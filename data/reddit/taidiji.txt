Regulations are here to protect well funded exchanges like coinbase and winklevii from competition. Winklevii said it openly. Their only added value relative to competition is too be all about regulatory compliance.
So don't worry the people funding them know perfectly well what they are doing.
I've seen the same thing in France where the irrelevant local exchange went to complain about unfair competition from other european countries to the local legislator. Not asking for less regulation in France but for more regulations against these companies.
As long as there is someone with a big stick deciding for everyone else, you will have parasites trying to get under its protection to club others rather than competing on their product own merits.

@_date: 2016-08-07 12:01:08
They lost 36% of all assets value in BTC that means they lost a much higher percentage of their BTC. Now they need to use these $ and other cryptos to buyback bitcoins until they have 64 % of what they had. My guess is they lost around 2/3 of their btc and need to buyback 1/3.

@_date: 2015-12-08 23:50:00
You think so ? Looks like a hoax with the guy post-editing most of the proofs and leaking the material himself..
As much as I find many of his twitter posts stupid and it pains me to think that this guy could be Satoshi Nakamoto, it still looks like Nick Szabo is by far  suspect. I secretly hope he is just trolling to make it looks less likely he is NS. Anyway that's why it's better that Satoshi stays anonymous. Somebody can be brilliant in some subject and stupid on others. This way we avoid ad hominem attacks on Bitcoin through Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:27:20
I agree with you. The problem is nobody has proved that say a 8mb block size would prevent this.

The problem about the "intrisic" value debate is that it's pointless.
Yes you could warm yourself by burning your bills, and yes you could use gold or silver to make some tools (albeit iron ore is much better at that and check the price).
The fact is that when the "intrisic" value of your money is 1/100th its worth or worse, it doesn't matter. 
99% devaluation is nearly as good as 100%.
Maybe the value mattered at first for it to be used as money in some cases (precious metal, shell bead whatever) but once its usage as money takes over, it doesn't matter anymore.
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:02:34
The world is not going to switch to Bitcoin in the next few weeks. It would take years maybe decades for something like this to happen and we need more onramp and more offramp until we get to the endgame.
People selling their coins using their coinbase debit card is more healthy than people panicking when the tape is painted red like so many idiots who sold their coins under 200 after 2013 just because the price was going down.
We need diversity and multiple usages of bitcoin.
Having a bitcoin debit card makes it possible to hold all your cash in bitcoins and sell as you need. It's a great service.

How often someone pop up in an extremly niche community and combine ideas out of the blue ? You don't know if Satoshi invented nothing before Bitcoin. Szabo himself wrote something along the lines "if Finney or wei dai are not Nakamoto". Wouldn't it be more realistic that Satoshi is one of the people behind at least one of these ideas?

Buy from reputable exchanges, if you have a lot of coins, you can buy a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor. But frankly, even leaving you coins on an exchange/broker like coinbase or bistamp is nothing to worry about.

Limiting the blocksize doesn't change anything about that fact. The whole thing has been known from the beginning. Bitcoin is bootstraped with coins inflation and must have enough users at some point for fees to cover some of the cost and eventually take over new coins created.
You logic is as sound as a business who would say: Damn I'm not making a profit with my cars at 20k, let's just make less cars and maybe they are magically going to sell for 200k. Users are not "granted". Besides we are still a  few years away from fees taking over.

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:58:47
Your logic is moronic. Smaller blocks = less transaction. More blocks = more transactions. You can have a lower average fee per transaction and still have a block with more fees in total because  it contains more transactions.
Normally I feel I'm in the middle of the debate, but when I see the arguments left from the smallblockers, it simply lacks logic in too many cases.

There is no proof he owns a supercomputer.
Satoshi never moved his coins as far as we know.
The emails are full of contradictions, at some point he pretends his american friend is satoshi, at some point that he is. Both articles are so stupid, I fail to see where any form of doubt can come from. He souds like a hoax, scammer, snake oil sellsman. Satoshi went to great deal to preserve his anonmity, this guy was trying to get fame or claiming he is satoshi for a year already.
There is 0% chance this guy is Satoshi. The only remotly plausible scenario would be that that guy knows who is the real Satoshi. But Occam's Razor makes me think there even that is improbable.

What people don't understand is .. We still have the ledger. The most important part of Bitcoin is the ledger. It's the legitimity. Every day that passes, every new person that uses Bitcoin makes it strong by recognizing it as Human universal ledger. You can always change the software as long as everyone trust the ledger. Because of this Bitcoin can is very strong, probably anti-fragile and I don't expect Bitcoin to be taken over by anything.
That's why the only thing bitcoin needs is to survive long enough.

I have quite a low opinion of her at the moment even though there is some interesting things left: like her husband is managing a bitcoin fund. Weird coincidence.
And people like Blythe talk to their audience and obviously she didn't convince Jamie Dimon or whoever she talks to at JP Morgan to invest in her startup by selling them on Bitcoin.
But I really dislike her personality. Typical self-entitlement and incestuous relationship between banking finance and govs. Revolving doors etc. It's like Geithner, Hank Paulson and co. Can't bear that shit. These people really think like they own the world.

This is not neutral or good news for Bitcoin in Kenya.
However this was to be expected. In Africa money talks even louder than anywhere else. Safaricom has a long arm that reaches many pockets and I expect Kenya to be one of the last country to adopt Bitcoin as they will try everything to protect the incumbent (Safaricom). 
Reminds me of France when it was trying to protect its proto-internet charged à la carte or hourly called the minitel.

No. Bitcoin doesn't trade on forex or stock market moves. Zerohedge is one of the dumbest financial news website in the last 5 years. 
Bitcoin is fairly uncorrelated to other asset class. It trades on technicals, big traders and more longterm demand and offer (Miners/new demand). Weekend after christmas is an awsome time to start moves. Also Chinese tend to be reckless gamblers (or have big balls if you prefer), and considering their share of the bitcoin's market, volatility is not going to go away.
Where it goes next depends on how the market react to the move.

Were you trolling the answer ? It doesn't look serious to base your answer and some gut feelings (the economic crisis is over). Moreover bandwidth is not progressing in a regular manner like chips, the generations are much longer. So it will jump 20-100x at a time and if 8Mb was at the limit already there is now you could increase it every 2 years
Rather the correct answer would be that since the current 8MB per 10 min limit is so low compared to the current bandwith available that it really doesn't matter if bandwith follow a 50% increase per year or not.

The reason is that Bitcoin trading volumes are moving to China because the 2 main chinese exchanges (huobi and okcoin) don't charge fees. And this is not going to change unless other major exchanges get rid of their trading fees.
Bitcoin price should be quoted in Rmb not in usd. This is the first commodity that I am aware of that is mainly bought and sold in Rmb rather than the USD.
Anyone who can read chinese can log on huobi and see how superior it is to bitstamp or mtgox.

No Tim Swanson is a journalist and a crypto hustler. Tim Swanson appeared first on Business Insider. At that time he was going to everyone in the community and basically mixmatching quotes of different people whose opinion he was able to understand.
That way he managed to get his name in google search. He would generally be writing a long text based on a flawed assumption right from the start. So everything that comes after is rather useless but whatever...  Apparently it's good enough to fool most people in this day and age. Because any market researcher who knows nothing about the field can spit you the same thing. To my knowledge he has ever only be able to assess Bitcoin from a currency standpoint (rather than a commodity or a protocol). Which is pointless as Bitcoin is not a currency. It can only be a currency eventually in the future.
That's how he managed to give some talks in conference and to get hired as an advisor in "digital asset" and "ledger" companies like hyperlerdger, Melotic and probably wrote reports for other people.

Thanks for you answers, a friend of mine is looking for a model in particular (high end). He is not looking for any luxury watch but for this one in particular. 
I know the guy who bought the lambo was the reason they accepted BTC in the first place at their concession. So I was wondering if anyone had done the same experience with a luxury watch. Otherwise any advice on how to find and convince a jeweller or watch reseller to accept Bitcoin are welcome.
In the country my friend live, it's going to be impossible to find someone to take Bitcoin but he is willing to travel to Switzerland, US or other countries to make the purchase and he thinks it would be nice to use the purchase to further the cause especially as he probably won't be the last customers to buy luxury watches in btc, it would be a good move for the shop.

Because you don't know when the price is low.
Let's say you want to buy 30 000 $ of Bitcoin. 
- You buy 30 000 $ now. The price goes to 300. You feel bad because you lost 7500 $.
- You buy 10 000 $ now, the price goes to 300. You lost 2500 $ but you can buy 10 000 $ of Bitcoin at 300 so you are less sad and you are also happy you can buy even lower and you still have 10 000 $ to buy at 200 or at 400 (the price at which you would have invested your 30 000) if the price goes up again.
- Now let's say instead of going to 300$ the price goes to 500$, well you can buy 10 000 $ more at 500. You will be happy because you will be making 6600$ on your 10 000$ and you can still buy 10 000$ more of bitcoin, you will just have a little bit less. If the price falls back to 400 or less, you can buy your remaining 10 000 $ as you could do if it goes to 600.
An even easier way would be to split your investment in 12 equal sum. And Invest the same day every month in 2015.
Most human being are more impacted by a loss than by missing out on a gain. And the worst emotion when investing is suffering from a loss. So it's better to minimize your suffering so you don't end up selling your 30 000 $ of bitcoin at 250 because you can't take it anymore just before it shoots up to whatever 500 ++.
Some people also fail to understand that Bitcoin is the type of investment that is better seen as a potential risk of 100% loss and and unlimited upside while undergoing crazy volatility. In this case I strongly advise against having a stop loss strategy (I.e Telling yourself, if the price goes to 200 I sell). It's better to ride it to 0 or to the moon and to ignore price action. Make sure to understand this BEFORE buying your bitcoins.
Finally On how much of your 100 000 USD you should invest. Well it depends on how hard it is for you to replace these USD if you lose them. It could be as little as 5% or as much as 100% depending on these conditions. Personally I find the 1% advice idiotic, as if you really have such a low confidence in your picks, you should stay away from investing yourself in the first place. 
It's nice to not put all your eggs in the same basket, but spreading your capital on  dozens of assets  that you don't know anything about is not good risk managment. What is important is how correlated your picks are. 4-10 picks of assets that are not too correlated seems more sensible to me.
If bitcoin does 10X on 10% of your capital, you will have doubled your capital on Bitcoin alone. If you lose everything, anyone will recover quite easily from a 10% loss. If Bitcoin does 10X on 1%, you will have made 10% which is really a waste when very few assets in your life will give you 1000% gains.
One last thing: Bitcoin maybe not only be a growth play but it could also (potentially) act as a form of defensive asset akin to gold. Let's say your broker or bank is going under. Who knows what you are going to get back. Let's say your saving currency is getting overprinted, who knows what value you will be getting out of it. Bitcoin might be protecting you in these cases. Personally I'd be totally comfortable holding 25% or even more of my asset in Bitcoin because of this. As a form of insurance against currency devaluation and third party risk.

Because its not going up ?
There is a downtrend line that need to be broken before technical traders feel comfortable buying. It should be done anytime soon. We are on or near strong supports in the low 500 too. 500 is the average price of Bitcoin on 200 days. 
It's a good middle ground.
The price will be pushed up when we get nearer the US regulations and exchanges. But that's a few month away. In the meantime who knows how it's gonna trade. Probably ranging. Around 500$ for the lows and 7-800 for the highs of the range.
Ofcourse it could also breakout anytime and frankly the day to day price is not very relevant to Bitcoin's future. You should have a longterm view if you hold or want to buy Bitcoin. You should not think of Bitcoin as currency yet though it has everything to be a strong one in the future. Right now think of it as a commodity or collectibles on a payment network.

People have a lot of of preconceptions on China.
The truth is that if Huobi  had the same exchange in the US with US bank accounts. Bitcoin would be worth 2 or 3 times what it is worth now.
People fail to realize that the reason why so many Bitcoins are going to China is that the exchanges are just better.
To answer your question there is basically no US exchanges and the only exchange remotely comparable (but still inferior) to the Chinese exchanges is Bitstamp. Which require a leap of faith for US citizens as it is based in a country most of them can't even place on a map (baltic bank and office).
I expect most exchanges in the future to work like the Chinese ones (no fees) as you could quickly grab marketshares by doing that in the west. Then people will realize the power of Bitcoin for international transfers as it will dramatically decreases the cost of fiat to fiat transfer.

Nobody keeps 100% of its worth in only 1 asset especially if that asset doesn't generate income. That's why even people like Larry and Sergei sell Google stocks from time to time.
Large Bitcoin holders are selling some of their coins as price rise to diversify in other assets and to cover their cost of living for those who need to. I'm not going to blame them if they don't want to sell any at $600 per Bitcoin because it seems too cheap to them.
This is a false problem only relevant to socialists
As it has been said, the current system is much more unfair and prone to keep the wealthy wealthy. Rich people have their wealth in assets that appreciate with inflations (art, real estate, shares, gold), poor people use saving accounts in fiat. Meanwhile the rich have access to low interest loans and all kind of red tape in place prevent new wealth from being created.
So yes a Bitcoin world would be much more fair. No doubt about it. No matter the initial distribution. Ofcourse the old world is not going down without putting a fight. That's why we need both wide adoptions and very rich Bitcoiners to fight them off.

Actually the bidders have an incentive to overpay. If they pay over marketprice, price has a high probability of rallying (they make money). If they pay under marketprice, the price has a higher probability of dropping (they lose money).
It's really easy to understand. The next few days are one of the best time to buy bitcoins. As traders are not complete idiots, I expect the price to rally somewhat before any result of the auction is announced.
I would be extremely surprised if 1 lot goes under 600$ per btc. And I wouldn't exclude one group or person buying everything.

Mining is not only about securing the network it's also about distributing the coins. How do they expect to bootstrap a new currency/commodity ? There is no better and more fair way than mining.
This is in no way a hidden cost. And It goes down quite quickly after each halving. 10% inflation is also negligible if adoption rate was faster.
Miners are not a problem. The only reason the price is going down is that there is not enough people willing to buy coins at the moment (for diverse reasons, the main one being that we are in a multi month downtrend and that new entrants come mostly during bubble phases).
These type of articles are completly short sighted.

Exactly. Mining in still the best way to distribute coins. That's what the proof of stake people don't understand. Electricity is not wasted. Even if you could secure the network without proof of work, it would still be by far the best way to distribute the coins.
The current price of bitcoin is 350$ because the flow of new adopters went down a lot after Mtgox. The price will go up when more people are buying bitcoins. It could be because they think the price is low and it's a good investment or because bitcoins utility has increased. 
Then after a while people will buy just because the price is increasing and the bubble/pop cycle will be in play once again.

Let me explain this in a more straightforward way.
It looks to me like Gavin decided he wanted to push through the 20 mb increase NOW. And He settled for a strategy of a number of blog posts followed by pulling the rabbit from his hat with Bitcoin XT.
The Bitcoin XT part came WAY too quickly after the blog posts. The public debate had barely started. This is divisive.
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:43:37
This is a little bit more complicated than this I think.
Gavin is not the only dev that is not working on Blockstream but he is the only one supporting his 20MB increase.
As Gmaxwell said, their position was the same before Blockstream even existed. 20mb doesn't render Blockstream's work useless at all. Most of the devs have probably more to gain from Bitcoin that Blockstream.
Maybe some of them should publish their holding, it would quash some of this speculation but I'm guess they value their right to financial privacy as well.

Japan is too closed on itself to thrive in the current globalization. They are currently getting their ass kicked by koreans playing the same flawed game with a few interesting tweaks (like sending students abroad, pushing english learning, giving more power to local managments, and an even more protectionist mindset at home). And Chinese are coming and they will be waaay more apt at globalization than both.
Hence Japan is playing their last cards, devaluation and it will fail miserably. But then Japan was always the country that would self destruct rather than open up. They might compete on prices for a while as they will be destroying their standard of living but the end of the japanese illusion is nearing.
Bitcoin will not be adopted first by people that are closed on themselves (japan, korea) or of a socialist mindset (parts of south america and europe). It will be led by the anglo as usual for anything that is related to freedom.

In the last 3 years all Gavin has done is politcal play after political play. Going from failures to failures. From Bitcoin foundation to XT to classic to Bu. And he found the time to crown con-artist Craig Wright as Satoshi too.
I don't see how all the harmful actions of Gavin would not have outdone any good he has done prior to that in the eyes of the community. He hasn't coded one thing for bitcoin in years.

I guess you are alluding to changing the pow as the nuclear option? 
There are 2 different issues I'm worried about in the mining centralisation: 
One is physical: 
The asic manufacturers but we could hope that it's only temporary until it is commoditised although not clear yet. Asic manufacturers geographical centralisation also add to the geographical/cultural centralisation of mining that facilitate cartelisation.
But the other one is pool mining: Wouldn't it be more feasible to tackle that one? Pool mining adds a second level of centralisation that seems to have very negative effects so far.
Could you talk a bite more about these non silver bullets solutions that are being worked on?
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:06:53
Thank you.
I know the charts but I'm pretty sure they will start to diverge very soon. We know that the majority of the hashrate is owned by people willing to collude in a cartel and they have made their position clear.
You didn't answer the sidechain part though?
More important, is anybody working on empowering users with technical solutions to break mining cartels as a deterrent to these threats to Bitcoin decentralisation ?
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:04:48
I hope you keep doing it. I know it takes time from you that you could use to do more productive things and some people might think that you are wasting your time becasue "omg somebody is wrong on the Internet". 
But truth is that it's badly needed to dispell fud. Especially because not many people have the technical knowledge to clear technical bs. I wish more devs would emulate your efforts.

Im a relatively big bitcoin owner. I support segwit and a potential hardfork (softforked preferably). I don't support BU, XT or Classic. And I would sell any forked coin to buy more bitcoins.
I think the HK agreement was a big mistake. It gave in to mining centralisation, gave the idea that miners had disproportionate power and was really bad PR. Greg was right. But I would have supported a 2mb HF.

@_date: 2017-02-26 13:53:47
Ok I'm going to explain to you so you might get a chance to go past r/btc crazy conspiracy theories.
You don't seem to be familiar with VC investing. Most Bitcoin companies (Circle, Coinbase, Blockchain.info etc) will lose money for their VC. That's the nature of the business and this is exacerbated becasuse most of these guys invested in the middle of a "blockchain investing bubble" without understanding Bitcoin that well.
Blockstream is more akin to company like Chain which also raised dozens (hundreds?) of millions and where the product is not a consumer website unlike these others I have cited but the TEAM. Basically, Blockstream gathered the best Bitcoin minds in the world and sell their services for consulting, private blockchain projects and so on.
So will VC investors in Blockstream make their money back ? Probably not, like most other Bitcoin/blockchain companies and who cares ? What did they want in exchange for their money ? Make more money, keep informed on the field (why most banks and financial institutions are invested in all of these Bitcoin companies, just in case it's really the "next big thing"), or even other goals depending on who invested. Because all these companies have not one but many investors with different goals. Usually some people know what they are doing (Let's say Barry Silbert fund that supports Bitcoin companies in the hope to make money but also keeping in mind they can recoup through Bitcoin price increase, that's how early angels like were investing too) and some others (banks) have just too much money to waste.
One of the leading investor in Blockstream is Reid Hoffman founder of Linkedin, who explained clearly in a blogpost that its bet on Blocksteam was not a regular VC play, that it was emulating Mozilla  's foundation model. At that time nobody, including all these previous companies I have mentionned that raised hundred of millions were funding Bitcoin development. So some smart BITCOIN HOLDERS with vision like Reid put money on the table to fund Bitcoin development through Blockstream with the hope that the company could be sort of self sustaining through consulting/side projects.
NOW concerning the company that all the crazies on r/btc keep mentioning as the illuminati/bilderberg/rotschild/freemason/whatever secret organization: AXA. It's a FRENCH insurance company. Like most other financial companies, they have a lot of money to invest, can afford to spread their "bets", they are huge machines, that don't necessarily know what they are doing and are mostly concerned with internal politics. So you will have some random guy inside the company that will try to advance his career by betting on a new technology, the guy over him will approve the investment because he keep hearing about the new buzzword in the financial press, board meetings or at good society cocktails. And so on. I can guarantee you that the CEO of AXA has no idea what "blockstream" is doing. Better than that, most people in these companies don't know what Bitcoin is exactly and or even care about it. This is the reality. How do I know it ? I know people (Bitcoiners) who work for these multinational banks and insurers on "blockchains". Conversation goes like this "we need to do something blockchain" "I want the best expert, can we hire this guy VITALIK BUTERIN? or "X"..."
Any other question ?

The nature of the VC business. You have to understand it's probably not AXA investing in Blockstream. It'AXA ventures. Capiche ? Ofcourse they are hoping to make money, but more important they are hoping not to get killed by failing to invest in digital camera when you are Kodak. So it's better to lose money on most of these blockchain bets than risk losing the train of Change. Most industries are paralysed at the sound of "disruption" since companies like Blockbuster, Kodak and others went the way of the dodo in a few years time.
All big Bitcoin companies have investment by big banks.

Users need something to defend themselves if miners attempt to take over, its always been a possibility even if a nuclear option.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:26:19
This has been done already. Users majority is pro-segwit. Miners can be anti-segwit and my estimate is that 20% of the market too is anti segwit so indeed there is no consensus. And segwit wont be updated anytime soon or ever.
Just be aware that BU is so much more contentious and will never have anything close to segwit users support. As long as you also are ok with that, I think we both agrees.
Miners have no other role in Bitcoin than to follow the market. If we had actual user consensus and inexplicably miners were against it, they would be replaced one way or another. Then again I don't think miners would be against consensus. Segwit can only be blocked because miners are not alone, they are standing with a significant minority of users.

Well Mods are doing what they can. It's not easy when there is so much money in play. As your own FUD post is showing.
It's the weekend and people like you are pushing the ether pump by taking shots at bitcoin. Nothing new here.
I own as many ether as bitcoins relative to marketcap so I'm quite neutral to this. Unlike most of you pumpers, I bought my ether around 0.5 usd per ether.
I don't think ether rise would be a negative for Bitcoin if not for the fuders who are using it in hope to pump a little bit more. And who think Bitcoin must go down for Ether to rise.
You have to be a complete moron to switch 100% of Bitcoin to ether. Nobody knows the future. The only sensible decision is to own same amount realative to market cap and see how it unfolds. It's far from won for Ether. Last time I checked Bitcoin is still 6 times biggers, and has been trading for years. It will be much harder for Ether to be stable after such a quick rise. Ethereum is also a company. And the future of ether is much more obscure (proof of work/proof of stake etc.).
Both Bitcoins and Ether should rise at the same time, I except this to happen once emotions cool down and fuders are ignored. Crypto are still a drop in the bucket compare to where they should go.

The way he phrases it is extreme but theres 2 reasons why we need to do research on a different pow. This shouldn't be a taboo.
1/ it will act as a deterrent to miners misbehaving if we have a viable alternative. Doesn't mean we need to use it.
2/ Satoshi is not god, maybe there is a pow that forces decentralised mining that has just yet to be found. We need research on that.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:34:49
In a way but it's more complicated. Miners can only stop segwit because there is no consensus supporting it. Specifically there is a strong vocal minority opposing it. This is the main argument expressed by this vocal minority.

There is absolutely no excuse for getting their hot wallet hacked and all the coins swept, not even mentioning the reaction time. 
You can compare to Mtgox because they are both highly damaging to Bitcoin's reputation. And Because you shouldn't trust people who failed you once when you have multiple alternatives. Not even mentioning that Bitstamp probably has the highest fees of any big exchange. For the worst security!

Don't take us for idiots. R3 line of defense is a ridiculous Straw Man. Making it sound like a big conspiracy theory when it's simple fud/negative marketing. We know you don't need R3's command to spread highly distorted facts (euphemism), you've been doing it for quite some time now. But you outdid yourself this time. No matter, they jumped on the occasion to spread a little bit more FUD on Bitcoin.
1/ We all know R3 is not looking to introduce R3coin, thank you.
2/ The point is almost every companies in this space (Private "blockchain" whatever) are using the same strategy of FUD-ing Bitcoin to prop themselves. From Ripple inception to R3. It's always the same anti-bitcoin rhetoric. Tim Swanson has built his whole "career" in the space on this. It's always the same fud about chinese miners, silk road, terrorists, a currency is useless etc.. We are just 1 step away from "protect the kid and the country"
3/ At Brookings, Charley Cooper was mentionning your article at the time it was published, mentioning the hook "It's a failed experiment" and the whole time he is selling R3 with the same argument "So this public blockchain is useless for financial service that's why you all need our product"  calling you a proeminent core developper (He must have misunderstood you on that). He acted it like a rehearsed PR STUNT. 
So don't serve us this shit again "ohh R3 and Bitcoin have nothing to do with each other" already served by R3 this weekend. R3 is the one always talking about Bitcoin and finding every way posible to diss it. And yes unlike R3 many people think that WE NEED a public blockchain, a moip, an internet of value.
Now I don't know if you have realized this already but you ruined anything good you might have done in the space for 5 years. You are a despised man in a large part of the community. And your lack of emotional control and constant public bickering culminating in this magnificient act of burning bridges will certainly not do you any favor in your next business endeavor after your stint at R3 (just one company among many others selling wind on powerpoint like its 1999 again). Who needs an out-of-control Drama queen?
And by the way, please deflate that huge ego of yours because it doesn't match any reality. You are no visionary. Considering the time you arrived in the space, if you had an ounce of vision you would be loaded like a Roger Ver today. And you wouldn't need to go work on useless shits at R3 with a few hundred coins left.
I'd actually argue that your death wish for Bitcoin is the subconscious result of these missed opportunities.

Correlation doesn't mean causation in this case. The most logical reason for the node count decrease is that less people are running Bitcoin qt because there's a ton of other options without running a node that didn't exist back then.

Hey Jesse!
1/I had some bad experience to get money out of Kraken.
- Couldn't do any transfer of EUR without a bank account with an IBAN number
- Couldn't transfer from EUR to USD to make a USD transfer instead
- Huge kyc/aml difficulties to get the money out (had to show not only where I acquired the Bitcoin but where did I got the money to buy the bitcoin in the first place from years ago...). Took a loooong time and many roundtrip with the customer service to solve my situation.
2/On the technical side, I also have to say that kraken was unavailable during peak trading times, notably during the peak of the mini bubble to 500 USD.
3/Finally, you only allow something very small for margin accounts like 20k USD and you count the total toward the margin (Making it more like 10k usd, you put 10 you can borrow 10) I think it's a little bit light, any plan ton increase this ? Or to use bitcoins to fund margin ?
4/Do you have any update on how you are planning to help with these things in the future ?
5/One last question for you on Ripple this time: I think I remember you are a Ripple investor. I don't know if you noticed but they always use bitcoin as punching bag in a negative marketing effort. Instead of showing where they could possibly be good, their strategy is often to diss bitcoin to prop themselves (quite similar to R3 or Eris). I noticed many Ripple investors are early bitcoiners (roger, barry, you, brock etc.) , what do you guys think about that ? They also had an awful hitpiece ordered on Stellar and and Jed Mcaleb, which makes me thing it's kind of the normal mindset of the managment of this company.
6/One last question on Kraken, how do you want to position kraken in the future ? You are the eurbtc leader, most exchanges have the choice to either be pure trading platform and expand in this trading area with other trading products like futures, margin, more market etc.. or they try to offer more consumer facing services with visa card etc. What's your strategy for kraken ?

3- large backlogs = where ?
4- is controlled by China = Would you say it's controlled by the USA if most of the hashpower was there ? Chinese are people like you and me.
5- 2 chinese miners control 50% of the network ??? = Confusing MINERS and Mining pool. These Chinese miners at the conf were representing mining pool. They don't own the hashpower.
6- Present RBF without saying it's opt-in which changes everything.
7-says Chinese Miner don't want Bitcoin to be sucesful because they are afraid to lose their share, never hard such an idiocy before. Does he realise that Chinese Miners own thousands of times the pitiful number of Bitcoin he held and that they would be instantly rich for a few generations if Bitcoin was a success ?

Thanks Luke for your message and the confirmation on twitter. Im just annoyed that so far you are the only Core dev I have talked to who explained this honestly. I understand why people think Segwit is great but it's important to be honest in defending a cause. 1 dishonest argument destroys many good ones.
I agree with you. And In truth I'm not worried about Segwit but the concept of Softforks in general. My problem is how do we measure consensus from users before soft forks? I feel there is absolutely no way to do that right now. 
When I asked Alex Morcos, he said well Core talk to companies and then miners activate at high treshold (95%) but where are the users in that? Fiat currencies are already controlled by technocrats and big corporations. My hope is that we have at least one crypto-currency where everything is not decided for the users without a proper way to know if they approve or not. If the majority still want to fork knowing that there is sizeable minority opposition then so be it. But it needs to be measured because there's good chance minority will defend itself by hardforking back to the original rules.

1. Segwit fix malleability only for segwit transaction ! What's your problem with that ? There is no other way to fix malleability in a backward compatible way. Are you trying to mislead people ? All that matters is that it's fixed so we can have non maleable transactions.
2. 3,4 Then get rid of the magic numbers! There are "plans", a.k.a vaporware. Considering the risk involved in every HF, we have all interest in grouping them together. Moreoever, BU would have way more chance to reach consensus if was integrating Segwit. Not doing it now proves there is no desire to implement it.
5. Why do you even mention it if won't be implemented and is not even past design stage
6. I think Malleability and capacity are both equally important especially because fixing malleability brings more capacity. Segwit itself brings a blocksize increase as well. So no, the real answer is that I want both more direct onchain capacity through a blocksize increase and fixing maleability but that BU pushers don't want a malleability fix at all (and are so undermanned they can't provide it  anyway according to you) for reasons explained in my post.

Less transactions = higher fees needed
more transactions = lower fees needed
However Bitcoin can be succesful in both cases as if the velocity is not very high, then you don't care as much to pay higher fees.
Bitcoin can be succesful as digital gold or as digital gold + high velocity transactional medium.
One is not possible however is bitcoin being very useful with low value.

How do you count the spv wallet ? Online wallets also massively increased their number of users. Also it does't require too much efforts to run a wallet for now...

You are too naive and Satoshi designed Bitcoin so that miners will mine what is worth it. You will be mining alone while other miners will mine the more expensive chain. Nobody is going to sustain loss for more than a few days to make a point. 
Miners are an extremly small part of the Bitcoin community these days. The miners role you imagine died with GPU and GPU mining. Nobody is ever going to support "miners rights" because we just need to buy Bitcoins and people will mine it.

If you are talking about Classic, that's not it. A 2mb HF needs to be packaged with Segwit to create consensus. Segwit was released end of 2016 so 2MBSWHF hasn't not been tried for 1 year before BU for sure.
Core doesn't need to be the one to code it and release it. Anyone could have funded and released it rather than go for the DOOR-IN-THE-FACE Bitcoin Unlimited technique. But again it's only first and foremost about "firing Core".
When there's going to be a huge surprise, is when people behind BU are going to realize than Majority of hashrate and Economic minority is not enough to overpower Economic majority and devs. This is going to crash the price but it will also be a huge wealth transfer in the end from Bitcoin Unlimited supporters pockets to Bitcoin holders.

No YOU don't understand. The only not-physical rules in this world are the one human being make and unmake.
If you want to force ppl against their own will its will you need guns not hashrate lol.
If miners collectively start behaving erraticly we just kick them out via pow change. That's the ultimate protection. Bitcoin is not defined on the law of nature. It's just here to help organise secure AGREED rules from a technological standpoint. If we don't agree on the rules, Bitcoin can't do anything about that. In the end there's humans behind it and they can override everything. If humans deem "moral" important, then so it is.

@_date: 2016-01-15 11:15:00
Most important:  Most of the problems you attribute to the Bitcoin community are proably results of Reddit's shortcomings. Now..
1/ Mike Hearn is in no small part responsible for the split and the poisonous atmosphere. Check his blog/ posts history in 2015.
2/ On the other side we have Peter Todd who displays some of the same traits (Oversized ego, can't control his emotions) but people are more ready to bear it because his technical contribution is more valued and he is seen as just better able/smarter than Hearn. Now that Hearn is gone, I hope he can grow up too and let his work do the talking.
3/ The problem is not only in the community but also in the leaders, as it has been said, the bitcoin companies which received a lot of funding have not invested in the development of the protocol. Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, Bitstamp, BTCC, Okcoin. Blockstream is doing most of the work (thanks to them). It's not their fault if the others are freeriding and complaining (Coinbase).
4/ Theymos is the tree that hides the forest. Yes he made a big mistake in his handling of it and put oil on the fire. I think he is actually smart/well meaning so I hope he realizes this and let it go. But people who visit r/bitcoin every other day such as us are overexagerating its importance.
In conclusion, this is nothing. In 1 year if we have sidechains and lightnings, everyone will have forgotten about this. Bitcoin has seen worse (Hello Mtgox and the 1001 scams of the first years) and it will be tested in fire. I'm invested in Bitcoins because I think it can stand the test not because I think it won't be tested. It needs to show it is antifragile. I don't care how many years we need to get there.

That's also one explanation I thought of. Ironically my post plays to this to (conspiracy against blockstream of sorts) :p
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:59:49
That's one thing I thought of.
I was thinking also about fungibility/anonymity. I guess some big mainstream Bitcoin companies and maybe Gavin ? (I know there was some rumor about JOI ITO, the head of the MIT media LAB complaining about this) don't look forward to more fungibility/anonimity with bitcoin because they are afraid of the governements reacitons or are under pressure from the government on this.
On the other hand we know that Blockstream and many core devs are very strongly in favor of anonymity/privacy/fungibility.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:09:21
Same analogy that Jihan has kept repeating over the years. Jihan and Roger both want the smallest fees possible (near free) and consequences dealt with later because they are both afraid ETH (or an altcoin) will eat Bitcoin if Bitcoin fees are too high. They might well be shortsighted, leading to terminal centralisation, which might benefit Jihan and destroy Bitcoin reason of existence. Still both own a ton of coins and they are doing what they think is best for their coins to be worth more in the future.
I think a more important debate rather than Segwit and BU should first be how do we find a proper process for changing of rules (soft or hard fork).
One part of the problem I have uncovered the last few days is that many Core devs don't even recognize/realize that tightening the rules via SF is a change of rules and that it does break consensus. Opting out of Segwit transactions is not going to help me opt-out of the ways Segwit changes Bitcoin (including higher centralisation through higher blocksize). Once that is recognized, it's not possible to say anymore that a SF don't risk coinsplits in reaction to the perceived rules changes, if a sizeable minority want to stick to the original rules.
Which leads me to the number one problem we have today, **there is no proper way to measure support for change of rules from users**. The metrics used to discover support for changes of rules need to be quantifiable. Core devs talking to companies and miners voting with their hashrate is not enough. The users are completly left out of the process. 
We need a proper way for users to signal support for changes of rules if we are to know if there is really an overwhelming consensus to change the rules via fork. I think what is needed before any fork in the future to avoid the current situation is a very simple way to do signaling with coins at the protocol level. There is no other proper metrics to signal what would happen in the event of Coin split. Users need to be able to flag support with their coins. If we have overwhelming majority of hashrate and overwhelming majority of coins, then we are ready for a safe fork. If not then get ready for coinsplit in case the majority still wants to go through the changes. And make sure this is done in a safe way.
I guess if we had proper sidechains working, we could also solve it using sidechains ?

 I disagree with you, think about it, right now blocksize subsidy is so much bigger than the fees, why would he want to increase the blocksize to reduce transaction fees if he wanted more fees? Doesn't make sense.
Monopolists want a dominant bitcoin and to control it ok sure. If you want to criticize somebody, you need to know where they benefit. There's a need for logic.
He might be staling segwit with BU but if they move on with the hard fork, then it's not valid anymore.
It's not the important part of my post anyway :D How about the rest ?
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:04:36
Yes and no. His Bitcoin stash is worth much more than shapeshift. 
Secondly if you think about it more deeply, Shapeshift is an instrument of domination for Bitcoin. It removes the need for altcoin/fiat liquidity that is the only threat to bitcoin (and why Eth is the only bitcoin competition). 
Altcoins are just a thing you buy with Bitcoins.
As said Erik and others have a blind spot for Roger self-destructive behaviour.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:59:16

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:21:25
Yes it will stay on the table so that people don't realize until it's too late (after a Bitcoin unlimited fork)
I'd bet you how many Bitcoins you want that they won't package a malleability fix with their BU hardfork, when 1/ It would give them more chance at reaching consensus 2/ It makes sense to package hard fork to diminish split risks. Because guess what ? The mining pools don't want to fix maleability! And Roger and Olivier might actually agree with them anyway.

Personally I support a maxblocksize increase greater than the current SWSF proposal but why do you think Bitcoin Unlimited is not packaging a stripped down version of Segwit in a Hard fork when it's clear it would help them sway consensus ? They don't want a malleability fix because they don't want lightning, while some of the mining pools themselves don't want neither lightning nor any privacy enhancement.

In before 'member when transaction fees were cheap
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:04:40
I don't think so. The pools get all the fees. So yes the pools have an incentive to drive fees higher. But miners don't get the fees so they don't care as much and EVEN if they got the fees (which some pools now share), it's still much less that than the block subsidy. Check my own answer to Theymos and the link to my posts from 2 weeks ago for more details.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:07:59
They want to increase the blocksize more than segwit becasue they think 2mb blocks will fillup quick AFAIK.
Think about what I said, miners gain from $ mined in a block. What's gets a higher price ? The blocksize subsidy is too small for miners to try to push fees up already when they get so many btc from the newly created in the block. They prefere high Bitcoin price and no fees.
From what I heard, recently, they do push fees up by spamming the network since the block are almost full, it's cheap to do apparently. But my point is they have more to gain from cleaning up the competition (see taobao vs ebay analogy). Will they push the fees higher when there is no more competition ? Very probably. But it doesn't seem to be the immediate goal.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:19:00
It might still be good to sell some from time to time. It would help not get lost in the emotions and selling it all on a nervous breakdown. There might be other times in the future (government attacks) where you could be in doubt. Always better to sell on the way up than on the way down. Especially if you are watching the price like a hawk, it's not healthy for your life (down hurts more that up makes you happy in human psychology, cf loss aversion).
Nothing wrong with diversifying a bit especially if you already up in the hundred of %. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, not matter what. Unless you are greediest guy on the street. The time to be all-in on something so volatile is when you have a little money not when you are already rich.
Bitcoin needs more time to be proven anti-fragile on all fronts. So far it's reacting well and has become stronger every time but we are not at the end of the road yet, we have not been tested in every ways yet.

Except nobody account anything in Bitcoins. Nothing is priced in bitcoins. The price change with the btc exchange rate of national currency (or USD) of the service.

There's no trend. Bitmain via all its partner pools control &gt;50% of the hashrate. So they can paint the trend any way they want. They could have started BU with 50% right away.

It's mostly emotional grudge against moderation and engagement theory imho as well as a sense of being "guardian" of bitcoin by owning so many and being an early angel investor.
A big ego, an ideological drive, and having been made rich by being proved right after disparaging (for buying bitcoins) can create this type of personality. I doubt Roger realises he can be wrong anymore.

We'll see. At least with this they have a chance to work on their proposal "addon" implementation rather than being left in the dust by Core like BU. It opens the road to segwit. Instead of being SEGWIT vs BU. Segwit can be adopted, emerging consensus can be adopted, whatever else. It simplifies the proposals and stop tearing us apart by removing political component.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:41:39

@_date: 2017-03-20 15:53:48
I'm not a BU advocate so it's hard to say. I would say, they are impatient (ROGER VER), or don't trust the road map (JIHAN WU and other miners, they might have a point considering the HK agreement misunderstanding/failure).
Maybe they really don't want SEGWIT anyway and just used that as an excuse to block it. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:44:44
It's not really only one or two individuals. 
The fact that no bigger blocksize increase has been proposed by Core (or anyone else) along segwit has allowed these 1 or 2 individuals to gather around them a lot of hashrate and a non negligible part of the Bitcoin community. Hard to estimate but If extrapolate from the people I know, public figures and avalable data I would say maybe 20 to 30%.
My guess is that a small HF max blocksize increase along segwit would have gathered enough people to overpower any anti-L2 (And therefore anti Malleability-fix) group.
The problem is that if they win the market after a coin split, I don't think malleability will be fixed anytime soon for the dominant coin. At the same time, maybe this will allow the segwit chain to make a come back. Then again, there might still be no coin split. Or BTU might fail to take over BTC. 
I have to say I'm surprised by the switch of rhetoric in the last days because I thought being openly anti-lightning would prove unpopular for BU. I don't understand what's behind this change.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:44:22
I doubt it has anything to do with the government. Bitmain feel like they own the bitcoin network with all their hashrate. They don't want to allow segwit because they don't want competition from smartcontracts such as lightning network and they don't want to have any fungibility enhancement for fear of the chinese gov reaction but the Chinese gov doesn't need to tell them what to do.

Can you by chance explain to us in which way you contributed to Bitcoin development in the last 2 years ? What are you planning to do for 2016?

@_date: 2016-01-15 12:17:34
Personally I feel like on/off ramp will be the most important part of Bitcoin for a very long time. I see Coinbase as very good and very important to the Bitcoin ecosystem and I  like what they are doing (exchanges, brokers, being able to buy with a cc, their new visa card).
And I understand their priority as a business should be to develop their business but their business is built on Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is still at a stage where it can use more development power.

Don't confuse mining pools and miners. Maybe miners will switch pools.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:10:34

It's a long time ago and a bit short for such a big subject. Do you think a big part of the current drama could result from a lack of communication between devs and miners and between miners and broader bitcoin community?
From a purely economic perspective, it makes no sense that they would try to do this no if they were not legitimately worried as they still make much more money from blocksubsidy than fees. 
The only party that I see that has an incentive to stall scaling is the mining pools as their current business model is to keep the fees.

So yes If I think Bitcoin will end up more valuable, I will surely sell my Bitcoin unlimited and buy more bitcoins with the proceesds.
After a very short time, hashrate will by synced with price. And If miners refuse to mine the more valuable coins to force the market hand, they will just go bankrupt and/or be replaced by other miners.

Another interesting point is that Roger Ver was buying coins from distressed owners at discount when MTGOX was going under but he doesn't appear on the claim AFAIK.

As I said to Nicolas, there might be a lack of education in their fear of Layer 2. One part of the problem is that Miners don't communicate well with the broader community so they can't get proper answers to their legitimate questions.
Their opinion from what I gathered is that Core is choking their ability to compete with offchain by keeping a smallblocksize (2mb sw) while the weighting of signatures in segwit also favorise smart contracts. So they want biggers blocks to be able to compete with offchain.
On the other end, with BU they themselves try to choke offchain by delaying (or even forbidding who knows) the malleability fix needed to make layer 2 really powerful and user friendly.
Also mentionned to Theymos, again they would not be anywhere as "succesful" without the allies they found in the Bitcoin community in the people who want cheap transactions in the near future. It's not miners vs users. It a big group of miners + (according to my estimations, a sizeable minority of the community). Allies that they found because many of these people are disatisfied with the 2mb blocksize increased provided by segwit (wrongly or rightly depending on how tolerant one his to centralisation risks).
My personal opinion is the mining is already centralised, that the main problem comes from the pools and the geographical centralisation of miners. From what I gathered the numbers of small miners has actually increased in the last few years. So there's some progress on that. Hopefully ASIC manufactures should be more decentralised in the future due to commoditisation. And that it would be better to focus on solutions to diminish the role of mining pools (I have no comp sci/network/crypto technical knowledge so I don't know if we can imagine this in the future).
Considering that we have some nuclear options to stop creepeing centralisation if doesn't go in the right direction (including Pow change and such), I think it might be worth the risk to offer a bigger than 2mb increase (outside of Core since there is no agreement inside Core for that) but in the end I'm forced to choose between SWSF vs BU, I will stick with SWSF.
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:27:44
doesn't that lead to miners centralization though ?
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:59:52
What's the risk with the hardfork? I also disagree 2 coins would kill bitcoin. Would be messy though.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:15:48
They can get the money bavk with their pools. Mining pools keep the transaction fees, only transfer the block subsidy.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:25:55
Actually Segwit is necessary to have a useful Lightning network. Lightning devs explained that to me in person (and to anyone who want to listen).
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:42:48
risking a split each time ? No it's much safe to package changes. Especially when as I said fixing malleability would rally much more pople to BU.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:29:26
Im pretty sure a malleability fixed is contentious to some extend (opposed by some miners). Its going very hard to have non contentious fork around these issues so better multiply the contentious forks and splits

Run a node with port 8333 open, prepare yourself to sell BU-coins and buy bitcoins with the proceed.

Bitcoin Unlimited supporters bullying tactics and Roger Ver constant propaganda assault make any compromise impossible now. It's too late. We are way past compromise. We are heading for a BU economic minority + hashrate majority fork
Ï'm a supporter of 2MB HF but the writing is on the wall. There was no need for a "compromise" between 2 camps. Just the need to push for a more consensual hardfork like 2MB+Segwit. But Bitcoin Unlimited supporters are not interested in consensusal upgrades. They are just interested in "Firing Core" by creating 2 camps and pushing toward conflict.
If you stop brown-nosing Roger for a minute, you will maybe realize that.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:15:18
Well obviously they want to increase the blocksize, have tried to do it but they can't get it done through core. Seems simple enough. It makes blocks not full anymore. Buys some time..
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:17:21
Yes and Bitcoin will be the one with more hashpower once BTU prices crashes. You just have thing backwards. You think price is a function of hashrate when hashrate is a function of price.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:44:43
This is what I posted 10 days ago: 
While talking with informed BU supporters, it had become clear to me that Bitcoin unlimited main reason for existence at least from Bitmain/Antpool and some other miners standpoints was to block segwit because it was a MALLEABILITY FIX. Because they don't want the Lightning network to exist and compete with their fees.
As you can see Roger Ver has finally started promoting the new rhetoric openly recently, inline with true motive behind BU: 
To be fair the fact that Core is blocking a bigger blocksize give them a point in the fact that it's even harder for miners to compete with lightning. Some other people on BU's side believe lightning won't work or that smart contracts are useless.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:43:48
Hk agreement was completly stupid. People going to miners to try to convince they are right are doing something stupid no matter what side they are on. 
Miners are much better left alone to follow broad apprent consensus. The best way to do that would be to trade futures of the HF.
I would say the same at 80% hashrate especially when hashrate is currently by a handful of mining pool operstors!
The only hashrate that matters is the one AFTER the forked coins are traded.
After thinking this through I'm also against softforks that make any change to consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:22:24


However, blocks are not expected to consist entirely of witness data and each non-witness byte is counted as 1.00 bytes towards the maximum block size limit, so blocks near 4MB in size would be unlikely.
According to some calculations performed by Anthony Towns, a block filled with standard single-signature P2PKH transactions would be about 1.6MB and a block filled with 2-of-2 multisignature transactions would be about 2.0MB.
Sounds like 4mb not 8mb to me.

Initially I was thinking they were just using BU as leverage to force Core handsthen I realized it's not that when I saw how serious they were in pushing BU and that every time I called for a malleability fix to be included or some form of middleground fork, it was met with "crickets".
Btw feel free to retweet my tweet linking to this article if you want, I think most people are still not aware of this. It's important if they try to push a fork that 
1/ people know what they are getting in BU 
2/they realize they have the true power through buying and selling and that hashrate will follow.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:53:08
Well you can never be sure, but I'm not a fan of conspiracy theories in general. I know people who work for governments, I know people who work for companies (Bank) that are often subject of conspiracy theories and it's not how these things works.
Governments are huge slow machines with a lot of inertia and competing bureaucracies. Government would be slow to recognize any threat from Bitcoin.
You can see how the CN government interact with the exchanges, the exchanges themselves got the sense that the PBOC doesn't even really know what it's doing. 
Some specific administration can give some recommendation that they wouldn't like to see this or that. But they are not busy pulling strings of puppets. And mostly they will understand thing slowly, and if they really want to crackdown they can do it openly in the end, they have the guns.

My preference is grabbing back majority chain on the market through selling btu and buying btc while trying to reach out to people in the middle. Doing nothing. Or Hardforking to 2 or 4mb + segwit for example + anything that's ready and give us more value. If we win on the market, the hashrate will come back.
For the active defense in case of attack, I'm not well versed in the technicals so I'd leave that to the experts such as yourself. I'm fine with any options. Resetting the difficulty is ok if the hashrate is too small. Change of POW algo only if they actively attack us, not pre-emptively!
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:37:45
The business I have talked to are pro-segwit. Most people want both a blocksize increase and segwit. Few people support BU. Mainly a subset of holders not happy because some core devs are blocking a hf blocksize increase. I understand the reasons for blocking a HF (it's "dangerous" so better package them and do just 1 or as few as necessary). 
But personally I would support it. (2mb + segwit)

R3 is not banks, it is just well connected people selling to banks. They hired a few names often seen on blogs to look good. But it's a biz dev story, not a technology story.
Banks don't give a shit. They just have a ton of money and are afraid to get disrupted like other industries before. I'm not even sure they are right to be afraid. Maybe the existence of the coin is more important than the technology powering it in the end. Anyway they will throw money at it just in case. Top management needs to look like it's doing something about the new buzzword.
Random Banks see other banks in R3's club of customers, they have to pay a few millions for the ticket and they are in. There is not much thinking going on here. That's how they got more and more banks on board...
As for banks they are certainly not going to do anything to help Bitcoin. That's for sure. 1/ they are terrorized by the new regulations and fines 2/ they would be afraid to dig their own graves. They will be happy to give money away to the snake oil sellers though. And sadly governments might be the actual possible ally for Bitcoin against banks ..

Well Roger is a career politician, ofcourse he is not stupid enough to say that out loud. Actually that "early adopters" part of Roger and Olivier's group told me directly they only pay lipservice to Layer 2.
I'm not sure about Roger's position, I asked him directly on twitter but he refused to answer. Either he is against Layer 2 and don't want to say it or it was the price to pay to get mining pools support (more likely imo because I doubt Roger is anti-privacy).  Mining pools are definitely openly anti-privacy and anti-layer 2.

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:48:35
Miners don't have a choice. You don't understand how this works. Miners HAVE to mine the most expensive coin or go brankrupt. Only the market can decide the result of a coin split.
Meanwhile if you slow the Bitcoin network to a crawl, it will be easier to send BUcoins to exchanges to sell them.
Think a bit before pretending you know what you are talking about.

@_date: 2017-03-18 23:54:35
Oh Brian How can you be so shortsighted???
- How are users going to send their forked coins from one exchange to the other if different forks are called btc depending on the exchanges? Ofcourse exchanges should rather agree on this than not.
- And then where does the exchanges letter say that Bitcoin can be contentiously hardforked by Core and the fork keeping BTC? If it's a contentious hard fork, original chain should keep BTC at least until things settle down as shapeshift mentioned. The team behind it has nothing to do with that. It's logical from a continuity standpoint.
- Btw did you even read Poloniex position? Exchanges that do lending are in a terrible position vis a vis of coinsplits.

@_date: 2017-03-08 09:19:48
I trust miners alright, it's a simple enough incentive, they provide hashrate according to what people want to buy Bitcoin for and what they think is proper margin. I'm just not sure the current mining pool understand and estimate properly the support for something like  It looks that some people seem to think that hashrate commands the price, when it's the other way around.
In any case, even if the curent pools make a mistake this time. The next pools will be vaccinated against it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:08:04
Sure but this 1 is stupid
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:47:33
Worst case scenario, we don't need a compromise, we need consensus that satisfies the vast majority (&gt;90%) to be certain that any 2nd coin resulting from the split would be irrelevant. This will exclude views at the extremity for sure.
One problem is there is no work being talked about that future elusive hardfork and how it would solve the problem once and for all. So it's perceived as non-existent.
I wouldn't call doubling capacity nothing. Especially with all future enhancements benefiting from that doubling.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:26:37
I sympathise but people are responsible for who they associate with don't you think ? Shall I remind you the other ideas of Mike Hearn like Blacklisting bitcoins ?
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:37:42
No it's not otherwise they would do it at the same time.
Segwit has wide support in the community, much more than BU. Most bitcoin companies are segwit ready. There's only a small group around Roger Ver and the mining pools blocking it.
The 1 hash = 1 vote consensus system is one thing, but there's economic incentives for Miners to anticipate consensus otherwise they might end up mining a worthless coin. I'm just worried miners might misjudge the support for BU or the strengh of their position (influencing the market with a hashrate display of power).
In the end the markets will decide which fork is valuable if there is a fork. It won't be necessary the one that starts with the most hashrate. Otherwise Bitcoin mining centralisation would be very worrying. That's game theory that prevents this from being too big of a problem.

@_date: 2017-03-21 10:57:26
I posted this almost 2 weeks ago: 
Basically, they want cheap onchain transactions (big blocks) &amp; to block or delay mass scale offchain solutions (most of them currently need a maleability fix and even if Lightning is possible without it, it would be much less useable as you said so much less of a competition). That's shortsighted imho even for their own interest but I guess they might be genuinely convinced that segwit is there to promote offchain over onchain. I came to this conclusion since most of the blockreward will come from the blocksize subsidy for a while anyway.
I think that where Core made a mistake is in given them an excuse to block segwit. BU wouldn't exist if it was only Antpool/Bitmain and a few other miners, hell even all the miners. It exists because they found an ally in the part of the Bitcoin community that wants bigger (than segwit) blocks. I'm pretty sure people like Roger Ver want to fix malleability but that must be the price they have to pay to get the bigger blocks. For them as long as fees come down quick, they are happy.

GOOD, they shiould also limit the leverage to 2x
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:58:13
This is my answer there: 
1- You missed the fact that 95% of Bitcoin trading is done in RMB. It's a little bit like commenting on the volume on a randome commodity future trading by taking only into account the Singapore exchange
2- The Forex trade is known to be massive and completly unrelated with any number in the real economy because of its huge amount of leverage... While "fake" liquidity is showing its ugly head here and there (remember the pound incident ?) Is that a goal to reach these levels in itself ?
3- So Bitcoin went from ZERO (a number that you like) to having total value superior to the broad money of HALF THE COUNTRIES on the planet! in 8 YEARS. Yes Because Uzbekistan is 94 on 193 countries. Can you think about that for 1 minute ?? A decentralized currency not controlled by any state, that didn't exist 8 years ago, achieved the mind boggling feat of going from 0 to 16B and his half the way to the top of the ranking. Shouldn't that make you think ? Are you really sure you are smarter than the market ? It also survived 4 or 5 bubbles with crash of &gt;90% to get there. Are you familiar with the concept of antifragility (Nassim Taleb) for example ?
4- To become a currency, Bitcoin has to be a commodity first. How do you expect it to go to from 0 to say $1T instantly ? How to distribute that new currency fairly ? Mining and the market will distribute bitcoin over the years, through up and down until it can achieve the mass necessary to be a non volatile currency. Is there any other way a non state currency could be brought to existence ?
Hope you like it :D

It's never going to be as clear as what you are describing, it's all about keeping good relationships. You want your miners at the right price, you want them on time, you want them in the numbers you need.
It's an opensecret that Jihan is using the smaller puppets pools to signal BU to not attract more attention to Bitmain. I can't believe some people fall for this kind of obvious manoeuvre.

Ok Interesting points. Let's explore the scenario that somebody just linked:  . Let's say they do have 75% and that the prices get lower on the core chain and that people foolishly don't realize the risk of losing coins if Core gets the lead back and go on and transact on BU.

Many Ceos tend to use bitcoin as a scapegoat for their business model failures. Then they dream of a magic solution that's going to save them. For Allaire it's another blockchain without pow apparently, for Coinbase it's appcoins.
But still I would like to hear more of his thought on this
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:29:09
I know a few people supporting BU and can attest that their motives are genuine. In fact they assume you want to keep blocks smalls either because blockstream would make money out of it (for the less intelligent ones) or because they think you are out of touch engineers engineering for the sake of engineering and that you lost or can't comprehend the big picture (for the smarter ones, not saying they are right, I'm personally undecided on the matter).
It would probably better if both sides were at least assuming good faith and trying to argue on economics/code/game theory/ whatever that fud battles.
The reason they haven't hardforked yet is because they are trying to achieve overwhelming support so their Bitcoin fork can quickly dominate the current Bitcoin. Nobody wants to lose money. They don't FUD bitcoin, they fud Bitcoin core (To raise support for alternatives)
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:06:09

First calm down with the insults. Try to talk to people the same way you would in they were in front of you ready to bash your skull until your understand politeness and respect. As you can see if you check my profile, I have much more karma in r/bitcoin than r/btc. I'm not here to troll or shitposts, I'm asking legitimates questions.
Second, let me rephrase again since your answer brings nothing new to the discussion: If a majority of miners (say 70%) chose to run BU or any other implementation introducting rules change (i.e &gt;1mb blocks), in what way does that mean that Bitcoin has failed and why Greg can say that they are "forcing" it on the community ?
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:16:33
I don't like comparisons. But it would be more akin to hedging http with gopher. Or yahoo with google. 
I'm pretty sure a crypto is going to become a dominant currency, and I think it's going to be Bitcoin. However I'm not going to take the risk of see a random crypto taking the dominant marketshare and being left with nothing.

Do you think everyone supporting segwit has the same opinion regarding hardforks ? I'm not in team core or team bu. I'm in Team BITCOIN. I have no problem with hardforks. The only reason I'm going with core roadmap is that it's obvious that most people behind BU are just leading us to the precipice. Clear technical majority on Core side, and a bunch of misguided fools (Gavin, Roger, Olivier etc.) and misguided powertripers (Jihan and his cohort) on the other side.

I don't necessarily agree with the digital gold vs payment network. I think it can be both. It looks like at the moment people are more split between fast and slow(cautious) actors. 
Also we should not underestimate the fact that even If we see it mainly as a competitor to gold, its future value also depends on its usage as a payment network and it has to compete with other cryptos.
For the taxable event, I don't see this as a problem. 1/ It could be automated 2/ laws can change to adapt to the moving world. 
On the other end, if you parse through my history, you will see that I don't feel like everything should be surrendered to whiny entrepreneurs like Jeremy Allaire. I said many times that too many ceos use Bitcoin "slow scaling" as a scapegoat for their personal failures.

The difference between a 51% 'attack' and a coinsplit is that the 51% attack is largely prevented by game theory. In the end Bitcoins belong to people who have faith in it.
It seems to me that hardfork are ultimately supposed to be solved by the market of which ofcourse we are all a part of. The proper way to fight a split is to sell it and buy the original chain.
What if a huge majority of people (lets say 85%) want to fork to something that you don't want to be part of? What will you then? Won't you be happy to go your own way?

Bitcoin probably shouldn't be bought as inflation protection yet. It's still too speculative. Store of value is by definition a stable asset. Bitcoin would become this when its marketcap is a few order of magnitude higher.

I  agree with you on many points. When I said easy I meant from a technical standpoint. I don't think think by any means that it will be easy economically. 
On the other hand it's important to recognize the possibility and work to minimise damages. It's important for Bitcoin to be able to withstand a hard fork bevause it's a non negligible possibility.
I can see a number of future subjects possibly highly contentious such as privacy, meddling of state actors, proof of work (be it the current algo or a different proof), even the 21m limits.
My main wish is that there is a more vigorous debate about hard forks where all arguments can be heard. You make some good points about the dangers. Maybe it will help those who want to hardfork now to read about those.

There is something that I have always been interested in is how Nick Szabo uses "Nakamoto" or "Satoshi" depending on the context.
Also in a old tweet somebody told him something like "thanks for everything blabla bitcoin", he replied along the lines "not Satoshi but thanks". He didn't reply "not Nakamoto" or "nor Satoshi Nakamoto"
I think he is also the one who createdd the expression "Nakamoto consensus" ?
A possible theory could be that Finney is Satoshi and Szabo is Nakamoto.

What's the definition of Bitcoin ? I would argue that Bitcoin starts at the genesis block and has the highest marketshare (in $/¥ for now). A coin sharing bitcoin history until a split would be an alt-bitcoin. A coin sharing part of the bitcoin code base is generally called an altcoin.

Ethereum lost some value but far from what your are mentionning. Moreoever if you knew how markets work, you would understand that the price of Bitcoin would be much lower now if a hardfork were to bring the price to 10$ as good investors take this into account in their current valuation of Bitcoin.
Finally what do you suggest to prevent Hard forks besides hiding under the table ?

@_date: 2016-11-21 16:08:31
The only difference is you don't need 51% for a hardfork. You need a few dozen percents and exchanges willing to list the coin. If there is a "need"in the market for an alt-bitcoin and this needs seems to be existing at this moment because of apparently diverging visions, then you have the conditions.
Again hope is not a strategy. It's too easy to hardfork to pretend it can't/should not happen. If a hardfork were to kill Bitcoin, I'd rather not have any bitcoin in the first place. Fortunately I think Bitcoin will survive. Obviously hardforks should be the last solution and the market will not treat most hardforks seriously.
But bitcoin is what it is, it's not what you wish it would be. Unless there is some code preventing a hardork (and there is not) then you have to deal with it. Money is a social construct. It's the market making it what it is.
There's plenty of things gold can't do that Bitcoin can. I'd rather have a Bitcoin than can fork in the 21st century. 
You can be hostile to people who try to fork, you just can't prevent it. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:22:41
Miners follow the market. If miners fork and everybody sell the forked coins for the old coin then the forker coin is useless etc. Miners what the coin that is the most profitable/ has the most value.

Yes I know but eventually all of these would be occupied by bitcoin mining if the price increases enough.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:35:36
It's really simple:
1/ Bitcoin has no ceiling has it could theoretically absorb all the fiat value of the world (and driving fiat to 0 the same way)
2/ Bitcoin is by no mean a sure thing and people will realize crazy gains (10x/100x).
3/ It's very hard to decide what are Bitcoin fudamentals as it doesn't generate an income (no P/e).
Personally I think the best comparison is gold and fiat. A simple variable like the yearly gold mining production ($100B) show us what could possibly be absorbed by the market.

Thank you for making me lose my time. 
It should have been clear from the beginning, but let me explain it to you in more explicit terms: I'm not talking about diversifying my investment portfolio. 
I'm talking about protecting myself form the possibility that my favored scenario where a cryptocurrency becomes dominant happens but that it happens with another coin. It's a hedge inside the "crypto becomes a big thing" scenario.
Now to discuss the appropriate allocation by assets to a portfolio, you can go back to r/investing, this is off topic.

I fail to understand your logic where miners "force" incompatible rules change. In the end the market decides which version of Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Miners just follow what they think the community wants. Like you they don't have any quantitative way to know that. 
So the ultimate judge is the market. Bitcoin fails only if it has no value. There is nothing preventing miner from adopting a different client, centralisation or not. If you don't recognize this, I don't see how Bitcoin has not already failed for you because this is bound to happen at one point are another. You can go and write your hearnia already. Miners can do whatever they want and the market delivers its verdict. There's going to be 2 bitcoins at some point because there is nothing preventing it.
As for r/bitcoin moderation, there's a middle ground between r/btc and r/bitcoin.

Obviously Bitcoin is much bigger and more widely used than Ethereum. I never said that we should expect the same pattern at all. It's just a experiment we can learn from in some ways where it's relevant.
The difficulty adjustment is a fake protection as it can be taken away in a fork. Hope is not a strategy. Personnally I'd rather deal with reality.

Exactly. In general people are completely paranoid with bitcoins and it's very counterproductive. Fact is the average guy with uptodate software (not running windows xp) is more likely to lose his coins by losing a backup than getting hacked.
Most people who have lost their coins had a unsecure/unecrypted backup of their keys on a online service (dropbox, gmail no 2fa etc.)
It's actually a good idea to have a good amount of bitcoins like a few hundred dollars on your phone and on your computer with little to no encryption, no better way to know if your device is safe!

I can't really buy this argument of "volunteer effort for the benefit of a community".
 If you have enough bitcoins, you are in effect working for yourself. And If you don't, then your incentives are not necessarily aligned with ours.
And I would add that in your case, you got paid 20M to work on Bitcoin. Isn't that enough of an incentive ?

Idiot op is spewing nonsense. Not only that but Blockstream has been funded by people who are heavily invested in Bitcoin. Basically funding Blockstream was the closest thing to funding Bitcoin they found.
I'm sure Gavin is loaded with Bitcoins and want it to suceed. I'm sure some other devs also have a lot of Bitcoins (I think Gmaxwell said a lot of his net worth is tied in Bitcoins) They just have different views on what is better for Bitcoin.
On the other hand Mike Hearn and Peter Todd because of ego issues or isolated views on some topics are definitely not helping. Remove these 2 individuals and the debate would be much improved as they are both very divisive.
I'm for a blocksize increase and 8 mb sounds more than reasonable (albeit the automatic increase by Gavin seems too aggressive) but I would definitely not support a fork now as I think there is still time to find consensus after some debate fatigue.
And the blocksize can always be increased by another fork later on.

Maybe you should stop reading Zerohedge. There is no need for central banks. Anyone can push the price down like with every other assets. Gold was in a technical danger zone for months. Ofcourse traders are going to want to push it through.
Oh and by the way physical gold is actually cheaper than futures contrary to what you can read everywhere on the goldbug spheres. Go buy a 1kg gold ingot and see for yourself. It's cheaper per ounce than the futures.
One reason I sold my gold years ago was that the goldbugs are so stupid. I thought if I'm investing with these idiots, I'm probably doing something wrong.
I hope they don't come over to Bitcoin because that's one of the few problem bitcoin has. Image problem becaue of the so many 'end of the world' idiots. Stop getting your facts from youtube video and think for yourself.

1/There are a lot of conspiracy theorists in the bitcoin community. These people always believe some force with ulterior motive is all powerful and will get them.
- The whale market manipulator always making a profit and pushing the price of bitcoin where it wants to to take their money no matter what.
- TPTB always out to crush Bitcoin (after it's done manipulating the gold and silver market)
2/Then there is a lot of rational thinking Ayn Rand fans. So if you are doing this or that it can only be because you stand to profit from it.
3/ And most important actually. Most of us don't have a clue whether we should or not increase the blocksize but people like to pick side so they will listen to those who are supposed to know. I hope the irony is not lost here because both Mike Hearn and the Blockstream party have used AD HOMINEM arguments against each other. And so their followers are following.
Finally maybe some 3rd parties are actually using this opportunity to create fud in the bitcoin community and there is some astroturfing going on.
Thank you for your post @_date: 2015-07-19 11:30:17
No need to be a rational libertarian or a goldbug nutcase to see usecases for bitcoins. There's plenty of them.
- store of value/ asset diversification
- Buying online without credit cards (underage, being in the wrong country, wanting privacy, not trusting the site with your card infos or for whatever other reason)
- Having some money saved that nobody can take from you (taxman, wife whatever)
- remittance, international transfers
- avoiding capital controls
Plenty of advantages for merchants too, maybe when they realise it they will actually make some effort to push bitcoins instead of asking for a blowjob to accept it.
@_date: 2015-07-14 10:59:46
Look I'm not defending the Greeks, they are a failure on so many levels. But obviously peoples like the Germans are not able to work out with others (non-germanic) long term. 
There is a reason why nazis came from Germany and not from England, France or the US. Cultural reason. It's an authoritarian culture who sees differences in a hierarchical manner (inferior/superior), can't assimilate any other people either (good luck to all the Europeans moving there). These ways were subdued a little because of WW2 but now the memory has faded.
You will note that Japan is more or less in the same situation. Historically they have the type of family structures. Only they didn't get in a complicated supranational structure like Europe so they only have to deal in a direct manner with their superior ally (the US) and hand out money to their inferior friends (South east asia). And knock heads with China.
These type of cultures work better as micro nations like the Flemish (who will eventually get their split from the french Waloons in belgium) and that's why most of them stay small or got unified very late. Germany got too big, should have stayed as collection of small states. And now they are in this mess they can't get out of. Tied to the destiny of other people they can't understand while all they dream of is to be a big Switzerland.
Europe is a mess. A beautiful dream but it's impossible to run in a democratic fashion. Only the brits were smart enough to recognize this (as they are the only one with a realistic vision for Europe).

The average lifespan of a paper currency regime is 43 years is a dumb statistics. We have been in a monetary system that has existed only for 50 years. You are comparing apple and oranges.
Tons of things have been used for 5000 years and have disappeared in a few decades. How about moving on a horse ? Fighting with swords ? It doesn't mean shit.
Gold is just too unpractical to use in the modern world and it will never be used again as currency on a wide scale.
Goldbugs are so stupid they don't even realize that if you put your fiat currency into a saving account rather than under your mattress, you get paid interest on it. Comparing 10$ is 1960 and 10$ today and forgetting the fact that you left 10$ on a bank account in 1960 you would have more value than buying 10$ of gold.
Gold is good for jewellery and that's it.
Bitcoin on the other hand is worth $4B at current exchange rate which means that even if never becomes widely used, it's still potentially an excellent investment.
Unlike gold it's useful for payments and could be used as a currency in the modern world. And finally unlike gold, it's evolving.
As for the disribution of coins, it will get much better as the market cap increase with big holders divesting. Everything else you said is a matter of the market cap increasing.
Gold has not future and can only go down, Bitcoin might have one and has a good risk/reward profile.

Having bitcoins on a non rooted phone with a paper backup like mycellium is pretty safe. Having coins without encryption or with very light encryption on your up to date desktop os is pretty safe too. Sure if you have 1 million dollars in coins, you can buy a dedicated computer for offline use. But otherwise it's not nearly as insecure as people assume. We are not in windows 95 days anymore.

@_date: 2016-02-10 17:52:42

Faster block validation
Faster block propagation
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:08:52
This. Much better to test UASF on a $500m network if necessary. That's what Litecoin is all about. It's the real money testing ground for Bitcoin.

If you are an alien looking at Bitcoin what do you see ? It's just a consensus system to make sure that rules agreed by humans participating in the network are enforced.
These rules are by definition political, they are made up by human like every other institution on this planet, from religions, to countries, to MONEY. Money is political.
Today if you have say 80% of the econ majority, you can probably force you way to a HF. and the 20%minority will have a hard time surviving, the "altcoin" created will replace the original chain for the world.
That's the reality. And that markes Bitcoin 10 times better than the USD. Because Bitcoin is a worldwide system, decentralized and because it's fate is ultimately decided on the market by the people who own it. 
The USD is centralized, decisions are made by people appointed by people who have been elected in one country of 300m people (of which most are not voting) in a planet of 7B. And nobody talks about the monetary policy in these elecitons.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:51:31
UASF could be done much faster on Litecoin since it doesn't have much non crypto-to-crypto use. If it works well, it would then increase chance of success for Bitcoin UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:21:50
I'm also good with this solution. I think unpacking segwit could be a good compromise. 
People are using high fees emergency as a bs talking point. The truth is bitcoin can wait one more year for a solution as long as there is a clear roadmap that people agree with.

I'm skeptical to the real usage of the blockchain. I think most transactions would disappear with a few cents of fees per transaciton. So I don't think we are close to maximun usage at all especially after segwit.

Bitcoin doesn't have to try to be anything. It can be used in different ways for people with different needs. There is no choice to be made. It's up to the user to decide how it wants to use it.

no breakout for now. 460++ would be though. We are at resistance.
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:34:05
The thing with Brian Armstrong is not his position, it's that he defends them in a childish way for the ceo of a top3 if not the biggest Bitcoin corp.
That's expected from someone like Olivier Janssens maybe (nothing against him but he was involved in many dramas before) not from the Coinbase CEO.
Classic supporters were the first one with the miner lobbying. Truth is there is no majority support at the moment in the community for their fork. But they keep going at it instead of waiting for the majority support if it ever comes.
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:24:51
No breakout on my trendline. And I would like a full weekly breakout with no reversal for me to validate. Which probably means 500+
But better be hitting against resistance than sleeping at the bottom of a support XD
I was expecting a breakout around end of march. But then again many people seem in the same boat so maybe It could run.

The weird thing is that Roger was buying bitcoins from distressed holders (like Greg). Only as far as I remember, unlike Greg, Roger doesn't appear on the plaintiffs lists.
Some people were able to withdraw JPY very close to the end. So my question is did Roger suddenly change his mind and converted everything to JPY AND was able to withdraw just before MTgox went down?
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:13:11
You are wrong. The market decides. If a huge majority of users want segwit2mbhf (I have no idea if it's the case), that's what's going to happen. It's not "politics".  It's markets. If a sizeable minority opposes the hardfork, then the majority has to decide if it is willing to risk a coin split. It might or might not change the majority's willingness. To be clear, the HF would be an altcoin (or more properly an alt-bitcoin), but with a good chance of overtaking Bitcoin.
I'm good with SWSF, against BU and I would support SWHF if it has broad majority (&gt;80% of the market).
Bitcoin governance works through economic incentives and market not ideology.

Izabella Kaminska has very poor understanding in general. 
People may pay attention to her because 
1. She works for the FT
2. She use fancy terminology which might fool some dumb people into thinking she is smart.
She has very poor understanding of bitcoin and has managed to write 75 articles on it. She has purely academic understanding of economics. 
Her irrational hatred for bitcoins comes from her fear of anything that is not controlled by the state. Felix Salmon is another such socialist retard.
Unfortunately she is not an isolated case. Most journalists are just good at one thing (writing) and barely understand what they are writing about. You just notice it when you know the field, but it's all the time on any non trivial matter.
The worst thing in kaminska's case is that she is extremely arrogant to go with it. There was an exchange where she got destroyed by another women (Andrea Castillo) on twitter regarding bitcoin. That would have been funny if it was not so pathetic.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:16:19
as long as they represent 20% of the market, they can block segwit indefinitely. Or we will need to accept a coinsplit risk with a HF.

One major reason why coinmarketcap rised to the top is because they listed detailed volume informations per exchange.
But now they are promoting fake data with a dozen fake cloned Chinese exchanges that have 99% fake volume. Not even mentioning Okcoin and Huobi that are at 80-90% fake volume. Okex being the  exchange because of this fake volume. They are rewarding scammers and cheaters.

It's the same in the end. The coin hoarded will be mostly sold at one point. The coins already sold by miners can't be sold again by them in the future. Better distribution is better for bitcoin too.
If there is stable demand for bitcoin as an investment, supply will become tight at some point in the future.

You don't understand how investment works do you? If you want to look at banker shills with $ sign in their eyes look at the people like Ersham and Armstrong from Coinbase. Allaire from Circle. And so on. These people raised hundred of millions to use Bitcoin in the hope of getting rich from their first  company or new venture. They don't give a shit about Bitcoin itself and now say it ou loud.
 Anti-core idol Mike Hearn went on to work for a bank consortium.
People at Blockstream or Core like Adam Back or Peter Todd were working on digital cash before Bitcoin even existed.
The guys who raised money for Blockstream need it to work Bitcoin. They need the money to pay other devs too.
Among the numero investors you'll find the ventures arms of some banking actors like r/btc scarecrow  (hilarious the conspiracy theory when you really know the company they are talking about)
So what? Do you think AXA gets to dictate what should go on with their minority share??? Somebody like Greg Maxwell has more certainly shares of Blockstream that AXA could get from that investment.
The only thing investors can pressure you with is for next round of investment. And 75 millions to develop Bitcoin is going to last a longtime. In the meantime Blockstream Blockchain skills are well ahead of all the other blockchain companies si I have no doubt they are easily making money from consulting.
Tldr: you got your story backward. The ones that are pressured by investors for their next round of investment are the anti core ones, the big names living off the bitcoin network like Coinbase. They are the one pushing to raise the blocksize to show scalability.

1/ Your blog post in hand waving. As it has been said, you have no way to know how much fees would be generated just by looking at the max blocksize. Increasing the max blocksize doesn't magically multiply the number of users willing to pay the same fee per transaction as a given instant. A fallacy that Roger and you keep paroting. 
2/ The Blockchain implies technical constraints that you completly ignore. Yeah ideally the blocksize would be infinite and energy would be unlimited but we live in a physical and human world where the question is about giving up something to gain something else. Bitcoin is not a centralised company like Visa, a centralised ledger will always be cheaper and more efficient. It's a network supporting a currency whose pillar is decentralisation. Weaken that too much and the whole thing crumbles.
3/ Most people agree that the blocksize will eventually be raised. The current dev team as a proven track record with constant improvement of the network while actually delivering on chain scaling that works. There is no urgency to override their roadmap to increase the blocksize even more and follow an unknown 'team' with a unfinished product into the abyss because a minority of newly rich holders of which only 2 are clearly known (Ver and you) have no patience and are stomping their feets.

Doesn't make any sense. You don't make something valuable by making it pricy unless you are selling some status item. You make it valuable and that makes it cost more (that is the price of a Bitcoin unit and not the price of fees we would have to pay to send them).

It's an important topic and a legitimate question. It's true that Blockstream is a major force in bitcoin's development. They employ many core devs and they are also working on some of the most important innovations concerning Bitcoin.
That said, the "others" don't matter as much. What matters is who put the most money in it and why.
Superficially, it certainly looks like Blockstream was funded to nurture the development of Bitcoin by Bitcoin holders and it looks like the closest thing to investing in Bitcoin outside of buying bitcoins.

A/ Scarce, universal, decentralized
B/ 2 important categories of people using Bitcoin today: 
1- The minority: People who need the anonymity/censorship resistance (people with a general concern about their privacy, dark markets etc..) 
2- Way more important, it's held mostly as an investment in the form of a bet on the futur use of Bitcoin. It's also held as a store of value outside of the banking system and outside of central banks control (like gold and unlike cash)
C/ Scarcity of course is untouchable. But the promise of a worldwide payment network usable by everyone is what makes the difference with Gold.
People are concerned about the scalability of Bitcoin because the vast majority of us are using Bitcoin as an investment and store of value. Note that the store of value function only works if the investment part works. That means that Bitcoin can only have non negligible value if we can project it as a fully functionning currency/asset/payment network in the future.
Even though I personally don't care so much if I have to pay 1 cent or 5 cents to send my bitcoins because I use them maybe 5 to 10 times in a year to buy something with it. I care very much that usage restricted by too high fees diminishes the expected vaue of my Bitcoin holdings by dimishing their future use cases. And I don't buy Bitcoins to spend them. I spend Bitcoins because I already hold them. As a first world citizen, I only hold them because I think their value should increase more than alternative assets I could hold instead and that they offer me a better risk/reward ratio.
Bitcoin has to be both nearly free and easy to send to make enough difference that we can project it as a possible future currency / asset / universal payment network. Bitcoin biggest chance is to be Gold on steroid. The scarcity has been taken care of, security has to be maintained, now where it needs to make a difference to destroy gold is by being easy, fast and cheap to send. If it's too cumbersome, then it's useless, there is already gold for people who want some store of value that is hard to spend or hard get in and out of. The price of Bitcoin doesn't matter, I mean by this, It can't be too high. It's not going to be a unit of account until it achieves world dominance. As for the fees, I would suggest they are never too low (as long as security is maintained).
I suspect the store of value libertarian/goldbug-like represented by Trace Mayer are very much a minority compared to the investment people. Bitcoin has no real future outside of the promise of a universal payment network. It's value would collapse as soon as this goes away.
So what does Bitcoin needs ? It needs way more onramps and offramps in every currencies all over the world. It needs to be decentralized enough, cheap and fast so that the promise of a future universal payment network with its scarce currency stays palpable. Bitcoin can't be just good enough, it has to be way better both than Gold first and than the Fiat banking system second in order to succeed.

Because at least from the well known major holders, few are going to risk blocking bitcoin scaling to make a point. Only ideological zealots like Roger and Olivier will take this route and in the end, they have too much money on the line. They will fold one way or another. Their only escape route is forking to minor chain altcoin. Look how ETC is strugling while having much more legitimacy... Core has all the technical talents. Core has people who have been talking and working on digital cash for years before Bitcoin inception.
This blocksize controversy originated partly because people who were worried about slowdown in vc funding wanted to show that Bitcoin can scale. Now that there is a scaling solution, even if it was not their prefere one, they are not going to delay it for long.

I think the correlation has reversed. 
In the beginning, people would buy bitcoin when they learn about it so higher search volume would lead to higher prices. 
But now most people have heard about it and while price increases will generate buzz in the media, bigger search volume for other reasons won't necessarily translate into higher price. 
If the increase in volume is generated by a price increase itself, say a new ATH or hitting a psychological price. Then it will translate into an even higher price (reflexivity). Could also work for a major good news. But it would have to be yuge. ETF, gov endorsments etc.

Yes the Ripple management team is a den of snakes. They will talk down Bitcoin any occasion they have. In the meantime, they are showing their face at every other Bitcoin conferences.
I don't understand how Bitcoin investors like Barry Silbert or Roger Ver are supporting this.  I understand investing in two competing systems (being nice to Ripple..), but letting the management team shit on your main investment at any occasion they have doesn't look like a smart move.
They also ordered the worst piece of trash journalism I have ever seen as a hit piece on Stellar

I was asked for a wire transfer. Wire transfers are extremely annoying with the banks I know of. In my case I think I can add a new beneficary by receiving a text message, however I lost the sim card tied to that phone number (I travel a lot and use many simcards) so I need to wait to go back to that other country to make a new simcard. I'm not even sure it's possible to add beneficiaries that way as before you needed to receive a confirmation code by snail mail t to add a new beneficiary. I asked a friend but in his case, he needs to go to the bank branch to add a new beneficiary (!?). 
And then it would have been more expensive anyway to do it as a bank transfer.

I hope your knowledge of history doesn't start with the time you entered adulthood :D
The EU budget doesn't cost that much really. 1% of gdp. On the other end the french state suck up to 50% of the gdp in taxes. So I think your parents rightfully think they are getting bled dry and told what to do, but it's just France sinking deeper into the communist black hole. Not much the EU can do about it. It's trying really but France us too powerful and bends the rules (budget deficit for example).
Again the worst of the EU is most often French-led so I don't see how France could do better without it. The UK  maybe.
 
And one should not confuse market reforms  (opening) and tax rate.

Well it's an easy answer. Bitcoin is a risky investment (possibility of dropping to 0 or near 0) with a very high ceiling. It looks like a good bet on expected value. It's like having a pair of As or Kings preflop in Poker.
However you should only do it if you able to go all the way. Why ? Because Bitcoin is too volatile and will push you to sell if you have to make a decision.
The stupidest strategy in investing in Bitcoin is having a stop-sell (automatic or mental). Because the chances of hitting that stop are too high no matter what becomes of Bitcoin afterwards.
The easy way to invest in Bitcoins is to buy what you can afford to lose and ride it for years. You can buy at once or every month. Doesn't matter. But you should stick to the plan. Alternatively you can decide to sell some portions out at a certain date. For example in 3 years on 2nd of february, you will sell 30%.
I would advise purely speculating on Bitcoins, (buying just in the hope to cashout entirely). Because you will feel much better if you actually believe in it. And it will help you hold in difficult times. If you don't believe in it, once again you wil be pushed to sell. That's part of what has been happening in 2014. Many people got in without knowing much during 2013 and couldn't find a reason to hold in 2014.
On the other hand someone like Roger Ver made a killing during the first big bubble because he was a believer and held from 30 to 2 dollars buying on the way down. Ofcourse you can't have the same returns now but the theoretical returns are still huge :D Even reasonable end valuation of 100-200 billion $ represent a x50-x100. And there is still a chance no matter how small it is that it could be worth trillions in the end. It could also maintain a small valuation as a niche market anywhere from 1 to 20 billions $ in which case you still have a lot of potential.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:59:07
The main property of Bitcoin is to being able to be sent over the internet while being scarce. The only other commodities you can compare it to are altcoins and Gold.
A 10 million $ bitcoin is no better than litecoin, and is not very useful either. On the other hand people can hoard billions of $ and bitcoin and barely move them and it would be a total success. How often do you move your gold ? You don't need to move your bitcoins, you just need TO BE ABLE to move them easily.

When you go to the website of a company and that there is no product, that in fact the product is the company itself, that the company ticker is advertised on every pages. That the company is trading on the pink sheets through a reverse merger. That's a big RED FLASHING LIGHT for a pump &amp; dump. Their stock has been pumped &amp; dumped once and it will be again.
So they have the shittiest internet shop with probably close to 0 sales per month. The CEO himself says in an interview he has no idea which product is selling the best in his shop. A non existant bitcoin wallet, 2 atms, and supposedly now around 900 TH/S of mining equipment in a empty hangar (pictures also found here  , I have no idea if they rent, bought the place, or just stole the pictures but they surely have no equipment to show for now). I'm not saying they didn't manage to convice somebody to throw them a few antminer in exchange for their stocks though it certainly should be looked at. But 900 th/s, 2 bitcoin atms and a worthless bitcoin ecommerce is an interesting product for a public company. 
Why? because the product is actually the company.
Either you don't know anything about that company on which advisory board you are sitting, or you are disingenuous because they gave you free stocks or whatever.

I'm not even convinced Bitcoin would fail if we couldn't get to a very high amount of transactions per seconds. How many times per year people move their gold ? 
I think Swift does 12 millions payment per day ( Isn't that around 50mb per block counting 3 transactions per seconds at the current size ?
On the other hand I agree with you that permitting more transactions is positive for psychological purposes and also from the point where Bitcoins needs to compete with altcoins too.
On the other hand, I don't think people earning Bitcoins is important, nobody earns gold. As long as trust is built in the network and in the history of the price, people will save in it. The only thing gold has is 6000 years of history. Bitcoin just needs to build its history.
Basically being as good as the next altcoin(altblockchain) and time is the only thing Bitcoin needs to be successful.

The problem is the way you presents it "User that promises to not make more that two purchase per day" ? What is this metrics besides something you randomly made up ?
How many times per week to you make a swift payment ? How many times per year do you buy or sell gold?
Bitcoin can be a huge success without sending a transaction on the network to pay for a bottle of coke. The important thing is the value (price) and a reasonable amount of transactions. Everything else can happen offchains, settled in a bitcoin transaction at a later time.
And I'm not even talking about the normal evolution with progress in blocksize and making the transaction takes less space.
That's really a non problem.

My point is the state is becoming more powerful and exerce more control with new technologies not less.
Now you have biometric passport, financial data sharing between countries. We live in a big brother society compared to dozens years ago, not even mentionning 19th century.
And Bitcoin won't change that one bit unless it was worlwide dominant currency. Exchanges and payment pricessor are very easy to control. Its even worse than cash.

- It should not raise steadily to the moon
- It should not go that high before caping until the final take off (5-10k usd/btc)
- It's impossible to guess the timeframe and it could ofcourse take decades
- It resolves very quickly once the final exponentional leg up has started
- There's no way Bitcoin goes to $1T and it doesn't upend the monetary sytem
- The next sizeable "bubble" should look like the one in 1919. It would flatten for years after that.
- There is a small possibility that 1919 was actually 2013 and we are closer than we think to the end (this is dependent not on Bitcoin but on Fiat curencies).
*Additionally, I can't see any logical scenario where it is led by the common people. Bitcoin is for people who have both wealth to save, are willing to take action and risks, are smart enough to recognize its potential. The flight to Bitcoin should therefore be led by the 1%. The average person would come in only after alarms are ringing and for many of them simply lose their fiat saving without taking action.*
=&gt; There's 2 scenario leading to that kind of chart.
1/ Bitcoin takes a role like a 21th century Gold and stands there with a reasonable market cap from 75 to 150B, stays there for years waiting for a worldwide monetary crisis (this will happen sometimes in the future, no system is forever especially in currencies and the current monetary system seems very fragile). The scenario I'm betting on.
2/ Bitcoin growth accelerates the demise of the "post Bretton woods" Nixonian era by providing a visible alternative and flight to Bitcoins leads to Fiat demonetization. I don't think it will reach a market cap high enough by itself to threaten the monetary system (should go to 1T to shock people) but it's a possibility.

If it was true there would be no price rise. It would be market neutral and volume would be higher and prices even lower in the west.
The real reasons are: Chinese exchange allow shorting on margin so there is a squeeze going on, Chinese traders are more bullish this time (not as much eth fud in China?), Chinese traders are known to be bold in general and make big bets  (see the copper market) and finally the weekend slows down arbitrage)

The day China wakes up about Bitcoin, you will see it in the charts with BTC/RMB leading the way up. 
Investment opportunities are very limited in China. They have serious barriers to prevent people from converting RMB to foreign currencies limiting investment abroad (although you can see the number of Chinese buying real estate in Australia, USA, UK and Vancouver)
So for individuals, it's mainly eye-popping overpriced Real estate and these days shady wealth managements promising unrealistic rates bundling shitty loans with banks thinking the Party will have to bail them out anyway if something goes wrong. The Stockmarket is seen has an insider game, and only used as legal gambling.
People are also used to huge gains because of the Real estate market and the high growth rate of the economy over the last two decades.
Mainland Chinese don't trust anyone in general but their relatives, and they certainly don't trust Chinese companies or the government for that matter. 
So many things make Bitcoin a good match for Chinese. Deficit of trust, lack of investment opportunities, control of change..
I have not doubt that the time will come, and the governement will be very quick to crack down if it feels any threat. 
Considering these facts, I see it as fairly possible that China would lead one of the next bubble phases of Bitcoin and it's equally probable that China would be the first government to REALLY crackdown on Bitcoin. Like taking down every bitcoin website inside the GFW and blocking evry bitcoin websites outside the GFW. Blocking bitcoin from being researched on search engine, social media. Usual stuff for China. It could happen from one day to the next without obvious reason to the outside.
And to those who think they might see it as a way to take on the dollars.. Well Chinese officials are obsessed with interior policies, The only interest they have in foreign policy is as a by-product of interior policy. And the number 1 goal of chinese officials is far and away keeping the party in charge (after themselves ofc). So I don't see them losing control of their currency to take on the dollar ..

Nothing special happened in China (yet). Like everywhere else in the world journalist are hyping anything, that's their job. Bitcoins makes it even more an incentive for a journalist as you can buy some and try to hype it to make money. CCTV is not monolithic. And the government of 1.3 billion ppl has bigger cats to fry.
Now anyone who knows China will tell you that Chinese people don't trust anyone but their family and no one is least trusted than the governement. Meaning they are excessively receptive to any kind of rumors. They panic for anything and will melt anything up or down. This is amplified by the fact that they are prone to gambling.
Taking that into account, I'm expecting a real BIG ONE BUBBLE on bitcoin driven by china at some point. I wouldn't be surprise if chinese were the one driving the price first to 4 or 5 digits Usd equivalent. I don't know when, but I'm quite positive it's going to happen

The increase in marketcap gives more reason to try to build around it. Underestimating it is more dangerous than tackling the threat now. 
I also think Litecoin is doomed because of it's high similarity to Bitcoin and higher inflation. The only reason you would buy Litecoin over Bitcoin is because you think it might go higher because it's worth less. Once you are at the same market cap, you have no more incentive to hold but then the vastly higher inflation rates kicks in.
However it doesn't mean that because Litecoin has virtually no chance to overtake bitcoin, it can't hurt it. Also we could say that people are simply mispricing Litecoin potential marketshare and will pay the price for it BUT you also need to take into account that simply increasing the marketcap of an altcoin increases its potential, (at least in the short term before the holders are seriously tested by the market). So we are in a situation where price increase somehow justify the increase a posteriori.

I'm a big supporter of free markets. In free markets, competitors do compete against each others. For now we have seen networks copying Bitcoin but we haven't seen much answers from The Bitcoin community, everyone who holds Bitcoin is a shareholder of the network. I'm raising awareness.
I don't see the link with pyramids and I personnally do not care about fiat currencies.

The usual answer to this kind of problem is education and PR. I think the biggest bitcoin holders are getting rich enough in fiat term to solve that problem without recentralizing Bitcoin with blacklists.
If a business doesn't want to be associated with Bitcoin for PR reason, too bad for them. They will have time to rethink their decision at a later time. Bitcoin reputation is not set in stone. It has been improving a lot these last 6 months.

Welcome to the worlds of markets. Markets are forward looking. And bitcoin is a very new asset that is hard to price so you could justify very different valuations depending on your reasoning.
And currently it trades more on technicals. My guess is that big investors who learned of bitcoin this year will get in when we touch the 200ma daily (if it acts as a support which I think it certainly will). Could happen anytime in July or August between 70 and 90 btcusd.

Spot-on Erik.
As Amanojack said, Bitcoin is a ledger. Litecoin doesn't bring any innovation to the table so it's just a parasite. The way it has been promoted since the beginning (silver to gold) is dishonest and a pure psychological trick because  the divisibility of bitcoins renders any "silver-to-gold" useless bitcoin being both silver and gold.
 I think too many Bitcoiners see it as distraction when in fact it's a competitor no matter how far behind it is.
That's why it's a bad idea to hedge your bitcoin position with litecoins (outside of the fact that there is very few scenario justifying doing that). You are supporting litecoins, which is like a vhs owner and shareholder supporting betamax.
When you are using bitcoin you are not only a user but a shareholder as long as you hold a bitcon balance. It's against your interest to buy litecoin. I'm sure it will be used in the media as a way to devalue Bitcoin, confusing people about cryptocurrency.
I would add that it's poor bet anyway considering the lack of ecosystem, the market cap is 5% of bitcoin and the fact that coins are created at a higher pace, potentially depreciating litecoin faster while People who used to mine bitcoin with gpu farms could do it today in litecoin, converting litecoin to bitcoin putting pressure on the exchange rate.

Presenting Bitcoin to the masses through mining is NEVER a good thing. Outside of the fact that mining is irrelevant to most users and a by-product of the necessary phase of money creation, it's very difficult to explain without making it look like a scam and rings instant alarm bells in people's heads.
Bitcoin should be presented for its major innovations such as:
- Conducting financial transactions or saving without banks
- Very fast money transfer very small to very large sums across the world at minimum fees
- Immunity to currency debasement or manipulation through central banks activities.

I would be VERY surprised (99.9% sure it's not the case) if gold price were kept down in such fashion by Central banks. Many people speculated on gold etf in the last few years and that is more than enough to explain these kind of move. You have people on both side of the trade trying to make the other fold first.
Also there is almost no physical premium if you buy in large quantities (&gt;1kg)
Many Goldbugs and preppers are paranoid. Most of them are Gollum-like with their precious and they will find any reason to justify price going down. Truth is gold went too high too fast and is still correcting for now.

Chinese (and if you don't know, now you know) are buying your coins. Probably along some deep pockets and average people who have been following bitcoin for a longtime but were too lazy to buy are now buying your coins, that's why.
Few  things at play here: 
- Some of the super early adopters which you are part of have made unbelievable returns so what you think is high is not the same as what people who bought at 100 think is high.
- Some of the early adopters made a killing by selling bitcoins from 100-250 and buying back at 50-100 last time and think they can do it again. Super early adopters are mostly computer geeks and not traders so they don't have a great experience of markets. (mainly they don't understand that markets can be overbought or oversold for a loooooooongtime). Also a 4B$ Market cap in the big picture is NOTHING.
- I guess what you think is everyone is just a very small community of super early adopters. And I tell you more, it's actually very healthy if you are all cashing out some or even a lot of your coins. Especially since you have so many coins, it's better to sell them when there is volume and demand for it. Just don't cashout everything ofcourse. You need to diversify and not have 90% of your wealth in bitcoin (yet).
- I'd be curious to know who you mean by everyone. I'm guessing some people from the early days that you are in contact with. However I think some of these people are also invested in bitcoin startups and are really trying to bootstrap this rather than just profiting from it. Hardcore believers would probably not sell most of their holdings no matter what. And If you are a hardcore believer and you are left with a few coins and the price keep going up, it will be very hard to resist the urge to buy back. Hardcore believers can't stay out of Bitcoin obviously considering the potential.
If Bitcoin is to succeed it will be a very long road from the satoshi's day and a lot of people buying and selling to get us there!
@_date: 2013-10-15 07:09:29
People tend to overestimate governments with crazy conspiracies but I think you are underestimating them here. Some powerful interests are also in danger of disruption (some extinction) because of Bitcoin. I'm not sure they will go down without a fight at all.
I think on the contrary that we need broad support in the population and tech companies.
Also don't underestimate the fact that a lot of people will be angry and jealous at those who got rich on Bitcoin and so they will be happy to let the government stick it to you. So we need WAY WAY more people involved. 
Personally, I think Bitcoin will spread in a manner similar to Christianism. I just hope it doesn't take as long :D

There is plenty of countries without capital gain tax, in this case on foreign currencies. Belgium was mentioned yesterday.

Bitcoin divisibility means there is no need for a "silver to gold". Litecoin is just another altcoin. And I'd be surprised if it didn't crash when Mtgox starts trading it with all the GPU miners who can't mine Bitcoin anymore and hoard litecoin in the hope to repeat the bitcoin story with Mtgox trading in sight.
This post by Gavin Andresen is actually quite scary, this guy is lead developer ? He seems to be confused by basic economics and in this post he is basically putting altcoins on the same level as bitcoin "It is all about supply and demand; Bitcoin makes the supply predictable, so price is purely a function of demand. Throw altcoins into the mix, and suddenly supply becomes essentially infinite" 
WRONG! If I chose to put my money in the Bitcoin network, I can't send it to my friend in litecoin! Infinity of altcoins doesn't change anything to the finite supply of Bitcoin. The only thing that gives Bitcoin value is the faith that it will continue to be the dominant decentralized currency. Bitcoin (or an altcoin that could take its place) is the ultimate FIAT currency! It can't be inflated but it is still only based on faith. Not hard to understand. That's why the most important thing we should look at (besides competent developers so Bitcoin doesn't fall behind in features) is Market Cap. Now the bigger the Bitcoin market cap will grow and the safer it will be from altcoins. Once Bitcoin gets over $10 Billions, I think it should be pretty safe. The bigger the gap between Bitcoin and altcoins market cap and the quicker these will disappear. 
Would you see Mark Zuckerberg whining about a no name social networks with 1 million users ?
Considering his recent suggestion of centralized 2 factor auth, I'm starting to wonder if he is panicking.. maybe he is starting to get cold feet because of the sudden wealth he is sitting on.. Now you have something to lose. It's not a game anymore. I hope he is replaced soon enough by people who can code as well but are more knowledgeable in economics..
One of the thing with Bitcoin, a lot of the early adopters (pre-2013) got rich and they don't know what to do anymore, they are in fear (not counting all those who have cashed out at $1 or $30 or $100, probably the majority). There is a big difference between going from 0 to a few millions dollars almost by luck and people investing millions of dollars and expecting ROI. That's why we need a second generation of wealthy Bitcoiners to takeover to go along with the Bitcoin fanatics (those who will probably never cash out no matter what). Fortunately as the Bitcoin Market Cap continues to grow, it will attract more people with a lot of money that can both buy bitcoins and support its development. Nothing has been better for Bitcoin since inception than hitting $100/btc. It put it on the map.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:43:04
I'm more interested in the rate of adoption as I think the faster it happens the better it is. Especially because the current central bank policies create monetary hazards and Bitcoin acceptance is still far from where it needs to be to take over if needed.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:28:11
At this point, I doubt that. While the gap in exchange rates would be easily explained by this, it looks to me that it's first and foremost attraction to big returns, every Chinese feel like they can make it big. That is completely logical after 30 years of adding 10% to gdp every year. It seems to be almost trivial in China to circumvent capital controls.
People in China have more trust in the RMB than the $, the reason they are looking to have assets outside of China is because they don't trust the government to respect private property or they made money in "shady" ways. The first thing they want to buy is Real estate. Inside and then outside. I'm confident Bitcoin might be able to compete with their other options in time.

People dreaming about the Chinese government endorsing Bitcoin don't know anything about China.
So Voorhees promoting this article after the mind-boggling post of Gavin on altcoins, I'm sorry but these are the kind of things that tells me we are still not out of the "amateur" phase.

He probably sold a significant portion or a majority of all his Bitcoin holdings at a much lower price and was waiting for a lower price to buy back and now he has to buy at 130$ or more. 
Because from an economic/trading standpoint this article makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:12:39
That might be related to the fact that they bought just before the run-up.
If you buy at 200 and a few weeks later it's at 1000, it's much harder psychologically than if you buy in april or mai after the last crash and go through a few months with price ranging from say 140 to 70 especially if you bought near 140.
The second reason is that they might not be able to understand the long term implications of Bitcoin. That will change when Bitcoin becomes more *real*. I.e When you can use it in more places, when there are more services around it and potentially other developments we can't even imagine now.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, few people are imaginative enough to project themselves in possible futures. As time pass    it will get easier to grasp the reality that is forming in front of our eyes. It's easier now than in 2010 and that's why a bitcoin is 700$ now and not 0.1$.
Every day more people understand Bitcoin and realize its potential. These people will not go back. All we need to do is to continue building around it, keep talking about it, keep using it. And time will do the rest.

What a stupid idea. Especially posting this now at 400 after such a run-up. Giving arguments to the people who decry Bitcoin. I hope this get downvoted into oblivion.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:17:56
Totally agree however you will note that the only coin with a decent market cap relative to Bitcoin is one of the closest copy and not one who is innovating like Namecoin. Namecoin and alt blockchains with differents purpose are another topic.

It makes no sense for altcoins to prosper along Bitcoin.
- As you just said yourself, Network Effect is everything.
- The biggest obstacle to decentralized digital currency is critical mass and liquidity.
If we put security and scalability concerns aside, the only 2 variables that matters are time and total value to build trust. People in the Bitcoin community today seem worried about governments, regulations when really these 2 things are what really matters. They are even more important than the actual number of people using Bitcoin. I understand that organizations and individuals might feel like these are the two things they have the least power over. So I guess it's natural they are overlooked.
The main challenge you are facing to succeed as a Software developer or Lead scientist is scalability and security. But these are not the goal these are necessities. We are all taking these for granted. Your end goal and focus outside of these should always be how to help grow Bitcoin market cap. 
That's why you have to be very considerate about anything you write or say because you are today the most public face of Bitcoin. Even if you do no want it, you should always think of yourself as a spokeperson or even CEO in anything you say.
If you write a post like the one you just wrote, you are just giving altcoins more credibility. Imaginary credibility that they don't have. As other people said, if you see anything useful developing in altcoins, just copy it. Otherwise, ignore them.
And besides I read my post again and it was a too aggressive so just wanted to say you have done great work so far but everyone that is important in this thing has to realize the magnitude of the task ahead and the responsibility that comes with the infinite potential of Bitcoin. You are in this position now and you have to be up to the task. I personally think Bitcoin really has the potential to succeed in a major way.

Competition is great! That's why I'm saying the bitcoin community should start taking it seriously instead of letting litecoin grab marketshares. Nobody is preventing the litecoin community to build its own litecoin ecosystem.

They never invested 10 millions. They invested around 1-2 million.
They haven't done anything that merits attention so far with these bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-26 04:08:59
Hahaha such an interesting guy.  You are on every topic defending Bitcoin. You are getting excited like a child on good news...
On one side I have to say I am/was quite suspicious about the whole Satoshi-dice story. On the other side, well I guess It could be expected if you were not rich before Bitcoin.. But still seeing an investor with such a large holding showing this kind of passion makes me kinda of like you. It's exciting to see your dreams becoming true isn't it.
Back to the topic, yep good news. That's a milestone. 2013 has been out of this world amazing for Bitcoin so far. Progression is clear on every fronts. Barbarians at the gate!

Tomorrow it will be a flood of headlines in the media

You can easily find tablets that are cheaper and at least as resistant to shocks than your terminal. A printer cost nothing.
Your "thing" has no use.. And the fact that you advertise Litecoin so prominently... I mean seriously ? Merchants will already have a hardtime accepting Bitcoin, wtf they would do with LITECOIN.
This tells me that either (a) this is a scam/ad campaign promoting litecoin (b) You are completely delusional
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:49:39
Would be even better if someone could come up with an alternative to this archaic message board...

We re not taking 1%, we are taking 100%. TO DA MOON.
People will be more calm when we rest 10-15% lower hopefully. I don't like the overheating.

We really need some graphic designer to produce a few nice pictures so media can use something else than those casasius coins.

I really like Chamath, he has vision and is good at expressing it. He tends to simplify things to extremes though and lacks modesty. Things are either great or stupid with him. He doesn't find much middle grounds. 
I never got if it is because he wants people to get his point or if he is more style than substance. No doubt guy is a great seller, he can make an awesome speech and is interested in all the right things but I really didn't like that time when I heard him call Xiaomi the next Apple. I can't get that out of my head.

You see the actual website or just the cloudflare snapshot ?

True and I will also add all the journalists and bloggers who will adopt bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:10:57
Great interview
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:41:07
Good Job Erik.
Schiff only argument is that Bitcoin is not adopted by enough people yet which is like saying that cellphones are not working in 1990 becasue only a few people have them.
He obviously sees it coming but he has to put Gold in everything because it's how he earns his paycheck.

What is the Internet anyway ? :D

This is lost on the naives my friend. Bitcoin is explooooooooding again in Voorhees' imaginary China :D

thanks pentarh!
It's shameful but I never took the time to check out the tip bot before, I'll share the love.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:58:30
That's one I would like to hear about too. Though I'm not sure It would be positive.

Litecoin is not a sidekick it's a parasite
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:29:14
agreed, upvoted
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:02:04
I'm not a big fan of how the bitcoin logo is positioned. Maybe make it smaller and on the heart (like a football team logo). Otherwise might buy..
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:14:55
Turning point
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:19:04
They probably think that higher unit price make people put more fiat in BTC, as all they care about is volume (fees), you understand why they are not interested. Exchanges might have the same line of thinking.
Ofcourse it's wrong and shortsighted.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:34:18
You are certainly not a "longterm holder" and since you are obviously not a trader either, you will end up losing a lot trying to time the market. It's extremly difficult to do for traders in normal times, let's not even talk about asset like bitcoins in exponential growth/ bubbles mode
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:49:51
Since he is going for ad-hominem arguments, I can only say "guru" dood is a fat idiot and the "interviewer" is a pathetic wimp...
Winklevii have way more vision that this blob too. As facebook shows. I would have liked to have an interview of him when Facebook was valued at anything from $1B to $10B.

Bitcoins is a currency and/or a commodity not a stock. I wouldnt call exchanging bitcoin for dollars a profit.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:25:37
Robocoin has no competition, reason why they are ripping all the benefits. Rewarded for being first mover. This will change soon I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-02 06:23:25
700K$ is nothing for some people. And Bitstamp has been trusted with millions of $ so far. There are still quite a few people who can sell 4000 btc and eat that wall instantly so you could also see it as someone who just want to buy a large amount of bitcoin at a small discount.
@_date: 2013-10-19 09:59:31
This. I agree that the second market slides doesn't make any sens but Banterpanther is barely better.
He is comparing 1 year of gold demand as an investment/store of value to the total market cap of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:33:21
Totally agree but on the bright side: Price going up, more people into bitcoin, more potential customers, more merchants, more potential customers, price going up, more people  in to bitcoin, more potential customers, more merchants, you get it
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:02:15
False comparison. Euro and dollars are not store of values, the trust is not in the network but in the states and their central banks. Crypto under their current form can't exist if they are not acting as store of values. Because they are very new, they have to build trust. It's hard to build trust in an environment where you don't know which one will prevail.

They can still close every exchanges in a day though
