More people need to see this. All they see is the fiat value and think "bubble." I agree that it's meteoric rise feels unnatural to me, but look at its relative rise - the percentages you work out - it doesn't feel as much like bubble territory.

You aren't wrong.

Check out their subreddit. It's a good community and a fantastic idea for a platform. I'm not shilling them... I hold a substantial amount of BTC. Anyway, check it out.

I just we can keep the momentum up for the morning! Would be a shame to waste that beautiful wall destruction. I swear I think I hear Ronald Regan himself.

Watched all my LTC value vaporize as well that day. $33 bucks or something iirc? I almost shat myself and could barely continue with work. mmmm. Good times.

Man I bought tonight too. I'm not stressed too much about futures. I think it's gonna have a smaller overall effect that we are theorizing. I mean - there has to be as many people betting for as against for those futures contracts to even exist. It may just stabilize BTC and therefore crypto as a whole. At least help the stabilization. We're always going to see value increases as we tend toward adoption, but this volatility day to day is handicapping acceptance. Futures may not harm BTC at all - maybe it will do just the opposite. I'm gonna hold through. I feel positive about it. Realistic, in that I know this market isn't really rational, but I think I will be fine.

I personally think a bear market is somewhat near. Nothing is stopping this freight train of technological advancement in the long run but presently it definitely feels as if we've exhausted this run. I had a guy raking leaves the other day telling me that I should get into bitcoin mining. I do mine, but it was a signal that most of this run has excited nearly everyone it can. They  were the sell-offs we've been seeing, either for a minor profit or fear at the last dip. I sold 75% at the top (not just BTC-all my holdings) and am now letting the rest of my holding be the support (albeit tiny, I mean part of the greater support level) indefinitely. With the new DAG coins, privacy projects, everything new in the ecosystem, you would have to be completely short side to not see that this isn't "go to crash and disappear." It's here forever. But yea, they have yet to see "the dip." It's not going to be overnight. And in a year or two those that stuck around and participated will be rewarded kindly.

Put it this way, my IOTA returns just a few days ago were MUCH higher percentage wise, and no one even batted an eye.

This is fantastic. Give your mom a hug.

Fucking hodl. My fingernails are hurting trying to hang on to this rocket.

Just in my mind. That would be quite the long video, it was like 15 runs against the wall.

I've had a Coinbase account for quite a while, as well as many other exchanges. Zero spam.

Either works, but I prefer the importJSON script, it's just more reliable.  Those XML pulls seem to fail a lot for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:08
I see that, still not even half of 5000%. A crazy increase to be sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:02:53
Depends on network volume. Could be an hour+ honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:03
This is where I am. I bought this week, the last, and many weeks before that. I could survive one hell of a correction and still a happy holder. Anyway, I think the futures market is going to help rather than hinder BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:36:08
Now we need to chip away at these weak hands ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:39:20
It was a beautiful thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:51
This is what I believe also. And, as another user posted earlier (wish I could find the comment to give credit) bitcoin is up about 1000% this year, which is a far cry from 5000% increase it experienced it 2013. This lends some credit to the idea that it may not be near done with this run.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:23:12
Always zoom out. I'm so happy that it is dipping so hard. Buy opportunity + a little bit of time for realistic value to catch up to the speculative value.
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:40:23
Just opened up the port. Got 10 active connections and counting :)

Huzzah, &lt;3 coffee
edit: because I've been working diligently trying to produce some reports for my boss who really REALLY gets on my nerves, and I need to re-up my caffeine so I can deal with her. Also, because I just became involved today about 11 a.m. with the bitcoin community (purchased my first ~~coins~~ fragments of a coin)!

Damn I kinda want to drive over, I'm in Ocean Springs in MS. Probably won't make it but I'll have a beer here in celebration!

Based on my near zero knowledge I bet it breaks up tomorrow night. Mainly because I want it to.

I understand the fundamentals, and again, it's somewhat trash. The reason it's trading so high is due to whales sparking unrest. In my opinion BCH is being falsely propped up and BTC is being forcefully held down. This is literally a tantrum being thrown because of failure of 2x. And coiners being coiners, they see these large movements that feel organic, and they hop on board. When BCash falls on its face (or maybe it will just coincide peacefully on its own chain, who knows) I will feel bad for the mice that feel into the propaganda trap. Core will be here and on top for the foreseeable future.

I haven't heard of it. Will check it out. Would you be willing to help get something together? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:24:34
They absolutely are acting as a bank. It's sort of a necessary evil to get the system booted in my opinion. Not everyone is savvy enough or willing to learn or willing to invest in hardware as to have people interacting in a fully decentralized way. The exchanges are acting to ease the barriers to "playing." There are already decentralized exchanges being developed and protocols being written to have direct swaps of coins - hopefully somewhat negating the importance of the current exchanges. 
Edit: give it time, they will become much less important in my opinion.

This. I'm fairly new but I lost about 60% overall during the china issue spread out over several coins. If there was a 60% correction today I'd turn off my tickers and probably invest a huge chunk of my fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:53:28
This was more valuable response than mine. But yes, diversify your investments, don't overreact to changes in your portfolios value, and sit on it. I wish I would have done the same at 18.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:01:29
I hear ya. Well, I'm going to go ahead and try to organize something. Hopefully you can attend! I'll send you the details when I figure things out.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:51:31
Coinbase is reasonable if you aren't investing a lot of money. It's a fun hobby for me - I don't invest more than I can afford to lose. If you keep with that mindset the in the cryptocurrency world, you'll be fine. You might even make a few dollars as the world begins to see the value in the technology. Good luck!

I'm really curious when/if there will be any replay protection implemented. I'd really like to dump the alt and throw that back into BTC but it's not worth the risk currently if there is real risk.
