The twins have their own index, winkdex.

Yeah, tbh I don't really know why they are using the auction now. Because in older news (when they first started proposing an ETF) they were planning to use the winkdex

Miners mine for profit not because they'd believe they'll get some kind of award for supporting the good cause. Bitcoin is a free market through and through which is good, they do what they have to.

for cold storage both trezor and ledger are easy, and for software electrum is the classic but i have to say i really like jaxx. jaxx even has a customer service that actually replies (even on reddit) even though the app is free.

That's mass production pricing right? I wonder if it's a ready-made package from the dnm.

From comments 


The banks are removing &amp; keeping lodgements to accounts, of not abnormal amounts, by calling them "unjust enrichment".
For example, a customer lodges a normal sum to their account, but perhaps doesn't usually lodge any money beyond their salary.
The teller asks "What is this money, where did it come from?"
Client responds, "It's mine, it didn't come from anywhere", for example.
Or, perhaps it's a family loan been repaid, considered personal, or savings, the client might reply, "It's just money I had".
Banks have been known to remove &amp; keep the funds, where the client is told they may be expected to prove a source, which can be impossible.
It's a presumption of guilt in completey normal circumstances, rather than presumption of normality or innocence. 
(What is there even to be innocent of? The bank's Kafka courts do not even need a charge to do this.)
Unjust enrichment, jesus h christ.

Yes it does. I opened a support ticket when my withdrawal was refused for "insufficient balance" several times in a row. The support person informed me that withdrawals out of the WirexApp are not possible because of security settings on behalf of the wallet provider (BitGo) which you cannot change but the dev team knows about it, and that it "sometimes works" with larger amounts but "sometimes not". 
Look, I don't think you're scammers but your service is just not functioning well. It wasn't a lot of money so I am not going to waste any more time on this but I just found the experience outrageous.
