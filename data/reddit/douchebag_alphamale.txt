The government wouldn't deem this too big to fail... Mt. Gox. had what, *maybe* 1 billion in bitcoins at most? I'm too lazy to look it up, it's probably less. Yeah, analogy does not fit well. Too big to fail is literally is when you have financial institutions that are so intertwined that it would fuck up the entire economy. Bitcoin really does no such thing, as it is internet play money and has no effects to the economy.

There is no worthy distinction. If you believe the man-made part is a "hypothesis", then you are just as good as a denier when it comes to actually taking steps to improve the situation.

You would still be incredibly stupid to think climate change is NOT man-made. It is not a hypothesis. A hypothesis is, "I think aliens exist". A fact is truth and has widespread support from the overwhelming majority of scientists, and is able to be proven.

Climate change is not a hypothesis. It's a fact. To think otherwise is to willfully ignore all evidence and the vast majority of climate scientists.
