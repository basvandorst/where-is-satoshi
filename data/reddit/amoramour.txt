I watch their video (comment below) you need to meet the seller. I'm looking for a 100% online transaction. Maybe that will be my next project :)

Definitely useful. Thanks!

This is an excellent, well thought out intro. I'll send anyone who asks me for more info about bitcoin here now :)

OMG that's what you product after buying shrooms with bitcoin on the darknet... I'm guessing

Thanks, I'll be paid in btc. I prefer to convert from btc to AUD, then from USD to AUD.

I've read about them. Have you tried? Why are they good?

If I would run it for 24 hours, I would plan to do the installing + chain downloading beforehand, so it's ready to go on the dot.

Keep going! Nice job. Be persistent, patient and HODL :)

There are always going to be fanatics on either side of the coin (pun intended). I'm glad I'm not alone in being moderate.

Where do your customers buy bitcoin? If they're using it at your business, they buy it somewhere. If you receive payments in bitcoin, why also not sell it? The exchange gets a fee for converting your bitcoin into dollars, the exchange gets a fee for selling bitcoins to your customers. There's a business opportunity to bypass the exchange. People who want to trade should have exchange accounts. Making bitcoin available to buy at the point of sale, would make it easier to get bitcoin, which IMO is still the biggest roadblock for general population adoption.

The point would be to bypass the exchange altogether.

That's what I was thinking. It would be like getting "cash out" from a merchant, only it would go to a bitcoin wallet.

I agree that earning bitcoin would help.

Awesome! Hope it's recorded :)
