The fact that you’re on r/bitcoin talking about “old money” social circles is hilarious in itself. OP fits in this subreddit social circle more than you do in my opinion.

Bitcoin is in fact “new money” bruv..

Think about the scenario you just described. 
A person smart enough to amass a sizable amount of btc. Purchase a cold storage wallet BUT who is also incapable of of securing it properly or too broke to purchase a safe.... ?

I’m sure I cleared at least 40lbs of chocolate by the time I was 7 bruv so 1 million can’t be too far off..

I ask myself this question more and more frequently and I honestly don't know. Definitely Talk to an accountant and a lawyer. Without going into detail, let me just say that your talking to someone who got into BTC for all the wrong reasons.. so with that being said, just know that The last thing I want at this point is unwanted federal attention.

That has been my goal since I was a sophomore in college 3 years ago. One year out and It's finally become a possibility for me. BUT even if I did that today, I'd still be a poor college graduate with no job... and much less btc... sooo Sallie Mae gonna have to hodl on a lil bit longer
