The more shitcoins there are that rise and fail, the more ammunition the financial elite have to use against us, instead of concentrating efforts together on one technology or a few technologies to take them down. 
Bcash is unequivocally a hostile fork. It is not anything like ETH or LTC who contribute something unique and their sole purpose is not to dethrone BTC. BCASH is riding the cotails of the work of others from the past 10 years and has the temerity to try and steal its name. Inb4 THAT'S HOW FORKS WORK. Most forks don't try steal the name of the predecessor. There's at least respect for the previous work.

I think you know and I know why bcashers justify it — money. The free coins from the hard fork. No one wants to invest from scratch in another crypto. Why do that when you can copy btc's 9 year old blockchain and reap the rewards for nothing spent? Would bcash have such ardent defenders if they weren't given free coins? You know the answer.

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:09:45
No, the reasonable question you should be asking is why the biggest exchanges, with coinbase being the biggest offender, aren't yet supporting segwit. The changes segwit makes are mostly invisible to the end user besides their new btc address beginning with prefix of 3. Focusing on the desktop core wallet is asinine and if you're more concerned by that than the biggest exchanges adoption segwit, then you're nothing more than a concern troll and or lying about possessing no bcash. You and others like you have probably never downloaded the core app yet here you are moaning on about it. I download it once in 2013 when I started mining, found a better wallet, and never used it again. Most new users don't even know it exists. Adding the gui won't change the largest exchanges adopting it. If you don't think so I'd love to make a bet with you on it. 
The shit talk is necessary because that user in particular and many others come here from r btc and say the exact same shit every. fucking. time. I even have them tagged already. I guess we should hop on over there and annoy them about scaling, asic boost, chinese centralisation and so forth. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:04:50

It's not just anecdotal; you haven't offered any actual proof. Come back when you have proof. You're talking about what we call delicatessens in Australia. You're also speaking nebulously in terms of crypto in general, not bcash. I told you I wanted proof bcash is offered as a form of payment at these places. Why isn't your friend taking pictures of this supposed bcash support? Surely they'd want to show it off? Easy karma at r btc, no?


You should know that coinbase has a minimum for how much bcash you can withdraw/send from your coinbase bch wallet. The same wallet Ver recommends users keep their coin stored at. This isn't a temporary problem. They have a hard minimum of what you're allowed to send.


This isn't your sub, you clown.

Apparently they have so few devs they have to *prioritise*. Smaller exchanges and even single devs managed to add it without much fanfare. Weird that with coinbase being the largest crypto exchange in the world — it couldn't allocate sufficient dev time to it. Are you trying to imply adding BCH trading was less of a task than segwit? Don't make me laugh. 
Clearly you know more about the inner workings of coinbase. You're probably even an employee. Are you? Or maybe you're the same guy who got busted the other day telling people he had a friend at CB giving him advance info on the BCH launch? Maybe you're the guy he's talking about?

The reference implementation is already in the bitcoin core fucking code available to all the exchanges and wallets and also with wallets and exchanges who already deployed it. You're getting your panties in a wad because it's not available in the form of a GUI in a piece of software no one uses. 


Uh, the LN?


Wooosh. I was talking about monetary profit in the context of development time. Just because you're unpaid doesn't mean you can't prioritise. In fact, it's precisely because of not being paid that grants them the permission to prioritise.


What? A reference implementation in a desktop application's GUI to then be used on a mobile app or website? How have the other exchanges and wallets it's already available on managed without this gold standard reference implementation you infer as being required of how best to display and manage a segwit address? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:55:46

@_date: 2017-12-23 14:29:51






Do you ever listen to yourself? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:02:07


What percentage of bitcoin users do you believe uses the bitcoin core wallet on desktop? Enough to justify your claim that it's a "*huge problem*"? Because that sounds like ***serious*** hyperbole to me. I'd argue those who do use the core desktop wallet are likely those to be technically proficient enough to do so and would have no issues with using its CLI over the gui. Newbies sure as shit aren't using it. The hoardes of people buying in at the ATH aren't using it because they're using coinbase's app. 


No one is doing this because the majority of people use software wallets on their phone or use hardware wallets.
You're trying to make out a minuscule non event into a big issue. You talk about it being profitable for cb to add bch, well it's also more profitable for the core team to focus on other more important issues rather than adding segwit to the gui. Exchanges and mobile software wallets are the parties who need to get on board for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:31:05




Because you were granted it at the hard fork. It's not like you went out and purchased bcash. You wouldn't champion it or give a fuck about it if you weren't granted an equal amount of bcash with your btc holdings upon the hard fork. If you truly believed in BTC in the first place you would have sold your bcash holdings and exchanged it to BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:49:35
[Coinbase had this roadmap 4 days ago.]( Everyone was under the assumption (as per coinbase's official document) they wouldn't be adding trade support for bcash, simply allowing withdrawals of bcash. They seemingly coordinated its surprise trading release when the mining reward difficulty shifted in favour of bcash. Also coincided with bitmain's new release of miners available only with a bcash purchase. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:16:57
It simply isn't necessary. There's far more important issues to focus their limited development time on. If they ran their own mobile software wallet I would agree with you, but they don't. Those with the technical acumen to use the desktop app are fine with cli. It's not going to change adoption of segwit as no one uses the desktop app. 
You're jumping on the most minuscule of issues because you're a rabid btrash shill. The only reason I'd want them to bother is to shut up the vertrash shills like yourself, but even then you'd find something else to bitch about.

This is not. Can you explain how a transaction is 'unreliable'? Are you inferring that transactions fail? What exactly do you mean?


So, you're saying bitcoin's success is contingent upon its ability to be converted into fiat as fast as possible? You have no interest in paying btc for items and only holding it as a store of value?

Not to mention Coinbase's BCH debacle of not releasing them to its users as yet who were silly enough to keep their coins on an exchange.

Just flair them all. It's what I do. Though their sub-given flair is always a giveaway. Not sure why they love their week old alt accounts so much.

Cool, so you buy bcash. Everyone adopts it. Then what? How are you going to scale? Who is going to do the dev? If bcash has such low fees — why the fuck can't I withdraw 20 bucks of it from coinbase and I'm being told I have insufficient funds to withdraw?

You should be asking why they aren't promoting digibyte over btrash and the answer is simple: bcash gave them free coins.

OK, fine. Excuse me for my incredulity and scepticism. Sorry. The last trade from MtGox @ bitcoinwisdom was **09:59:06 GMT+0800.**
It's now **11:26:37 GMT+0800** and there hasn't been a trade since.

Excellent synopsis! A++ would upboat again.
But seriously, how the hell did she get from looking up historical genealogy records to emailing a model train company? This is the huge gap which bothers me.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:47:04




Pot meet kettle!
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:32:39


I've been asking this too. I thought I was alone in my suspicion. That is a huge stretch, from looking through genealogy records, to then finding the exact company he purchases model trains from?? My only explanation is that after she determined the existence of Dorian Nakamoto; she went on a googling spree and found his interest for model trains. But the white elephant in the room is: how would she convince a hobby shop owner to give up the email address of one of his clients?? She's committed some *serious* fraud, there.

Not op, but I do, how then can I create a BCH equivalent wallet from my BTC private keys?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:02:01
So from what I've just read on btc talk we simply wait for a BCH software wallet to be made available, import our private BTC key[s] and then sell from that wallet off to whoever will buy it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:42:43
Try this, it worked for me. [How to get your private keys from blockchain.info to import it into something like Mycelium]( Not sure how then to turn it into BCH, though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:11:52
It does. It also supports credit card purchases from Australia. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:39:25
So, who managed to hold onto their BCH this whole time and didn't immediately dump it like my retarded self?

You're stuck in the denial/anger phase. Be glad you'll get to buy a shit ton at 1k or 2k. The technology isn't going away but the price needs to — for now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:41:07
I'll stick to brevity. There's a bottom and we're far from reaching it. Some think 3k is the minimum we'll go to. I think it's 2k or even worse 1k. That's when you buy 20. The price has dropped 30% this week and 10% in just one day today. If it gets to 3k you're also going to see a lot of alts crumble and for those that don't theymay topple btc from the top. I can assure you that it won't be btrash.

My favourite thing about coinbase is being able to purchase with CC. But they limit it to 500 USD. Are there any other Australian  exchanges who permit CC for purchasing BTC? I haven't found any.

We're going to 2k, maybe even 1k. 10% wiped off over the past 24 hours, 30% the past week. You're all pawns to the day traders who don't give a shit about long term price, just daily gains. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:49:21
Damn, nice! What exactly were the increments like from 500 to 2000? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:39:58
I haven't found any Australian exchanges that allow purchase of BTC with credit card as the payment method. Coinbase allows me to purchase up to 500 USD of BTC with a  credit card.
