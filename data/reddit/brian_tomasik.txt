Thanks for your generosity! I'd recommend the [Effective Altruism Foundation]( which accepts Bitcoin on their [donation page]( (in step 2, "Payment").
The Effective Altruism Foundation does many different activities toward the goal of reducing as much suffering as possible on the part of people, animals, and future beings. For example, one of their projects raises money from poker players to donate to the most effective charities in global health, animal welfare, and risks from future technologies. Since 2014, this work has generated about €3 million in donations to effective charities for a tiny fraction of that cost to run the project.
(Disclosure: I volunteer for and give advice to the research division of the Effective Altruism Foundation.)

Your generosity is awesome! One charity I support is the UK [Humane Slaughter Association]( which does research on less painful methods of killing animals for food. I think their work is especially important in the case of fish, since most fish that humans harvest are asphyxiated to death with no prior stunning. At least 1 trillion fish are killed per year for food (which is more than 100 times the human population), so the potential impact of reductions in the painfulness of fish slaughter is staggering.

It's a question of what's most pragmatic/realistic for reducing the most suffering per dollar. Large-scale welfare improvements may be more leveraged than convincing a small additional fraction of the population to go veg.
