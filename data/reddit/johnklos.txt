x86 is little endian, too. Do you think that building Bitcoin on x86 is problematic?
I don't know about building on VMS on VAX, but I doubt it can be done. I'm not sure what the most recent VAX gcc on VMS is, but I know it'd have to be recent to support C++11, which is required. I couldn't imagine why it couldn't be built on BSD on VAX, though.

github is linked from various bitcoin.org pages:
The "Source code" link points to:
One might be forgiven for seeking tarballs from Github. Personally, I don't like Github's packaging option. So it seems the issue was that the tarball came from Github.
If it were me, I would NOT link to Github on the download page for source. Github is not source - it's a web site. I'd have a Github link which is labelled a Github link, and the source link would link to either the source tarball or the list of files (source tarball and checksums).
Wait - what's bitcoincore.org? Why is it different than bitcoin.org? (I know what it is, but you can see how this can get confusing and how people might not necessarily trust files from three different places. Oh - add Sourceforge - we're up to four.)

Thank you. This makes sense, except for one part:
pkgsrc-wip is still on 0.13.1. The distinfo size and checksum information matches the tarball from a while ago (November, 2016) - I know because I built bitcoin on other machines with no complaints. This means that one of two things happened:
• bitcoin-0.13.1.tar.gz was changed on bitcoin.org recently
• a different bitcoin-0.13.1.tar.gz was used to make pkgsrc-wip's checksums and that specific source tarball was uploaded to a distfiles mirror, and that was what was downloaded and worked in the past.
I have to find a machine which has bitcoin installed and has an intact bitcoin-0.13.1.tar.gz to see for myself. In the meanwhile, I emailed the maintainers of the package.
I really hope it wasn't updated on bitcoin.org, because that would be scary.
