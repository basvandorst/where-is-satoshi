Interesting question. I will need to ponder that one. Personally, this whole blocksize schism is making me nervous. I wish a conservative compromise (4-8 MB) could gain traction and proceed forward without talk of a breakup.

Author did not explain why it is a ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme, but nice headline anyway.  These knuckleheads like to pontificate on a nascent technology as if it has already reached its full potential and use model.  Meanwhile I'll just keep buying my bitcoins.  A little more each week.  Wonder when the author will buy his first one?

I think that people would be more comfortable if a concrete contingency plan were developed AHEAD of time in case the "bump" into the into the 1MB limit turns out to be more problematic than you are predicting.  Not having a strategy upfront seems like an unnecessary risk.

I hope you are right.  Bitcoin is tenuous enough without these additional uncertainty factors being added to the mix.

You are the only one talking about price.  Fear mongering?

If that is the case then the core dev group needs to prepare some sort of document to ease the minds of the community.  In effect saying, don't worry, we've got this.  If X happens related to blocksize limitation we are prepared to do Y.  Right now the impression is that it is a big cluster****

There is merit in much of what you say, however the initial choice of 1MB was arbitrary and is obviously becoming a shortcoming for the future growth of the network.  A higher cap seems to be necessary even if it were only a doubling to 2MB to allow time for alternate payment channels to develop.   Personally, I haven't heard a compelling argument that contradicts the bump to 21MB except for potential unintended affects that could possibly occur.  To use your medical analogy, we don't want to wait until the patient is on life support to perform surgery.

The possibility of many devices having a bitcoin interface capability built in to them should be exciting to those of us who want bitcoin to thrive.  
I think that most people will not mind their device doing some hashing when plugged in, even if they are theoretically losing money on the electricity cost.  
I could imagine a case where your phone is aware of your bitcoin balance and can ask you to add more bitcoin (of your own) to perform various tasks and functions.  
There is more  promise here than most are allowing themselves to conceive by getting stuck on the economics of mining.

21 MB.  Gives BTC some room to grow!
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:39:46
21 MB please.  Make it snappy.

I had a similar experience.  They started asking questions about my source of income and when I expressed some displeasure with the line of questioning my account was frozen.  I guess my "crime" was accumulating bitcoins from a US checking account.  I hope their CEO knows what a bunch of Jackasses they have working customer service.  I used to think highly of the company, but they have lost one customer here and I'm not returning.

Take a look at the 30 day chart instead of the 12 hour.  I think it paints a pretty nice picture.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:36:39
Me too.  I just can't help it.  Who wants to keep spare value in dollars anymore with the rate they are printing money.   Keep averaging down in BTC, someday this thing will pop!!!

I'm at 90% as well and I'm no spring chicken (50).  Guess what, all roads lead to the graveyard, why not have some fun, take some risks.  Bitcoin is a once in a lifetime binary roulette wheel investment.  Red comes up and you lose all your money.  Black comes up and you get 20X your money.  Gentlemen, place your bets!
