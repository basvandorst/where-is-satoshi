I dealt in that are (mortgages and banks) and saw obvious massive fraud that the Fed, Thrift Supervision and comptroller of the currency deliberately turned a blind eye to. Geithner and Holder (bankers best friends) actively discouraged investigations and criminal charges. Source: Read "Bailout" by the TARP IG. You way, way understate fraud and corruption.

I thought the whole American banking system, including JP Morgan, had to be bailed out at tax payer expense and the QE used to do most of it is still on the books. If Dimon ran a SuperCuts he'd be bankrupt. Bank CEOs are all about connections, donations and bailouts.

We're talking housing. Many people pay whatever the going rate is even if it's bubble inflated. Like food.

The housing bubble created by the FED was huge. Homeowners couldn't escape the tide. And now the central bank has apparently combined an internet bubble and housing bubble. Maybe you see Trump's election and collapse of the two parties as a normal thing but how this plays out won't be pretty and the banks brought us to this point.

How about people retiring in 10 years? Apparently you don't work for a pension fund. And QE was used to take over the secondary mortgage market for the benefit of banks. Now the taxpayers own it and they have to price out young adults from housing.

How do you explain banks then?
