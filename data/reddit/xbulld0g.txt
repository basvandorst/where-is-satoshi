SOLVED. Repaired my wallet.
Only problem is that i went from 24$ when sending from local bitcoins, down to 18.95. 
Much fee; such wow?
Anyway, thank you all for the help!!

can you suggest some good ways. Been doing some website/free btc, but they offer in so low amounts that it will take weeks even to make a dollar it seems.
@_date: 2016-10-22 10:37:12
It also says its unconfirmed. 
My bitcoins is in some type of limbo, but how do i get'em in my wallet? Or is it me just being retarded and the money is in the wallet

Yes, it is the 3rd. But it says i have no money in my wallet, and the other money (the transaction) is unconfirmed money. Do you suggest me to just wait or?
