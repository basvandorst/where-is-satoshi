hahaha lol
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:36:20
You really dont know what your talking about.  Hodling gives value.
Here Mr retailer please take this thing that i want rid off...... ?
check out 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:42:12
The OG bitcoiners are still here, ;)  ignore the price people it about how bitcoin can change things.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:10:35
been here since 2013, calm as fuck right now.... this is going to 100k eventually.... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:19:11
Never go full no-coiner, you will surely regret it in 10 years.   
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:17:40
Try to educate your self more, if you fully understand what your talking about it is usually really easy to convince others that bitcoin is the better money.  Use examples of things they already know to make it easy and show how our current money is a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:13:59
I feel some of your frustrations but at this point an increase to 2mb would be pointless it would fill almost instantly and we would be right back where we are now.  We need to be patient, Bitcoin can never compete with visa for on chain transactions.  we need it to remain secure and censorship resistant.  that is what is currently important.  I dont know a single person that currently wants or needs to make retail transactions with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:21:59
it doesn't really matter what we think about ETF's they are coming no matter.  Run your own node that you use is the best way for the average person to do their bit. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:02:08
Bitcoin works best when everyone is selfish and looking out for their own self interest.  If bitcoin needs to rely on goodwill then we are done. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:27:25
Of course it's in there self interest, if they don't include transactions then that damages the reliability of  bitcoin.  Which In turn damages the price of a bitcoin which means ultimately they mine for less.  Surly they want confirmation of transactions as quickly as possible, it's very short sighted if they can't see that
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:31:43
no great mate, but let this be a good learning curve for ya.  :)

Do you not think elaon put in a lot of sleepless nights making his fortune?
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:52:04
it sounds like you need to make sure that port 8333 is open.   you need to go into your router settings and port forward that specific port. you should then be able to provide block info to other nodes.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:20:00
Agreed, i told my brother to buy in, in jan 2014 just before Mtgox exploded and bitcoin crashed.  but he trusted me when i told him it would come back and now he is delighted :)
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:31:10
More like get ready for War,  any country that tried this in the last 30 years has soon found themselves on the wrong end of an invasion......

@_date: 2017-02-15 14:31:33
if your thinking of holding long term then i would buy now, because long term its gona rise,  short term i dont know what you should do :(
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:08:03
I sneezed and got the flu Virus on my Paperwallet one day, wow it was a close one but the bitcoin are all still there.
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:35:21
lol :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:14:03
contact police straight away, 
@_date: 2016-01-31 09:53:29
i think i read somewhere that storj when finally ready will be set up to encourage smaller farmers and discourage mega farms, so as not to centralise storage.  i put a £100 in to a 5TB drive for testing, but if it all goes pear shaped i will still have a useful 5TB drive, i doubt the average joe has much use  for a 240TB drive other than for a business use.  I would seriously consider a wait and see approach on this, especially now as only 25TB is rewarded per address 
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:34:30
Yeah they didnt do it for the community, they all need to stick together on this one or they stand to lose their shit....... Bitcoin is working as planned, its driven by greed.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:26:57
why on earth would you wanna waste your bitcoin on Gold....... lol :)
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:03:04
i would say that this is vital, if they ever manage to change the 21 million cap, i am outa here......
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:20:58
Yeah i think ETF rejection will effect price to the downside but noway by that much,  its not that big a deal :(
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:59:54
Bitcoin guy just taking a break.........:)
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:24:34
I really do believe that bitcoin has been infiltrated by those who want to see it fail.  We need to stick together and one thing we should never do is break consensus. Forcing something through is not right.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:47:31
totally agreed ......:)
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:41:44
:) so true
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:43:26
I sold half my ETH, But that was an easy decision.....lol ;)

Or in their quest to destroy it, China, Russia and US make the network even more secure fighting it out in the  ,;)   beware declaring bitcoin dead, it has a nasty habit of making people look silly.

this is spiffing my old boy!!!!

Only worrying when you dont understand the numbers involved...... its nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:36:31
IN My opinion buying in now is still a good buy,  buy 2020 the next halving we could be looking back at a £1000 as a steal.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:51:39
no lets moon now....:)
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:52:31
Totally agreed, lets all make this work by discussing the issues not banning opinions on them.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:38:57
wow....impressed 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:41:26
why is 0.14 not showing up in Bitcoincore.org releases ?

Giving away your bitcoin for a beer is a shame,  i use worthless fiat for that.

I followed the advise of an idiot who said the same about ethereum, it cost me a fortune.  Take advice but make your own decision. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 19:20:31
Get the coin moved asap, i wouldnt even say my seed words around my phone
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:22:18
Satoshi is dead
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:01:53
go to bitcoin.org and read all the info you can there.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:46:45
whys he wasting bitcoin buying game....... thats what useless fiat is for.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:54:55
call me cynical, but a 16 yr old got given a whack of bitcoin this morning when he posted about buying his 1st BTC.......... he posted his address and a guy doubled it. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:25:00
wallets need custom fees.....now
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:31:51
or just send them over to me and ill look after them for you...... :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:04:06
Buy the dip they said.......... "What Dip"
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:56:57
also great if your using an spv wallet that you can connect to your own node to validate.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:19:05
just print a paper wallet from Bitaddress.org 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:06:38
Nothing to be worried about, this is game theory in full flow,  dont worry about what you cant control, do your bit for what you feel is the right way to go and if majority of users agree we will win if not then so be it, remember Bitcoin is still an experiment. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:01:22
Thats my point when the majority of users decide on a consensus then that is what it is, it cant be changed by big corporates. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:36:56
is that his name ?
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:05:38
What you talking about the transaction is confirmed ???? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:38:28
Never sell the dip....... 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:24:03
That is a no these days,  even if a website  (faucet) did give you pennis it would be worthless to you.  Fees mean that it would not be financially viable to move them.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:33:13
Thats because he was Satoshi and wanted to return to see the last bitcoin mined in 2140. :)  and use his stash off course
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:42:26
I think the powers that be try to co-opt bitcoin and using it for there purpose.  Who ever controls the concensus rules controls it so i would expect to see that as the attack vector.    
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:11:20
I am gona name my Node........ "Bad Motherfucker"....lol
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:18:34
i thought he was fully using bitcoin until the other day he tweeted something about a bitcache ICO, that would be really disappointing 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:06:12
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:53:17
This is why i dont keep all my bitcoin in one place, even on a HW wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:46:18
No its not, someone is creating an altcoin
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:16:19
If the transaction dosnt get mined into a block it automatically appears back at the address like it was never sent, technically it never was sent if its not mined.  i am unsure of how long it takes exactly to drop out of the mempool but it could be up to a week.  at this time until segwit kicks in it is is important to pay a good fee to make sure transactions confirm, but if they are not important it is fine to pay a standard fee and wait a few days.....
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:08:13
my problem with big blocks is the fact that eventually i will be unable to run a node which means i will eventually have no say over which concensus rules are used which means that the big data centres storing the blockchain become the new banks.  
they could change any rule they wanted including introducing more coins (inflation) or changing past transactions and in a world which no longer has cash they could block and stop your bitcoin transactions......... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:31:40
I remember buying that amount for $15 ....... oh why didn't i buy more lololololol
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:37:20
Its not that, Hodlers dont care, Wake me up at $50,000 so i can watch it rise to $100,000. :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:04:52
just hodl, never let that bitcoin go :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:32:41
what wallet you moving it from ?  current fee is at least 53 sat per byte..... 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:50:46
why's it an attack?  i have been moving some bitcoin around for 2sats/byte,  its been getting confirmed.  This is great :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:08:07
Its Theymos, he is to blame for them dastardly satellites 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:41:12
Well done ........ Legend :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:36:52
..... was quite, but for the knocking of the bitcoin blockchain every 10mins moving forward no matter the drama.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:30:39
if they are on an exchange then all you own is an IOU,  so if they where hacked your bitcoin are gone.  hardware wallet or even a paper wallet.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:27
I think that it will be cheaper to move to a segwit address once more people are using them, because there will be more space per block.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:56:42
Thats cause we have been infiltrated by the criminal banking/ Government.  and they are trying to either gain control of bitcoin or destroy it in the process.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:27:27
nice :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:42:07
dollar cost averaging works well in the stock market but for bitcoin its pretty bad, better off investing all you are ever gona invest in one go and HODL
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:25:00
Hodling just 1BTC is a massive achivement so well done on getting 2
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:18:45

1. When GMaxwell throws exceptions, it’s across the room.
2. All arrays GMaxwell declares are of infinite size, because GMaxwell knows no bounds.
3. GMaxwell doesn’t have disk latency because the hard drive knows to hurry the hell up.
4. GMaxwell writes code that optimizes itself.
5. GMaxwell can’t test for equality because he has no equal.
6. GMaxwell doesn’t use web standards as the web will conform to him.
7. “It works on my machine” always holds true for GMaxwell .
8.GMaxwell can delete the Recycling Bin.
9.GMaxwell  doesn’t bug hunt as that signifies a probability of failure, he goes bug killing
10.When GMaxwell  is web surfing websites get the message “Warning: Internet Explorer has deemed this user to be malicious or dangerous. Proceed?”.

@_date: 2015-11-04 11:14:52
How do you avoid the fee if using bits, for example.  if i want to send 0.0009 do i not still have to pay a 0.001 transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:26:52
ME neither........
and for buyers stay away from coinbase, use local bitcoins

Agreed, i  sold some shitcoin called eth, hoping to make more bitcoin and it nver went down again either....... problem is when it goes down it prob not coming back up :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:20:55
they can do as many backroom deals that they want, its about how many people run and use the software.  Bitfury and Bitgo are prob trying to do their best to come to an agreement.

i agree at this stage the 2mb thing is really a piece offering.  Segwit now and a HF if and when its needed, like this shit aint rocket science..... :)

whys it not recommended?  i go BU hunting through my peers all the time. :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:38:04
it can fall but not as easily, Hodlers aint never gona sell low, so every time there is a drop weak hands get droped and strong hodlers take the coins
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:16:19
If we get segwit then happy days :)  a few years ago no one thought that a HF to increase the block size was a no go.....  now we have people (mostly noobs who have very little bitcoin) shouting never, never , never HF.... 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:53:31
I hope this aint a bubble, cause i want to buy more.....:)  if ive learnt anything over the last 3 years its only buy on the way down.  
although to be honest "some day i believe the whole world will want bitcoin"  and at that stage $400 is gona look dirt cheap...... :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:43:56
Havn't a fucking clue what this means, but i'll bet it's fucking brilliant.  :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:11:44
Their incompetence is bad enough, but to try and blame it on Bitcoin network congestion, when there is none is just deceitful.
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:49:41
Yes the coins will be returned, the only problem i found with this is that other nodes my still know about the transaction and will tell your node again about it.  so it could show up again in 24hrs.  that is why you have to send your bitcoin to a fresh address, (basically causing a double spend) this way the 1st transaction will never be valid and the 2nd transaction will be confirmed.  
dont worry there is no way of lossing your coin here and its a good way to play about with the system. :)

@_date: 2017-05-16 11:41:09
Your problem is actually one of Bitcoins strong points, it's resistance to change.  Most Alts can change anything about them at the the wim of the lead developer.  Not good for sound money.

@_date: 2015-11-07 21:33:53
my advise is go else where, that has been the problem over the last 100 years people unwilling to "go else where" when they get a service there not happy with.  especially with banks.  if your not happy take your business to someone else. if everyone did this there would be alot less shitty service about.  Their not the only ones trading bitcoin you know?

@_date: 2017-07-16 03:03:51
Noob alert....... you haven't been around here long, have you ?  i will buy all the bitcoin you on for a cent on the dollar. ;) better that than getting nothing
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:02:43
This command bitcoin-qt.exe -zapwallettxes
 will make the transaction disapper from your node.  then just send out a 2nd transaction with bigger fee.
PS: you can never lose your bitcoin in limbo, only if you sent to a wrong address or something. 
EDIT: your node will rescan after, nothing to worry about
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:59:29
Why did you sell ?  nobody should buying bitcoin unless they believe in the tech, eventually it will be worth far more.  And also seems to me that those that panic sell have invested why more than they are willing to lose.  HODL
@_date: 2015-10-10 07:26:58
I know the feeling, I heard max keiser talking about bitcoin when it was really cheap like 10p for one or something like that.  If only ......;)  I'm still buying myself as I reckon long term it will challenge the existing highs set in 2013.

Hate to say mate but unless you find the private key on one of them usb stick then the bitcoin is gone, if you have written over i would guess they are gone forever,  its an expensive lesson, but you should have secured them better.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:09:18
Cheers man
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:55:00
Just for the record, i love bitcoin and didn't sell cause i wanted to, but the stress of holding since 2013 and buying through 2014-15 has finally been released....... :) so relaxed now.... popcorn time, i hope that selling some bitcoin yesterday was the worst financial trade i ever made.......  ;)
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:33:29

@_date: 2017-06-21 16:27:31
This to me is why we need to start using bits as the main terminology..... people tend to not like using anything more than 2 zeros after the decimal.

@_date: 2017-06-13 14:33:51
Blockchain.info only shows transactions with a certain fee size, if its to low it wont show up, try another block explorer. 
have you got the TXID ?
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:39:27
Are companies now just calling bitcoin , Blockchain?  i think in the future thats what will happen, everyone will be using blockchain but it will bascially be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:40:23
Totally agree with everything you said ;)  Think im gona take 6 months out and come back December, by then we will either be at new ATH or in the middle of another winter...... see you on the other side :)

:)  not joking if you have the chance everyone should do this,   such stress relief.  popcorn time, i love bitcoin.....

Not a chance i already give him a fortune
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:42:16
Some block explorer nodes will not show transactions that pay a small fee.  Your fee isnt bad so i would guess it will get confirmed
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:45:45
noob, you are obviously new here.....lol  you'll buy back at $5000 and prob sell again at $4000 only to buy in again at $10000.... by then i you will have probably learnt your lesson.......HODL
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:29:01
Best place for advice like this is 
Bitcointalk is great for help reddit ok too but not the best.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:37:45

your sorted either way, just enjoy life my friend....:)
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:15:51
Thanks man, i totally agree with you.  I was worried about the blocksize debate recently and just thought lets get original investment back, and hopefully i can relax.. i was right :)  i think that bitcoin could easily hit $100,000 in the next 10 years and probably more,  now it has cost me nothing to be part of that experience, well apart from time.... i'm obsessed with bitcoin .....lol 
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:34:19
i paid more at bitstamp the other night than i would have at localbitcoins......;(
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:46:52
Yeah but now i can relax, happy with that, i am more than happy with 88% of my original holding if it goes where i think its going ;)  ....... ill still retire a happyman

;)  actually it was 99 sats ...... lol

Are you fundamentally against ever HF for bigger block size ?  If yes then why?  genuine question.  I get why it would be dangerous currently to have massive blocks and the centralisation thing, but what about in the future?

Obviously, where i live..... most people have never heard of bitcoin, i have to pay my bills in fiat.

ahh the slaying of bearwhale was epic, and well done for buying back in.  i remember then thinking i was late to the show, only relising now how much of an early adopter i was also.  
i have to be honest though and i owe him a few beers for this but andreas antonopolous and his vision of what bitcoin could be, kept me hodling all these years... only recently with the scaling debate have i thought of getting some out..... glad i did now and can relax.  all the best for the future and see you 2030 for the 2nd wave bitcoin millionaires party ..... :)

Nope ,,,,,, wrong its not your bitcoin on less you control the private key..... if you dont even know what that is then you got some reading to do.
short term exposure to the exchange is fine if your trading, but not for storing.
