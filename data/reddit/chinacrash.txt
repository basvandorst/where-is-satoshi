If you support increasing the number of transactions you should go to one of the numerous forks that do that and leave pure bitcoin alone!
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:24:36
At that point, it will just be called bitcoin.

Except that bitcoin is open source software. So anyone can create a private coin and make those tokens freely tradable with bitcoin. Which means there isn't any benefit to controlling bitcoin since it can't be used to restrict trade.
If someone wanted to invent a payment system that encourages political control, fiat is much better because the need for banks to handle risk management creates pressure points that can be leveraged or regulated in order to deny access to the payment system. These structures don't exist (and won't) on bitcoin because there is no risk in accepting payment.

I feel 8MB blocks would push the price over 2000 USD quickly.

Capable people always assume what is obvious to them is obvious to others. Satoshi was ideological, but he wouldn't have put a roadblock in front of bitcoin adoption. It took the introduction of developers who weren't involved before 2013 to do that....

Where is my choice of Core-provided segwit-supporting &gt;1 MB non-witness blocksize code?
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:07:40


Yes. Because I already hold the tokens and using the network would be much cheaper and faster than using the segwit fork version. I would probably hold rather than sell segcoin to see if the developers could actually pull off getting users and build something of value though.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:04:39
I will be seilling segbit to purchase more bitcoin if there is anyone still buying the minority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:44:12
Seems unlikely there will be a fork at all with BU. Assuming the miners come to strong consensus, there won't be anyone left mining on the old chain. A couple of blocks might be found, but anyone who is serious about mining for profit isn't going to want to devote significant hash power to supporting something that is clearly in the extreme minority &lt; 20% hash support.
Very practically, maybe Bitfury or BTCC might continue to mine the old chain out of spite, but at that point it would be silly for exchanges or businesses to support it as they would be susceptible to a 51% attack from the only miner on the network.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:22:09
if? the only roadmap to segwit activation is an 8 MB hf offering from Core, which has about the same the likelihood as the Germans pulling off a surprise 1945 victory.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:32:42
OP is describing a situation in which nodes flip back and forth, in which case both chains are by definition following acceptable consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:33:25
If the nodes are flipping back and forth between chains then both chains are valid by definition.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:47:14
Your earlier understanding is correct.
OP is describing how bitcoin has always worked. The longest chain of blocks is definitive. BU does not make it be easier for people to create malicious transactions and it is no more likely that blocks will be orphaned under BU than under Core. And for double-spends? custom coding is required regardless and those are frankly much easier to pull-off with the child-pays-for-parent feature in the Core roadmap.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:28:15
They're likely averaging total costs of sending transactions with higher fees across all outgoing ones -- doesn't make sense to calculate fees needed on an individual transaction basis, especially since users can't be guaranteed a single input transaction. And you have to make the user aware of the fee before sending too -- bitcoin isn't supposed to force people to have to check UTXO state manually in order to do business.
Will all be much better once we have scaled and businesses and users don't need to worry about this at all. Months not years now.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:36:42
Who is blocking it? 
Most people believe we need both a modest blocksize increase as well as segwit. Leaving the other developers aside, would you be willing to support a blocksize increase in exchange for BU implementing segwit? We can make this happen!
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:24:06
Core needs to release a client that supports accepting up to 8 MB blocks presuming they are produced by the network. This is the only way for the software to remain relevant in a BU-dominated world.
At that point, technical debates can center on segwit versus flextrans and the developers can work to help alternate clients support segwit code. Otherwise flextrans will be used for malleability fix and a lot of other improvements will take longer.

Zoom in on the chart and look at the numbers:
    260k transactions March 1st, 2016
    250k transactions January 1st, 2016
Spikes in processing caused by additional hashpower coming online don't count since the network self-adjusts to remove the effect of the additional hashing power over time.

Exchanges will not adopt quickly since the threat of reversal carries significant economic liabilities for them. Meanwhile, a lot of consumer wallets will need to update for the witness reorganization to clear up enough space to make a non-trivial dent in transaction volume.
So where does the growth come from? We are told LN will increase volume but it requires two transanctions to open/close channels. Given that there is no viable routing network that makes LN relatively useless for everything except bidirectional payment channels (which already exist and don't typically require constant onchain settlement). That leaves us with a relatively useless form of LN, or a possibly useful form of LN that benefits a small number of users and does so at the cost of reducing the total number of transactions available for the rest of the community.
As above, and without prejudice to segwit, if Core was serious about bitcoin we would have a date for a blocksize increase. Segwit advocates were repeatedly telling us it takes 12+ months to plan a safe hardfork last year. The lack of any movement in planning one speaks volumes as to the lack of effective scaling planning.
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:58:10
The limit is on the size of the data, not the number of transactions. Some transaction types (multisig n-of-m, etc.) take up more space, so that can reduce the total number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:28:16
If Core was serious about bitcoin we would already have a date for a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:22:26
Circle was good, but lack of scaling put them out of business.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:38:17
What increase in transaction volume? There's been no increase in a year, dude.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:06:15
Arg. Sorry, that was March 2015, so technically a 4% reduction....
I agree there was still growth last year, but bitcoin was on an expontential growth trend and if the network had not hit capacity we would be at 400,000+ transactions. total cf on the development side.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:21:26
I would sell some ethereum to buy some. Empty mempool and cheap transactions on a platform that's guaranteed to be 100% compatible with every piece of software ever written for the bitcoin blockchain?
There are plenty of applications that won't work with high onchain fees and second layer networks. If this version of bitcoin attracts those applications, it can be as valuable as any other. The only question is if it can scale, but that is an open question.
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:45:54
Ethereum transactions just spiked to about 60k daily.
If we don't scale this sort of thing will continue and... well... are you guys seriously expecting the ETH blockchain to collapse from overuse? What about other altcoins?
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:22:26
Why rollback? Segwit adopters just lose money when their payments stop being recognized as valid. Whatever exchanges supported the soft fork go bankrupt as segwit deposits vanish and their obligations need to be paid out in real BTC.
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:58:50
My customers called bitcoin "CirclePay". It was the only exchange I would introduce them to that would stick (gemini too hard, coinbase too expensive). So you can claim it wasn't an exchange if that makes you feel better, but it managed to exchange my customer's fiat for bitcoin pretty efficiently and my bitcoin volume is going to fall by about 50% thanks to this.
I suppose the good news is that when everyone is on an exchange that supports alt-coins (because apparently they all need to support altcoins just to stay in business), it will be easier to transfer money using whatever altcoin offers best speed at lowest fees.
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:13:19
If it is such a good idea, hard fork yourself....  Core has been clear they don't want bitcoin being used directly as a payments/transfer layer, which means they don't need the mass of users who are using bitcoin for exactly that. As such, they should HF and push their technical agenda elsewhere so they can attract users on their own merits rather than Satoshi's.

Sorry mate, but I'm a merchant accepting bitcoin and can tell you outright that adoption is going backwards now that it is more difficult to purchase bitcoin in the US. Circle was a major loss because it let people buy bitcoin at a reasonably low rate. About half of my bitcoin customers have gone back to Paypal, and this isn't even about the excessive transaction fees, just about the ease of purchase.
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:47:55
Well.... you can still send and receive bitcoin. Your wallet just won't register incoming transactions. So there is a natural incentive to update, but you don't lose funds if you don't.
@_date: 2016-11-26 19:20:07
I've told customers to write their support line. They've generally been good at increasing their limit to 2-3k.
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:06:39
Set aside some money and purchase some regularly. Resist the temptation to day-trade. You may not have 1 bitcoin now, but you will probably be able to purchase one before the price rises out of reach for good if you are persistent.

@_date: 2016-12-30 07:48:25
If you believe that and consider Core's roadmap the best solution, then that is all the more reason to fork, since by your own admission you have no use for the current users in the ecosystem and do not believe any competing fork will succeed. What fear of failure holds you back?

@_date: 2017-11-11 00:31:54
A lot harder to buy now after the fork. Pick the wrong fork and you'll end up with a lot of expensive nothing.
BTC has 300k transactions and not much short-term growth potential. BCH has 50k transactions and a lot of short-term growth potential. Opinions differ on technical roadmaps. Risky.
 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:04:49
Case in point right here: people get testy when they lose 20% of their portfolio in twenty-four hours.
So thanks but I'll stick to my opinion, shill. Anyone buying in who doesn't have a committed reason for supporting any particular chain should be careful. The market will sort out which bitcoin will win in the next couple of months and there will be plenty of time to buy in then. Lower return, maybe, but much lower risk.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:31:11
You're fine, dude. I was replying to Idiocracy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:59:04
That's not true. The wallet uses the same keys across BCH and BTC. So even if someone sends you BTC you still get it. Very much the best way to do it, since you don't need to police which coin the other person buys and can just tell them to send you bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:48:58
From what I see on the ground here in China, It'll be a challenge for segwit to get even 40 percent network support: almost all of the Chinese companies that support it are already signalling: where is the extra support going to come from?
So segwit is practically blocked unless Core adjusts its activation threshold downward, a step which would make supporting segwit even riskier for non-miners (no-one running an exchange can risk segwit being rejected since segwit coins aren't bitcoins if the segwit fork fails -- segwit is an all or nothing fork if done as SF)
So the real question is how much support BU can get and whether it can position itself as a scaling solution, or whether Core can paint it as an obstruction. Regardless, the real problem that makes this tricky to figure out is that once a fork happens Core will have to pull off a fast HF to lower difficulty on the bitcoin network, which will be a kick to its credibility especially among the Chinese miners who have been asking for onchain capacity growth for the last year.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:52:51
Yeah. It's brilliant.
You get the money even if the other person screws up and sends you the coin you aren't expecting.

This is a joke, right? Core has been pushing a fee market for more than a year now. And you're upset with the guys who signed the HK agreement because they wanted a 2MB hardfork along with segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:39:58
I would believe you, but your theory predicts the exact opposite of what has happened for the past year.
@_date: 2016-10-06 03:01:18
Bitcoin use is not increasing. We hit capacity last November:
You can see the point on the graph where exponential growth stopped.
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:47:17
Crypto is on an exponential growth curve. There are about 500k daily transactions today compared to about 200k a year and a half ago.
So transactions should be growing at about 6% per month. Right now it looks like price follows usage, so if bitcoin stops growing in price the momentum will likely transfer to whatever alts can grow to service the 400-500k in daily transactions we should add over the next year.
The only thing that can stop this train is a general economy-wide meltdown that would cause major asset holders to dump crypto to get short-term liquidity to cover their losses elsewhere. But even that will probably not happen since crypto is probably an uncorrelated asset that will get buy-in if the economy goes south, and not enough people with significant debt hold it to liquidate.

Yes, fixing transaction malleability is important. But segwit isn't more urgent than a blocksize increase and doesn't free up much blockspace. The efficiency savings segwit offers will apply to the 8MB of block+witness data just as well as they would the original 3+1MB.
