You sir are correct.

Salt adds another 2 bytes to the whole encryption stuff and thus makes it much more difficult to crack. The salt also is taken from a bigger character space then what you would normaly use.
So while "hunter2" is medium difficult to crack, salting it makes it "&lt;hash from hunter2&gt;$,", hashes that and stores it in the DB.
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:15:41
That's whats supposed to happen. Like this you  equalize the market places.
@_date: 2011-06-07 12:23:09
Yes, but not everyone reads it/knoiws that
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:43:26
Yes, this is one of the most concerning problems I see with the market right now. The Volume is so low that it's really easy to play it for a quick buck.
I wonder if we can hold even $10 for the next week. It wouldn't suprise me if we'd crash way lower then that. And that is not even taking into account the horror that is going to break out once they shut down silk road. I'd short them right now, if I could.
@_date: 2011-06-22 03:45:41
Check with the guys from they can tell you a bit about variance. This is probably why the recalculation period is so large (2 weeks)
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:08:36
He stored the stuff in the cloud. I am pretty sure what happened was that he registered with a rouge site using the same uid/pwd as for his cloud login. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 16:34:40
Well, if everything plays out, not for long.
@_date: 2011-06-08 05:32:29
Guess we're going to get another influx in *checks his wrist watch* 4 days.
@_date: 2011-06-18 13:46:36
He is legit, I worked (by proxy but still) on atitd years ago. Very small developer that ties his lifelyhood to some really inovative ideas.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:42:04
Please read up on how salting works.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:57:04
I tried to buy 2 6990, but they are simply out of stock.
@_date: 2011-06-15 12:59:02
Or just moving cash between wallets
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:21:58
Well, thank you sir. Anyway I still think that my point has some merrit: people are stupid with their passwords and I am pretty sure that thats what happened here.
@_date: 2011-06-10 05:07:30
Anybody wants to buy some heat? Or knows a way to store it until our -40 in winter? 
@_date: 2011-06-08 13:05:15
There is no maring
@_date: 2011-06-12 04:37:10
Except that the biggest exchange site sits in japan.
@_date: 2011-06-18 13:53:13
Yes, BUT, they might change the protocol at one point so that it gets pruned and/or only header info is send to clients. You don't need to have your client open immediatly, but you should watch whats happening with the development of the client and maybe at least connect some time after the transaction to recieve your coins.
@_date: 2011-06-06 18:27:32
Yeah it looks like it moving around a bit
@_date: 2011-06-06 18:27:12
@_date: 2011-06-12 12:27:02
Yup, I don't think they would.  They will see the price getting higher and higher, and although a lot of coins will get exchanged, people would hold onto an even bigger part to see how high it goes up -&gt; greed.
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:42:05
Ok, replace 0 with useless.
Like [this]( it goes really fast, just in reverse
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:49:07
If you run a business you have to trust, at least to some degree, the people that you work with. At least you have some sort of ID from them and can sue them should they do something horribly malice.
My point is, that there usually isn't some black hat uba wizzard involved when it comes to hacking.
When you see anouncements like these, or just rumors of sorts, you should first go to "ok, I am not sure I have the whole picture here. People are idiots &amp; this thing about a major 1337 h4ckz0r is only talking about how big of an E-Penis someone has. Let's keep cool and see what happens. Maybe someone just fucked someones assistant." Which is what happened here.
This however as nothing to do with MtGox dude being an idiot for having an auditor with access to his network. (Well, maybe a little) But more with having that auditor being an idiot and accountable. (The auditor was the idiot here, should he exist.)
This isn't some theoretical internet stuff. When you do bad they will get you IRL and rightfully so.
@_date: 2011-06-09 01:07:52
Wow, how did changing the template to add this "Do not enter commas, only dots for decimal separator." take longer then a string replace?
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:29:06
I knew it. English is my 2nd language, does that count for anything?
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:13:47
if you want to but weed, go to your local college
@_date: 2011-06-04 20:42:00
Oh, yes, please me too. If anyone can.
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:34:15
Hmm, it should be a lot coming from the same adresses in intervals.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:45:27
That should be the general aditude around here.
@_date: 2011-06-18 13:54:21
Can you come up with one transaction? Then we can dig through the records and maybe find something.
@_date: 2011-06-04 02:29:26
That is what I am saying. If you would then define the base as 0.00000001 it would be far from enough to sustain an economy with that currency.
Lets just agree to disagree.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:00:42
Montreal, $0,08 per kwh :)
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:05:08
and people are still buying, i dont get this.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:30:59
Except that it wasn't an SQL Injection. Since the dawn of computers the majority of hacks are done by fucking the assistant. Same here:
*It appears that someone who performs audits on our system and had read-only access to our database had their computer compromised. This allowed for someone to pull our database. The site was not compromised with a SQL injection as many are reporting, so in effect the site was not hacked.*
@_date: 2011-06-06 17:18:52
Current estimate for the next difficulty is ~750k
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:37:17
Let me answer that for cwkoss: No
I like the guy that actually took the time to look at the transactions and came up with the 14% transaction share for mt gox.
@_date: 2011-06-10 05:01:17
I bought 1000Euro worth at around $10 and sold at around $30
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:33:53
But that's how these things happen. Well, there are rare cases where really takes the time an effort to search for recently released 0 days, but the people that actually discover them are far and few in between.
You want to know how WoW accounts are "hacked"? Donks buying WoW Gold and using the same password for registration as for their WoW accounts. Or people in EQ that shared their Acc. Info "but only on the private guild forums". 
DAoC was hacked because a GM logged on from an internet cafe, and so forth and so on.
The idea that someone tracks your randomly assigned IP over your DSL/Broadband, tries to specificaly for you is just not whats happening.
However, yes, there are enough people that register for any penis enlargement website, while again using the same password as with everything else. Or that really really really want to participate in this awesome BTC lottery, because they are going to win big and the know it.
Most of them just download a cute little screensaver with puppies or lolcatz and by that get their entrance to this totaly wicked bot network.
99.9% of "hacks" can be brought down to people being exceptionally stupid. And not even being lazy and not patching your apache server 10 seconds after a new security fix came out.. Just by being really really thick... and blaming it on everyone else. (Which is the part that gets me ranting)
@_date: 2011-06-05 05:20:50
Yeah, was just being lazy and it was 4 sentences...
@_date: 2011-06-04 16:44:14
Baffled me... However it seems that actually if all miners agree at some point there can be more coins generated. So it's not even an issue.
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:52:36
Actually, yes it would be.
That's 100 000 000 fractions. That is far from trying to run an economy with.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:14:00
Don't post personal info on reddit.
@_date: 2011-06-11 21:54:32
Then it wouldn't have affected the market.
@_date: 2011-06-06 14:02:41
The thing about generating bitcoins is to give people the incentive to set up the network needed later to run the network and process the transactions. It is not really about giving miners free  money for hookers and blow, but rather to set up a solid network.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:35:15
I thought the 2nd bull trap happened around 16.30
@_date: 2011-06-18 04:25:47
What I was saying from the beginning: a Rogue website that is gathering infos.
It's also the way that mmo accounts get "hacked"
@_date: 2011-06-05 15:21:53
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:32:17
Nope, thats not what I am saying. What I am saying is that over time any bitcoin (or fraction there of one) will be hit by some kind of desaster.
The thing about bitcoins is, that once you create one (with all it's fractions) this one coin (and it's fractions) can never be generated again and can never be replenished.

Anything but the US is good for now.
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:27:48
I saw this graphic about node distribution worldwide. It was made as a point that BTC isn't a US currency.
While there were a lot of nodes in the US, Europe and the rest of the western world, there were only very little in the places that could really benefit from BTC, for Example Africa. A lot of these countries are already conducting a lot of their day to day business with mobile payments. So BTC would just be another step.
It's not an answer to OPs question, but maybe an angle.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:55:55
Yeah, just saw the other post about it.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:34:03
There is no "Exchange rate" outside of the exchange, besides what you and the party agree upon.
@_date: 2011-06-12 02:24:44
Also, I heared they are [keynesians](
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:24:40
Yup, and here is the kicker: since the cost for electricty isn't the same all over the world, you know who is going to run all this bitcoin stuff? The people in iceland... It's all repeating itself.
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:36:22
Like Dragons Tale?
@_date: 2011-06-12 04:39:18
The thing is, you need not to just buy them... you need to actually BUY them. As in: you need to have everyone sell them to you.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:15:12
So what do you usually use?
@_date: 2011-06-09 12:43:29
You still need to pay to electricity
@_date: 2011-06-07 12:34:28
It is from march though
@_date: 2011-06-18 16:34:25
It's in the original papers. And yes, this should only be used for non-miners. Just to be safe though I would start the client in the days/weeks after recieving a transaction, just to be sure.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:46:23
24h clock is awesome!
Can give some options for the BTC/USD Graph as well? 5 minutes, hours, days, something like that?
@_date: 2011-06-04 00:13:17
Yes and no. It causes to currency to have build in expiration date.
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:23:11
Elaborate, please
@_date: 2011-06-04 17:42:28
Basically, being an anonymous currency, how does one prove that they own X amount of bitcoin if their address is lost or computer holding the Bitcoin software destroyed?
You can't, once it's gone, it's gone.
Also, if it is simply lost or unrecoverable to the original owner, wouldn't it create a decline in the quantity of bitcoin in circulation over the very long term?
I asked that one yesterday (and got downvoted for it...), it turns out that should all miners decide to create more coins, they could do so.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:56:02
It's the same with every currency. You always have the guys that make it and they make sure that they can sit with their asses on a big fucking pile of it.
@_date: 2011-06-12 15:56:18
@_date: 2011-06-04 19:08:18
Totaly, but it's possible.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:34:19
You know who else cares to explain?
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:19:16
Because your wallet, and all your coins might get lost by X (where X is something more or less smart)... The thing is, with $ right now it is no big deal, money is being printed all the time. With BTC however, those coins in your wallet are forever gone. Thus the total amount will eventually be 0. (Given enough time)
It's not about any fractions, but about the actual coins that are being lost.
Edit: Also the downvotes on this are stupid. I think this is really a valid point and worth discussing.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:33:56
People are so gullible... Some guy commented here on reddit that some other guy on irc said that he works at google and ran the DB against theirs and had all accounts flagged. Strange enough, mine wasn't one of them.
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:15:25
Thats what I did, they do have a limit though on the amount of SLL you can trade.
The other thing I did was a bank transfer from a german account, which takes 2-3 days though.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:23:17
I already have kickass gaming system :) not THAT kickass, but good enough for a mortal
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:47:48
Thanks, I'll have a look either way
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:21:46
Just canceled the order. Would have been out of $1300 and I only had a couple of hours to do so.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:47:18
Yeah, I can see that. But the return would have taken a few months for me as well. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:10:26
Shit, thanks
