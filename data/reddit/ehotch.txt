Having buy strategies is easy. Selling strategies is a more complicated task. Set up your strategy and stick to your principles.

Turns out a key ingredient to sustainable happiness is overcoming some struggle through work. 
Accept and adopt that concept now, while you’re still young.
The best way to do this is to find work that you’re so passionate about that it feels less like Work and it is fun every single day.
Success and happiness is a process.

Emotional investors by definition have no strategy. They feed off of impulse and feeling and less thought. They are more prone to putting in money they don’t have and then panicking (intense emotion) when the markets don’t move they way they wanted it to.
They are the ‘weak hands’
Bitcoin traditionally has done quite well in the long term, so if you have a well thought out strategy and can fight off the feelings of euphoria, greed, despair etc and stick to a well thought out strategy... which requires a lot of patience... then those people come out on top.
Short traders and day traders have to have a lot emotional discipline and skills to pull off what they’re doing.

I doubt this is the big dip.... but you thinking it is is why you’re probably all out of money!!!

To me, i think nano is the answer, because it does not mine and consume energy like bitcoin.

Exactly what i suspected. Bear market.

I work with teens in my profession, and they say Facebook is lame, and then i ask them what their preferred social media platform is, and they say ‘insta!’
Facebook is not going anywhere except up. Go ahead and short it all you want....i think that stock price has a lot of room to grow.

That’s a sign that you might be overly invested and that you’re definitely looking at the charts way too much trying to find meaning in impulsive, erratic and highly emotional behaviors of others. 
It will turn you bipolar. Look at the graphs! 
Invest an amount that lets you sleep 8 hours a night... see if you can go 3 days without checking the price.
You’ll be so happy to have your life back.

I appreciate this commentary. I think people get addicted to the parabolic bull-runs, but they forget the difficulty of building a foundation and going through an accumulation phase that happens prior...the struggle is necessary.

10 crypto commandments off the top of my head
1) Markets move fast, Patience and strategy win the game. Having a buy strategy is easy. Sell strategy can be more challenging. Come up with something a little more sophisticated than HODL...because there has to be an endpoint somewhere
2) if you are losing sleep over this you are overly invested.
3) unless you are skilled and know what you’re doing, i recommend that you do not day-trade
4) do research, read white papers. There’s a lot of convincing propaganda especially here on Reddit. Learn to sift through the bullshit and hold conversations on substance. Seek reliable sources on your information to make thoughtful decisions. Seek to make investments in projects that you think will grow and mature in 3-5 years.
5) fomo is emotional, and you do not want to make emotionally charged decisions with your investments.
6) create a thoughtful, balanced and diversified portfolio that is built up overtime. 
7) Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging in) with an investment amount that does not break your finances or quality of life. Invest only what you can and prepare to see everything go to 0. 
8) Be careful how many times a day you check the price of crypto. If you are making longer term investments the price right now, or 5 mins from now won’t make a difference on what you do... so go live life and get off your phone.
9) Engage with a community of people, trade ideas, get active in the movement. Be a catalyst and an activist in the projects you believe in. You don’t have to be a tech person to be part of the movement.
10) have fun. This is an amazing time to be alive. Welcome to the club.

I’ve accepted that bitcoin is truly digital gold. What is the utility behind gold? Jewelry? Bars to be held in safety deposit boxes?
To me bitcoin is the gold standard of a longstanding blockchain. It is heavy, slow but it is reliable, immutable and transparent. I see it as a store of value and a representation of a community and an economy, but it has less to do with utility than many other projects.
(Thats just my personal opinion)
As far as “investment” and “gambling” I think that the two aren’t mutually exclusive. It involves managing risk, luck, timing etc....  but where i try to deviate from gambling and move into investments is that i am looking to make long term commitments (3-5 years is an eternity in crypto) where i see gambling to be more about throwing money in random coins (scams or not) hoping they get pumped and then get out...with instant gratification.
I appreciate your perspectives—What are your thoughts?

Ha! Great point.
I guess this boils down to the question: would you rather have 110 billion in bitcoin or amazon stock?

If bitcoin died it would drag the whole market Down with it but some ‘shitcoins’ would not only survive but thrive after the depression....
Trust me, I do my own research and I’m not too impressed with your discussion points. At all.

I’ve found myself in similar conversations with friends and find that this debate boils down to the fundamental question of: does history repeat itself in markets?
To those that think/feel that looking at past trends are a waste of time bc the factors are different now... then this discussion is pointless.
To those that think/feel that markets move in cycles and repeat patterns...then this discussion is priceless (pun intended!)
I happen to believe in patterns repeating itself...but knowing that these are not going to be exact replicas of previous cycles bc of different times and circumstances.
I do think that the emotional/thinking patterns of humans making and losing money is always the same...for better and for worse. It’s why there are billion dollar casinos in Vegas and why the emotional sentiment from Reddit threads from previous bearish cycles look the same...
Remember, the disciplined investor does buy in the red and sell in the green.
Great discussion.

Before you go bashing Facebook and other tech companies for deleting crypto ads— think about what happened on these social media sites during the 2016 election. These companies saw major vulnerabilities and they are seeking to repair the damages they have created.
The crypto world is full of con artists, scammers and pump and dumpers who encourage others to hodl....they would have exploited Facebook so badly and started to.
They are not discouraging groups from engaging in dialogue— but they are preventing companies like bitconnect to advertise. I think this is really good.
Plus to the inexperienced, crypto evokes intense (euphoria and despair) emotion that can lead to gambling-like behaviors....i do not think we need crypto advertised and peddled on social media.
Just my 2 bitcoins of thoughts...

It’s not a Ponzi scheme and we know that because it is open and transparent, it is secure bc of 10+ years of security and then you factor in the idea of a potentially globalized deflationary currency,the ills of human psychology—including greed and fomo, mix in Fibonacci patterns and yeah.... short banks and long bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:34:48
Clearly there is not enough demand at this price point..because the price is going down.
Let the bears do their thing... bulls will eventually come out to run.

Bc the weak and naive hands that were buying back then ran out of funds to keep buying.
People are holding bags. There is blood in the streets. The money has run out.
Institutional and smart money are picking their spots to make their moves.
