Show us the math and then we'll believe you.

You just don't know when to quit, buddy, do ya?
Tell you what: I will bite into your herring.
1. If the FBI was not obsessed with ruining the lives of people who trade drugs, then they would not have threatened Ross' associate Curtis Clark Green with prison to get him to turn on Ross.
2. If Curtis hadn't been blackmailed by the FBI into becoming a snitch, then he would have never started to blackmail Ross by threatening to expose Silk Road customers.
3. If Curtis hadn't been blackmailing Ross, then Ross would not have been coerced into deciding between letting his customers face danger or killing Curtis.
In other words: The whole murder case against Ross, every single step and event, was *strictly and entirely caused by the FBI's actions*.  There is no ethical difference between what the FBI caused, and someone forcing you to kill a stranger in order to protect a friend, then accusing you of murder.  Wait, there is one difference: nobody actually died in the plot fabricated by the FBI.  So add lying to extortion, threats and harassment against people who didn't hurt anyone until the FBI got involved.
There goes your latest smear against Ross.

Hey buddy, not sure what you're talking about.  You wanted a source for the claim that MLK had been admonished to kill himself by the feds, and I gave you the source.  Isn't that what you wanted?
If you got downvoted here it's probably because you're asking for a source to confirm something that is widely available on Google.  Your question makes you look like you're either too lazy to do a simple web search, or you're trying to make people doubt about a perfectly truthful historical fact.

Not to disagree with you specifically, but this hole is far, far worse than Heartbleed. This is WinNuke weaponized to run code, against three orders of magnitude more servers, with way larger attack surfaces.

Bitcoin changes the equation of violence significantly.  If someone (private thief or government one) says "hand over your car keys" but you refuse, they shoot you and get your keys anyway.  But you can always deprive the thief of whatever Bitcoin they want to steal from you -- just don't hand over the password, and some loved one of yours will keep what is yours to give to them.
