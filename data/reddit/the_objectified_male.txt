That's a real pro tip right there, thank you! Gonna wait to see what happens. Either way, sounds like it's a win-win, as far as I can tell

What's happening on the 11th? I was kinda waiting for the next sharp drop in the $900 range.

Username checks out haha
Well, I feel like 10k is not the jumping off a bridge kind of money, so I'm probably gonna do it. Mostly worried if its a terrible idea, tho

What do I unlock at 21?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:37:49
Is that because exchanges can be hacked?

I'm sure bitcoin will endure, but the lack of net neutrality will surely have some effect.
I'm interested in gauging what those effects could be. if anyone has any insights or ideas, I'm all ears.

Thank you for this, it makes perfect sense, and it's the future that I hope for - not dystopian at all in my opinion.
I was just hoping that there could be a better alternative for sending money across borders in the present time...

Here's the math, just for YOU, with BTC  on coinbase (but, like I said before, I now know that GDAX is a better way to go):
PURCHASE FEE (for .4150 BTC at USD$3,300) =  USD $48.45
TRANSFER FEE (network fee) = USD$8.07
WITHDRAWAL FEE (on MercadoBitcoin.com, @ R$2.99 + 1.99%) = ~ R$215 = ~ USD $65
TOTAL IN FEES = ~USD $121
WESTERN UNION FEES = USD $55
Makes SENSE now?

I guess it's still too early for Bitcoin's practical use... I do invest (and profit) in it, but this is a different use case - I may as well use Western Union or some other shitty service.
The way things are developing, I don't see how it can turn into a true P2P, decentralized value exchange.

I didn't LOSE money.
I'm upset that not one, but TWO centralized exchanges are profiting from my purchase and transfer of bitcoins.
It's more cost-effective to simply use Western Union. Practically speaking, bitcoin (as it currently exists) is failing in its promise of 1) Decentralization, 2)Easy, peer-to-peer exchange and 3) Serving as cost-effective alternative to existing value exchange systems.
