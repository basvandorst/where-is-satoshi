Ah 9 days later, sorry for forgetting about these posts. They said theyve been having alot of issues with fraudulent accounts and have been manually calling individuals to verify. Alot of account transactions were put on hold for this for some days. Im all clear now and have been moving money pretty regularly since this initial discussion without them taking more then the standard 3 days.

Ok nice work, now it actually shows share balance and btc balance!
But how often does the api update? Youre not doing it manually are you?
I currently have twice the minimum payout amount, with no payouts... how, what, when etc etc

Using computer hardware to produce currency is stupid?
Libertarians are idiots?
Has to be trolling. Try formulating arguments with facts/reasoning/logic and not purely opinion. Until then i think maybe you should stay away from reddit.com altogether.

Ive taken out exactly what i put in originally and still have plenty of profit. I did not try to make it seem like i was sinking. Im paying off the debt slowly as is and am living comfortably in my opinion. If it were to crash now, it would be as though i had never heard of it. If it excels then my debt will cease to be.

Agreed, this needs to be implemented asap! Along with an instant payout function if its not too taxing on the website.
Or at least let us know the rate/interval for updates that will be displayed on the website
currently putting in 0.0330Ths, would like to be able to keep tabs on rewards etc

I sold btc on bitcoin-otc and soon after rebought btc from mtgox with that money. Moving money from one dwolla to another is very quick, less then 20 minutes each time. Its only dwolla working with external sources that is slow such as verifying or making withdrawels or deposits from a bank account is ridiculously slow. so all in all, moving money to or from your bank, cashing out or making deposits takes forever, so im moving alot each time to have room to react to the market. Depending on the mtgox guys speed, you can move money between mtgox and dwolla extremely fast.

90 hours and counting, waiting for transfer from bank to dwolla account.... something has got to be up with this service... sending a contact email to ask.

Mtgox uses dwolla because its exactly like paypal in its service, minus the ability to fraud via chargebacks. also paypal has stated that buying selling BTC with paypal is consider ecurrency or currency trading and thus against the tos. Paypal is a crude business man, as dwolla is a simple and more open, however is much slower with transactions.
74 hrs and counting for a deposit from bank account to dwolla account. However transactions between dwolla accounts are nearly instant.
