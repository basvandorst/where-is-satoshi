Isnt this good news? The less bitcoins the more they are worth

Why are you expecting a dip? Newbie question :)

Hard to tell, it all depends on how many people that will use Bitcoin, whether its for storing money or use as a payment method doesent really matter imo. As of now only a fraction of people use btc when compared to fiatmoney and still the price for one btc is ~7200 USD. If btc reaches the mainstream and the userbase increases even more the price for one Bitcoin could easily be worth 500.000 USD in the future.

Moon would be when btc marketcap is higher than USD :)

How can you even consider this a legit question?

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you'll land among the stars.

7300 by the end of the day no worries, people will want to buy as the prices drops which makes the prices go up again

Well isnt bitcoin possible to split into 1 million parts? Could someone evaluate this?

When the first bike came people laghed, when the first car came people laughed, 
When the first personal computer came people laughed, when the first.. you get the point. Im definitely willing to bet some of my money into Bitcoin since there probably will be the same story, its only logical that while rest of the society gets more and more depending on the internet, why wouldnt currencies be?

Ofc, they are just based on specific data to make it as accurate as possible but does not include unpredictable events which is what really matters imo
