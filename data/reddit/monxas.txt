Really? Keep your own coins. I'm not even saying anything bad about coinbase. Read about ways to keep your own coins. I'd recommend a hardware wallet, like trezor or ledger nano. I happen to own a trezor and I couldn't be happier. You'll have to read a bit to make sure you fully dominate it, but only by keeping your private keys you can call those coins your own. 
It's not that bad if you don't have that much coin, but if you have a "big wallet"... Many things can go wrong with coinbase. And even if nothing bad happens, you''ll be limited on how to dispose of your coins. you won't be able to sell them in one go, you won't be able to get the money out whenever you want, you account might get frozen maybe a month while they check something to freeze your assets.

The bubble I’m sure will burst. But it won’t affect bitcoin or it maybe push it up. The real bubble is all the fake altcoins, more than a thousand and more each day. It makes no sense and 99% adds zero value. The top coins will stay. I hate seeing altcoins growing so fast, but in the long run, it’s the pefect way for bitcoin to avoid itself become a bubble.

1 lightning is not years away. It’s already working in testnets and can be implemented locally.
2 blockstream doesn’t own bitcoin, is just one of the many institutions helping develop bitcoin. 
3 when lighting is implemented generally, it will make most of the transactions move to the lightning network. The assumption that fees will keep raising on the main chain makes no sense. If the main chain is a road and lightning network is a net of highways, as more transactions go through lighting, less will go to the main blockchain, making normal transactions much cheaper. (2:00 on the Clip I think) 
I’ll update as I see the rest of the video.
Edit: the rest is pure FUD. Lightning is open source and anyone can install it, develop solutions for it... no "monthly fees" to blockstream. It really is a bad video.
Remember who the main promoters of bcash are. Roger Ver (the "I am right because I make more money than you" guy  Craig Wright (fake Satoshi  
 Extra points for this one:  ) and other similar folks.
Such "assholery" is what is driving bcash. If you still want in, fuck, you're braver than I am. One of them literally claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. It can be proven very easily (signing any message with a private key that owns one of the addresses that we know for a fact are owned by satoshi. He tried to fake it. Now go give him your money)
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:39:11
It’s competition, you said it. It’s a contentious hard fork, not like other forks that were more friendly. They are literally trying to take bitcoins name. They call bitcoin bitcoin core. They own bitcoin.com and  on twitter, using that to confuse new users about what is actually bitcoin. It’s messy and sloppy. Bcash all the way for me. 
It’s competition so just stay still as they attack you is what you propose? It’s just a name, and it’s being the consensus. Bcash. they try to kidnap the name and you want to give it to them?
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:10:43
Well, they also use when their tick is BCH

Are you blaming Btc for what exactly? How is btc a shitcoin if it’s the original that created all this ecosystem? By the way, altcoins are the one that are 99% shitcoins...

@_date: 2019-07-12 01:32:10

Nope. You have to actively go to a faucet and claim the free crypto. Sorry!

The most important thing of your wallet is the private key. That’s what make you the owner of your coins. That private key is generated by those  24 words (seed). So as long as you have those 24 words you have access to your coins. A hardware wallet is just a convenient way to access your wallet safely. A hardware wallet isn’t in fact a way to keep your coins, but to use them. You keep them with the list of words. The device have them as well so it’s easy for you to access them, but that’s just it. Think of it like a debit card. You can lose the card or destroy it, the money is not there. 
So yeah, an extra hardware wallet is just a backup for the wallet, not the coins themselves. Always keep your seed safe, apart from devices.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:53:58

I don’t HODL any alts. I might trade them but those are in a exchange. Long term, I basically own bitcoin, and some eth and litecoin. More than enough for me. But I can’t deny I’m looking forward to the trezor t and what features it brings. Other than that, yeah, I’m sure nano is great too.

Why are those guys renting you the hashpower instead of just keeping the coins to themselves? It doesn’t make sense, unless they are scamming you.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:55:22
If you just recently remembered about the coins you might have mined, breathe. There’s a big chance you won’t recover them, if you mines some at all, but you were just fine a day ago. This could be a nice surprise. If Ymir doesn’t work out, just move on.
Yeah, check what version of core you were running.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:11:42
Op, that’s good and all but I’d be more worried about your parenthesis addiction. (4 sets (of parenthesis) in the title)(its a joke (but really, get that checked)) (I’m a programmer, you can see it because my nested parenthesis are next level)
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:19:18
Well, it’s a bitcoin transaction. In this case Coinbase chooses the fee for you. But make sure you check some guides/tutorials/videos on how the hardware wallet works and most importantly how to set it up. It’s easy but the better you understand the in and outs the more comfortable you’ll be. Also, instead of making a single transaction I’d do a test one, wipe the wallet and see if you’re able to restore it. If everything works as intended then you can send the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:45:46
Fire up the core wallet. Just by opening the app it won’t expose anything. Start trying passwords. Not sure exactly what your problem is right now... if you can be more specific...

Lightning will do a great job on making transactions faster. I think of it like the internet. First it was slow and expensive. Updates on bitcoin will make it great.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:39:14
I’m discussing. This would be a very opinionated change and would break the community. I think we’ve had enough splits. Also, you’re virtually printing bitcoins from thin air. The market has regulated the price of Bitcoin from the amount that are in the market. I truly don’t see any benefit. If you think reissuing those bitcoins is easier and would have more consensus than bringing more decimal places... I just can’t agree.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:51
I’m pretty sure you won’t be able. But I had another idea.
Run the command dumpprivkey &lt;address&gt; to get the private key associate to your address. To run this command, you can either run it in bitcoin-qt console or with command line in bitcoin-cli.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:04
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:30:37
You have a huge amount of public addresses per private key. You basically can use them as 1 use only. Sure the “donate” ones stay public so everybody can see how much donations you got. But you can always change it after a while.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:56:39
It already dipped hard, and bounced back quite fast. Not to all time highs, but high enough. Doesn’t that prove that there are a lot of people waiting on the dip to buy again that it won’t let the coin crash that way down? Just because it fits you the coin won’t accomodate to your targets. It could go up to 14 before dipping to 11, that being “the crash”. It hasn’t been crashing that hard lately....

Well, most digital currencies actually don’t have any value. But apart from that. I see crypto currency as new technology being deployed, and being allowed to invest in it. Imagine being able to invest in the internet of the 90’s (Not the dot com bubble, the internet as a whole) it might not had a lot of uses at the beginning. It might have been expensive and slow. But look at it now. That’s how I look at this. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:28:17
You buy coins. You buy them at the price it’s marked. What those are worth a year later has nothing to do with the transaction you made, like buying a bike. The transaction has been made, if you could afford 200 bucks for the bike, that’s it. Not further exchanges will happen. Unless you decide to sell it. By then maybe it’s worth more or less, but nobody is looking at the 1 transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:58:36
Well this week it dipped already. Why it has to be a major 40% down? If there are dips at a regular pace to correct the price, no crashes might happen (unless major events)
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:02:18
Yeah but if nobody sells to crash the price they can’t predict the short for sure. But I think they’ve already been buying.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:38:12

Login into gdax with Coinbase info. Transfer your money (free) and put a limit order just below current price, that has 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:15:12
They stay on gdax. Long term, is safer to store them yourself offline. If you’re not buying too much, a paper wallet works well. For bigger sums, ledger nano or trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:58:08

Andreas Antonopoulos take on this:
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:38:45
Futures is you don't own bitcoin. you just bet for or against bitcoin. but you don't own bitcoin. It's a big deal because it's how wallstreet plays the game. it's much easier to use futures than owning bitcoins safely and trade them in  a crypto specific exchange. This way all the tools and things they've been using for other stocks are available to them. 
The big deal... I think it comes from the legitimization of the coin. You won't see cocaine futures on wallstreet. The fact that they allow bitcoin is a normalization of crypto, accepting it as one more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:49:54
I don’t get it.
They buy the machines, they make the investment. You rent the hashpower.
There are only two things that can happen:
That the renting + 15% of the mined coins is more than 100% of the coins mined 
Or is less
If they make more money renting it to you, you’re being scammed. 
If they make less money renting it to you, they’re losing money by not just mining them themselves.
What’s your point of view?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:08

Only economic “gurus” say that. If you ask them what bitcoin is about or what blockchain is about, they just don’t know. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:49:20
Is it going to be a big dip? A small one? Is it even a dip? 
If you see it’s a dip you’re late on selling, because the chart is already down. Could it lower more? Sure. Will it? I don’t know.
And then, when to buy? Is that the lowest it can get? How about now? Ups it’s climbing! Oh no, it was just a minor stop, it’s going down still. I’ll get cheaper coins if I wait. 
Then the bounce happens. And it happens fast. Probably going upper than when you sold. So you’re out of your coins waiting for another dip of rebuying at a loss.
NOT WORTH IT. You can get lucky, but it’s not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:34:42

Segwit means segregated witness. Basically it moves part of the info on each transaction around, making the transaction virtually smaller. That allows to get 1.8Mb worth of data on a block that only allows 1Mb.

You can cancel the download of the blockchain and substitute the new wallet.dat for the old one. But backup your original wallet.dat and make sure you still have access after copying, or use a temporary wallet on your phone to hold your coins as you set up your new pc.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:20:10
Well blockchain and the currency attached to it need each other. Blockchain pays for it itself (the miners, getting coin drops) if the coins are worth nothing, blockchain would collapse. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:27:52
My question is, how are those coins protected? are still under my seed? do I have to put them inside the channel in a separate different kind of wallet for that channel?

The deposit will lock the price in for you if you go buy bitcoin directly from a deposit. For the rest of questions...
Spending that money on btc you might be interested in buying a hardware wallet? Do some googling, trezor and ledger nano are the most popular. They might sound expensive but they make it so much safer, and you actually own your btc (by owning the private key)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:23:48
The thing is, you go public wit a week’s notice, the market gets ready and prepares itself. Deploying like that is just irresponsible. Had they announced it, they wouldn’t have to freeze it when prices just went nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:29:14
When you use a hardware wallet, they keep the private key inside. You create a transaction using the pc, the transaction is handed to the device, the device signs it when you push the physical button (no way of signing a transaction from the pc without using the physical button). Then the signed transaction goes back to the pc and it’s sent to the blockchain.
No matter how full of viruses ready to steal your private key or alter an ongoing transaction.

Low.... it has never been more expensive than today. Might the current momentum keep going? Maybe. Can it drop? Maybe. Nobody knows. Long term it will go up. But will it go up higher than btc? 
Since it’s not a lot of money (maybe for you it is, but then crypto might not be for you) you might wanna gamble a bit with it. Make sure you use gdax with limits or another exchange without fees, and maybe you’ll manage to make smart money. Good luck though. Don’t try to run after bulls, though. Even more if it’s been bullying for a while now. It can short anytime.

To be honest I think btc for merchants should never keep the coins, or at least not a big chunk of them. Maybe now we’re more confident on btc, but as a merchant I think you have to exchange for fiat and stay safe. Maybe keep a little of the benefits in btc, but not full btc
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:24:17
According to my calculations (it’s late I might have screwed something up) if bitcoin went up 1% every day 600 days in a row from 10.000 it would be worth $3.915.833

Coinbase could freeze your account (it sometimes happen, temporarily, until they figure out some sort of false alarm or something) you could get hacked and get your password, os someone could steal your phone and send it somewhere, or they could get hacked. Sure maybe some of those cases you’ll eventually recover your coins, or maybe only the money you had, who knows. Or maybe you’re losing all the altcoins forking from your bitcoins for you to sell. 
If you own your private keys, you’re good. Just don’t lose the seed words and you’ll be all set up, no matter what.

Tomorrow 100 bitcoin could be worthless. Maybe the paper that says you own land becomes worthless. Why does gold have value?

Well, you could use the seed words to set up another wallet online but that would completely defeat the purpose of the hardware wallet and I would strongly advice against it. My answer would be no, but since you asked “absolutely”... well there’s that.

Basically, bitcoin is getting a lot of attention.

Coinbase has 10M users. With that number I’d say there are less than 100M bitcoin owners, probably way less. While it’s impossible to know how many users there are out there, that’s my rough stimation. So, where are we on that curve?

Don’t PLUNGE in, send a small amount, play with it, get comfortable. Also, test your seed words by deleting the trezor and recover it from the seed. If all comes back, then you’re ready to transfer the coins. 
Come on guys, stay safe.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:46:04
Personally, yeah, it would take a hit. But USA is not the center of the world. Bitcoin will still be used in the rest of the world, and yes, in USA. If bitcoin flourishes in the rest of the world like in Japan right now, USA would have to go back on it steps, and go to the back of the line on crypto technology.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:05:09
When you use an address the device offer a new one by default. All the addresses you used will always be yours and be able to reuse them, but it’s better to use a new one each time, or at least a new one per different entity you transact with. Each address holds its own balance and when you send bitcoin the transaction is smart enough to get from any different address it’s needed. 
With some blockchain analysis you’ll be able to get more info, but at least not as easy as to shove the address in a search bar
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:32:19
You choose the fee you want to pay (or the wallet you use) per byte. The more you pay the sooner a miner will grab your transaction and attend it. How much is a high fee or a low fee? Depends on how congested the mempool (the pool of all pending transactions) the more congested the higher the fee. We’ve been going through a period of congested mempool so right now it’s kinda expensive to move coins fast. 
When a wallet offers you different tiers of fee to pay, they make an estimation at that moment for each tier. Super economy now and super economy tomorrow might vary a lot, as well as the time to be processed.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:58:48
Don’t try to time the market, you will get your ass kicked. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:00:36
What they say is that is a privacy issue if you use always the same address since the balance on that specific address can be checked by anyone you share it with. The idea is they only are able to see the balance their own transaction generated, so no new info is shared.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:40:07

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:23:08
You can check your balance? If you can without introducing a passphrase my guess is it’s not encrypted.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:28
Well, if you are sitting on a lot, I’d definitely move my coins to a hardware wallet, like trezor or ledger nano. They make it really safe to store coins. They keep your private key offline, and even use a unsafe pc (as in having virus ready to steal your coins) and won’t get to them, since the device never exposes the private key to the pc you’re using. Also, to backup your wallet it will give you a 24 word list that acts as a seed to regenerate your private keys. People engrave those words on metal plates. Having the words is all you need to recover your coins. Not depending on hardware feels much more safe, to be honest. Maybe this is a great opportunity for you to take this extra step.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:47:10
If that’s all you got, I’m sorry but you won’t recover your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:18:34
The moment you decrypt the private key in your pc to use it  you’re exposing it. That never happens with a hardware wallet, so it’s not exactly the same.

"crash" define crash, because we had a 20% dip this week, and it was almost a non-event. also, upcoming years... 
Well, sometime between now and the upcoming years it will rain, heavily.like, a lot. no matter where you are. Bitcoin is volatile, and it has recovered pretty quick every time it dipped ths year, because it has the manpower behind to sustain it, and it didn't had that before. you know how many people have  buy orders above 9000? it would take a huge market shift to break through that. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:45

Can this shift just before the futures market be a tactic to make it easier to short? (Inflating the price with those news?)
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:42:44
Nope. Make sure you use a wallet that supports bip39, gives you seed words and back that list of words offline safely. Better multiple copies, multiple locations.

Yeah but every single shitcoin was born that way. There are already thousands of shitcoins out there. If all those wasted dollars were put in just a few, real projects, we would be in a much better place. But there are too many people building it’s own coin or token. It won’t be special to anybody, just that you “control it” (more or less depending on how you built it) but nobody will use it. 
TLDR: Focus on the real coins, you’re damaging the crypto community by not pushing the real coins and projects.

One more time, back up your seeds. You’ll need them. Your coins are not on the trezor. Your coins are kept with the seed. Your trezor is only a convenient way to access them. Trezor will ask you for your seeds sometimes when updating. Keep them safe. Several copies. Look at products like cryptosteel. 
BACK UP YOUR SEEDS.

My approximation for the near future is to be something like gold. Lots of people use it as a shelter, but not for day to day operations. I’m not sure if btc could become more mainstream than gold, so much mainstream that we could use it in day to day exchanges. Btc is 0,1% of what gold is right now, so lots of room for growth. One could ask why don’t we use gold online since it’s value  is accepted universally  (More in a retoric point than a real one) 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:18:59
That seems tough. How did you stored those btc?
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:00:29
What is this "Cash out" you're talking about? Here we HODL. Seriously though, have actual coins, and yeah the market is very volatile, but on the long run it looks like it'll keep going up. You might wanna try and predict the dips to make profit. I'm not sure but I think sometimes it's cheaper to buy other coin instead of fiat, although I'm not sure about that. I personally use kraken for fast trading.
This is not finantial advise. There's also sites like 1broker that allows to invest with bitcoin, or copy other traders strategy. of course this is a tough game, the good thing is that you can raise your number of btc, but of course you can lose too. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:12:37

When something starts going up  too fast, it’s expected to get a sudden dip, to counter balance that extra growth. It happens organically, basically people selling thinking the burst of the bubble is coming soon and start selling fast to rebuy back making profit.

nothing of the backend has been exposed. They showed a fake (10 digit) public and private key, as an example of hoy it would work (on a pdf). no other info has been disclosed, only the tweets of Kim bragging about bitcoin, it's the only coin he mentions (existing or new)
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:57:47
Yeah it did. it's like two separate things. K.im (the platfrom where you upload and share the files) and bitcache witch is the payment platform. probably bitcache would have an api and will allow it's use in any site with integration. so, you upload the file, say what bitcache account to link the file to, (you could create a demo account of bitcache on the spot, but you couldn't see any control panel for it) with $10 worth of coins inside (demo). for the most part you don't see the bitcoin part, but it's definitely a wallet. we also don't know how to put money on it yet.

Restoring a wallet on a fresh machine:
Start Bitcoin-Core (daemon or Qt), shut it down after it has started up (you only do that to create the necessary data directory)
Replace wallet.dat with your backed-up wallet.dat (see  if you can't find the data dir)
Startup Bitcoin-Core, wait until your node is in sync (can take a couple of hours/days)

Fees won’t correlate to the amount of btc moved. They correlate to the size the transaction will take in the block. Short term the best way to get low fees is promote and use segwit transactions. From there, other measures will be taken to reduce fees on the midterm.

Hardware wallet is a usb stick with a screen that is offline. You need to connect it to a pc to use it, but your private keys stay in the device and the pc has no access to them. You can plug a hardware wallet and operate with your coins in a insecure pc, full with viruses, and bad guys won’t be able to grab them. 
Wallet apps are less secure as the keys are in the device, and it’s usually online, maybe even permanently online. A virus programmed to look for private keys might find them and steal your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:28:33
I don’t follow the logic either. I’m guessing they are also buying coins atm, so they are actually buying bitcoin now and storing them for a year? That would make them profitable.

We need mass adoption of segwit as a first step. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:43:19
It doesn’t work like that. They are not assigned. It’s just so difficult to create the same address twice that we just don’t check for that. If I recall correctly the number of possible addresses are approximately the number of atoms in the world, so yeah. Picking the same as any other is not happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:18:05
They keep your private keys 100% offline, even when you spend coins. If coinbase gets hacked, or shut down by a government, or goes rogue, or decides to freeze your account, or a virus catches your coinbase credentials, you're out of your coins. 
there's a say around here. If you down own your private keys you don't own your coins.
This devices store a 24 word seed that translates to your private key, using a system that is open source (if the hardware wallet provider goes out of business you still can produce your private keys). when you set it up it gives you those 24 words, and never again. you have to write them down (offline) and keep them in the safest system that works for you, since if your hardware wallet stops working or get lost, the only chance to recover it is with those words. Some engrave them in metal, so you get the idea.
As for normal use. you plug it in, you enter a pin using a display in the device (even if you're using a compromised pc they won't be able to get that pin right.) And hopefully a 25th word that completes your 24 seed word with one extra one. That ensures that even if someone stole that 24 word list from you, they'll still be short of one word to get real access. 
When you're ready to send your coins, you have to verify everything in the hardware wallet display, and press the physical button on the device (without pressing that button you can't proceed with the transaction, so no virus can work in the background to make secret transactions.) When you confirm the transaction, it's the device that signs the transaction, and passes the signed transaction to the pc. that way, the private key never leaves the device, no matter how many viruses the pc has, your coins are safe. If the pc attpemts to modify that transaction the signature would be invalid so there's no way they can break it. 
As long as you keep those 24 seed words safe, it fucking solid.
The most common are ledger nano s or trezor

Meh, that would be true if NYA succeeded a couple weeks ago. A group of companies, the biggest around, agreed to fork bitcoin to “upgrade” it. They had 80% of the hash power, so it was a solid success. Most of the community vouched against it, as well as other companies. Slowly, they started to lose mining power. (This was all pre-fork) a week before the fork, they new it would be a complete mess. They pulled out. 
So yeah, with enough community consensus. Our message gets around loud and clear. That doesn’t mean miners are a huge part of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:08:50

Is it actually a dip? Take a look right now. Has it just go down 70$ because of normal fluctuation or is it a dip going down several hundreds? 
Starts of dips are only clear after well in the dip. We’ve all been there, trying to time the market. It doesn’t go well. But you’ll try anyways, because we all tried anyways, because you think you can actually better than all the rest. And you might come lucky a couple times, and you’ll lose money soon. And it depends to you on how much money you lose before understanding that you can’t time it. Buy cheap, and hold as much as you can without selling. Maybe set aside part of it, so you can gamble with it.

Consensus is stablished with hashing power, the more hashing power path is the one it’s taken. 
Right now everybody in BTC or bch agrees to follow a path, but if there is not consensus their hashing power will break in 2, and the strongest one will win. It’s almost like voting. 
The thing is, BTC won’t try to harm itself and the consensus will go forwards the best option (considering what the majority wants is supposed to be better).
If bch decided to decide something harmful on BTC, they would only have a 10% of the hashing power. 
But if BTC decided to put some hashing power on bch and make some nasty decisions, those would be instantly a majority. That’s why only the strongest coin of Heath type of hashing power should be consider safe.

You can have as many as you want, for different wallets. While it’s posible, don’t set up the same wallet in a hardware wallet and in a software one, since it would defeat the purpose of the hw.

You probably can’t, I sure hope so. Nothing personal, but they should not be able to steal coins from a stolen phone. We don’t even know if you’re telling the truth, maybe were helping a thief. 
I can’t stress enough how important the seed is. That’s the single most important thing to have. Devices and wallets are convenient ways to access your coins, but fuck, you need the seed. If you don’t have the seed is a matter of time until you lose the coins.

Failure can happen. They can be (and are) the target of many hacking attacks. They manipulate private keys to send coins so they are available in the network.

They just pushed the block size limit up, witch solves high fees/slow transactions, but makes it bad longterm. Bigger blocks really make the coin more centralized, bigger fewer miners controlling the network.

Blocks are going full most of the time at this moment, so you either wait or pay extra to get your transaction go through, and that makes the prices go up. Solutions to the scalability problem are being worked out (Segwit, lightning) This was the main reason for the failed fork (Segwit2x) but most of the community came together and agreed that just changing the blocksize limit wasn't a good solution (And I agree)

Well if they aren’t encrypted I would definitely don’t recommend breadwallet. 
And I would argue that no, it’s not the same case. A smashed screen is a smashed screen. Trying to get access to hidden data that gives you control of any amount of bitcoin without any proof is just hacking your way to get coin. Again, I hope it’s not recoverable. Because that would mean breadwallet is vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:40:17
It’s a bit late now to do the transfer, with the current transaction times. If tools for your wallet won’t appear (they will, people want as much free money as they can get) you can get your private keys from the recovery seed. I think Coinbase will end up not supporting it, so you’d be sending coins with a fee twice, just to end up how you are now. If b2x happens It’s going to be way too cheap to be worth the hassle. I’m guessing 50$ per coin, taking into account that Coinbase will block transactions until it settles. 
Too many ifs in the equation. Not worth. If it ends up being something you’ll be able to sell them from your ledger, probably through ShapeShift or similar.

Of course that’s not representace of anything, but come on, most people own more that that.

Oh it takes time. I talked bitcoin to friends a couple years ago. I forgot about it myself for a while (after buying). Then Last year. then on April. On April I got some traction, 4 friends jumped in. Summer, a couple more. Now I'm getting 3 calls a week.

Probably, but most don’t own a full coin, so this comparison is not really meaningful.
The this is, coins are limited to 21 million. If you get to own more than one, you’ll be in an amazing position for the future, as bitcoins if it all goes well would have to be split between billions of people...

You first put money in, via transfer or credit card. Credit card has fees. Maybe those are those fees. And also, it’s a two step process. After getting the money in the platform you actually have to buy the coin you want. It sounds like you just made the transfer...

If someone puts an order for 5000 btc to sale at 8000$, when the price hits 8000 it will execute his order. if there's not enough people buying, price will drop, since someone's selling and nobody's buying. you it might cause a drop. 
The other way around you basically keep the coin from dropping value since if you keep buying at 7000 the price won't drop below that. 
Sometimes people speculate with that when they see (or create) a wall, but take into account that the one that sets up a wall can remove it at any time if it hasn't executed yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:03:59
“Not sure if now”. Bitcoin always fluctuate a lot.  saying it will drop 20% at some point is like saying it will rain. Yeah, eventually. That’s not a prediction. If you think it’s close, sell your coins, make profit rebuying low!

When de dip comes it’s because there’s FUD all around. Don’t expect a dip when everyone says “yay everything is going perfect and this dip is just waiting for you to buy!” Dips happen for a reason. Good job holding, but if you wanna buy the dips you’ll gonna get a strong mind. 
TLDR:there’s no dip without FUD.

We’ve been there. Look at all the dips this year. Most just bounced back even higher, after just days. We’ve just came out of a dip and you’re already calling the next.

Segwit is backwards compatible, so you can operate with them as usual, but only the transactions from your wallet are cheap because they work as a segwit transaction. When you receive coins from gdax, they come from a legacy address and fees are paid in full.

Yeah, but they still have the most frictionless entry to crypto out there. I don’t use them but when I’m spreading the word about bitcoin I recommend them to start out. The. To put coins in your own cold storage of choice, but they got that right. Lots of work to do yet to lower the entry barrier. Which I’m not even sure I want, since I only truly push my friends into investing after a lengthy explanation about how the technology works, and only like that you’ll be able to be smart about crypto.

By the way, you can send coins to and from segwit addresses, to and from non-segwit wallets

My thoughts, it’s not enough money. Not the loss of 30 million tethers that are being blocked, and not if the whole tether thing bursts. If they’re really printing tethers without a good chunk of cash to back it up, it will sure cause a dip in the price, but I think it would be a minor one.

Good addition. Creating FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) in the information channels can also alter the price, maybe even creating a self fulfilling prophecy, ie:
 "Bitcoin is gonna crash!" -&gt; people sell to protect themselves from the crash
if the FUD is strong enough, enough people will sell that the coin actually starts going down, and once it starts falling the prophecy is true so even more people sell, making the coin crash

The requirements that appear in bitcoin.org (long story short, you need more RAM):
Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
145 gigabytes of free disk space
2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 140 gigabytes the first time you start your node.
6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.

@_date: 2017-11-03 14:58:00
Again, I don’t think you can buy bitcoin without having money in Coinbase. It’s a two step process.
Youu first transfer money. You can’t buy bitcoin unless you have the money in your account, and only then. 
Then, you buy btc, and that’s what a pending transaction is. 
What probably happened is that you clicked on buy btc, the web suggested you don’t have funds and to recharge your account, and that you did. But that doesn’t fulfill the crypto purchase. It just cancels it and makes you do the transfer.

the word is hodl. it is a meme, but it's true. I would buy again, don't try to time the market. you might buy and dip just after a few hundred. it's okay, after a week or two it will be back on it's feet.

The goal is to be able to keep secure your coins, both from strangers and your own incompetence.   Entropy is a non-issue for me. The password is strong enough, and the most important part, it’s vistually impossible to lose access to my coins which is what I value the most.

Difficulty adapts with miners availability. If it’s too difficult, miners will drop. Not all at the same time, that’s doesn’t make any sense since each node has its own cost/profit ratio. If miners leave, difficulty goes down until if finds a sweetspot. In fact, it’s always at a sweetspot, just like now. So go write fan fiction about something you actually know about.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:19:58
The scarcity is a key part of this (imo). only 15 million coins at this moment, probably more like 11 with all the lost "worthless" coins some years ago. 11 million units of currency for the whole world.

There's a movement, the ball is starting to roll. 72 businesses are a lot imho (I wish there were hundreds ofc) I think It'll start first online. It's been used for years in tor. it will come to our internet. more and more businesses online are accepting it, new services and better apis are growing all around btc. I've used Dotcom's demo, and it's easy enough for many people not savvy enough to fully understand btc to use it in a simple way (imagine thousands of youtuber fans making microdonations through bitcoin to their favourite creator). And he created some huge services in the past, with megaupload being one of the best online storage solutions of it's moment. And there's many more. se see some flashy ones trying to get funded, but there's a lot of people involved. 
We're building the technology as we go!

Does mycelium keeps my private keys encrypted? Does it connect to any server and why? Is it sending info or only receiving? Are ads sandboxed somehow? Am I able to see my private keys on screen(making it vulnerable to viruses that capture my screen)? Are the wallets behind a password or code so if my phone is stolen my coins are safe? What recovery protocol does it use and how extended it is? Is it open source and has it been vetted?
That’s what I need to know about a wallet that is connected to the internet, of the top of my head.

@_date: 2017-10-26 10:02:15
Yeah, completely agree. It can take months to sort this one out if the fork happens, imagine mainstream media comments, all the FUD, all the casuals dropping coins. I think it would take us back in time. 
After that, mainstream media would have a new mantra "What would prevent this from happening again?" and they'd for once would have a solid argument.

@_date: 2017-10-13 09:09:07
Store. You buy them on exchanges and then you move them out. If you have more than 800$ invested I'd go with a trezor or ledger nano s, incredibly safe. (80-100 $) If you have less, I'd use a software wallet, maybe mycellium, or electrum, there are lots. since I own a trezor I don't look much to software wallets.

A hardware wallet will always show in its display all the relevant info about the transaction, sending address, quantity... And you'll have to confirm it only using the hardware button. That signs the transaction on the device and passes the signed transaction to the pc. your private keys never leave the device and the signed transaction can't be modified without breaking the signature and make it completely useless. it's a very clever design and it has even more cool security features that are absolutely great.

mempool has been a bit saturated this days. I truly think you'll still receive your coins. Fees are a bit low, But I think it'll clear out eventually.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:11:46
The seeds use a standard protocol to generate your keys. There are lots of open source tools that would generate your private key again to get access (Electrum to name one)

This drop has actually helped my anxiety. I checked way too much the price.  Of course the drop was hard to take, but you learn to take it more calmly. Now a couple times a week at most. 
Bitcoin was way too much in my head when the price was rocketing up (not that I complain about that) but now either if it’s falling or growing I know the community that is working on crypto keeps working on it and I truly believe crypto is part of the future, the price will come, since there are just 21 million coins

Id buy a hardware wallet (I have one) when the investment of buying it is worth it. For me, if you own more than 8 times the cost of a hardware wallet in coin, you should get one.

There's a transaction id generated. it's longer than the addresses itself. What wallet are you using?
EDIT: and probably one of the public addresses should work, but never tried that

@_date: 2017-09-18 23:22:32
Thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:25:53
Hardware wallets are very very safe. I own a trezor and I couldn't be happier. it will give you a seed to recover your wallet, and new addresses to send your coins, like a usual transaction. you'll have a pin and the possibility to add a passphrase that would work as an extra word for your seed. 
You'll get the seed that generates your private address but you won't see it (there are generators to get it, but no need)
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:41:15
Well it's going down.

How would you deposit bitcoin into a wallet in the first place without exposing it?

Coinbase has a widget and an alert function. I don’t think it has an Iwatch interface
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:06:24
I need to understand, will they "duplicate the coins" like with bch or depending on where we have the coins they will get converted to one or another?

Bitcoin is open source code. That means it's public, you can see it, read it. Even modify it for your use with the license it has. You're two clicks away from creating your own Uncle_Ebeenezer1 coin. (It would be worth nothing, bout don't let that stop you) That proves that bitcoin code is very secure, since even seeing exactly how it's written, it can't be hacked (for now?) 
The thing is, The same way you can create a new coin from it, others can. If instead of you, someone with enough authority comes modifying the original code to make it better (from their stand point) They can create a new coin that can hijack the original. It's called fork because it splits like a bifurcation. it's a general term that can be applied to any piece of code that is shared, not specific to the crytocurrency world. 
TLDR: One piece of public code is copied by someone and a new version is generated. It's for the user to decide witch one is better.
For extra visuals: This is the icon that is usually represented with :

Wtf. They are seizing your money.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:29:32
It depends of  how much fees you decided to pay. coinbase overpays fees, so they are very fast. Other wallets allow you to choose between options how much you wanna pay. Basically, you just have to wait. It'll arrive. If you need it faster you'll have to pay bigger fees. also, you can check

It's worth the investment and they're very secure. they have backup, and you can protect that backup. It can't just be all explained in a reddit comment though. Watch some videos, read about it. It's all there and it's worth it.

Bitcoin core is a group of developers that had brought us this far. I’m afraid a new team with no proof of their hability can be in charge of the surviving coin.

@_date: 2017-10-13 18:29:24
Get the fuck away from that. 
Even if they try to be legit, you need physical buttons, and a screen. If not, you'll have to accept what your computer screen says, so you miss the complete purpose. Either it's a scam or at best is a regular usb with a software wallet in.

“Getting your bitcoins”? First buy them. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:30:48

This is answered 20 times a day, every day. check the side bar, check recent posts. I'll copy paste my answer that I gave literally half an hour ago:
You buy them on exchanges and then you move them out. If you have more than 800$ invested I'd go with a trezor or ledger nano s, incredibly safe. (80-100 $) If you have less, I'd use a software wallet, maybe mycellium, or electrum, there are lots. since I own a trezor I don't look much to software wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:15:39
Can it keep up with the chain and work like one more? It's not for profit, just to make the network bigger and try to show some  appreciation.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:41:16
Apart from the spam, are you sure your bank won’t change it for current money?
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:09:26
A paper wallet would be nice and instant
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:48:57
Also, if you're not in a rush electrum will update "very soon" to segwit, so you can change your wallet to a segwit one and benefit from low fees

No, because you still need a pc to use it. it stores your private keys with no batery, just like an usb. Then you can plug it to any pc, even one with viruses that are scanning your pc fot bitcoin keys or transactions they can mess up with. You access the software of the trezor (it's a chrome extension in the chrome extension market.) Then it asks you for a pin that you already set up. but you can't type it with your keyboard. you're presented with a 3x3 empty board, and you have to look at the screen of the device to see how are the numbers mixed. Every time you plug it in, a random board appears on the device, so knowing with blank square on your pc you clicked there's no way to match it with your actual pin. Then, you put a passphrase in witch works as a 25th seed word, that unencrypts your private keys, only in the device. Then you operate (the device passes the public keys to the pc so you can check your balances) If you want to send money, you create a transaction on the pc, and send it to the device. the device shows the true info, who you're sending it to, and how much. then you aggre phisically on the device (not clicking on the pc, only way to sign a transaction is in your device) and that signed transaction goes to your pc. If it's altered, the signature would break. then it's pushed into the mempool to be processed. it's a very clever design. Also, it's compatible with other softwares so you're not dependant on trezor as a company to keep open to access your coins
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:23:42
Gotcha. Yes, seed (and passphrase depending on how you used it) is all you need. It’s a backup.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:57:59
Next time maybe add a qr code to make it easier to pay!
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:27:54
I am so sorry. If you don’t get access to that wallet, or the private keys, or the seeds that generate them... there’s nothing you can do. No receipt can generate your private keys back.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:02:26
WHAT? no. They keep safe the keys to your wallet. like saying your home keys store all your home and thing you have in it. nope, it just allows you access to it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:38:00
That's actually a quite clever idea, I might do something like that someday. I'll have to have backups and all, since futureme might just close at some point, but that would be a great way to hodl
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:57:18
It will go down, sure. I'm just saying it will be because of events. We've been through 3000 without any dip. 4000 was mixed with all the china and jp morgan drama. 5000 (big goal) And didn't feel it at all. Sure it can go down, I'm not saying it will only going up
Thousand marks are not psychological marks anymore. People is hodling tight.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:45:45
Yeah, stay tight. Clever people are working to fix that kind of problems. Segwit2x is not a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:43:45
are you planning to sale? (or sold already?) Most of us are here for the long run, and timing the market usually ends up with loses.
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:35:57
Yes, and you can pay to get in and you can convince 5 guys to buy them there.
Anyways I was talking more on a general basis.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:01:56
“Current trend”... the way I see it it just bumped up 10% aprox in one hour and just stayed there. It’s a spike, how can you see a trend there?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:52:00
Best way it take them out of the exchanges, your own wallet with your private keys. Then you can evaluate and get your coins accordingly
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:13:25
Yeah, I admit I haven’t mated much attention other than a couple videos I watched from our champion, so maybe there’s more to it. In Europe pin and chip are available everywhere so I didn’t think that could be a bit of a challenge.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:49:51
yep, some exchanges broke the 5000 barrier
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:11:34
Huh, I haven't thought of that. TIL. Interesting!
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:44:41
Segwit addresses don’t get new coins?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:28:41
...Or a single big bank from USA. It's tiny compared to many other markets
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:15:23
The article he quotes is from august....
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:15:17
I don't have any recall of that but that would be great.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:48:43
No segwit addresses?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:29:36
If you wanna rebuy afterwards you want to pull the money out of the exchange? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:21:29
I don't see any crash of alts, witch ones are you reffering to?
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:05:14
Depending on how much coin you’re holding. While their interface is neat, I’d only use it for small amounts, but that’s me because at this point I only want to work with hardware wallets... 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:14:33
Well you will buy mBTC or satoshis...
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:07:33
Welcome, you’re an early adopter!
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:26:16
Oh I get that, we don't like bitpay, but I thought you mean't something else. You can pay in bitcoin for the game. I can see the utility for businesess to use services like bitpay, since that allows them to automate the process without too much of a hassle. The fact that transatcions aren't immediate brings a  problem they might not want to have to deal with. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:00:02
Trezor uses a 24 seed protocol. but, for extra safety you can put an extra passphrase, one you can choose on your own. I'm guessing you don't own one jet since you didn't know there were 24 seed words. Basically you can add a passphrase that the trezor mixes in (compatible with other apps, same protocol) and any diferent passphrase would create a vaild account, so can have as many accounts as you want, behind different passphrases, with the 24 seed words as base.  taht word you'll type it in every time you need to access your account, like a password. really handy

Electrum 3 is the new hl3
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:53:05
I don't expect the fork to be cancelled. It does seem like it's losing steam, and it will end being an alt coin more.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:40:24
The problem is, you’re asking the wrong question. If I sleep with my front door unlocked but no thieve has yet tried to open it, is it safe? I’ve never been robbed, so I guess so... 
Listen what they are telling you and don’t be so arrogant. Or don’t listen. Your coins after all.

Where are you located?
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:53:30
Oh boy. Nope, the higher the fee you pay the faster it will get to you. Some wallets will detect the oncoming transaction and mark it as pending on your receiving wallet, but short answer is no, it takes some time to go through the network.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:35:39
As you say, maybe it will shrink quietly enough so when the last bch node turns off it won’t be news for anybody.hopefully.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:20:29
By telling me to don’t engage, you’re telling me to shut up. I think it’s quite clear, and here you do it again. Another user asked a question and I answered.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:32:05
R/Bitcoin not allowing to talk about alt coins is not censorship, in the same way you won’t be allowed to post Bitcoin stuff in some cooking sub. You can create any sub you want. They can. They indeed control they can literally talk about bch anywhere they want. Why can’t they go talk about bch on dogecoin? Censorship is not this.
Where are all the litecoin supporters demanding not to be censored? The iota guys? Any other crypto coin supporters?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:29:42
The thing is I don’t agree with your last point. Well, partly, like with this pointless argument. 
They have rich leaders that will buy minutes on tv, interviews in articles, and relevant domains to spread their bullshit. And you say “let’s not fight back”. Well, you stay sitted if you want, but they will do a lot of harm. They are known to be full of shit and that doesn’t stop them to get huge media attention. I not the one promoting them, they are the ones trying to destroy btc.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:37:08
Bch claims to be the real Bitcoin. Roger Ver (the biggest impulsor) makes multiple claims a day and all he does is whine about how his coin is the real Bitcoin. He also claims bch to be the fastest growing crypto ever, witch makes no sense, either bch is the real original Bitcoin that was born in 2009 as he claims, (meaning the price crashed 90% when the fork occurred) or it was born that day, so it Can’t be the real Bitcoin. He and his entourage owns Bitcoin.com and controls and also the twitter handle  They use lots of money to make people think their coin is the original one, using those platforms to spread the message ad pass them as true. Bitcoin community have no problem with any other Bitcoin fork, being very friendly even with other ones like litecoin. The whole message of bch is trying to replace Bitcoin. They don’t talk about innovation, they basically spread fud about Bitcoin, and use their corporations to do it, while a huge part of the community have to push against it to defend Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:10:18
So you’re against censorship but at the same time telling me to shut up? He can say all that and I’ll say it’s a scam. 
“By the way, send me 0.5btc and I’ll sure send you 5btc, special offer for the upcoming 10 anniversary of the white paper”
“It’s a scam!”
“Hey it’s a free word dude”
Well, it’s still a scam.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:01:27
I agree. How is bch getting censored?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:50:55
Bcash blocks are empty right now. Just keep increasing block size as all innovation.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:25:30
Just three days ago, wanting to buy in. But sure, we are the ones over reacting. 
Look at his twitter timeline. Half his tweets are to attack Bitcoin. But sure, we are the ones over reacting. 
He has reach, he has money, and he wants more of both, to promote his scam.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:45:09
Well. no. It jumped at 5k, so the bottom of the cliff being at 8k is quite inaccurate. Funny, but very inaccurate. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:51:32
Yeah, you’re right. Litecoin was inspired by, and in technical details is nearly identical to bitcoin, but it’s not a fork.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:51:47
You mean in the last 3 days? Please. I hope you’ve been around more than 2 months. If that’s the case you sure know short term changes have nothing to do in this volatile market. Do you remember which was of both coins took a bigger hit on the recent crash? Also, I can keep my breath for thirty seconds. If this continues that will mean I’d be the first human without the need to breathe. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:15:59
Look at the original comment. He literally asks about what’s going on with bch vs btc. I’m telling him what is going on. I’m trying to help around. Maybe your message wasn’t directed to me, but then maybe you shouldn’t have replied to me, but directly to the post as a parent comment.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:57:28
Why would I stop saying that? Am I supposed to shut up while “fake satoshi” goes around in conferences telling the same bullshit to newcomers? The guy claimed to be satoshi and tried to tamper evidence. Those are the main guys behind bch. When it all falls apart, the whole crypto community will suffer the blow, and the bigger they get the harder our community will be damaged. So there’s that. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:28:44
I hope so, but I don’t think so. If it crashes hard enough, it would be in the media. And people will hear Bitcoin cash has crashed. And you know what they’ll hear. Panic spreads fast and don’t need any arguments. All the work explaining crypto around you will be crushed with “Hey but I heard bitcoin crashed, hard. What a scam.” And you could try to explain, but they won’t be listening.

What's the status on segwit?
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:35:14
My approach is look at the mempool size, is it clear or full? Then look at the last couple blocks, see the stats, ignore the highest fee but look more to the average fee and median if possible. Remember average means “half” paid less than that and made it to the block. (I know is not half).
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:35:53
Read and watch videos, as mentioned above, Andreas Antonopoulos will bring you up to speed in no time understanding bitcoin. There are lots of his talks on YouTube. 
Don’t buy big the first time. Use a respectable exchange and make sure you’re in the right place. 
Buy small first, dable with it. It’s recommended not to store coins on the exchange you buy them. Move them to a personal wallet. If you’re thinking about buying a considerable amount, I’d suggest a hardware wallet. Investigate on them, I personally use trezor. 
Anyways, get yourself a personal wallet, there are plenty, just make sure to read online about them. If you do everything fine it should be safer for you to store your coins yourself than depending on exchanges that can close your account for no reason, limit it, block it, get hacked... again look into hardware wallets for cold storage.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:01:15
It certainly is, and roger ver is trying to buy into the sub (as he did with Bitcoin.com and  offering $100.000 to reddit if they admitted a moderator of his choice here.
