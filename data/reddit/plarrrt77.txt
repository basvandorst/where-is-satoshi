It's above everyone right now. You could code it fairly easily with Ethereum, but then you wouldn't be able to store your BTC in there (until some sort of bridge like polkadot is available). Also, Ethereum contract coding is still in its infancy and best practices are not well known. So storing it that way might be risky in the short term. But I'd expect that 10 years from now that will be the canonical way to give your crypto once you die.
*EDIT: I also assume you'll be able to do this with rootstock since it's sort of textbook use case for smart contract platform.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:34:56
A more robust approach would be to use a death switch smart contract with a function amIDead() that returns False and keeps doing so as long as you keep calling imStillAlive() function every once in a while. Then store your funds in multisig which uses amIDead() to determine if m-of-n of the key holders can withdraw. This way, you can tell everyone right away what the deal is, and how all of this is supposed to work.

Maybe people don't want to use Segwit, and prefer old style tx?
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:44:44
Yeah, but then, you're the miner no?
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:50:37
I know the feeling :) my first "real-world" tx was for a burger a few years back. 
For the sake of the conversation, would you mind looking up your tx fee?

If management doesn't plain suck they should already have some sort of migration plan. You don't have to migration every subsystem at once, you can do it over time. And potentially simply deprecate some of the older subsystems that aren't going to be needed a few years down the road (eg management might know that insurance department is going away so they can afford to maintain that old system for a few years)
At any rate, this is a business/management/IT discussion that is completely unrelated to Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:30:04
So would you say BTC isn't a great use case for locals?
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:16:32
The difference is I'm not brainwashed like 80% of people around here. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:31:35
Correct. I've been predicting a stock market crash for the last 7 years. I'm still going so hopefully I'll be right soon
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:00:44
Converting to anything. BTC traded for ETH (or any other shit coins as you call them here) is a taxable event 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:30:27
Why would I be salty? I'm still long BTC. I disagree with you, miners certainly do decide something. They decide what software they run, just like you do.

You're me in 2013
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:20:31
I'm also long on Ethereum, but they've started to feel the same pain Bitcoin has been feeling. Their milestones are being delayed for the same reason: gotta be careful making modifications to something worth $30B. The main difference is that Ethereum embraces hardforks while for Bitcoin hardforks are (by definition of its main use cases) the absolute evil. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:37:49
No foreign but you could argue the rate I get sucks, but certainly not 5% spread. 
Regarding Japan/us, it really depends which rate provider they use. 
I'd still argue that 37 cents fee for my daily curry is too expensive. Comes down to almost $100 over a year. For all of us who made big $$$ with crypto, $100 is nothing. But it's a ton of money for most people on this planet. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:51:18
No offense, but 0.37$ tx fee is too high even for your luxurious $10 curry. Also at 30/40 what's the average confirmation time you think? Should I pay my meal before I start eating?
Edit: and just so we are clear. I've paid for food countless times with Bitcoin in 2013/2014. Today there's no fucking way I'd deal with the hassle give the state of the network. Fuck that I'll use visa or cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:02:39
I meant to say that Janet doesn't give a fuck about that flag. OP's bravado is lame af
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:07:45
My point is actually very simple. There has to be miners for whatever version of Bitcoin you want your node to accept tx/blocks for no? If all miners decide to run new software, you're free to keep running the old software for you node, but someone also needs to take the place of these miners who left. You're free to do that too, but then you become the mean miner
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:03:38
Yes, but there weren't silly tribal fights back then. I'm subbed to both subreddit and I can tell you the average redditor on both of these subs are absolute idiots. The main issue now is that it's quite obvious Bitcoin can't innovate without having to pay high political cost. And innovation comes once every few months (years?). In 2013/2014, we thought Bitcoin would be used for 100s of use cases. Now it's pretty much stuck to store of value/speculation, and I can't see how that'll change. 
Still super long BTC/BCH...
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:35:13
I'm tired of waiting. I've been waiting since 2013 for all these cool applications and all I got is a bunch of territorialists arguing on Twitter. Where LN? How long did we have to wait for Segwit? And yet, wallets aren't ready for it. My point is that Bitcoin people stopped focusing on innovation and started focusing on "protect my tribe" a few years ago. 
*Edit: what I'm waiting for to sell BCH? Nothing, I won't sell. Contrary to 90% of idiots both here and on I don't see things in black or white. I think both BTC and BCH have a role to play. I know that's not a popular on either subs
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:32:17
Wow you really showed them
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:40:24
"tribalism is healthy" please, provide some arguments for that. I would certainly argue that tribalism has stiffled innovation in Bitcoin in the last 3 years. Tribalism means your tribe is right no matter the evidence or arguments. This means both parties are going toward suboptimal solutions just because that's the solution their tribe has been vouching for. I'm not saying BTC or BCH is better, I'm saying if you can't see on the gray scale then you're part of the problem not of the solution. 
edit: typo
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:26:26
I'm am SDE not a PM. I understand LN and it's dep on Segwit. I understand it's complex and it takes time to properly test. I'm not disagreeing with any of this... And yes Bitcoin is an amazing tech solving an important problem. As I said, I'm super long BTC/BCH
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:21:31
The rules cant change except for the PoW algo?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:51:51
I never expected it to be ready a year ago. My whole point is that now that Bitcoin is worth $70B, things are moving slower for a reason. That's not the case for smaller blockchains that can innovate much faster. On top of that, tribalism has pushed a lot of good devs away. Nobody likes to work on an environment where two sides can't talk to each others on Twitter without accusations starting to fly. Plus the amount of toxic trolls on both sides does nothing to help. 
FYI there are plenty of state channel solutions that are already implemented and working on other blockchains. 
As I've said, I've been waiting since 2013 for cool techs to come to Bitcoin, and even Segwit hasn't reached the mass yet...
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:39:56
Nice, so your 7$ curry cost you how much in tx fee exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:21:07
18 years
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:37:38
What do you mean miners don't decide hard fork? If they run software B instead of A then they definitely forked... I mean you can certainly keep mining A but then, you're the miner. 
Quality shit post right here
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:54:16
Well at least you guys aren't the only fools around!
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:52:20
Lol, you make 0 sense. Good luck
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:49:51
I agree. That's why I'm still long on BTC/BCH. But my initial point was that we (or at least I) aren't dreaming on decentralizing voting systems, replacing centralized exchanges, transferring land/property via a Bitcoin blockchains. Exactly because of the reason you are describing: it's a $70B asset and we need to be careful.
I disagree that any of these will happen on a Bitcoin L2 layer. It's going to happen with another blockchain that isn't worth $70B and so can innovate faster on the smart contract side. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:42:03
Yes, those technologies can't come fast enough...

If you had been on before the fork, this was 90% of the comment (and I was one of the one who agreed). See what happened with ETC.... Don't be so fast to judge
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:20:23
My main issue with ETC is the lack of ecosystem (very few dapps built on it), though a xchain solution like polkadot might mitigate that. Also they aren't planning to go PoS, so no sharding. I don't follow development of ETC, but I'm glad these folks got their own chain to enforce whatever definition of immutability they want.

Every hard fork is valid, as long as someone mines it and keeps that forked ledger alive  It doesn't mean that anyone has to use it, and it doesn't mean that txs ok that fork have any value outside of it. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:43:38
I don't mean in terms of price or holdings. The majority of my holdings is still BTC, I just don't use it to transact.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:17:52
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:45:32
I think that's because a large numbers of users have already figured out that sending BTC tx is expensive, so they've moved to other coins... I'm not fudding, just giving one possible reasons why mempool isn't as full as it used to be... I for one have stopped transacting with Bitcoin has much as possible. I had a few txs where I ended up paying 5$ of tx fee...
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:02:10
Precisely. IMO the ETH/ETC split was a really good thing since both communities got to focus on what mattered to them. I don't personally resent anyone who went ETC, that's their decision. Plus the fact that there's already a PoW ethereum clone means that there will already be a place for PoW miners once ethereum goes PoS, which means less likely to be conflict then. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:32:48
I'll consider any fork that I can use to transact and store value to be valid. I don't care how much hash power it has, as long as it's enough to keep my coins safe. But then, I'm not a maximalist, I see a future with 1000 blockchains working together. So it only makes sense in my view that Bitcoin forks every 4-5 years in order to keep innovation going. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:18:04
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:46:31
Yup, this is literally what ETH people were claiming about ETC. Whatever, you guys will learn your way I guess

Ethereum development was funded through an ICO
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:54:06
I think the situation between ETC and bcash is pretty similar, in the sense that they are "ideological" forks where the code is 99% the same, except for a few minor differences on consensus rules. Also very similar in the sense that both sides of the forks have very strong feelings and opinions, and very few people are objective about what's going on. Also the two Bitcoin subreddit contain about the same type and equivalent number of shit post that both ethereum subreddit had back then. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:53:55
Maybe that's just their optimal fees to minimize the cost of people creating support ticket to ask where their transactions are? With these fees, their txs are given extreme priority, thus reducing by X% the cost of hiring customer support to answer stupid tickets like "where's my BTC"? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:55:57
Best advice is don't listen to any advice on the internet, especially Reddit, and especially if it involves what you do with your money (eg buy that or this coin)
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:20:13
But the platform won't be targeted, only the applications (eg ico). Yes, if you use the ethereum platform to raise funds, you have obligations to the people who contributed. But if you fuck up, it's not the platform liability it's the applications. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:18:20
People on this subreddit cheering for SEC to come in and regulate ICO is quite ironic...

@_date: 2017-06-27 16:08:24
Well it's a matter of perspective. On the technical side, fundamentals of both dogecoin and Bitcoin are very very similar. There's more to that (eg how many merchants accept it) but if the dogecoin fundamentals are flawed, so are the Bitcoin ones. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:23:46
Ethereum supply isn't know?!? Can't you just start from Genesis blockchain supply, and add all block and uncle rewards to get total supply? You could certainly also just keep a very large set of accounts involved in a transaction, and at a a given block, get all balances...
There are a few claims in there would benefit from being better supported. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:24:56
Not true. The SEC job is to protect investors. You assume that all ICOs are bad which is a flawed assumption. That's going to hurt you the same way maximalists who believe only Bitcoin would reign are now wishing they had looked more seriously at contenders. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:12:00
Why not majority?
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:21:49
Not all ICOs are fully centralized, many of those erc20 tokens actually have a governance feature so decentralization happens through the token holders and their governance power. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:44:31
Can't tell if you're sarcastic...dogecoin and Bitcoin share 95% of their codebase no?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:59:41
You're biased and don't have a clear picture of the situation. Plenty of people were claiming ETC had no reason to exist, it's really the same with bcash.... You just happen to be on the side who thinks bcash has no reason to exist. There will be people on the other side of that opinion, and bcash will survive just like ETC did. And 6 months from now you'll be wondering why the fuck it's still around, just like many people did for ETC. 
Be aware of your biases and remember nothing is black or white.
