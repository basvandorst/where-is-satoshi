"Excluding the early paper currencies of China up until the 15th century and the majority of paper currencies that existed in China until 1935, there are 609 currencies no longer in circulation. Of these, at least 153 were destroyed as a result of hyperinflation caused by over-issuance. The remainder were revalued, destroyed by military occupation/liberation, renamed for political reasons, or were converted to another currency. The median age for these currencies is only seventeen years."
The main thing is that the integrity of our money is still intact.
The global money supply is $80trn which works out at $3.8m dollars per coin in discounted buying power. Wealth is never lost it is just transferred. Our time in the sun will come, just take a breather and don't invest too many emotions into the short term, learn to just take a step back once in a while, and just be a hodler.

Supply is not cut in half. The rate of new coins is cut in half. If there are 15m bitcoins and there are now 1,750 new coins per day instead of 3,500 coins per day. This means we are dealing with 1,750/15,000,000  * 100 = 0.01% increase in the number of coins per day vs 0.02% per day. Any increase in price will be sentiment.

New money (nouveau riche) has a massive propensity to spend, old money aires hoard it as the custodian doesn't feel like they earned it. This can be seen in philanthropy.

I've read is book "The Death of Money", it is a very interesting read. It was written a few years ago and barely touches on Bitcoin. I think his attitude towards bitcoin has softened over time. He was still adamant that the IMF with their SDR will become the overriding global currency after the collapse. The issue is there is no balance sheet to support any faith in the SDR after all fiat currencies have crashed. Bitcoin will replace the SDR, and hopefully destroy the IMF.

Your argument of the 3rd mortgage can be applied to the banks themselves, they took excessive risk and failed, now we pay.

The Presidents working group on financial markets and the banksters suppress the price of gold and silver on a massive scale as it is the antithesis of fiat currency. All evidence is pointing to the fact that there is no more gold in the west. This means that the west will be 100% under China's control if gold becomes the next pricing mechanism. They would much rather let BTC succeed and suppress gold right until the very end. There would be big problems if gold was seen as the defacto go to currency when very few people hold it. People are not going to trust any form of government issued note backed by gold or not as people's trust in government and the banks would have been irrevocably shattered after this next crash. The US could start paying civil servants in BTC and receive taxes in BTC and completely inflate the the fiat debt away. Every fiat currency becomes worthless. It's a stroke of genius, BTC has to be CIA. I see the the current POTUS as a potential martyr for the good of the planet.

My estimate is that Gold and Bitcoin are going to soar in the next crash, and when the dust settles Gold is going to be priced in BTC. People are then going find it pretty difficult to  buy a coffee with gold (or silver) and gold will come down massively in price relative to BTC. One thing is certain, the people aren't going to trust any paper currency issued by a government, whether it's gold backed or not. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 04:58:33
Physical gold is cumbersome to own, and paper gold, well that's just a Ponzi scheme and anything but a store of value. There are around 500 ounces of paper gold for every 1oz of real gold in the Comex vaults. That is going to affect true price discovery on a massive scale when it crumbles.

The bitcoin market cap is $15bn at the moment, with roughly 10m - 20m users (at a guess). We are just a blip on the radar so far. The tipping point for new technologies is roughly 100m users, when things really start to accelerate. The crucial time will be 100m - 1.4bn people (20% of world population) and how that wealth will be skewed (new global middle class) compared to the the top 100m. 
Edit: I would add that the "Goldilocks Zone" would limit the damage to the global economy, new industries would emerge the fastest based around bitcoin as more legacy business models fall by the way-side, as we pass the crossing point. Phased approach rather than big bang. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:51:08
Mathematically the tipping point is roughly 10%, M0 + M1 global money supply is USD81trn, so a market cap of $8.3trn, so roughly 100 times from where we are now.

Yes &amp; No. The difference between money and currency is that money is a store of value and currency is not. You have to then decide if bitcoin is a store of value.

Andreas mentions that this is a bad monetary experiment by the Indians. I am going to give them more credit than that, I think it could be an attitude of pain now being less than pain later and the countries that fail first are going to reap the biggest long term gains with BTC (or physical gold and silver). We are getting very close to global fiat crunch time.

They will likely try and leverage the system towards their own personal gain. Finding ourselves in exactly the same predicament we find ourselves in with fiat based currencies. The primary focus is to build a new Monetary system which will form the foundation for a new global micro and macro payment system (among other things). Personal interest and protectionism based on who is slightly in the lead at the moment is the wrong way to go about it. It is also not a given that a person with 1m BTC should have so much power because of that fact, it doesn't mean they are right. The attitude needs to be on what makes the most sense for the future of the ecosystem, not for me.

Coming from the 3rd world. Visa has to be the bridge that links the user with the bitcoin network. People still need help typing their pin codes into an ATM in Africa. The likes of Xapo and e-coin will bridge this gap well, but as the debit card falls away and people are confident with App functionality they won't change back to the likes of Coinbase. Are Coinbase an exchange or a wallet? Pre-paid airtime and bitcoin on the same platform which can be inter-changed regularly is a commodity in Africa, if the mobile operators like MTN / Vodacom are clever they can pivot and be the banks of the future piggy-backing on the current uses of airtime.

This is a crazy suggestion and don't expect you to take me up on it. I am one of the largest traders on local bitcoins for a particular small country. My personal stack is about 150BTC but I have an FX time delay of 4 days when my stack runs out. I'd be happy to Skype, provide my ID, and even a potential visit if someone would be willing to lend me around 100BTC, I have a 100% approval rating on the trading platform and would never jeopardise that. I'd be willing to pay 20% interest. It's very close to zero risk I just take a comm on each transaction, and keep all my excess coins on a Trezor.

Any bank of note has a direct line into the Fed. The whole system is being propped up as they are all insolvent. The fed will determine the order they all come crashing down. The fed has even bailed out Europe.

Governments should rather start accepting Bitcoin in taxes and paying civil servants in Bitcoin. Not building their Bitcoin balance sheets, all that creates is a massive socialist/facist government that we find ourselves with at the moment. Bitcoin needs to remain free market.

I agree, the solution for moment is definitely just to wait it out. But this is not a transparent or ideal long term solution. Pleased no damage has been done thus far.

Roughly 90% of bitcoins are held by hodlers, the rest are traded on exchanges. It's impossible to buy all BTC as any attempt would just cause the price to rise, furthering the hodler's belief.

Italian Bank Bailins and then the crash of Duetsche Bank. Major moves in price are extential reasons, Brexit, Cyprus etc. ETF is big, it will come after the crash.

Never paid more than 4$ per transaction. This is like people moaning to the wright brothers that they haven't built an economy class. Everyone always wants something for free. People need work harder and invest in bitcoin to make the fees a moot point. The moaners obviously don't own enough. Tick tock the train is leaving.

I have been a flat panic the past few days, someone ported my telephone number and has control of my Authy. I can't log into my local bitcoins account, and still have not heard any reply from them yet. AUTHY IS THE DEVIL.

My phone was ported, my Authy Hijacked, and I have been locked out of localbitcoins since friday. Still no response from localbitcoins.

What are you talking about, the US has killed 1.5m innocent people in the last 10 years. Globalist NGO data should be taken with a pinch of salt. That is Genocide in my book.
