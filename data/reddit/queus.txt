It is slightly more complicated than that. They have one plural form for "bitcoins" plain and simple (bitcoiny), one for "about bitcoins" (o bitcoinech) and yet another one for "because of bitcoins" (kvuli bitcoinum). 
And they have all that forms for singular too.
P.S I guess this qualifies as *What you never wanted to know about the Czech langugate but have asked anyway*.

OK, what competitive bidding for limited block space is good for? A limited number of cashiers in a traditional bank will make access to bank facilities a limited good too, but is is hardly a good thing.
It should also be noted that so far (in almost 4 year of bitcoin experiment) limited block space was a) not an issue b) not a factor which contributed to bitcoin adoption.
And while an unnecessarily big block size may increase transactions costs a bit, a block size which is too small will be worse. Not being able to include your transaction in the blockchain because of the block size limitation is the same as having a infinitely large transaction cost

Yes, you're right. This way the monetary inflation in 100 years will be just  1% but the money dilution in the next 100 years will be be still a 100%.
It will be only a 10% (over a 100 years) in a 1000 years, so yes asymptotically it *is* the same as bitcoin. So it pretty much ends where bitcoin starts.
Now the question is why? Why such a long run-up if you the consider the final stage good, desirable, etc. ?
EDIT: I still do not see the great-..-father wallet as a problem. I can conceivable be a problem only if the bitcoin will appreciate considerably over the life of a few generations. But these can happen only once when the bitcoin is initially adopted. But it this will happen in the next 30-50 years, your 5000 wallet is absolutely a non-problem because there are way more greater wallets owned by early adopters.
And if this happens after bitcoin becames The Currency then there will not be an appreciation over time (as a share of total economic resource which can be powered) worth worrying about. Even if a future Gates/Jobs  will lose his wallet and later on of his nephews will find it I do not expect anything brutal to come of it.

In my understanding the double-spend race conditions are not actually prevented, but arbitrated.
A *bitcoin* spent twice will split the chain, since there will be two(3, 4, ..) blocks including a transaction with the same input but different outputs all linked to the last valid block but in the end just one of those mined blocks will make it into the official (maximum difficulty) blockchain.
I must have missed something because I do not see how this is different from current situation.

Let's say there are 5 000 000 000 people using bitcoin. Assuming that they will perform 10 transactions per day, and each transaction will require a 100 bytes to be recorded in the block-chain...
It means that the block chain will grow by 4,600 gigabytes per day. Now you see the problem?
I certainly hope that stripping spent outputs will reduce the size of block-chain. But it will be a very bad scenario when the wide adoption of bitcoin will be exactly what will finish it.

There is the curious story of Somalian shilling. When the somalians get rid of the old government, but didn't bother to get a new one instead, the masses has got access to printing presses so to speak.
Since the were no one to *authorize* shilling notes of higher denomination than the ones that already existed, a curious equilibrium emerged. "Counterfeit" notes are an accepted as payment but at a price that is only slightly higher than the cost of printing them.
My point is that this is would happen to bitcoin if the miner reward would have been constant. And there were/are some alternative *coin initiative which were/are doing exactly this.

No, there will not be only one correct answer. Actually, the number of correct answers is regulated by so called difficulty level, which is adjusted every 2 week so that a correct block will be *mined* approx. every 10 minutes.
Returning to my simplified example, it can 4 zeros, 5, 6.... or just
     hash(block) &lt; difficulty_level
@_date: 2012-02-08 08:54:45
You're right.
@_date: 2012-01-02 10:13:58
I'll try a very simplistic explanation using md5 and terminal. If the hash of the previous block is `ca025371cf7316c82f39854677ed000` and we want to encode the transaction `5 bitcoins to Peter from Paul` that is the work which should be done
     echo 'ca025371cf7316c82f39854677ed000|5 bitcoins to Peter from Paul|AAAAAA' | md5sum
     8b799324044e34c2381a9cb3042257a1  -
    # ... more nonces tried
    echo 'ca025371cf7316c82f39854677ed000|5 bitcoins to Peter from Paul|ZZZZZZ' | md5sum
    911f8c636cfd8306572b1ac824c3b290  -
Now trying the all the *nonces* from 'AAAAAA' to 'ZZZZZZ' there will be one where the last 3 digits are 0, as soon as it is found there is a block to be included in the blockchain, which is broadcasted to all nodes. Checking that the block is valid is easy. Finding a valid block is hard. Proof of work.
Now if the attacker wants to *rewrite history* to '50 bitcoins to Paul twin brother from Paul' it will have to find another nonce. Which is hard. But there is more. Since the hash of the last block is used to compute the hash of the new one, it will have to find a 1 nonce if the transaction is in the last block, 2 nonces if the transaction is in the block before last, 3 if.. and so on. And it will have to do it in competion (faster) than all the honest nodes.

* You just add a ``printf2`` function.
The goal is to accept the old programs without modifications.

It will be the story of Somalian shilling. It is more or less freely counterfeited, but since there is no government to impose acceptance of shilling notes of higher denominations, the value of a Somalian Shilling is slightly above the cost of printing one.
Doesn't look very appealing to me. Also, both this scheme and the forever 50 coin reward are sensitive to technology improvements in  a) paper printing b) energy/hash production
If you're only concern is the grandfather wallet problem, why not just *poison* (make invalid) coins after some reasonable great amount of time? See? No great-great-great-father wallet problem.

Not exactly, as serving the same js continuously. You track the consumers and deliver the malicious js only on the hundredth time. Then you serve the correct one again.

It is the block chain which is updated. Every now and then a new block is added to the block chain which records the new transactions.

In an economy with a constant money supply (don't faint yet ;)) how do you measure the economic growth?
The total amount of many spent is (roughly) the same year, after year, after year... and so is the economic output measured in units of currency. So, how do you measure economic growth?
Also economies do not grow like trees do. 
Yes, improvements in technology allows us to produce stuff more efficiently, so it costs you only 4 minutes of your working time to buy a Pizza as opposed to 4 minutes 15 seconds 2 years ago, and that's definitively an improvement. Now tell me, why should the pizza price stay the same?
On the other hand (given a constant money supply) you'll need roughly the same amount of time to earn a unit of currency no matter what the level of prices. Now tell me again, why do you want a stable price level?

Which numbers? And how about quality improvements? And changes in fashion. To say the least. My guess is, that a lot less hats are produced now than 50 years ago. Are we in a depression because of that?
How will you compare a transistor radio from the 70-ties and an iPad?  And what good would have an iPad in the 70ties without the Internet, and wireless? Of course if there would have been a way to have a trade (on a regular basis) with the people from the 70-ties the answer will be, for all means and purposes, obvious. Just look at the prices
It also shows that goods have value, but their value is not a property of goods themselves. It is the consumers which give the goods value, and it is up to them how much value they put in transistor radios/iPads. If any. Do you still insist on *counting the numbers* to measure economic growth?


Obviously your are speaking about  *price* deflation/inflation. Price indexes. Fine, so what is a *price index*. Just a weighted sum of individual prices, Or, to put it on a stricter basis, a weighted sum of prices of all goods where an enormous majority of goods have the weight of 0.[1]  Do you already see a problem here? Prices of good whose weight is 0 simply do not matter. Right? Right?!!!
Second, while changes in technology and factor availability are allowed to influence the prices of individual goods, the textbook wisdom is that such changes should leave the "magical" weighted sum in place. 
So, on one hand the market *is allowed* to set the prices of individual goods, but... on the condition that a specific number which is just a sum of individual (weighted) market prices stays put.
The logic behind this reasoning doesn't cease to puzzle whenever I happen to think of it.
P.S. Just think for a bit about an economy without a central bank, but with a family (clan, tribe, sect) of very skillful counterfeiters. Due to their efforts the money grows approximately at the same rate as economy grows (whatever your of definition of economic growth is). Are those skillful people economic benefactors or economic parasites?

Isn't the *dumb users* those who are supposed to run and decide the fate of bitcoin?
I'm not supprised that there are cries of joy for the supposedly benevolent dictator "of all things bitcoin" which seems to arise right now. It's only natural. Unfortunately.
On the other hand it is GA who is writing the code, and I do not, and I have naturally a lot, lot, lot less of saying "of all things bitcoin"
From a cursory glance, it can entirely be, that GA has got this almost right..
But if this will create a precedent where GA decides, it is a bad thing. Long term, that is.
