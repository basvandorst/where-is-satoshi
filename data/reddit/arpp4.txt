Eveyday someone say that Bitcoin is about to "crash", some day someone will be right...
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:41:05
100usd seems to be to fair price now... imo now that the price have stabilized people will, slowly, start buying again.
There are many projects being developed right now, many investors planning the future of Bitcoin, many normal people thinking "let's try this, I don't have anything to loose".

Tell something more about your background, nobody is going to believe a new user...

Are you considering using Bitpay?

Definition of 'Bear Trap':
A false signal that the rising trend of a stock or index has reversed when it has not. A bear trap prompts traders to place shorts on the stock or index, since they expect the underlying to decline in value. Instead of declining further, the investment stays flat, or slightly recovers.

Whoa, 22 down votes? seems that some fiat owners are jealous or something :-/

he obviously don't understand technology, it's like asking to an old surgeon about nanomedicine

Do you think this is a problem? Google cookies are not well configured and any exit node (or someone in a open wifi network, for example) could inject code to disclose your e-mail/username.
I submitted a bug report last year and they said: "well yeah, this a http protocol problem", I give them a solution for this but the problem is still there..
btw the bug bounty program is bs

You really don't want to understand what they say: at least 50% of every comment in lanacion.com and clarin.com are paid by political parties, their job is just troll the comment section (it's worse than 4chan's /pol/)

In Argentina you can't buy foreign currencies nor international bank transfers without an special permission from the govt, so it makes a lot of sense :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:23:01
People could do the same in Twitter, Facebook or even Reddit if they want...

Removing information is not a really big deal if your information can't be decoded in the first place.
Just dump a bunch of numbers in your wall, could mean anything. If you want to distribute CP with someone else you could explain how to decode those numbers and voila! you may use steganography, gmask, embed files inside other files, using meta data like exif.. could be anything.
If it's not known how to decode it nobody will remove it.
I am pretty sure there are a lot of CP all over Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and why not Reddit and only a few pedo's know about it.

We don't trust in Satoshi, but in cryptography.
Instead we adore Satoshi's work :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:17:30
but then the spread of cp is already done..
looks for me that most people here is more concerned about the impact of this news on the price than the cp itself
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:54:48
no, it's not possible (not even "potentially") with paypal or any other service like it:

i was reading the OP message telling to my self **holy shit** several times and then the first comment start with the same expression. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:13:32
Argie here. Bitcoin is perfect for real state in our country: the Peso is a fucking joke, there is an "official" value and the blackmarket value (because you need a special permission from the govt to buy eg USD), also you can't just transfer money from an Argentinian bank account to another account in other country, so if you want to move you are fucked (my case).
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:27:04
Comparing two periods without any relation except grow. You must have a PhD in Finances right OP?
