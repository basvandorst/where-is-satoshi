All those miners combined are just a sitting duck waiting for the 51% attack.
bitmain is the only supporter of bcash that matters because they bought 1.1M bcash to prop up the price. 
Daily send in $ stats for bcash show that there is no ecomomic activity surrounding the bcash chain so maybe it is you who should stop lying to yourself.

Bitcoin is the base layer. Ethernet was pretty limited as well but look where we are now.
I love Steve Wozniak's quote on this matter: There are now over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak said that bitcoin is the only one that remains "pure" because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is, such as decentralization.
"Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That's the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model."
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:20:38
Those are not centralised corporations like Ethereum but they are mining pools.

Bitcoin is the only coin that was created to change money for the greater good.
Every other coin that exists and every coin yet to be 'invented' will be born out of greed. The only goal being to make more money for the creators of said coin.

Bitfury is already keeping the land registry of Georgia honest by anchoring the land registry transactions to the bitcoin blockchain.

bitcoin miners are location agnostic. They go where there is excess renewable electricity nobody uses. If it wasn't for bitcoin miners that electricity would just be run of into the ground and go to waste.
No other industry can set up shop where bitcoin miners are able to operate. If the area develops other economic activities to absorb the excess electricity then the bitcoin miners just pack up their gear and move on to the next location with renewable electricity over production.
so in short bitcoin mining does not create a lot of electricity demand but instead it absorbs excess supply.

I respectfully disagree.
Currently most exchanges use batching for withdrawals. This makes it cheap and easy for the exchange but the customer is now forced to make at least one on-chain tx and can't use batching to spread out the cost of the on-chain tx.
When the exchanges offers the option to deposit straight into a LN channel for instance like this
 
It saves an expensive on-chain tx and instead the user can go straight from exchange to buying stuff at

Yang Zuo Xing left and set up shop competing with bitmain. What has bitmain delivered to market since that day and would you buy it?
Maybe the dash miner for 1500 bucks?  That could have made a profit. too bad for the poor souls buying that thing that bitmain switched on their own dash miners after selling out thereby instantly boosting the hashrate to loss levels for their own dash miner customers.

bitcoin mining secures a ledger which is increasingly being used to tackle fraud and corruption. Just because certain media outlets consistently picture bitcoin as useless does not make it so. 
this is a good example of how the only truly immutable ledger humanity has ever seen is used  
or this example 
In the future every centralised institution will have to submit their data to the bitcoin blockchain so that we the people can audit them. So that we can be sure notaries, stock exchanges, banks and even complete governments are not short changing us.
Could it be that all this hating on bitcoin is coming from people and institutions that stand to lose their power to the bitcoin blockchain?
Furthermore: bitcoin miners consume energy that nobody else wants. What other industry could set up shop in the Atacama dessert to consume excess solar power and leave the minute a grid connection has been established for the solar park involved? or look at paraguay. they were being blackmailed by brazil to sell them excess energy at rip off prices until bitcoin miners entered the scene and paid paraguay a fairer price. The list goes on and on. There is no industry transitioning to 100% renewable faster then bitcoin miners.
In the very near future bitcoin miners will even be building hydro dams in areas that would normally be too remote and sparsely populated to ever get a hydro dam. Area's doomed to exist on diesel generators will be transitioned to renewable thanks to bitcoin and in the process these areas (think greenland) could strike it rich like dubai got rich of oil.
but it is so much easier to just stick to: **bitcoin bad mkay**!  
look who is consistently painting this simplistic picture. It is dying  news papers who's main advertisers are banks and governments. They are the main source of fake bitcoin news because: whose bread you eat, their song you will sing!

Pool participants left them and pointed their miners towards another pool.

intended use: send ~~cash~~ value from A to B
large amounts can always happen onchain but there needs to be fee competition for bitcoin to survive long term.
small transactions will have to happen on second layers (plenty of solutions ready for roll out after segwit gets implemented). 
there's just no way around this evolution.
A linear blocksize increase can never accommodate enough cheap tx's to keep mining feasible in a 0 block reward environment.  
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:54:14


ehm nope! please don't bring up BU, classic or XT because they all bugged out constantly.
lookup quadratic hashing so you can understand why we need segwit before a blocksize increase.

no need to reply because your 'facts' already got destroyed by the replies to your original comment.
point 2 is just blatant conspiracy ad hominem dribble and that is the real problem with people calling themselves 'big blockers'. To them it is about people and not the code. core is the code, not people.
luke-jr just loves to troll and is actually proof that core is not a cohesive closed of group. 
in reality literally no one is against bigger blocks down the road. But it needs to be done responsibly and segwit is the way forward for that.
what is your alternative? running BU, classic or XT and have the network crash regularly? or waiting another 2 years for a client that can actually be used in production? 
Newsflash: There will never be a production ready client with a simple linear blocksize increase because no developer worth it's salt in bitcoin is willing to work on it, that should tell you something!
the examples you mentioned with the exception of gavin 'bamboozled' andreesen have no technical knowledge on the matter. Again, that should tell you something.
u/Falkvinge the fact that you mention that clown just shows how thin the support for your vision really is. roger ver and voorhees are just alt coin pumpers at this point and, just like falkvinge, they have no technical knowledge whatsoever.
stop stalling progress, there is no alternative to segwit and their never will be!
get segwit done and then we can talk blocksize increase which i am in favor of just like everybody else!

in one word: immutability!
my background in real estate makes me incredibly excited about this feature and that's why i regard this cumbersome consensus process in bitcoin as a positive (it's annoying because of all the FUD).
land registry security is a major issue in developing countries with lower level corruption.
the bitcoin blockchain can literally kill land registry corruption and companies like bitfury, chromaway and factom are on the right track to make this reality.
They all anchor to the bitcoin blockchain for proof of immutability and they don't even need bigger blocks to do it.

The power generation is happening in remote sparsely populated area's that can't sell/transport the electricity to other regions.
No other industry can set up shop where bitcoin miners are able to operate. If the area develops other activities to absorb the excess electricity then the bitcoin miners just pack up their gear and move on to the next location with renewable electricity over production.
This area agnostic quality of bitcoin miners creates a lot of opportunity to bring renewable energy to remote area's. For instance, there is a project being planned in Suriname to connect maroon communities to hydro power. This can only be made economically viable via the addition of bitcoin mining. 
If it works out, these people will switch from diesel generators to renewable. So mining actually reduces the carbon foot print in this case;).

a high price makes the network more secure.
All bitcoin has to do is survive and it will eventually go up in price again! It doesn't need to convince everybody. Only 1% of the global population can push it to $200k.
Presently, Bitcoin is just regarded as a master card type payment system. This is maybe 5% of the speculative value. Personally, I am in to the immutable aspect of bitcoin, others like the store of value/hard money use case or it's censorship resistant qualities. Everybody can use bitcoin as they see fit. It is controlled by no one and this means it can be trusted by everyone.
Another thing bitcoin has going for it are the central banks, governments and even people like you. you are all part of bitcoin's marketing team. The more you hate it, the more others will love it. This love will make it go up in price;)

Funny meme but that doesn't change the fact that bitcoin remittances are doing just fine.
Those companies just batch a ton of transactions together and they could easily stomach exponentially higher fees. $100+ fees would be fine for them
The idea that a filipino migrant worker would send bitcoins directly to his family at home has always been a pipe dream touted by people that don't understand bitcoin's value proposition and also have no experience with third world country remittances.

@_date: 2017-06-02 11:58:44
Yes and your kind of mass adoption was never in the cards anyway.
Mass adoption can only happen off chain. This rule applies to all of bitcoin's competitors. Blockchains don't scale well and second layers are the only way forward.
Just because the roger ver's of this world keep repeating the on chain scaling lie as if it was promised to them by satoshi does not make it technically or economically feasible.

Schiff has been warning against bitcoin since $100. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:34:20
they can only achieve those levels via centralisation of some sort or the other.
Decentralisation and lack of control are among bitcoin's most important selling points. 
Besides, why would a consumer want to give up buyer protection, insurance and possibility of recourse only to be able to transact via a blockchain? 
A consumer would only do that if visa threatens to block or reverse the transaction. So in reality the market for such a service is limited to gambling, drug selling, etc. 
LN are an ideal solution for those kind of use cases. Especially since LN gives more privacy to the users compared to on chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:18:53


Bitcoin has always seen this kind of price action and we would have to drop a lot deeper for your scenario to become a plausible risk.
  
We would also need some other things like an irrational attacker with very deep pockets. An attacker who's happy with a Pyrrhic victory that is guaranteed to not actually kill bitcoin. The attacker could only be China gov at this point and their window of opportunity is closing fast.
To dismiss bitcoin based on this scenario would set the bar for any innovation impossibly high. We would still be living in caves with this mentality.

@_date: 2017-06-02 12:44:57


that assumption is false, especially if you start doing the math on what kind of linear blocksize increase we would need to get to that sort of transaction volume and the strain it would put on full nodes.
You would need gigabyte sized blocks. You should really run a full node with the 1MB blocksize in place and then imagine doing that with visa sized blocks. 
LN, thunder, bitcache, etc etc are way better suited to handle that kind of load and those second layer systems allow the users to collect fees on transactions instead of just the miners.
Besides being faster and cheap, LN makes transacting way more private as well.
Bigger blocks are just a simplistic kicking the can down the road approach. Its main advocates have totally other incentives and just use bigger blocks as an easy narrative to obfuscate their real agenda (asic boost with miner and full node centralisation)

Lol just because vitalik uses the environment as an argument for POS does not make it so.
Vitalik is forced to centralise ethereum even further by attempting POS. He made some fundamental design mistakes which forces him into POS. Things like child pays for parent and batching just aren't possible in ethereum so they need POS to scale. They will more then likely fail and end up with a hybrid POW/POS coin.
Did your 'research' ever go beyond watching a couple of youtube videos? 
Did you also just believe vitalik when he was selling shares of quantum computers that did not exist?

To humeur you here is a little calculation but keep in mind this is just the people involved with remittances.
going by the numbers in the link above it shows that just the monthly remittance transactions flowing to india are double the amount of monthly transactions the bitcoin blockchain can handle on chain at 1mb. India is not even 5% of remittances. So for just global remittances we are already at 20MB blocks.
This is true if everybody sticks to just 1 remittance transaction per month. 
The remittances went onchain and we want mass adoption. So we should expect all the people that received those transactions to start spending those bitcoins on chain as well: coffee, groceries, newspaper, etc etc. 
Let's say the average remittance caters to a family of 4. Each family member does 5 purchases per day. So your one monthly transaction now turns into 20 daily transactions or 600 transactions per month
600 x 20 is 12GB blocks just to cater to the remittance industry and the spending power it creates.
Now imagine the big blockers dream coming true and the entire world starts doing everything on chain. you are looking at terrabyte sized blocks then.
In short, on chain scaling only makes sense to people that, apparently, are too lazy to even take 2 minutes and do a calculation like the one i just did for you.
regarding centralisation just research stellar. that shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes and it is as decentralised as ripple.
