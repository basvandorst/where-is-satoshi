In that case, blame his family for revealing all the details. If they get kidnapped, its their own fault. All the family members talked to the reporter. Its crazy.

yup. seems to me hes the creator of bitcoin. everything adds up. his own family doesnt even knows what he has done over the past few years.

Did you even read the article. They gave tons of personal details away. Like they didnt even care about the fallout. Or maybe they did it on purpose, so they could get money from Satoshi. If they forced him to sell his bitcoins by publicizing. That brother ranted out of spite it seems. He has only himself to blame.

SIlk Road would still be alive if not for bitcoin.

why would the market care? I dont get this. Willyreport just said mtgox was fraudulent, it has nothing to do with bitcoin itself.

lol did you read this guys post on bitcoin forums and stackoverflow in 2010?

bitcoin is stalling because the hype has died down. 
it was never worth much anyway. it doesn't have intrinsic value. its not even anonymous. WOW gold has more intrinsic value than bitcoins.

there is more to currency than usability. there is also reliability and bitcoins reliability is very low. it can easily be displaced by other currencies, as it has no backers, WOW gold has more reliability because it is backed by Blizzard. it isnt even anonymous. all your transactions are recorded, unlike cash.
bitcoin scores low in usability, reliability, anonimity and many other.

I hope this is true. Chinese are the very naive, they are sure to help fuel the last explosive parabolic stages of the mania. These are the same people that bought kitchen salt to protect against radioactivity. Ad to that theor immense greed and wealth redistribution is coming!

why are you downvoting me for telling the truth? chinese are like goldbugs, massive distrust of their government. the fact government says bitcoin is bad in chinese eyes means bitcoin is good. they will think government is scared of bitcoin because it works. if that isn't going to blowup in their face....
