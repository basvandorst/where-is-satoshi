I think there is time for blockchain to be used as an independent financial tool for all transactions around the globe. At least not happening this decade. I think for now block chain coins that are addressing and helping current world problem and institutions will rise before the world gets educated about block chain’s potential and recognises the convenience.
About bitcoin, I think there is nothing that can be said for certain. Bitcoin has shown extremely high growth which actually does not give me the confidence to say it’s going to go back to it’s original price of $1000-$3000 before investors popped in for profit (snowball effect). Anyhow, it still does and will hold a place in the future.
(My opinion)

Literally doesn’t work at all. It should’ve notified me the second bitcoin hit 11000 pounds

I’ve got a very important question!
I’m from Pakistan, but currently living in the UK. I want to buy bitcoins from my pakistani bank account from the exchanges that support pakistani banks. However, I’m already registered to many exchanges with my UK as my current country.
I would like to know if it is still possible to buy from my pakistani accounts from those already registered exchanges. If so, would I be charged the conversion fees to usd as well?
Is there any alternative to this to save fees?
I’m trying to avoid the high banking fees that incur while transferring money internationally.
Thank you
