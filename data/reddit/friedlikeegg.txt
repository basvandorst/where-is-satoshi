as in you didn't understand or thats when you worked i was a dumby?
if you didn't understand  -&gt; to transfer the bitcoin i had to pay a fee. when i tried to move  £10, it wanted close to £10 in fees. when i when to transfer  the £120, it wanted £13.  so moving £10 was rather costly. 
when i say £10. i mean £10 worth of bitcoin

its got up to 8 confirmations now. and that seems odd, because its a small moment. 
when i looked at the receipt of the sending, the address was different. however, there is "show legacy address". if i click that it shows me the  correct address.
so, im hoping this is to do with a Segwit address conversion? anyway, its been over an hour now. so im gearing up to be money down.

its been about an hour now. but i can click a "show legacy address" and that shows the correct address.  so im hoping its just being slow. 
the confirmations keeps going up. dont know if i should be happy or sad about that

ok, i think i might be ok? maybe you will know. 
i just saw under the address that i sent to it say "show legacy address", if i click that it shows me the correct address. so this is just some normal basic stuff going on that im panicking about?
and confirmations are now at 6+

i mean, i checked the address twice before sending it. but when i went to my other wallet and saw it hadn't arrived i went back and checked and on the "receipt" the address had changed. someone said it might just converting it to a Segwit address. because i can click "show legacy address" and that is the correct address. 
and i didnt want to pay 10 in fees for 10. well, that will teach me
