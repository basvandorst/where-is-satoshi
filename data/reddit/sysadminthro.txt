There was a famous story from a long time ago (in internet terms) when a UK town council implemented an internet filter to prevent any unsavoury content coming from or going to the people who worked for them.  They did this by blocking keywords from passing through their filter.
The town was called Scunthorpe, and their filter blocked every incoming email to anyone  any email mentioning the town's name, and any websites mentioning the town.

I think that BTC is interesting as a currency.  For it to be usable as a currency, I want to see it as stable against the dollar as any other currency.
Yes, I have some BTC.  Yes, it'd be real nice if it went to the moon and I could use those coins I bought for tens of dollars to pay off my mortgage.  But if it stabilizes against the dollar then that would be pretty awesome too because it will make it useful for trade.
I also disagree about Bitpay needing BTC to keep rising.  I've been interested in Bitcoin for a few years now.  One of the first things that struck me was that buying from a convenience store, neither the merchant nor the punter was going to want to wait the length of time it took for a transaction to be confirmed by the network.  I suspect that if Bitcoin has a future on Main Street then the retailers and the customers will both be dealing with companies like Bitpay rather than doing transactions directly via the Bitcoin network simply because a lot of business cannot wait for the P2P confirmations to come in; a lot of business wants a transaction to be either "yes this person has the money" or "no this person does not have the money."
