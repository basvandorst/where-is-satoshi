I'm not a blockchain expert, but I am trying to find out why there are so many small transactions currently going into Bitfinex's primary wallet at the moment.
I decided to click back and see where some of the funds were coming from and I noticed something strange (might be normal, as I said I am no professional at analysing the data on the blockchain).
The primary wallet is this 
and I saw this small transaction coming from this wallet to the bitfinex wallet  and noticed the time/date looked similar to the date when the system was hacked.
So I went back another to the previous transaction which shows that money was sent from the original account, plus one of the hacked wallets at the same time 
Is there any particular reason for this? Was this something done to bypass the security measures on bitfinex when the system was being hacked? You can see a lot of duplicate transactions were done at the time of the hack on some of the smaller accounts which are sent to 
1) wallet starting with a 1 and the majority of the money
2) wallet starting with a 3 and very small portion of the money
How is this money now going back into the primary bitfinex wallets? I'm a little lost, but i'm sure its easily explained by someone with a bit more knowledge on how it all works.
