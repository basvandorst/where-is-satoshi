Uhm. That's really a radical approach for hodling. But okay... ��
Hope you will find your lost passphrases soon.

Yes that's it. But you can sell all your coins to me. Thank you. :-)

Uh, that's evil. When you're new to the business and this is the first time you've seen a ledger device in real life, I can well imagine that a lot of people fall for it.
**Best advice:** Only buy hardware wallets from trusted sources and **NOT** from a random guy from ebay!

In 2004 Bitcoin was not yet invented. That happened 4 years later. So the time traveler was too early. :D

There are some official resellers in some countries who still have some ledger devices. But I think most of them also have low stock levels.
See: 
Don't (I repeat: **DO NOT**) buy your devices from untrusted sources (ebay, Amazon, Alibaba,...). Better you're patient than losing all your crypto currencies like [this guy](

There are more attack vectors. The firmware can be manipulated or the instructions can lead to a fake website with compromised chrome apps and so on.
I posted the link to the official retailers list. If one of them sells the devices via Amazon, that's fine. But you have to check twice if it is really an official reseller and not a participant pretending to be an official reseller.

Just have a look at the price chart for the last 12 months on a daily base: 
It seems that wednesday is mostly the best day to buy Bitcoins. But there are also other events like segwit lock-in or difficulty adjustments that are influencing the price. So keep your eyes open. ;-)

I think he (or perhaps she ;-) ) is sitting at a wonderful beach, enjoying some drinks, looking at some beautiful, dancing girls (or guys) and this evening he/she will take 2-3 of them to his/her big beach house and enjoy their attendance. 
At least that would I do if I had 25 billion dollars. :-D

No. It's true. Mostly at Wednesday the price is the cheapest. Don't know why and it's not every Wednesday. But if you look for the cheapest price for a weekday in the last 12 months you will find out that it's Wednesday. There are websites which show you the avarage price per day for the last x months. Just search for 'daily btc price historic'. So you can proof my conclusion.

There is one single reason: It's Wednesday. Look at the historic price data on a daily base. Mostly at Wednesday the BTC price is the lowest in the week.

I'm pretty sure he's talking about Dogecoin!
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:45:20
Yeah. Not enough. :-D

Oh f*ck. We are doomed. If John McAfee is on the train, the train will go directly to hell... :D
