I don't even know what to say to that.  Nothing in my post is attacking or shitting on Bitcoin.  I love Bitcoin and hold an amount of it as well as Dogecoin.  I work in the finance industry and weekly field nonsense from our traders about Bitcoin and Dogecoin so I'm no stranger to the hate from them but not so much from a fellow crypto user.
I'm sorry you've got such a negative view of the coin, I imagine we've got some bad apples over there but the overwhelming majority are supportive of the Bitcoin community and of Bitcoin itself.

You've obviously got some chip on your shoulder, though I do agree that some Shibes have aggressively tipped in to that end those users are pretty often scolded in with the occasional scolding thread hitting the front page) and I'm sorry for that but we're not all fanatical, we're just mostly excited about Dogecoin.  We're excited for the explosive growth we've seen since December, the relatively large adaption rate, the media response, all of it.  We're excited like, well, a dog might be.

Right, I don't necessarily think that anyone that would tape up something like this is really "afraid" of Bitcoin in the sense that a lot of people around here think.  I know a few folks who are skeptical of Bitcoin and might even go as far as taping up an article like this in the hopes of "educating" people walking by.  They aren't afraid of Bitcoin, they're just loud and pushy and think they're right.

I understand that, of course I do and anyone with any sense recognizes it also.  None of us would be here without Bitcoin paving the way.  That doesn't mean that there can't be room for Alts that bring something new to the table, whether it's technical advances or altruism.  There's no reason we can't all get along and be civil with one another.  Nobody would have said anything s TotalMelancholy hadn't taken a pot shot at Doge.

Yep. In '13 a few friends and I looked into mining. BTC was about $100 then and we looked at BFL and other miners and figured it wasn't profitable unless we dumped in a couple Grand and even then we'd break even pretty far out. We ended up just buying in at $100 and myself and one other friend traded a few alts for a nice profit.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:40:35

HitBTC is a disaster. I've had an open case with them for MONTHS and it hasn't even gotten a single staff update. Someone logged into my account from China or some shit and changed the password and enabled 2FA so now I can't get back in. Every couple weeks I get an email alert that the account was logged in from Eastern Europe or Asia. Luckily there's no money or bank linked to the account so it's no loss other than the frustration. I've emailed a million times and tweeted at them, nothing. Useless.

I missed out on $17k because I dumped my rdd at 17 from 6. 3 other alts I'd been watching with low volume and low price all jumped to 20+ from 3 or 4. Hurts man. That said I cleaned up in alts in 2013 right after the bitcoin crash. Alts are where there's easy money to be made.

I had to do that on bitfinex I think.  At first I just attached the pdf I downloaded, but it got kicked back because they didn't accept "downloaded documents'.

Thanks, this is the first comprehensive, satisfactory answer.  Like I mentioned in the OP I'm not doing anything shady, I just wanted a quick, painless way to get coins without answering security questions and linking bank accounts.  I get there's no direct, convenient way to buy them without giving up info on yourself like buying with a debit card or linking an account, it's just frustrating I can't just but some god damn coins without giving my blood type or sifting through potentially scammy local deals and having to get my ass off the couch.

I work in IT in a brokerage firm. I told the guys I work with about bitcoin when it was about $100 but they all made fun of me and my imaginary World of Warcraft money. Now since we blew up after those hearings, I get asked weekly from our top traders what's going on in the  BTC world, and of course "why didn't you tell me about bitcoin". It's not to late I tell them.

Perhaps you're right but not 100%.  I don't know where else to turn but to Reddit where I know they hang out.  I've put in two tickets for two separate issues and both of them have been ignored(lost/overlooked?).  The first over two weeks ago with literally no communication aside from thicket creation email and the second I put in yesterday morning and again, no communication.  What am I to do then?  There's no support number, there's no direct email, there's no forum.  There's just the support form on the site that sends an email and, I assume, creates a ticket which someone is supposedly looking at.  
It's not even like I'm bitching about delayed coins or that they ran out earlier this week.  There was an issue and I got, more or less, free coins and I'm trying to give them my money again.  What the hell do I have to do to get an answer on a ticket, especially when I'm trying to make an error in my favor right?

That's what'd I'd read and partially what prompted me to make this thread.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:59:09
I would have agreed last week but now I'm having an issue starting back to last Friday.  I emailed support twice now and have only gotten automated responses back regarding my ticket's creation.  I think I've been pretty patient and didn't want to raise a fuss about it, but I was thinking of making a thread here since I have yet to hear back from anyone for a week.  I'll just detail my issue below for now in the hopes one of the CB reddit dudes is lurking.
When buying BTC I like to move money from my main bank account to another account I have somewhere else to keep it separate, otherwise I'm too tempted to spend "just a little more" and it's somewhat of a hassle to wire the funds around so I don't bother with it too much, it's a deterrent for my own good.  Twice when placing orders I've entered an amount of USD to buy BTC that's just  under the available balance in the account being withdrawn from, the first time I thought I made a mistake and ate the overdraw fee from my bank, 25 bucks and the order was cancelled.  "Alright, my bad" I thought.  I figured I wasn't paying attention when I placed the order and entered too much.  The second time I looked into it and noticed that both times after the step to view and confirm my order the price changed but the verification page didn't reflect the updated price.  When I actually confirm and submit the order the new total is shown on the history.  I would think that the price you see on the verification page would be locked in, at least for like 2 or 3 minutes or at the very least update the price on the verification page so you can change it if you need to.  It wasn't like I left the order verification page up and walked away for an hour.  In the time in took to double check the order and click submit, the price would go up be enough to make my account short by a few cents causing me to overdraft twice.  Other than this I love Coinbase and haven't had any issues.  Love the instant buys.

@_date: 2013-11-16 16:41:21
I don't propose a solution that's perfect or even suggest that it's good, I'm just throwing something out there.  The main point of my post is that I submitted an order with an order total and that total changed after submission.  How is that fair, in my or their favor?
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:07:19
It's easy.  The order was more than what I had available.  Over drawn.  
Like I mentioned above I keep my actual bank account and my account for buying BTC separate.  When I want to buy BTC I wire money from my main account to my secondary account, this way I'm not tempted to spend "just a bit more" because I have to pay a wire fee, this way I'm less likely to change my mind after I wire an amount.  When buying I try to get as close to the amount in the account as I can so I have as little extra left in it.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:49:45
I just did mine about 10 minutes ago.  They asked standard questions like when you fill in your taxes online and shit, what phone number listed was associated with me, where I got a loan for my car, what model/make/year my car was, etc.  I'm "verified" I just have to wait the 30 days now.

That's neat but holy hell that's expensive in fees.  If 1 BTC is $100 USD you lose $35 in their 10 BTC example.  I guess if you're really trying to cover your tracks though 35 cBTC is a small price to pay on 10.
