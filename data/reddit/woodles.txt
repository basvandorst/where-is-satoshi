Companies don't operate in a free market currently because of subsidies and other government funding and controls. 


The free market demands damages when their is property damage.


Lol, no. Government hasn't saved us from air pollution. In fact the reason why pollution is rampant is because government doesn't recognize property rights violations. It shouldn't be surprising though since the government is the largest violator of property rights not to mention the largest polluter.


It is hilarious that you believe that you or some other group of people can "figure it out" faster than the market.

You got that backwards. Businesses operate with a much lower time preference than the government does, because if they didn't, they would fail. The government is literally the most high time preference entity in existence today because they can delay all responsibility to the future and consume everything in existence now.

I took the time and watched the video. I'm even more convinced now that this is a scam. Several red flags jumped out at me.
1. You have to lock up your coins for a substantial amount of time.
2. The crazy returns promised are way too good to be true, he explains it's because the trading bot makes a lot of money for the investors, very similar to the Trendon Shavers ponzi.
3. The BCC price is artificially pumped as bitcoin increases. The scheme is wrapped in a lending platform to obfuscate the inner workings and market dynamics.
4. The whole scheme requires bitcoin to be increasing in value, in fact if you just held the bitcoin itself you would have made more money. In no way is this sustainable, especially if bitcoin was to enter a bear market.
5. This guy is shilling this scam, he even has a referral link in the description, so he's probably making money off new people.
If you are able to get your bitcoin out, I would do it as soon as possible before this thing collapses. Just hold bitcoin long term and stay away from these get rich schemes.

They are.


I didn't claim any of these things. Why are you being forced to use these terrible exchanges.




Well it is fair because you agreed to put your bitcoins in that exchange. You put your trust in the owner and his security, and you lost. I agree though that this feels unfair and is heartbreaking. Overtime these cases will decrease as the technology evolves, infrastructure matures and the market weeds out the fraudulent and bad services. Hopefully in the future we can move to a more free economy.

I don't remember this ever happening to bitcoin, maybe a different coin? 
This was more of a problem in bitcoin's early history. Now that mining hardware is so abundant it is very unlikely that any single group of miners could amass enough hashrate to pull this off effectively.
The bch fork last year was similar because they use the same mining algorithm as btc. So if enough miners left btc for bch then that would stall the btc network. They were promoting and encouraging this idea calling it the btc death spiral. If two chains are competing for the same hashpower, one is very likely to kill the other as the chain with lower hash could be gamed and stalled, while the majority of miners move to the chain that is most profitable. However, bch prevented it's own death by introducing an emergency difficulty algorithm (EDA). There were special rules that would lower the bch difficulty if no blocks were found within a long time.

@_date: 2018-11-25 01:27:26
Which coin is better than BTC? And why?
@_date: 2018-11-05 03:38:37
Since the retargeting time is in blocks, blocks must be mined in order to retarget. If a large miner could turn on a bunch of hashing power and then turn it off causing the difficulty to spike, it could take days or weeks for a single block to be mined. In an extreme scenario, it could possibly never find a block in a 100 years. Longer retargeting times protect against this.
Also, the difficulty can never change by more than a factor of 4 in a single retarget.

Changing the difficulty algorithm would require a hard fork and would probably create two chains, so many people would likely not support it. I'm not sure there's even a problem with the current diff algo, I believe it's just a matter of trade-offs. 
As far as bch goes, I believe the EDA was specifically set up to cause problems to btc. I remember that whenever the difficulty would retarget, there would be a bunch of hashing power switching between the two chains. I remember hashing power dropping off bch, waiting multiple EDA retarget periods to lower the difficulty substantially, then turning the hashpower back on, resulting in blocks being mined like once a minute.
Here is a little more info on the EDA

With Breadwallet or another bitcoin wallet app, you truly control the private keys to your money and can do anything with them that you please. The wallets are generally open source software and the contributors don't own the wallet or have control of your coins in any way. Your wallet software will generate your private keys on your computer so nobody will have them but you.
Coinbase is more like a bank account. They are a custodian of your bitcoin, so they generate and hold the private keys for you. You have a balance on coinbase which represents the bitcoin that coinbase owes you. When you want to send bitcoin out of coinbase you have to ask coinbase to send it out and wait for them to send it.

I think it's a joke based on an old article about Erik where they misspelled his name.

I think he meant it jokingly because of all the crew members standing around not buying.

He did pay his fair share. He offered a fee and the miner accepted the fee. Can't get more fair than that.

Really, bitcoin is no different because they're both just computers? This guy seems like he hasn't even read a thing about bitcoin, or even about computers for that matter.

Like u/14341 said, Brian is also saying this, which is kind of ridiculous since we are so early in the price discovery of ETC, let alone ETH.

Yes, although residents of some states are prohibited. WA was prohibited until a week or two ago, I recently received an email saying they are now open for WA. I sent verification 2 days ago and am currently waiting approval.

Why do you want to buy coffee with bitcoin? Bitcoin is for storing value securely. You seem salty you don't have any eth, just go buy some and get into an ICO. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:32:09
So then why use bitcoin to buy coffee?
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:45:38
I believe it is desktop only.

Didn't someone tip thousands in btc like the day before the april crash. This may not be good.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:29:23
Can I sell my share for btc?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:58:29
I disagree, I don't think buying coffee is the use case that will bring mass adoption. A decentralized, secure store of value is what I'm interested in and what I believe will bring mass adoption. I agree about lightning though, that would be a fantastic addition to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:02:44
Noice. Put that $600 back into btc and let it ride my friend. Worst case you lose nothing.

Erik Voorhees had a good comment on the article.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:49:04
Good article. I love Jeffrey Tucker.
@_date: 2013-08-18 00:09:06
Jeffrey gave a great response to how bitcoin originated and then Matt Welch essentially took the focus off of bitcoin. Jeffrey seemed mildly annoyed by this. I know I was. Also, Jeffrey is awesome.

The difference is that extortion is a violent crime. Voluntarily engaging in trade is not.

I think he means that the money supply should expand with the economy as it grows, to help keep the price stable. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:46:25
I missed the spin. I think it happened really quick out something. Also armory used a different address than the one I posted. Anyways seems fun I might try a few times with my own money.

Sorry, I think the tone of my post was somewhat more negative than I had intended. Under no circumstance do I think what he said is anything short of brilliant.
@_date: 2013-08-16 00:59:08
What if say Google wanted to map out as much of the world as they could. Like street view but everywhere. They make a game where bitcoins were scattered around the world and users had to go collect them. In return the users sent back camera data and other relevant data of the area in order to earn the coins.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:10:35
Is this the reason btc just spiked?
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:54:04
Wow at the comments. "The bitcoin will devaluate." Lol.
@_date: 2013-07-01 06:57:12
Well that just means there is potential profit in making the spread smaller. Get in there and make some bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 06:22:30
Bitmit is great. I just sold a gift card today. Feels good getting btc for a card I probably was never going to use.
