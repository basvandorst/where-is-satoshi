The whole free Ulbricht thing is why Bitcoin is has credibility issues. The guy started a black market for ILLEGAL substances, and used his own system to hire a hitman to kill someone.  He deserves prison, and if you disagree, you need to be cut from this movement as bad as people like Ulbricht.

I persist because he is still being charged, and until he has been proven innocent, while he's not necessarily guilty, putting pressure on courts because he is popular among a community is a perversion of our justice system.  
Cling to drama? Please.  Protesting his court case is clinging to drama.

Africa has double North America's population and half of North America's internet users.

Normally a lurker here, but tell me more about how the most underdeveloped continent that actually has people on it will be tough to make an ELECTRONIC CURRENCY viable for.

Of course.  I live in America where not only having heard of wireless comms, but possessing them is standard.  We're talking about a place where entire villages are lucky to have one internet connection the chief might have a cell.  Sure the North African countries, South Africa, and places like Nairobi, Accra, and Lagos might be viable options for bitcoin expansion, but you're telling me that the continent of Africa is wireless, you're hopelessly misinformed.

You act like I'm some conservative Christian who believes that the government is Gods own institution.  It's not.  Doesn't mean that laws aren't sensible, or that they're not in the interest of many.  An online marketplace where you can purchase anything from prototype red bull to a hitman's services is a step toward an open world, but not a step toward a good one.   I'm not defending big banks, I'm just saying that it is not good for the Bitcoin movement to be championing someone who is being tried for hiring a hitman and providing a place for literally anyone with a keyboard and some money to purchase narcotics or innumerable other substances some recreational, but many dangerous.
Sure Ulbricht did a lot for Bitcoin.  But wanting him as a figurehead, at least before his court case has played out, will not help Bitcoin gain momentum in the mainstream.
