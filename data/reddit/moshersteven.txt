Yup cant scale.

Last I looked at the spec ( cant find it now) I think the fees to close are set aside upfront  when you fund the channel.  Not sure,  but the scenario you describe was the first one that came to mind. What if I can't pay the fees to close the channel.. or I open the channel in year 1, and 5 years later the fees to close are huge and cost more than I even put in the channel in the first place.

larger blocks will magically become acceptable once people realize that the current blocksize ~4MB  will not support even a reasonable LN. A decentralized LN of 10Million users requires on the order of 70 MILLION channels-. Opening 70 Million channels requires--- yup,  70 Million main chain transactions. At that point people will give up the bogus argument that bigger blocks leads to more centralization.

Yep. Since LN channels need to be opened and closed on the Main chain, you can imagine the backlog if a million people a day try to open a single channel. Plus, LN  doesnt address the UTXO problem.. 
here's a core idea....   kinda fucks up hodling or passing coins to your kids

err nope.
What's the first and last thing you need to do when you set up and then close a lightning channel?

"Even with increases in block size it was estimated that the blockchain capacity
could only support about 800 million users with micropayment channels due
to the number of on-chain transactions required to open and close channels [9].
A large scale adoption of micropayment channel networks, where, e.g., Internet
Of Things devices have their own Bitcoin wallet, brings the blockchain to its

ya  .. looking less and less decentralized. However they do point out some of the 'challenges"  in LN

ding ding ding... we have a winner.

It is too high for 7nm.
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:31:45
Not even talking about theoretical  optimum.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:25:32
Hmm says  you pay in June, ships in Oct.  This ( and other intell) suggests that they taped out April at 7nm at TSMC. 
This would  mean chips back and characterized by early august,  then build a miner and optimize.  The TH and power consumption looks off  way  too many watts.

huh?  When we build Miners they go straight from the factory to the customer. We don't mine.
