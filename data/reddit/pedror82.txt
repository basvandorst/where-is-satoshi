Do you think someone who can get confused and buy something different than what he wanted to buy will be able to maintain a full node?

This page includes the fees on the calculations in order to determine which chain is more profitable to mine:

I thought Core was the implementation which had to add all those protections...
Why isn't that the case?

I see we have different perceptions on what the majority supports. My understanding is that most exchanges, internet services and miners are behind 2X.

Anyone can call any chain they like Bitcoin, yes, but what counts is which chain inherits the ticker BTC and is called Bitcoin by the majority of exchanges and thus has the Bitcoin price.
Because aside from technical merits, the network effect is really important on this race.

Do you mean you don't think many people will use SegWit2X? Or SegWit1X?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:19:12
As far as I know SegWit2X will happen in November, most people and organizations who agreed to that are saying they will carry on with that idea.
And then Core said the client will not follow with the block size increase.
So if I didn't get it wrong, there will be a fork anyway... right?
Then the only issue is whether Bitcoin Core is the one deviating or SegWit2X. The one deviating is the one which should add protections.
On the one hand, SegWit2X seems to have a broad majority of stakeholders involved. From that perspective, they are the Bitcoin chain.
But on the other hand, SegWit2X is "changing" the current status quo. From that perspective, they are deviating.
What I cannot understand though, is that in my opinion almost all your list about Bitcoin Cash being superior to SegWit2X also applies to SegWit1X. 
Wouldn't it be a lot easier for Bitcoin Core to implement those improvements and be done with it...?

What I'm trying to hint at here is that there is no "official" anything in Bitcoin. I don't even think that the Bitcoin Foundation at  is claiming to be the "official" bitcoin website.
At least they didn't use to do it, they were very careful with their communication. Maybe that has changed...

What does "official" mean in the context of Bitcoin...?
