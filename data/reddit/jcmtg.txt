Please mention that this requires a coinbase account first. The user must simply NOT buy on coinbase, but sign up for an account on GDAX after their coinbase account is approved. Then, in the GDAX interface, perform the bank transfer. NOT PERFORM A DIRECT BITCOIN BUY FROM COINBASE.

The advice work regardless of stake. If you know the price is going down selling and reacquiring more coins later is logical.
if however you want to get out completely and do not foresee any price increase int he future, at all. then cut losses.

[futures markets effects on the  spot](


Also, the sentiment from all of my observed "pro traders" that aren't believers in Bitcoin are to short Bitcoin and "drain" the BTCUSD price.
Sounds like an Us vs. Them mentality.
Of those links, i couldn't find anything about the effects on a Market whose cap is X but the influx 1-order-of-magnitude-higher-than-X amount of Futures trading on it.
If you can solve that then you can predict the market by EOY. If your answer is "it will do nothing" then these memes like OP posted ought to continue the bull trend.

Regulation relevant because he brought it up as a concern.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:24:15
as a btc holder i am bullish on it. what makes THEM not bullish? could be many reasons. But i think that interpreting the message of Conclusions  and  as bullish on the price of btc is wrong. Esp coming from wall streeters.

It's like a magical rock that grows and shrinks when Miners act on it. The price of ore goes down and so some of them leave.  But then the rock magically corrects its size so that the Miners who stay can all create the same amount of ore from it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:28:38
If consensus thinks so, then yes, it's possible. But, I doubt it.
More likely: a slight increase in cap to keep miners busy to keep transactions processed to keep transaction fees low. All the while the base price in USD goes up to keep miners interested in processing transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:11:34
Alt coins to launder it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:01:12


You don't mean lenders and borrowers? because transfer of bitcoin is built right into it.


If you're criticizing bitcoin for not have an inherent mechanism to facilitate Lending then fine: of course it doesn't do that.
It's role is to be a currency... not a Man and a Contract that you (a Person) signs, nor also a Debt Collector if you don't pay back.
Of all of those actors above, in the typical Lending scheme of our modern day, bitcoins role is the capital that gets lent.  
In order for the other actors to take part in this Pantomime of modern day lending, they need to be built.


We're talking computer technology here. Automation of all of these mechanisms is possible.
I'm interested to here about what particular mechanism of the Finance sector aren't able to be reproduced by block chains.
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:17:38
so create as many alt coins as we can in order to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can? gotcha.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:11:01
How will banks solve the "incentive problem"? In order to get public miners to keep securing a blockchain owned by these so-called Shitty Banks That We All Hate, the Bank would need to fork over some $$$.  
See? Disrupted.
Also, not much need for Bank tellers now, is there?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:16:16


step 1. get blockchain and bitcoin into public awareness.
step 2. educate public on what alt coins are (they are slow databases)
step 3. alt coins go to zero
step 4. profit.

That's right, the [target]( does get smaller or larger based on miner count but the system does count miners it counts other things to infer the count, like:
* with the current target size, how fast do we expect it to take it for someone to hit it?
* how fast did someone actually hit it?
* let's use the above two to figure out if miners are leaving or going: if leaving then make target easier else do the opposite.

When this argument comes up...


Just ask them why and who they trust their money with. That should shut them up or have them challenging you/bitcoin. 
And then you can explain the blockchain and decentralization.
Then they can be onboard but worry about things  transaction fees and delays like the rest of us!

Not bullish on BTC but on blockchain. And comments on lack of regulation.
Just come out and say it you wall st fucks: "Don't look at bitcoin until we're done fucking around (gobbling up) with it. Then, when RegulaCoin comes out we'll tie our lions share of BTC to it, treat btc as gold, and regulacoin as fiat."

The mechanism that bitcoin uses to show "WHO-owns-WHAT?' is both more secure and more accurate than whatever goes on behind closed doors in the banking industry.
Using a new technology for ones benefit isn't limited to just individuals. One would assume that corporations and governments may also look into this technology.  If you can concede the previous statement, then perhaps you should next determine if bitcoin technology (blockchain) is a beneficial piece of tech. see video below, it is a lecture explaining the technology.  warning, it uses basic Computer Science terminology like nodes, encryption, parent, child, etc.  
Regarding trust, it's as much trust as you have in cryptography.
Scientists and Mathematicians seem to trust it.

Refresh your [blockchain basics]( And note that this proposed change called "Segwit2x" is purposefully not fixing a glaring hole which allows Replay Attacks.  Do you like getting charged twice for things? If bitcoin would allow you getting charged twice what good would bitcoin be? It would make users and miners lose confidence in it. 
Question: By golly who would want that to happen? Answer: whomever/whatever bitcoin is disrupting (Financing/Banking).
