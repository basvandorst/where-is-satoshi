I think it's scary how you can sell half your holdings on a Thursday, think you've got a good deal and then think what the hell have I done on a Monday!! :D

It's as easy as trading anything, with more volatility. Good luck.

1. Their support is non existent, I verified with SEPA to be able to withdraw money but although it says I'm verified I'm still unable to withdraw.  Support send me two automated emails asking if this resolved before I bought back into BTC and transferred it all out.
2. I feel that their fees are way above what they should be.
They are  easy to use, it's pretty straightforward. But these two issues (for me) have resulted in me moving elsewhere.

I sold a few days ago - half my stash. I don't think it will go below $3000 again but I had to lock in profits.
However, it's a volatile, unpredictable currency/asset so your guess is as good as mine to be honest.

localbitcoins works well for me in the UK. Coinbase is shite.
bittylicious works as well but can be on the expensive side.

Nice. I'll sign up for shits and giggles. Will you be announcing the winners? Because, you know, talk is cheap! ;)

1. Any amount of BTC is worth the effort. We all believe in hodling BTC long term. Spending if you want but reinvesting in fiat when you do.
2. This is not a get rich quick scheme. Be prepared to lose everything. But the opportunity for growth is there - we've seen it over the past year and the past 10 years. We expect this growth to continue.
3. For a small amount, a paper wallet would be fine. You need to make backups of your your private keys, because if your wallet is lost/stolen/burnt you will lose your bitcoins.
4. Keep hodling

Thanks, I know it was the right decision because I have been thinking about it for a while now. I said after I sold that if it dips again I'll buy back in. Go figure!! :D

I sold half my hodlings on Thursday to lock in some profits. Annoyed but I still have btc and will now hodl for a few more years.

localbitcoins, bittylicious, coinbase are a few which I use in the UK.

70 BTC? Whoahh big spender calm down
No one knows the answer to your question. If we did, we'd all be BTC traders. 
I personally expect a correction on this price at some point. However that correction could be from $4000 or $5000.
If you're investing $70, buy $35 now. Wait a week, buy another $35, and continue that. Its called dollar cost averaging and is a well know technique used to invest in stocks and shares.

Just read your strategy and portfolio. Very interesting and well done so far.
Can you share some of the reddit pages you subscribe to? (i presume you do).

I gave a colleague 0.1 btc in 2014 as a paper wallet. Said to keep it safe as it'll be worth a lot later in life. They lost the paper wallet...
However when I owe friends money, I now get them to download a wallet onto their phone and pay them in btc
