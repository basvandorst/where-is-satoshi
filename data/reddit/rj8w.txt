What's the best service for US customers to buy reoccurring buys for Bitcoin (daily or weekly) at small amounts and minimum fees? Coinbase has the ability but the fees make it not worth it if it's something small like $5/day. Cash app has no fees but as far as I can tell there is no reoccurring buy option.

Your comment is irrelevant and off-topic to the thread. I'm sure you can read tons of debate and theory on what makes something a store of value elsewhere

Go to gdax and look at the depth chart, and steep sell or buys are called walls

Right, but if mass adoption is going to happen and btc is going to be used as both a store of value and a currency, then this is an issue that would likely surface.

Edit2: but then you'd have the backup phrases at your house anyways.. this is becoming a mess. Do you understand yet what I meant? There has to be a solution I don't know about - which is why I created this post.

The scenerio is everyone having their life savings at a bank vs everyone having their life savings stored in an offline wallet somewhere in their house. If crypto is to have mass adoption and be used as a currency and a store of value, everyone would have all of their life savings stored in private keys somewhere in their house. Rather than at a bank. That's the point of my hypothetical.
The alternative would be everyone saving their private seed in a centralized location (not in their house/possession). And that brings us back to the issue of centralization..
Edit: I suppose you could have your wallet at somewhere like a safety deposit box, but the wallet can only be opened by the owner because it requires a phrase that only the owner would know

I owed my dad $50 or so, and told him i'm only paying him back in bitcoin. He reluctantly agreed, so I helped him set up a wallet and sent some $50 worth over to him. He learned a little bit about how crypto works and said from now on he wants me to pay him back only in bitcoin lol

If you want the best available hardware wallet, get the coldcard. 
If you want to use a good but cheaper option, use the ledger nano s or trezor model one. 
The coldcard allows you to use Bitcoin without connecting the device directly to the computer, and it can interface with wallets like wasabi for better privacy.
Edit: from my personal perspective, I used to use the ledger as my main wallet, and was very hesitant to switch to the coldcard because of the pricetag, but I made the jump and have no regrets. It was a great decision.
@_date: 2019-11-28 00:29:39
Wasabi by itself is a hot wallet. And to use coinjoin you need to use a hot wallet. 
But wasabi is compatible with hardware wallets. I've only used it with the coldcard and the partially signed Bitcoin transaction feature and it goes something like this --
1. Plug microSD into coldcard
2. Click format microSD button on coldcard
3. Plug microSD into computer and open wasabi 
4. Click import coldcard button on wasabi 
And that's it. Now you can receive funds as normal on wasabi but it's sent to your coldcard wallet. You can generate as many new addresses as you want and it's all coldcard addresses without having to actually connect the coldcard. You only need to bring out the coldcard to sign transactions if you want to send funds. 
So my personal set up is send funds to wasabi hot wallet , use coin join, then send them to my coldcard wasabi wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:49:09
Worth the wait imo. It feels great to mix in wasabi then move them over to my coldcard + wasabi combo. 
Also, if you use the coldcard + PSBT wasabi combo, you never actually have to touch the coldcard to receive funds after the initial setup. Only when sending. So if you use it for cold storage you never really have to touch it, just keep it stowed away safely

1. Coinbase as an exchange is reputable but exchanges have a history of being hacked. It's not worth the risk. But just as importantly, your phone and computer can easily get hacked. Someone can log into your account and transfer the Bitcoin off of it. 
2. Hardware wallets come with a backup phrase Which allows you to restore your wallet if you lose the hardware wallet itself. Securing the backup phrase is extremely important and shouldn't be shared with anyone and never put online
@_date: 2019-10-14 20:18:22
If that's got a pre-generated private key, do not use it

Why did my grandma call me and tell me Bitcoin got hacked? She said she saw something on channel 2 news.  Anyone know what she saw? ��

There is no rhyme or reason for most short term (0-5 month) price swings. The market doesn't have a big enough market cap to drown out individual whales and noise. Anyone that says otherwise is either lying, wrong, or purposely being deceitful.
The only price pattern that I believe bitcoin may follow, in long term cycles, is the stock to flow model. You should read this article:

Note: I personally don't trade, don't try to time the market, and do dollar cost average.

I just downloaded Lolli and bought stuff from a partnered retailer, but my balance hasn't changed and my activities page doesn't show I bought anything. Did I do something wrong?
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:34:28
That's what I did at first, but I keep seeing it pop up all over the place. I may try testing it out
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:04:13
Lolli is a service related to Bitcoin so idk where else I'd ask lol
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:43:28
Thanks for the explanation. Is it set up in such a way that port 8333 can only communicate with Bitcoin core Software? Or does this allow access to every software on the computer? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:12:36
Right, but is the node software the only software that will do that? Or is that port in communication with everything on my computer 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:52:02
Thanks a bunch for the explanation. So basically all the trust I need is in the node software, as it is the only source of communication between the open port and my computer.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:43:46
So I'd basically send my coins to Wasabi, maybe transfer between a couple wasabi wallets, and then just withdrawal to my cold storage address? Or am I missing a step
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:46:30
Yep. It's just a really interesting idea imo
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:42:10
Wouldn't you have to do that through an exchange though?

Wow, thank you for the long response. Much appreciated
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:36:33
Yeah I have a lot of trouble trusting any of these crypto mixers, even the "reputable" ones. I visited a few of the websites and just didn't get a good vibe from then
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:38:43
Yeah I agree it's a bad idea, but it is one someone with a lot of influence may one day try to push. I've personally never heard anyone talk about it before though

Thanks a lot for all of the information. Hopefully more people decide to opt for privacy ��
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:41:48
I think we all agree it'd be devastating if Satoshi moved some funds and proved they had access to around 1 million Bitcoin. 
I'm not saying we should, but would it be possible to just remove all known Satoshi addresses, lowering the Bitcoin supply to around 20 million instead of 21?
This is probably a terrible idea and could set a precedent for stealing/censoring in the future, but I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts ��
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:52:52
It is possible as long as there is consensus. But like I said before, I don't support the idea
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:38:50
That transaction would be visible to everyone in the blockchain. 
It'd look something like this..
Coinbase -&gt; wallet -&gt; new wallet
It'd be pretty obvious who the address belongs to haha
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:09:15
That's actually a pretty cool point I've never thought about. 
I'd say in general that clean coins would vastly outweigh dirty coins in terms of volume, and the chances you'd obtain a majority of dirty coins would be slim to none. 
Also, if decentralized exchanges one day become fully operational, liquid, and popular, I'd imagine dirty coins would start to become a non-issue as there'd be so many ways around introducing them into the market
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:04:15
All of the things you said make sense and I fully agree, and Im actually undecided to whether I'd want to make my holdings anonymous. 
I just really like the idea of having privacy, and do think privacy is something really important to consider. At a minimum, with proper steps, anonymous Bitcoin is something someone can have it they want it, and I think it's at least worth knowing how. 
I think if mass adoption ever occurs and people use Bitcoin for day to day transactions, it'd be kinda silly if the funds in the wallet used we're ever traced back to a main savings account. That just doesn't seem practical as it'd be a massive breach of privacy (I know there are other ways around this..).
So yeah this is just as much a learning for me as it is a consideration. Maybe I'll test it out with a small amount just to give it a shot and see how it works
