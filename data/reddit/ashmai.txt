I personally don't blame the community for shit posts, memes, humor, and HODL content. The reason? There simply isn't enough technical bitcoin talk happening daily to fill a subreddit with enough content to appease 15,000 active users browsing...
Adoption is outpacing (by far) daily batches of new technical discussion... If you removed all the memes, you'd end up with a subreddit with 3 posts a week that actually cover something technically worth hashing over.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:14:37

If you have 5 apples and I take 3 from the pile, you will notice. And if I add 3 to the pile, you will notice. If you have 10,000 apples and I remove 3 from the pile, you won't notice.
bitcoin is in its early stages, and although it seems like a ton of people are trading, adoption is so small. It isn't that hard for a company or exchange or early investor to pull 100 bitcoin (or 3 apples from the pile of 5) out and affect the price.

If you have coins on a hardware wallet like Nano S, it will take you roughly 10 minutes on a good day to get enough confirmations from your exchange (GDAX) to release for trades.
If you're a day trader, 10 minutes is too long for these prices drops / increases, so they keep their day-trading coins on the exchange. Also, you have to have coins to backup a sell or a buy order. So if you want to put automatic purchases or sells in place, you have to have the funds on the exchange.

Well let me through some hard fucking math your way.
If you put 100 dollars in now, when bitcoin hits 32,000 USD a coin, you will have a profit of 100 dollars.

This is a great idea, thank you so much for doing this.
I've posted this about a month ago, and although I got good feedback it was down-voted quite hard because of the subreddit rules about asking for donations for smaller, non-official causes. However it has been a year-long dream of mine, and I won't let that get in my way. I certainly wouldn't need a full bitcoin, as my project could be completed successfully for around .32 BTC.
(TLDR at the bottom)
Over the last 5 years I've been working with organizations that support refugees, typically from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Africa, resettle here in the US-of-A. I'm the guy who picks them up from the airport when they first touch down and bring them and their families to stay at my home while we work through the long process of getting them a new life here in the States. It is has been very rewarding, and I've made lifelong friends with families all over the world and learned a lot about compassion and the human element. [Video of a family of 10 from Africa breaking it down in my living room.](
About a year ago I wanted to find a more creative way to donate my time. My sister is in the medical field, a hospice nurse, and I am very passionate about Virtual Reality. I've been working with and developing on the side since the DK1 (Oculus early developer kit). Having the hardware on hand its always been fun for me to plug in refugees (from my work with World Relief above) and show them something they have never seen before, watch the amazement in their eyes as I fly them down to their homes on foreign soil, let the kids ride roller coasters (in VR) for the first time, and take them to the bottom of the oceans. It has been wonderful.
My goal is to work with Hospice patients here in Spokane WA, as well as the children's hospital, and bring these experiences to the elderly and young. I'll build a portable VR solution that I can load into my vehicle and travel to the patients home (if they are on hospice) or room to room at a hospital for children. I've been stashing away a couple hundred dollars a month working towards this goal, as well as starting my [caregiver training]( (required before I can visit patients, luckily my sister walks me through all this!). However, at this rate, I won't be able to bring this work into reality for years.
And here is where YOU come in! I'm looking to raise roughly 0.32BTC (or about $3,500). This would cover the materials I need to build the portable transportation unit for the VR setup, the VR system (Oculus, as now I use Vive but it isn't as portable), and the hardware needed to power the beast.
Originally I started by reaching out to larger corporations (Most said, including Wells Fargo, they wouldn't support me because I don't have a non-profit tax ID.) Other than volunteer work and VR, my other passion is bitcoin, so I thought what better way to combine them to fund this beast.
Once I get this going I plan on recording my visits with patients when appropriate, and post the results of your donations :)
About me: Just a 37 year old IT engineer working for "the man", trying to give back a little. Got sick of hearing people "praying for change" and decided years ago to try and do some actual real work.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!
TLDR: Raising bitcoin for a project to bring virtual reality to elderly hospice patients and children in the hospital. Looking for roughly 0.32BTC.

The fees were accounted for in the bitpay app. And locked for 15 minutes awaiting my deposit. After one minute it failed saying transaction amount wasn't high enough.
Oh well, someone else pointed out not to send from an exchange and send from a personal wallet. I'll do that next time, but think I'll pay with fiat and try bitcoin purchased when things get figured out in the future. Thank :)

Hmm how would this example work.

Day 60: transfer from hardware wallet 1,000 USD worth of BTC to Coinbase
Day 61: sell the BTC for USD, send to bank account.
Day 62: take 1,000 from bank account in cash and buy hookers.
In the EXAMPLE above, how would IRS know that 1,000 in Btc converted to USD was gains on the original 500, and not someone paying me for a Ps4 and Rockband.

@_date: 2017-12-08 06:24:16
I don't day trade, but believe although GDAX and Coinbase are sister companies, their wallets are seperate. So you would have to send coins from your Coinbase wallet to the GDAX wallet, although there is a tool that does this for you through their site. I don't believe fees come into place unless you want to turn the coins into dollar bills, yo. But haven't done it myself. Day trading will fuck a man.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:09:03
you can only fit so many transactions into a 10 minute block. People fight for that space by paying a little extra in fees. When the unconfirmed transactions are as high as they are right now and people are waiting in line, you have to pay a lot to get to the front.
Yes its a problem, yes everyone is aware, yes devs are working on solutions, no they aren't here yet.

I'm not a supporter of bcash. Sold shortly after it split, and large majority of coins I hold are BTC. Not sure I'd lie about that. I simply am a realist, and am crossing my fingers scaling solution get here ASAP. If we can't spend or move coins right now due to fees and pending transactions it really could hurt us in the short term.

Ok thanks. Also, when Ledger "pushed" this change, and I tried it, it wasn't activated yet on my device. I waited and hour and tried again and this time when I powered it on, it asked me if I wanted to use legacy bitcoin or segwit. I choose segwit, made a new wallet there, then bounced back to legacy and transferred my funds from that into the new segwit address. Fees seemed higher than expected, but oh wells now I'm moved over.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:25:19
Having a standard USB key, vs something like Ledger Wallet or another hardware key that still plugs into USB, is that hardware designed for coins (like Ledger) has prevention built into it which would prevent someone plugging it into their USB drive and seeing files that could possibly be manipulated.
So would a normal USB key be better than a online wallet held in an exchange? Probably. If its kept safe. But is it as good as a hardware wallet you hold, thats designed from the ground up to prevent tampering? Negatory
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:08:28
Is there anything I should be doing with my other wallets, in regards to my node?

If you have someone sending you bitcoins, you don't need an exchange. If you need to CONVERT FIAT (real moneyz) into BTC, you need to use an exchange that is attached to your bank account.

This. There is a drop down in the Ledger app, I'm not looking at it now but it was like low, medium, high fees. I had it on high (which I think was default). I can snag the transaction and post it in the AM, in bed and don't wanna plug it in to depress myself. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:28:43
It's huge... Like 150 GB, bandwidth hog also. It helps the resiliency of the bitcoin process, and I run it myself. But if I had a laptop with limited space, or a metered connection I'd pass. Just store your coins on your phone or a PC. And if you have a bit of money in the game, get a hardware wallet like Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:28:37
If it goes onto hardware that isn't designed with anti-tampering in mind, lock that bitch up in a safe.

Awesome, I'll wait a week. On a side note I can't figure out why although some of my funds have cleared completely (shows so on my Gemini transaction page) when I try and transfer Btc to a different wallet, it says zero funds available for transfer. Shows the funds in Btc, in my account. And cleared. But won't let me move them. Hmmm

@_date: 2017-08-27 17:26:33
You won't lose coins choosing either one, but I'd go with segwit because everything will be using it evenually anyways. Then get some coins from an exchange, and send them on over to your Ledger! Easy mode.

@_date: 2017-08-21 23:24:26
General advice (and from good sources like Andreas Antonopoulos) is to keep your coins as they are and don't move them until a month or so after the split occurs. If the split is a hard split (resulting in forcing users one way or the other) I believe you're given coins on both sides of the fork. If its a soft split you won't even notice anything happening (other than an increase or decrease in coin values).
I'm still trying to figure it out, but regardless if you understand it or not, HODL your coins during these times of splits.
EDIT : This video is a great resource for understanding forks. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:11:17
how dare you
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:49:13
But just remember, and this may not be a huge deal for you or not, but if you transfer segwit to segwit right now, the confirmation times are TERRIBLE. Miners are avoiding them being dicks. I've done my part and changed my wallet over, but christ this is painful.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:05:29

It says "Transaction fee is too low". But Ledger also allows me to accelerate the confirmation through their tool, I just don't want to pay a 8 dollar fee for a 1.20 cent transaction.

No joke. I don't even know if there is currently a system for this problem we are facing, I assume there is (and I just don't see it happening because I'm dumb) or its being planned as we speak... This whole "I'll go mine shitcoins if it pays me more, fuck everyone else" mentality. Which yes is human nature, but,,,, fuck man I'm just mad. I need a drink.
Its also preventing me from moving my coins off my exchange to my ledger, because my fees are so god damn high I'm waiting it out.

Oh man I just posted my concern about this. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:28:43
There is a good chance, but hard to say. Just HODL.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:40:45
Because during a fork, you are either going to see just some price fluctuations (soft fork) or you receiving coins on the hard forked currency, allowing you to choose later what to do with them. (my understanding?)
The general consensus I've been reading is to HODL on forks, and watch the market closely for a month or so after before making a choice (if one is needed) on what to do with your coins.
Also, keep your keys on a hardware wallet you own, and not in a exchange. This allows YOU to make the choice on what your coins will do after a split, and not default to whatever choice the exchange feels it wants to take.
PS I have no idea what the F I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:09:36

@_date: 2017-08-26 20:38:28
Never does, meaning it may show "pending" forever on both sides? Crap this stuff needs to get figured out. If I open my Ledger Nano S, and send someone money using default options (High, Fast Confirmation), it should get to them and be confirmed much quicker.

I should point out, it was a small transaction for a new friend I got into bitcoins who just set up his Ledger segwit wallet. I had the "high fee" option checked, and now if I try and accelerate the confirmation, it will cost me about $8 USD. My initial amount I sent him was $1.20

I am using Gemini as my exchange, and bank with Wells Fargo. I sent a wire transfer over to Gemini from within my bank, and the next day the full amount was on my Exchange and cleared for full use.

I sent a lot of money in wire transfers out of Wells into crypto. Zero problems. Took me 5 minutes in the bank and less than a day for funds to fully clear on exchange.

So I know it's kinda a pain in the ass but Ledger has a way to validate the firmware hasn't been tampered with, but requires opening the device and doing some technical work. I'd post link but typing from cell phone in bed. You can good it though.
My personal advice if you're uncomfortable with opening the Ledger to validate it hasn't been messed with, return that mother fucker fast and get a sealed one, and try not to use 3rd parties or sales from individuals.
Could you imagine putting your crypto on that, only to find its been transfered to another account shortly after?
Scary.

You're looking for a hardware wallet. Like a Ledger Nano S, as an example. Its a physical device that looks similar to a USB flash drive, small in size, with a digital screen. You plug it into your PC, authenticate, and can now accept and send your crypto coins (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, etc etc) through this device.
They are very easy to use. The documentation is straightforward. You will write down a series of words that will act as your "private key". This should be put in a safe, buried, or given to me for safe keeping (PM me for shipping address).
You will then set an 8 digit "pin code" for your new hardware wallet that will be required to enter every time you plug it into your PC.
What happens if your hardware wallet is stolen? Well, the thief will have a few attempts at guessing your pin code, upon all failures, the device will lock itself out and no longer be usable. Also if you accidentally lose it, or run over it with a tank.
But worry not! You simply get another wallet, import those "private key" words you have written down and hid in a hole in the forest, and your coins are safe.
Once your hardware key is all setup, simply log into your exchange, do a bitcoin send transfer, and plug in the address that shows up on your hardware wallet. Wait a few minutes and congrats, you no longer have your coins on an exchange, they are in your hand!

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:59:42
I've done it plenty. From Wells Fargo to Gemini. Easy, fast, and was available for spending in less than 12 hours from the time I sent the funds.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:37:59
Dont' worry about the price... Every time I've purchased in the past, I've done so at very near all time highs... Each time saying "Fuck I missed the boat.".... Every... Single... Time...
When its at 15 in a month, you'll not even flinch at the "high price" of 10k.
When you plug in the hardware wallet to your PC, you will open an app on your PC. I use a Google Chrome plugin that is made by Ledger (the company that owns the hardware wallet you will get). The software app authenticates with the hardware wallet and shows you a pretty little user interface you interact with. Here is a shot of what the software you will use looks like if you DO NOT have the hardware plugged in yet. 
As soon as you plug it in, that screen changes and shows you your balances and options.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:31:14
well each time you click the "receive" button from your hardware wallet, a new address is typically generated. So how it would work is 
1. log into your exchange
2. open your hardware wallet.
3. from hardware wallet hit "receive" and copy your incoming address
4. back in your exchange you do a BTC transfer out, and it will ask where do you want to send it. Paste your address you copied then VERIFY they match, as there is hacking software that can change the deposit address when you paste (rare but check anyway).
5. Once you press the send button from your Exchange, I usually wait just long enough for it to show up on my hardware wallet. This takes roughly 10 seconds to show up with no confirmations. At that point you can unplug it. It does NOT matter if the hardware wallet is plugged in or not. When you plug it in at a later date, it refreshes, validates, and will show the coins.

I've been using them as my primary exchange for a while now, other than today's outage at a very inopportune time, they have been great.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:26:12
The fee to send Bitcoin TO your hardware wallet will be covered by your Exchange (Coinbase, Gemini).
You can NOT make fiat -&gt; crypto purchases through the hardware wallet. That will always be done on the exchange, then transferred to your hardware wallet :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:33
It's a nice sale for sure. With so much support and people wanting in, I was too scared to hold off my next buy and snagged a few minutes ago. Maybe it will keep falling but I can't imagine it lasting long. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 02:18:13
If you aren't dropping 40 - 260k on hardware investments, data-center cooling, power costs, infrastructure, etc it isn't worth it. Those days are gone.
Your PC is meant to do a lot of different things fairly efficiently. The bitcoin specific hardware on the market now doesn't do anything but one task (decrypting sha 256 hashes). And it does it so damn good it is like comparing an old 486 with the amber "turbo button" against a brand new i7 chip.

Wonderful cheer mate! Awesome idea! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:53:18
Crazy, yes. But also makes me..... appreciate? how vulnerable the price still is... If we saw some US regulation against coins come out, the price would fall below 2k lol.
Still, I held. Was I woken up at 7am by my bitcoin price drop alarms? yes. Did I jump up in the dark and crash into my table and cut my foot in the panic to get to my PC? maybe.
BUT I HELD.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:02:43
Did this through Wells Fargo last week. Took me 5 minutes with a banker and the money was in my Gemini account in less than 24 hours and completely unlocked for my use. Easy mode.
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:49:22
I'm a huge fan of HODL'ing, however if I was EVEN or up on my BTC, I'd personally sell, and put a large buy order in for my original break even amount.
That being said, if you aren't even or positive on your coins, I'd most certainly hodl. Never sell at a loss.
PS, I have literally no clue WTF I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:44:22
Use Gemini for your exchange, and get a Ledger Nano S for your hardware wallet where you'll transfer your coins after your purchase on the exchange. I've done over 16k USD using these tools and it's been easy as pie.

First off, I need some answers... Who the F is "e" you refer to?
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:00:18
The high fees I'm seeing, is trying to get the coins OUT of coinbase, onto the hardware wallet. How is this reduced, or avoided?
EDIT : Nevermind I see... You withdraw FROM GDAX to your personal wallet... Zero fees, awesome. I thought you had to go back to coinbase first. Thanks!

Their attitude with change once it's financially beneficial to them. Crypto monies is extremely threatening to their whole system, they won't be in a hurry to fund or take risk on investments that will build the foundation of their downfall.

I just posted awhile ago looking for info on purchasing bitcoin ATMs in WA State. Having a hard time finding info
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:32:56
First think you want to do is get an account on an Exchange. If you're US based, you can try Coinbase or Gemini. I use Gemini, I've typically found them very helpful and fees appropriate. I also like their UI better, and their support has been great considering how much traffic they are getting.
That process can take 1 - 2 weeks, be prepared to "hurry up and wait". You have to provide ID, and your bank account information.
Once that is confirmed, you have two ways to buy. Immediately for smaller amounts (usually less than 500 USD -&gt; BTC), or a Wire transfer from your bank to the Exchange you chose. If you buy Immediately, although the price of BTC you buy in at is secured, you won't be able to move those coins in any direction until that transaction clears your bank account. This can take a week. So if you plan on buying BTC &lt; $500, you can't send it out of your Exchange wallet (to for instance, a hard ware wallet you own) or cash back out to USD, until that original purchase clears.
If you are in a hurry, and want to move more than $500, I'd suggest going to your bank and doing a wire transfer. I bank with Wells Fargo and this process took less than 24 hours to hit my Exchange and full funds were available to trade.
Once you have your shiny new coins, you will have to choose. Do you feel comfortable keeping your coins on the exchange you chose? Most do not, at least in large amounts. I won't keep more than $500 on an exchange in the event it crashes (which is becoming more and more improbable, but not impossible). If you have coins / USD on an exchange, and something terrible happens like MtGox, you will lose everything.
Option 2 is keeping your coins on a hardware wallet. These typically cost between 60 - 150 US, so have a higher entry point to get into the game, but allow you to keep your private keys (which are what proves you own the coins) held securely and in your own hands.
My advice, if you're looking to spend less than a couple hundred dollars, buy your coins on an Exchange, and transfer off to a wallet on your cell phone. Once you start to get more than a couple hundred dollars worth of coins, it may be a good idea to invest in a longer term storage solution like a hardware wallet. (Ledger Nano S, etc).
Last advice, I wouldn't attempt the "day trading" game with BTC unless you really know what you're doing. You will lose money. Just keep your coins for a year and re-evaluate your position.

Dude calm down. I've used Gemini for large wires twice, once took 24 hours, the other, 3 days. Both arrived safely. Gemini has been great for my exchange.

This was another false alarm by China. All their exchanges are still up and no one over there has any clue WTF they are talking about. They scare people, buy the dip and profit.
Business as usual. China isn't banning bitcoin... They are however banning ICO's, which isn't a bad thing.

I use "CoinAlarm" for android, its awesome. You set highs and lows to alert you on and just forget about it. It will trip alarms when your thresholds are crossed.
I also loves how it displays the data.

If I sold, I wouldn't be out the game, I'm buy back again hoping the drop would be 1k. I didn't sell anything BTW, because my money is down quite a bit right now lol. My ONLY choice is to buy at this point. I refuse to sell at a loss.

Its easy for me to say HODL, I'm down 2k under all my investment prices. My only choice is to hold. If I was still at a profit however, it'd be hard to hold onto coins.

1. Exchange = The online website you use to convert your local currency into crypto-currencies.
2. MtGox, just [read here.](
3. The real "ownership" of bitcoin is in the private key. If you keep your coins on an Exchange, they hold the private keys for those coins, even if you "bought" them. If you have your coins on an application that provides you with the private key (usually converted into 24 words you can write down) then in the event you lose the application (ie, you have your wallet on your cell phone, or PC, and they break) you can restore the coins you own with that private key. If you're going to buy a full bitcoin, my advice would be to get a hardware wallet (I use a Ledger Nano S) which gives you "cold storage" (Meaning it isn't connected to any online device) + your private keys, which you will write down and store somewhere safe. Having a wallet on your cell phone is safe as well, assuming you can export your private key in the event your phone is lost / stolen. Not as safe as a hardware wallet, but better than keeping your coins on an Exchange.
4. yes, this is best bet :) Just keep an eye on the bitcoin news, and watch for hard forks at a high level, to ensure bitcoin is still the majority holder in the crypto space.
5. If you decide to sell x amount of bitcoin via Coinbase, transferring those local currency funds to your bank account, this takes (in the US at least) a couple days to "clear". I don't know what you will tell your bank where the funds came from, I don't think crypto is illegal in Greece? Can't you just show them where it came from? In the states the banks don't care where the money came from, but the government sure does care if you are making capital gains on your initial investment, and will want to collect their taxes when going from bitcoin -&gt; fiat.

You aren't coming across as rude, no worries. I'd have to convert a small amount of it to FIAT, yes. Newegg would supply the rest. However for me its more about possible exposure, so why not. Every time I am with a caregiver or patient who inquires about my volunteer work on this front, they get to hear about how bitcoin really was the facilitator. The local news wants to run a story on it if I can get this going, and you can be sure I'll be plugging that.

Not sure what old timers are... I came in hot at about 3k (few months BEFORE the ATH). Rode the ride from 3k to 20k shitting myself. Then rode it back down shitting myself.
Now I just buy a little each pay check and forget about it, I'm to the point where I honestly believe in the value and have already paid off all my original investment. I still look daily once or twice at price, but doesn't give me heart palps.
