2) Money as Debt (46 mins)
Explains how money evolved over time and why, to our current (fiat) version. Also explains the perils of our current money system.

Excellent question, but not exactly. We haven't had *direct* real asset value backing of the US dollar since 1971 - when the IMS was last reformed as Nixon used the guise of "international money speculators attacking the US dollar"….
**1971 Nixon on the “New Deal/IMS”:** 
.. to remove gold backing from the currency, thus allowing the USA to retain their reserve currency status and its accompanying “Exorbitant Privilege”…
**Exorbitant Privilege:** 
… This move was in part enacted as France started to lose confidence in the US dollar as early as 1965 and demanded its dollars be exchanged for vast sums of gold  (because gold was fixed at $35/oz) in 1971, which if the trade occurred, would have collapsed the US dollar.
**Charles de Gaulle (France Prime minister) 1965:** 
As such, what Rickards then attributes fiat to working since then - because it has - is *confidence*; but confidence in what and how has that confidence been maintained internationally? Enter the 1973 “Petrodollar”…
**Petrodollar:** 
The ultimate confidence is that countries that have their central banks holding reserves in US dollars know their reserves will retain most of their value (inflation aside). But why do countries hold US dollars in reserve in the first place? Because they need it to buy oil from the likes of: Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Kuwait, Nigeria, UAE, Quatar and Canada (not a complete list).  One by one, since 1973 these countries agreed to sell oil ONLY in US dollars in return for the military protection of the USA.  When Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya threatened to get off the Petrodollar, they were “liberated!”. The same thing is playing out in Syria right now; however, this time around Russia and China aren’t letting the US collapse Syria via proxy wars (see just last week’s headlines about Turkey via USA causing attempting to cause false flag to destabilize Syria).
**13 min summary video of all the above:** 


There are many reasons why something can be considered valuable, but at minimum at least the participants in the exchange of the thing must agree that it is worth something. That ‘something’ when it comes to currencies used to be gold – such that internationally, everyone could be on the same page as to the value of X currency. These days, given no currency is backed by gold, currencies must float against each other and only a few currencies are backed indirectly by oil. You could thus extend your question to ask, what is all the remaining fiat currencies inherent value? I believe the answer to that comes back to confidence – the confidence that I can exchange my “effort” (i.e. labour effort, business execution, speculative wit, etc) *consistently* for a similar number of units of X fiat currency. In other words, confidence comes from currency “price stability”. 
Now before the libertarians get all excited, yes the US dollar has lost 95%+ of all its value since 1913 etc, but that was and is by design and 95%+ isn’t exactly accurate when you take into consideration wage increases over the same period, though admittedly they have most definitely not kept up. Our Keynesian economy managed by central banks typically targets 1-2% yearly inflation – this is not at all good in the long term, but has allowed, at least for G20 countries for relatively acceptable price stability and a relatively ok functioning economy. Lastly, for the citizenry, confidence is also attributed to fiat currency by government decree; that is, governments assure its citizens that “trust us, these pieces of paper can and should be exchanged for goods and labour, and just in case you don’t trust us, we’ll demand you pay your taxes with it, else you go to jail”.
Bitcoin’s inherent value isn’t very likely going to be decreed by governments, so its confidence will have to be proven that other people (ideally the majority) will accept bitcoin for goods &amp; services, just like any other currency.  You can make all kinds of other technical (bitcoin uses encryption &amp; rules can’t be changed unless miners accept them etc) or economic arguments (bitcoin is deflationary, thus its value is extremely likely to increase long term etc), but really, for the masses, it will simply be that they can exchange it for goods &amp; services, or that if they hold it, it will maintain or increase in value – an aspect of the subconscious need for “price stability”. From that perspective, I’m not confident we’ll ever see that in bitcoin unless you get mass adoption, and ironically, you will probably not get mass adoption until you see price stability, although a continued series of mega bubbles will sure persuade a LOT of people to gamble and adopt bitcoin. I know I have ;-)

Your statement is contradictory. Who the hell would not want to use an asset class to store their wealth if it will continue to rise ?!?  High volatility as the price keeps rising is just fine by me.
I have a feeling you borrowed your comment from government/economist sources whom are trying to argue that bitcoin does not make a good currency.  The problem is, their theories do not match reality. Why? Because all they ever studied was inflationary economic designs and have nothing but assumptions on how deflationary economic currencies might work.
I have a good feeling that in about 5 years, they're going to have to re-write all their economic text books, at which point, any old economics degree will be just about worthless.
TL;DR: Don't get advice from people who spent years and thousands of dollars studying theories that might contradict reality.

You must be new to bitcoin. I think you're wrong on nearly all accounts. Here's why:


Wrong. At the low nm range, only companies with millions in their pockets can afford to produce an ASIC. Lower nm = only slight improvement in power/hashing efficiency but much higher cost, so risk = higher. Not everyone will be willing to take that risk.  Also a few existing companies may just flood the market with so much inefficient but cheaper asics as to block the point of entry for more efficient designers due to cost of entry/financial viability no longer making sense. Mining is very likely to become more and more centralized. It is the pattern already, it will continue. A 51% attack though may be more and more unlikely over time though. There's too much $ to be made by very few companies producing mining gear.


For what purpose? Doesn't WLAN work fine?


We don't need new programming languages to address issues in bitcoin. Not sure transactions can really be sped up. Data transfer improvements have nothing to do with bitcoin.


If bitcoin survives another 5 years, I think this may be a correct projection.


This is extremely unlikely, barring somebody finding a flaw in the SHA2 protocol (also extremely unlikely at this point).


Get out from under your rock. Governments are already regulating virtual currencies, and more and more regulation will come out for more and more countries.


Namecoin will be fully replaced by bitcoin 2.0 protocols. Namecoin has had years to take off, and it hasn't. It's dead and dying. Nobody uses it other than to merge mine with bitcoin for some extra profits.


To have cryptographic democracy you need a way to tie private keys to real people in real life, this may not be so trivial a task. Anything digital, has the potential to be hacked. Private keys do not assure the entire system will be trustworthy. We use private keys for all kinds of security IT related systems - they still get hacked in the end. Not because the private keys were hacked, but the system around the private keys were, and then the private keys were acquired. Bitcoin doesn't solve this problem.

You give ASICminer way too much credit. Do you even understand the crap design they did with their first ASIC? It was like copy/paste from ready-made templates, almost no optimizations were made.  I will give ASICminer one thing, they were by far the most business saavy of them all until things turned professional with silicon valley groups like hashfast, cointerra and KNC from EU. Did they rush their first design to be first to market? If so, they deserve applause, if it was any indication of their asic designing skills, then unless they put all those millions to good work hiring asic experts, I would not get my hopes up.  I'll take a wait and see approach, rather than assume they can beat the genius of Bitfury who learned how to make an Asic in 1 year, skipped all testing and went straight to production and ended up beating out the 28nm "expert" companies in power efficiency. That guy deserves some kind of nobel ASIC prize ;-)

Correct response: Cash transactions are more anonymous than bitcoin and perfectly legal in australia. When Silkroad 1 was taken down, the value of bitcoin exploded. This is because it became obvious to everyone that the number of bitcoin transactions per day remained in excess of 95% of the average bitcoin transaction volume. Therefor one can only conclude that bitcoin is not in fact used primarily for drug transactions. The prefered method for that is in fact cash.

1. That very few people actually understand how transaction fees work and that there is no dynamic algo yet to increase or decrease them. Recently they were manually decreased by core devs by a factor of 10x. 
2. That the bitcoin source code download now includes ~800 files but still only ~15.7MBytes in size.
3. That there's a bitcoin developer blog:
4. That there's 369 open "issues" in the latest verison, including 82 bugs, 5 of which are high priority and 51 medium priority:
5. That the version after 0.9.0 is not 1.0, but 0.10.0
6. That some guy with the handle "laanwj" has nearly twice as many commits to the bitcoin code as gavinandresen, and that there's been 171 different bitcoin contributers since July 10th, 2010
6. That there's 3,267 forks of bitcoin, but less than 300 alt-coins.
7. That bitcoin.net is still an unused domain registered in August, 2008, way before the bitcoin software was still used. It is owned by theymos (same guy that operates bitcointalk.org) where Satoshi made many of his forum posts.
8. That the guy that was a core contributer to the invention of PGP and the inventor of Proof of Work, was also the same guy that made the first bitcoin transaction in Jan 2009 and identified the first double-spend attack, giving it that actual name. His name is Hal Finney, and he once commented on how great the programming behind the bitcoin protocol was and that Satoshi replied (paraphrase) "Coming from you, that really means something to me".
8. That bitcoin contributer "ArtForz" once held nearly 25% of all bitcoins created at the time.

THIS! The  recommended advice by financial advisors is to turn down the risk level of your portfolio as you approach retirement. It took your dad an entire life-time of savings to get him to be able to retire, and in his case he wasn't even able to work all the normal necessary years, so as you stated his funding is hort. To put even some of that money in a high risk investment is just a BAD idea.
Mining bitcoins is very profitable, but only if you can get very cheap ASICs like the manufacturers can, and if you are damn lucky that the price explodes 10x after your ASIC finally arrived after all the months of delays... in which case if you had bought BTC instead of mining you'd have more money faster.
Even so, I would still advise your dad to keep less than 5% of his portfolio in purchased bitcoins and ZERO invested in bitcoin mining gear.
If you really want to mine, go mine alt coins using a multi-pool. You can still make money using GPUs, but keep in mind scrypt asics are coming out later this year, so time is short.
Lastly, buy fire insurance for your house if you plan on doing GPU mining to any extent. Last thing your dad needs is to lose his house to a house fire because a GPU meltdown or short circuit.
As for you... take 25% of your savings and go mine altcoins and learn something technically useful - Linux, scripting/shell languages, math, encryption, backups, etc. Take the other 25% and go invest in bitcoin and some altcoins and learn about finances, day trading, libertarianism, regulatory environments, trustworthy businesses (or lack thereof - exchanges), programming trading bots, and countless other things.  Even if bitcoin goes to $0, it will be cheap schooling for the rest of your life. If it goes to $50,000... heck, maybe you can even help your dad out.
Good luck

The union just wants to ensure its employees are fairly compensated - that is last year's salary + inflation adjustment of 2%/year going forward.  At the strike rally, one employee asks another... You know I've been thinking, why does everything go up in price 2% every year anyway? Computers are more efficient, cars are more efficient, food production is more efficient, house building is more efficient, we all work more efficiently with all our continuing increasing efficient tools, yet somehow the cost of living goes up not down. Why is that? The other employee shrugs, but at the same time a 3rd employee overhearing blurts out: It's because of money printing. And it's not just 2%... it's really more like 4-6%, they just twist the calculations and definitions of inflation so it doesn't sound so bad. Overall, they just keep printing more money every year, by the Trillions! It's basically counterfeiting because it decreases the value of our existing dollars, but this is the way the system is designed. Look, we can't even get an automatic 2% inflation increase in our wages to stay on par, we have to actually fight for it, which is ridiculous. It's impossible to get ahead. Just look at history, only our fathers used to work and they all had 3-5 children, now two parents work and can barely afford 1 or 2 kids. 2% inflation every year is a compounding problem that is now making our entire middle class poor. So what's the solution (asks one of the other 2 employees). We need to change the system from the ground up. Instead of an inflationary system, we need a deflationary system. You know, when a dollar earned and saved is still worth a dollar or more in buying power next year.  Then cut to cartoon logo: "BITCOIN - we can help with that". Bitcoin is the worlds most successful deflationary currency, helping people store and increase their wealth for 5 years running. We have no corrupt banks or politicians debasing our currency, we don't limit how much money you can take with you between countries, limit your transaction sizes or interogate you about the source of your money if you happen to dress funny today.  Stop proping up the old banker's world and start living in a future of hope and freedom. Start using bitcoin today, it's really quite simple! Here's how you can get started (then provide link to some intro on getting/using bitcoin).

Sorry, but your article doesn't make sense, primarily because it is not based on reality or realistic expectations.
First, competing alternatives are a good thing, not a bad thing. On one hand you expect things to evolve but don't want to fund alternatives  (even though you already did!).
Secondly, this notion that by funding 1 coin/group of people (i.e. bitcoin) should give you investment access to all future crytpocturencies, is utopian at best, idiotic otherwise.
When you buy a stock in Apple, you are NOT also buying a stock in Microsoft, and neither should you expect any equity in any other upcoming tech companies. That's just not how the world works.
The flawed idea that you can fund 1 group of people and then expect all subsequent groups to live off air and water without any funding and produce quality work in a timely manner is pretty naive / completely unrealistic.
People who do work need to get paid. End of story. Fragmentation is required for accelerated evolution. The free markets will decide the winners, and that means you gotta keep an eye on things, not simply make a 1 time investment and expect to retire in 5 years - that's also not how the world works.

My experience with CAVirtex for the past year has been quite satisfactory (high fees aside). From customer service to almost extreme processes that ensure they know that I am whom I am before I have access to my funds, not only during setup process but half way through the year unprompted verification.  I cannot speak to their technical proficiency in the back office, but their account verification processes are quite good.
I still recall them stating they kept something like 98% of customer bitcoins in cold storage and saying "we've never been hacked" - the latter of which was obviously a bad idea to state publicly, but for the time being I am not nervous about my bitcoins at their exchange. If in 2 days they have not re-enabled withdrawls, then yes, I will start getting nervous.
I should add that during the malleability issues earlier this year they were quite bad at communicating their good status to the public. No public announcements on their website, no pro-active emails, no twitter info. I had to personally email them and ask them what was their status, to which they responded promptly they were not affected and all was in good order.

Western nations would never agree to have the Yuan, plus China lies about all its economic data far more than the Western countries manipulate theirs (i.e. CPI=lies, BLS=BS, ISM=joke, etc).
There will never be another country who's national currency is a reserve currency - at least for my life time. No other country would agree to let 1 country have the "Exorbitant privilege" (wikipedia that) of a reserve currency that leads to "Triffen's dilemma" (wikipedia that).
At present we are heading into an East vs West scenario for global reserve currencies. US for west, Yuan for East... until the next global financial crash, at which point all G20 central banks have so much debt on their balance sheet, they can't expand further to bail out their countries without causing a major currency devaluation/crash/politically unpopular high inflation (not hyper inflation)... then, the IMF will come to the rescue and be the International lender of last resort to G20 Central Banks with their fiat "SDRs" (wikipedia that), whose value is tied to a basket of (yet undetermined) currencies and/or commodities (i.e. 20% Eur, 20% Yuan, 20% USD, 20% Gold, 20% Oil).
Then after this last global experiment fails and the world is in war or utter financial chaos far beyond 2008... then yes.. then bitcoin has a chance at being the global reserve currency. See you all in 2022-2025 or there abouts.

The easiest way to chuck out most conspiracy theories is when the conspirators make constant use of "correlation equals causation" and offer that as the founding proof/evidence. It's like nobody took a basic logic course in college. Also the best conspiracies (and "lies" by extension), are when you mix a bit of truth with a bit of false info - whether intentionally or not, cuz at some point you just have no idea what's real, what's not.

This subreddit's topic is a video that contains a 5 minute interview with best selling author, economist and financial expert Jim Rickards. Jim gives us a synopsis of his new (already  amazon best seller) book, not coming out until next week titled "The Death of Money". 
Amazon Book: 
If you've never heard of Jim before, look him up on youtube, he's done countless interviews on TV primarily on topics of the Federal Reserve and his previous book "Currency Wars". 
I'll warn that Jim is not a pro-bitcoin guy (he's pro gold), but I think that's in part because he's not fully understood its potential; regardless, this guy is very much worth listening to when it comes to the matter of the US dollar and the Federal Reserve.

Perhaps if you live in very low population rural areas, 1Km radius should be fairly safe, unless somebody decides to watch from a hill top which cars are driving to meet each other.

I haven't quite grasped the scenario of 'what happens if a node that receives coins to mix just drops off the face of the Earth', what happens to those coins? How do you work around this?
Side note: you should also consider building in a timeout setting, such that a node involved in mixing cannot hold coins for more than X seconds or Y coins or Z transactions (or some combination); else, they could sit there collecting as many coins as possible and then walking off with them - unless there's some other mitigation to this already?
In short, how do you mitigate against rogue nodes?  Yes you have mentioned something about kicking bad nodes out, but what's to prevent a rogue node from just re-spawning under a different ID?

Ok, I don't get it. How did the site manage to find all private keys in a matter of days/weeks or a few months?
Also, if they generated all the possible private/public key pairs and have it on a website, it means:
1. They have enough storage space and its probably not ridiculously huge
2. They certainly had less than all the CPU power in the world and managed to find all the key pairs
3. What's to prevent them from indexing it and making every pair searchable?
Possible Answer to my own questions: Am I to conclude they didn't find them all, and each page is generated on the fly as people click forward/next and since most people aren't going to click next/previous more than a few times, at most they store a few hundred page entries which accounts for less than .00000001% ^100+ of all key pairs?

Starting this petition is a great idea, but I think we can improve on the wording.  I don't have a lot of time to write this right now, but here goes:
**Topics Emphasis: (not a complete list)**
- Bitcoin has huge potential for growth in expanding jobs &amp; GDP (that gets their immediate attention). Try to find estimates of how big the industry is today and how big it will be in 5-10 years (i.e. Bitcoin will be a 100 Billion industry by 20XX &amp; a 1 Trillion dollar industry by 20XX)
- Mention that this is the biggest technological invention since the Internet and not to close the doors to Canadian Entrepreneurs at the onset. (i.e. cite that Bitcoin won the 2013 Silicon Valley prestigious Crunchies award for  best innovation of 2013)
- Mention that Canada is currently slightly ahead of the USA in some of the bitcoin innovation and excessive regulation will put us behind. (I.e. Exchanges &amp; we have our very own Satoshi Nakamoto:  Vitalik Buterin)
- Point south at USA and mention how NY has launched a public inquiry to gather information from the public, entrepreneurs, finance experts, law enforcement, venture capitalists  and academics. This because it is a complex subject and several governments already changed their initial stances due to lack of initial understanding. 
- Explain (as you have) that Bitcoin is a global paradygm and if Canada is serious about being the next Silicon Valley (see recent internet news articles), and if Bitcoin is the equivalent of the new Internet and you over regulate, then say good bye to our chances of being the next Silicon Valley.
-  Regulate if you must, but be open, knowledgeable and fair about it. Financial institutions (i.e. banks) should not have dictatorial powers to shut out bitcoin entrepreneurs that are abiding by the law.
- Review whether bitcoin should be regulated as a currency or as a commodity or something altogether new. It makes no sense to have different government departments labeling it as different things and imposing legal rules regarding it. I.e. bitcoin is to be regulated under barter rules for tax reasons, but then government may want to impose AML &amp; KYC currency rules upon it, and in the media it is discussed as a commodity not a bartering tool or a currency.
- Be bold with your legislation/regulation and allow existing financial institutions (banks, credit unions etc) to enter into this new space to increase their own bottom lines and be global leaders in this new financial sector. For example: Right now financial institutions are researching and attempting to implement mobile payments for their customers, but bitcoin is already a superior solution to nearly all the technologies they are investigating - all of which are American by the way.
- Offer list of key Canadian entrepreneurs already successful: VOs, CaVirtex, Havelock, The ATM company, Ethereum, etc.
**Spreading the word**:
After we have a rock solid letter that touches on all the critical points then let's blast the message:
- To all bitcoin meetup.com leaders &amp;  attendees across Canadian cities
- Through Tiwtterverse to all Canadian media figures, companies (tv, print, blogs, etc) and politicians
- Facebook sharing by all bitcoin enthusiasts
- Co-orientated events that gather media attention
**5 Minute Canadian-Centric video clip**
-Appeal to the emotional senses: Create a 5 minute video explaining how bitcoin can improve remittance, mobile payments, help charities, online payments, reduce customer transaction fees, improve merchant cashflows due to no charge back or waiting periods from payment processors, and other areas of inovation we can't even imagine yet (1 min). Showcase some of the Bitcoin successes in Canada and abroad with the faces of real people and how Bitcoin has already done amazing things for them. Interview venture capitalists, students excited about new technology area to get future jobs in, startup companies operating, finance experts saying this is a whole new unexplored sector... etc.
-Gather small donations for this effort if required. Find expert voluteers to do this on in parallel, don't try to do it all yourself.
Feel free to add to this list... I am out of time to write more, right now.

COPY/PASTE from Google's WSJ article rip...
"By TAKASHI MOCHIZUKI CONNECT
Updated July 23, 2014 10:32 a.m. ET
TOKYO—An official responsible for the assets of Mt. Gox told creditors he would consider returning the bitcoin that remains with the defunct exchange without converting it into regular currencies, people who attended a closed meeting with creditors said.
Some of those who had deposits with what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange welcomed the possibility of keeping the virtual currency unconverted, avoiding a potential drop in its value. But they also expressed their frustration with a bankruptcy process they say is taking place with little transparency.
Mark Karpelès, the chief executive of the defunct exchange was also present, despite saying he had concerns about his safety.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in February, saying it had lost 850,000 bitcoin, worth half a billion dollars, in hacking attacks. Only about a quarter of the missing electronic currency deposited with the exchange has been recovered.
The bankruptcy highlighted concerns over the regulation and security of bitcoin.
Some of the defunct exchange's 127,000 creditors have been worried that the recovered bitcoin might be converted into dollars, euro or yen before being distributed to creditors at the end of the bankruptcy process. Many creditors would prefer to keep their share of the remaining money in bitcoin, since a large-scale conversion into conventional currencies would deflate its value.
"The court-appointed trustee asked how many of us want to have the bitcoin returned as bitcoin, and about 70% of us raised our hands and gave a round of applause," said Yoshimitsu Homma, a Mt. Gox creditor. "He said the option would be considered, though he added it wouldn't be easy due to legal requirements."
About 100 creditors attended the meeting, gaining their first opportunity to talk with Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee who has remained largely silent while carrying out his duties. Mr. Kobayashi has made announcements via the Mt. Gox website, but his critics say his handling of the case lacks transparency, leaving creditors dissatisfied with his work.
Mr. Kobayashi has repeatedly declined to comment on any aspect of the bankruptcy process.
Mr. Kobayashi used the first 30 minutes of the meeting to explain the bankruptcy process and how he was seeking a sponsor to take over the operation of the business while continuing efforts to find more of the lost bitcoin, the people at the meeting said. The trustee spent the subsequent 90 minutes answering questions, though the people said Mr. Kobayashi didn't provide any new details.
"I wasn't expecting much, but I'm totally disappointed with the meeting," said Kolin Burges, a creditor who staged a sit-down protest outside the Mt. Gox office building for several weeks starting in February.
Creditors had asked the Tokyo bankruptcy court to allow the proceedings to be recorded and posted online, as many creditors aren't based in Japan and can't make it to the series of meetings to be held at the court. But those requests weren't approved.
No photography or recordings are permitted in the court building.
Another focal point during the meeting was the whereabouts of the lost bitcoin and the police investigation into the matter. Mr. Kobayashi declined to comment on that, saying he didn't want to disrupt the investigation.
Mr. Karpelès briefly apologized during the meeting, in response to a request by a creditor, but said nothing else.
"I am really sorry for what happened and will do my best to make the outcome of the bankruptcy as best as possible," Mr. Karpelès told The Wall Street Journal after the meeting. He said he had been worried about attending the meeting because of recent death threats he received. "I really hope everyone recovers what they lost and that the culprit is caught," he said.
The next meeting, including an update on the bankruptcy process, will be held in November.

System will include encrypted communication message system. Mycelium will take a 0.5% cut, possibly lower. Very fast (90 secs+) high confidence trading feature, where Mycelium tracks your transaction propagation through network - better than waiting for multi 10 min block confirmation times. Works on testnet, ETA for launch end of Feb 2014. Android only. Target market: People who want to buy their first bitcoin(s), and active local traders.

I agree. Further, you will have way more influence over a credit union than any of the large banks. There's dozens of credit unions with only a hand full of branches, and whilst they must all follow the same regulatory rules, they will not do douche moves like close your account without any given reason. Chances are the CEO/executives of your local credit union branch work and live in your city.

It's because of this chart that keeps getting posted everywhere:
It makes it look like all 21 million bitcoins will be mined by 2033, when if you look carefully, it's only something like 20.5 million bitcoins mined by 2033. If you extend the chart out another 100+ years, you'd see a nearly flat line showing the remaining 0.5 million bitcoins.
I've seen so many articles that talk about the last bitcoin being mined in 2040, instead of 2140 for this same reason. In fact, I'm surprised more people haven't noticed this constant error in the media. This next chart which is also constantly posted, makes it look even more deceiving that by 2040 all bitcoins will have been mined:

This has been rebuttaled countless times already. The fact is that reality disproves their theories.  
Let's say you invested $10,000 in bitcoin, and a few years later it is worth $10 Million. Will you continue working your 9-5 job, drive your 10 year old honda civic, keep renting that 2 bedroom apartment and bring home made lunch to work every day?
Hell no - You will quit your job, buy a BMW, a new house or three, and go sip margaritas on Bahamas beaches... and still have several million dollars left in the bit bank.
Hoarding only lasts so long. Everyone has their wealth targets at which point they start to spend.
A simpler example is when people get unexpected bonuses at work. Do they just keep them in their savings account? No, they either put the bonuses towards investments, pay down debts or go buy new toys.

Bitcoin wisdom has a lot of Technical Analysis tools that allow you to draw fancy lines to identify probabilities in price movement. They work something like this:  
Some guy with a Phd thinks he's found a pattern that can predict a future trend, whether short term or long term. He tells the world about the pattern, then everyone starts looking for when that pattern is about to take place but hasn't yet and acts to front run it, thus ensuring the pattern occurs.
In other words, whether a TA pattern can really predict a future trend or not is irrelevant, because once one is widely used, the pattern becomes self-fulfilling.
Eventually people try to front run the front runners and ultimately breaks the pattern most of the time. It can still work but only when people are not aware of the new "better" pattern that now some new guy with a Phd come up with. Then as most people start trying to front run the new pattern and not front run the front runners of the previous pattern, the previous hot pattern becomes functional again some of the time as only a few people are trying to use it.
At the end of the day you end up with a hoards of technical analysis patterns, none of which work 100% of the time, all of which are pretty ridiculous (yes I'm talking about you fibonacci), and all of which ignore fundamentals and break when any major news related to the item being traded is announced (i.e. china ban, mtgox, irs tax, etc).
Welcome to day trading, now you know why 90% of the people lose their shirts trying to day trade using TA.

1) Fact: Your US dollar is backed ONLY by the credit (made out of thin air) and faith (quickly waning) of the US Federal Reserve (a private bank playing central planner for the world's reserve currency)
2) A bitcoin is backed by the reality (not faith) of cryptography and its underlying mathematics. 
3) The core rules of how bitcoin functions is not subject to change due to political influence, lobbyists, economic targets (real, altered, or imaginary) or performance.
4) Bitcoin's liquidity has grown exponentially through massive user adoption over the past few years. Unlike fiat currencies, it cannot be imposed on entire populations, as such it needs to grow in user adoption. Growing phases are subject to pains .
5) The limited use in real life is very quickly dropping. The ability to use bitcoin to purchase gift cards accepted by hundreds of thousands of retailers means even if the retailer doesn't have a clue about what a bitcoin is, you can purchase your goods in bitcoins.  Further, some relatively large sites (overstock.com, tigerdirect, and others) selling tens or hundreds of thousands of different products in bitcoin, means its real life usage is actually quite significant.
6) People are tired of banksters, their undeserved bonuses, the associated cronies, and history is all too filled with failed centrally planned fiat currencies. With the 2008 financial crisis as a wake up call, some people (read a few million) are looking for alternative solutions.... Welcome to Bitcoin.

Perhaps not, but the bigger question is, is it moral? And in many cases, yes it is. The laws of men aim to translate abstract and intuitive morality into practical laws; however, often the spirit of the intention is lost in translation or diluted over time both intentionally or unintentionally and we end up with laws that are either nonsensical or unjust, or both - and more importantly: immoral. Consider that once upon a time slavery, apartheid, women's inability to vote, death penalties and genocide (i.e. WW2 nazi's) were legal - but were they moral? The perfect translation of morality into legal terms is ultimately an impossible task requiring an infinite amount words and description of all possible circumstances present and future, yet mankind has been gifted the ability to immediately come up with a Yes or No answer in a mere few seconds for nearly all possible moral quandaries. 
Still, man has not given up attempting to encapsulate morality into what might be considered by comparison, terse translations of a higher concept into our modern but still primitive languages. With the never ending quest to achieve a perfect translation of morality into human language, the outcome is that all laws are constantly being 'improved' and thus merely temporal. Whilst some might argue that our laws today are far more moral than those in past centuries, the reality is that such improvements were not linear. From time to time, and more frequently than some will admit, unjust and immoral laws are put into practice. Thus what is legal today, may be considered illegal tomorrow and this emphasizes the concluding point of this mini-treatise: Go ahead and ask yourself before acting if what you are about to do is legal, but don't forget to contemplate if it is moral... and if there's a conflict always follow morality, for then you will be making the right choice leaving you with a clear conscious that should be prized above a free man imprisoned by a guilty mind.
The failure of man is not that he breaks his society's legal laws, but rather that he fails to inquire within the morality of his actions, and in the event he contemplates both, that he chose the former over the latter.
Imagine if you can: If everyone acted morally, the millions of legal laws men have written to paper since time immemorial would be immediately rendered completely useless and unnecessary!

1. My first fear is that this project becomes too successful too soon. There's a lot of debunking out there saying that BTC is pseudonymous and not anonymous. This helps BTC get accepted by regulatory bodies and by extension mainstream. If you make BTC fully anonymous and word gets out, it will get legally banned and crushed from any mainstream adoption. Whilst they can't shut down Bitcoin, they can pass laws that say if businesses accept it, they are breaking the law.  The ideal situation is that most countries pass laws (as they are) allowing it with some restrictions/taxes etc and eventually you get to mass adoption to the point it becomes ubiquitous. Once the masses love it, THEN you can introduce the anonymization factor with little impact. Regulators/Politicos won't ban it if mainstream uses it and loves it, and there'd be an easy argument that most mainstream uses it without anonymization, thus you can't shut it down/make it illegal because 1% of the population uses the anonymization part to supposedly evade taxes, money laundry or whatever other "negative" possibilities there may be.
2. If all those 3 letter government agencies are on their toes, they are watching this thing with a 10 magnifying glasses! That means, I fully expect anyone who donates to be fully spied upon and investigated to the Nth degree... unless of course, they donate anonymously (irony, I know). So if you want donations from those that don't want to be tracked yet believe this is a good project worth supporting, please provide step by step instructions on how to donate anonymously.
Amir is doing outstanding work under circumstances most of us would never consider enduring - so awesome job there, but please keep him away from cameras of all types. From the mainstream perspective he comes off  as fringe and too radical (and thus scary). This does not only a disservice to Darkwallet, but bitcoin itself - it propagates the mainstream erroneous negative propaganda of bitcoin without much effort on their part. Lastly, I totally agree with the naming problem. "Dark" anything is a horrible idea if you want wide acceptance. It immediately insinuates whomever uses it to be doing something illegal, even if its not the case.
Lastly, have Amir re-read the Art of War. And I quote:
*All warfare is based on deception.  Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. (Thus, work on a "dark" implementation; but advertise it as "light". i.e. DarkMarket vs OpenBazaar)

Your ideas of "customer service" and "support" are over rated. In short you have Western Nation bias on how important these concepts are and how they should be done.

Try to buy something at a store and tell me how happy you are with their customer service skills. They don't give a shit because if you don't want their product, then get out of the way because there's 10's of thousands of people on the street that will pass by the store today and some will want the same product.

TL;DR: 
Ecomonic Law derives its truth from the proof of history. The same types of people always behave the same way under the same circumstances:
With inflationary currencies, economic law tells us that poor people will spend their money to lock in prices of goods before they go up in price, whilst rich people will invest their money to at least retain their buying power and ideally make some money.
Let's start a discussion on what the economic law (not just theory) might  be for a deflationary currency like bitcoin. Will people just hoard?

Read what I said, I didn't suggest the 2MB increase is a final solution, it's something that we can (mostly?) all agree on to buy us time to also then find agreement on a more long term solution.
Also, allow me to rephrase the urgency. I stated the resolution, not the actual urgency. The urgency is that blocks are being filled up and confirmation wait times are too frequently getting beyond ridiculous by bitcoin standards. Saying this isn't a problem, let alone an urgency is ignoring a large part of the user base... you know, the people that actually use bitcoin to make transactions... and that's just a bad idea (understatement). If I couldn't use my phone to make phone calls when I wanted to and the phone vendor or telco kept saying "yeah, well we're debating what the best possible solution is, and we have absolutely no ETA, and we're going to vote to see which option wins out", believe me, I'd be getting rid of my phone and/or phone company and finding a replacement pretty darn quick.  Solutions exist to please the user-base, not the solution makers.

Thanks for taking the time to respond. I wasn't aware that the reference rate would be determined by actual Bitcoin exchanges. Also you make a good point about arb'ing that I hadn't thought of as I don't trade futures.

Can somebody explain to me why a futures contract derivative for Bitcoin should have any impact on the price or volatility of Bitcoin at all?
My understanding is that people will be trading derivatives, and nobody involved actually touches a Bitcoin private key. So how can a fake bitcoin trade (futures derivative / side bet) have any influence on the real Bitcoin price or its volatility?
If most speculators on the CME say a Bitcoin future price is worth X, I don't give a crap, because I'm trading real Bitcoins and even if they are wrong, they can't possibly influence the real Bitcoin market... unless there's a settlement to real Bitcoins at some point... is there?
What am I not understanding? Thanks.

Thanks for taking the time, but to me, at a glance, the entire futures market seems just useful for hedging prices. I really question how frequently (if at all?) people actually stand for delivery for Orange Juice, Pork Bellies, Wheat and soon bitcoin. To claim the exchange actually delivers any real good (other than its cash equivalent), in any significant quantity, seems to me an absurdity bordering on some variance of a fraudulent claim. At any rate, I don't give a crap about futures, other than am concerned they will be used to manipulate Bitcoin in the same way Gold &amp; Silver have been completely rigged.

Practical criteria judged by whom? Sounds to me just like another form of popularity contest, albeit by a much smaller group of individuals running X exchange.
Capitalism says list them all, let the market decide, even if that means a lot of (not so smart) people lose a lot of money. A very hard educational cost of sorts? The other side is that it also allows the higher intellect immoral types to scam the masses and thus become more financially powerful, which could further erode trust in crypto long term if they are not caught or their beliefs/actions publicly dissected (i.e. CSW) for all to see and learn.
I think the big problem, as we're seeing with democracy in general is that social media and its various echo chambers have a huge influence on people's perspectives, especially the ones with less than ideal critical thinking skills.

So umm, at some point Bitfinix runs out of crypto tokens (BTC, ETH, ETC, ZEC, etc) and since they can't get USD out to buy more, it would imply shut down of exchange. So who here can identify their crypto wallets and see how close they are to reaching zero?

Erik, it's not bitcoin that will fail, it's that bitcoin will cause the existing *global* economy to fail.  With bitcoin rising massively every few months, people are more and more tempted to take large chunks of their fiat savings and buy bitcoin, thus perpetuating the massive price rises. Further, people won't need loans since if they just wait 6 months they can magically afford whatever they initially wanted to save for. This of course will eventually reach a critical point where in bank depositors disapear triggering a reverse in fractional reserve lending, and further banks will start to close since their main earnings are generated from loans. 
Now, whilst this might sound like a libertarian's wet dream, it will have real world repercussions none the less. When the banks fail, the economy fails, when the economy fails, governments fail, when governments fail revolutions are nearly guaranteed.
At some point my expectation is that governments will see this coming (they don't yet), and make bitcoin illegal for mainstream use (i.e. retail sector, banking etc.. not unlike what china just did).  When that happens, THEN bitcoin will have failed. If they don't do this, then bitcoin will survive and thrive... however the world will be in chaos.  Perhaps somewhere in the middle there we will find a smooth transition mechanism, but it's much less likely.

After the US dollar eventually loses its reserve currency status; which by the way is a a process, not an event - as this very article is proof of (step by step avoidance of USD for world trade); there will highly likely no longer be any country-specific global reserve currency.  
Everyone has learned of the "Exorbitant Privilege" (Wikipedia that) that the US dollar and USA by extension has gained over the world as a result of this. This was well understood by at least some smart individuals far back as 1965 (French Prime Minister:   Even China itself should be cautious of wanting to have its Yuan become the global reserve currency due to the Triffen's Dillema (wikipedia that) effect which the USA is now stuck in. In short, any single country's currency who also becomes the global reserve currency automatically ends up in a massive trade deficit situation in the mid-long term; one which is, short-of-a-miracle, impossible to get out of.
The IMF and all the Central Banks have been discussing a sort of inter-central-bank *partial* fiat currency (not for use at the grocery store by joe6pak) called "SDR" or Special Drawing Rights, which they have yet to agree on what specifically will back it up (Oil?Gold?Euro/USD/Yuan/GBP/CAD mix?, etc); which China has recently showed support for this solution as a replacement for USD's reserve currency status. The US of course has not fully endorsed it, because hey, "getting into debt for free" is a very nice privilege to have.
In short, even China knows it has no chance of its currency become the global reserve currency, at least not anytime soon (next 10+ years). China's economic data is quite simply not trusted around the world. Further, no sane Western nation would accept China - still partially representing communist and dictatorship-like ruling philosophies - as the controller of the globe's reserve currency.
Herein is a massive opportunity for Bitcoin to shine - A non-government specific international reserve currency that is not subject to bias, corruption, does not provide any special privileges to any one country and cannot be inflated at will. That said, pigs will fly in a frozen hell when Central Bankers accept Bitcoin as the global reserve currency ;-) They will accept (and already do) gold, before bitcoins; except since after WW2, the US and UK store most of the G20's gold in their vaults and don't seem to be too interested in its repatriation (aka. Germany needs to wait 7 years to have only 10% of its gold returned back to Germany &lt;-- google that).
From a Central Bank's perspective my friends, plan "B" is not bitcoin, it is Gold - hence why Central Banks around the world are net *buyers* of gold since 2009; although the IMF would rather see they execute plan "S" first - SDR's.

I find this article pretty biased towards bitcoins. Yes there's countless scam coins coming on market faster than ever now, but let's face it, no major innovation requiring hard forks will come to bitcoin at this point. All major innovations are highly likely to occur in Alt-coins where the cost of failing fast &amp; retrying has very low impact. At some point, somebody with enough money, resources &amp; time will gather all the best bits (no pun intended) of each alt-coin, combine it with the best aspects of bitcoin, and ultimately build a far superior coin. Napster was pretty awesome, but then came Kazaa, and later Bitorrent. Likewise, first there was gopher, then AOL Webcrawler, then AltaVista, then Google. Or first Friendster, then Orkut, then Facebook. The version 1.0 of anything tech very rarely makes it into the long term. Imagining that Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all, is extremely short sighted and highly biased. Nice try, but me thinks the author has way too much invested in bitcoin to see the future clearly.

You have got to be kidding me. ASICminer is the most overpriced Bitcoin share out there, hands down. You'd be buying at an overvalued high and could end up with substantial losses. Yes, they've made a formidable profit from themselves and specuvestors (er.. shareholders)  for many months in a row - but this is nearly guaranteed to crash anytime soon. Why? Because if you understand anything about ASIC technology, their is one of the worst and oldest out there, and they are about to get completely crushed by the likes of Bitfury, KNCminer, and the massive dump of Avalon chip sales in the market.
Further, ASICminer's 31 TH of the network's current 150 TH is about to become completely irrelevant. By most conservative estimates we are looking at a year end hashrate of 500 Terahash, and upwards of 1+ Petahashes.
So ancient ASIC technology + tiny network hashrate + way over priced products that can't break even = imminent share price collapse.
Also, their stock price being so high is mostly an illusion. The vast majority of all public shares are not traded on any stock exchange, they are managed *manually* by one of ASICminer's employees or associates which is mind boggling to say the least. Only a tiny percentage of the shares are traded publicly, which has resulted in a very artificial demand.
To be fair,  ASICminer does have some good things going for them:  they must have massive cash reserves from IPO to do 'something' that can be profitable down the road. They are astute business people (nobody has managed to value their shares at such high numbers), they are active in the community and respond to the public's inquiries, they operate out of China which makes them semi-imune to USA's ridiculous laws, they actually deliver ASIC products - crappy and unprofitable as they may be.
In short, this company is a short. Buyer(s) beware!

Oh but look, by waiting 1 month, you just saved yourself over $130,000 dollars and got a 28nm vs 45nm chip device.

People are still living in mud-huts and burning cow dung for fuel to cook - you can see this in HUNDREDS if not thousands of villages.  Bitcoin in India? Hahahaha  Give it 10 years.

No I haven't had the time, but I do listen to J.Rickards Fed commentaries every other month. The guy seems to know his stuff.
