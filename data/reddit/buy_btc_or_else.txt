You do realize that no else is viewing this post because it's [removed] right?
Completely fabricating stories to discredit my character are pointless here bro
In case you're genuinely misinformed, I heard about Bitcoin through a Youtube user named 'davincij15' in late 2010. I didn't mine Bitcoins, but I did later mine Litecoin and much more recently other altcoins - in the former case with my HD5770, and in the later with my HD7970. I was using these two GPUs for gaming already, so it wasn't an 'investment' or outlay for me. I didn't sell any Bitcoins at $25-$35, because I didn't have any.

You must be pretty gullible then, which is no surprize considering you're a Bitcoiner

I didn't have any to sell bro
If I did buy Bitcoins, I would have lost it in mid 2011 anyway:
I sold my litecoins when they went into the double digits though.

I didn't buy any coins on MtGox because I wasn't comfortable with handing over my sensitive documents for verification - which turned out to be a lucky thing I didn't!
The $25-$35 threads I posted on this subreddit in 2013 during the bubble were satire. The price was far higher than $25-$35 at the time.
