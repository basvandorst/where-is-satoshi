Not breaking, more like 'Confirmed'

It's hard to imagine there's a sitting judge on the planet who knows enough about the overlapping subjects to make an accurate judgement.  This is fascinating to watch.  I'm hopeful this situation will make the whole 'smart-contract' side of things, smarter and more secure.  Fingers-crossed while it's all still playing out.

Ok, yeah.  I sent some bitcoin from one wallet to another a few days ago and it did take a long time to confirm.  Nice to know it's attempts didn't do much but inconvenience the network.

I'm just an observer who has no real dog in the fight and it looks like what this guy did was not a hack or theft.  He wrote one of these 'DAO contracts' that took advantage of a programming flaw, in the way they interacted with Etheruem?  That's what it looks like to me, but idk, someone correct me.

Deutsche Bank hasn't collapsed yet.  Just because UK left the EU doesn't mean everyone's going to unload a lot of their assets into a crypto currency they barely understand.  I think what's important is that you seeing these 'wealth managers' talk about moving assets into Bitcoin.  It's going to take awhile before we see the real effects of Brexit.  I think in the short term, the halvening will have a bigger effect on the price.  While in the long term, the Brexit will have some lasting effects.

I'm a novice in all this and was looking around at other coins and noticed they all had this same problem with the mempool during the same dates.  Do all the coins share one mempool or does each coin have it's own?

I bought a Trezor about a week ago and couldn't be happier with it.  Hardware wallets are the way to go if you're worried about your system being compromised.

What all goes into being a 'full node?'  I'm looking for a new computer and would also like to do this, but am not entirely sure what kind of setup I should be looking for?

He should've gotten a mistrial from the DEA agents who were proven crooks/liars &amp; the judge who barely understood how to send an email. It's tragic, but the only system of justice in the US is injustice.

1) the blockchain app is called a hot wallet and those bitcoins are still not in your custody
2)    &lt;-these are hardware wallets to securely custody your bitcoin

it's coming soon, from the street view ;)

Thanks guys :)
[Here]( is the full slide show for the intro.  Really appreciate all the great feedback!

its just a beautiful local ;)

It was more just an acknowledgement of our intentions for the viewers so they didn't feel like we just disappeared. Thirty episodes built a small following we didn't want to offend.  Sorry the thread was still up, meant to delete it soon after the show aired.

Thanks! I agree the audio has been an issue, we're going to try and improve upon that for Season two along with a couple other things.  Stay tuned for more and be sure to drop by the mumble ;]

thanks for the help

I don't know. Searched google and saw a pokemon :/

I don't understand why militias think they can overtake or outlast the possible institution of military order.  They have so much more shit to achieve progress in war, through month long attacks and/or sieges. The infantry, air-force, marines, and all the others institute military order, GL.

This is our best hope.  I refused an order to 'shoot first, ask questions later' in New Orleans after Katrina.  Got discharged less than a year later.

I have a Trezor and haven't gotten an update since their tweet about the firmware update about 3-4 weeks ago.
Edit: I would contact Trezor on twitter and see what they say.

No, sounds more like a principle quit
@_date: 2016-07-29 06:15:52
will this cut any kyc connection to your coins, like if you got them through coinbase?
@_date: 2016-07-29 11:02:19
An audit of coinbase's ETC has already been done and their insolvent. They better start buying up the market to reimburse.
