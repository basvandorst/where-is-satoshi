I love the growth and innovation in this space. I'm a big fan of Breadwallet on iOS but I find myself trying out a lot of different wallets on Android.
I noticed Airbitz is on both platforms. You might've answered this in another thread, but... are you using Ionic or something else to create a hybrid app?
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:55:53
I'm hoping the price dips into the $300s (or $200s). I want to pick up a few more coins before Augur, OpenBazaar, the halving, and all the other great stuff coming in 2016 pushes the price up.
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:33:11
I grabbed it—thanks! I've never used Airbitz before. I like that the app defaults to using bits.

I've been using Gemini and have been happy with the exchange's functionality and the excellent UX/UI.
Their fees are low but they don't make it easy to find before signing up (maybe they've addressed this in the past couple months).

I'd recommend [dollar cost averaging]( You'll save yourself from worrying about day-to-day price changes and the irrational, emotional decisions that come with it.
If you see Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or as an investment, then there's no need to stress yourself attempting to save a few bucks per coin. There will always be events (both good and bad) that nobody saw coming that'll push the price around. However, if you budget to make a daily, weekly, or monthly automatic purchase then you won't fret that you're missing out or getting screwed since it'll get averaged out in the long run.
Nowadays, the price of Bitcoin is only of minor interest to me. Rather than studying the price I study the technology and how the technology is being used, accepted, and regulated. Every week I get a notification that my automatic purchase of Bitcoin in a set dollar amount was made, no fuss involved.

I've been thoroughly impressed with Breadwallet. I'm waiting for an Android version so I can switch to it completely for on-the-go spending.
For my savings, though, Trezor has been solid.

lol, I like your style!

Glad to see this posted on I've been DCAing for the past year with little to no stress over the ups and downs. :-) Every week an automatic purchase is made. If bitcoin is on sale, such as this past week, I'll pick some more up whenever I feel like it as long as the fundamentals are still sound. Investing in bitcoin doesn't have to be as big of a deal as many make it out to be.
For those new to investing: when buying, don't get attached to prices. For example, $189, $207, $213 were all great prices to buy bitcoin on Wednesday. Don't beat up yourself or others for not purchasing at the lowest price on a given day or week—no one knows what future prices will be, and in the end it just doesn't matter. Rather, just enjoy being a part of this amazing time that we live in.

I'm going to reach out to the [KC STEM Alliance]( to see about accepting Bitcoin donations.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:13:25
Thanks for the link! It's great they're paving the way with making Bitcoin accessible in IRAs and 401ks, but the 2.0% fee is way too high. I look forward to other options with fees around what Vanguard charges for their various index funds.

This is such a great community! I'll have to submit a charity next Tuesday.

There was a time when you'd ask a business if they had a web site. They'd either tell you the site address or tell you to just call them (for info on their product, service, hours, etc).
I'm sure there was also a time when people would ask a business if they had a phone number.
About ten years ago a surprisingly large number of fast food restaurants (like Taco Bell) wouldn't take debt or credit cards due to the fees, but pushback from customers showed there was a demand for the change.
Point is, history has a way of forgetting the countless small, boring interactions that led to big changes. It costs a business time and effort to get a phone number, to get a web site, to accept debt/credit, etc. Most businesses will wait until there's demand at their front door.

Happy cake day! I’m getting ready to leave Kansas City, MO and head to Phoenix, AZ for a vacation, but I wanted to do my small part to provide some feedback.


In the past I’ve been purchasing bitcoin via ACH through Coinbase. So far I’ve been happy with their service but I’m a bit paranoid from the stories of them tracking personal BTC use. I don’t lead a terribly exciting, crazy life of cocaine and hookers, but I like to occasionally participate in crowd funding of awesome new projects like Augur and would rather not worry that my Coinbase account be closed as a result of me trying to help others advance fascinating technology and services.


Pretty important.


Yes and no. I fairly confident I’ve come across the name before but haven’t really checked out your service. Having visited your website I’m now rather intrigued.


What tracking do you do of a customer’s BTC usage after a purchase has been made? You might’ve answered a similar question already… I’m still reading through all the comments.


Honestly, I’m not sure. I’m impressed with your website, though. Clean and relevant UI/UX for the Buy and Sell options. Plus, Proof of Reserves! Right on!

Are you an economic professor or computer science professor?
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:55:26
Mine has. A few years ago I had around 5 Mps and today I have 1000 Mps (for $70/mo in Kansas City, MO).
I agree that bandwidth hasn't kept up, but it's due to a lack of competition rather than a lack of tech. Thankfully, companies like Google are getting fed up and pushing the tech where it should be.

Let's upvote into oblivion!
Here's an upvote for both of you.

Huh? Even though someone disagrees with BIP xxx, it doesn't imply they disagree with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-30 01:18:21
I'm glad there's variety in wallets, and Mycelium is certainly an asset to the Bitcoin community. However, their UI/UX is lacking, especially to newcomers. It's been a couple months since I've tried their wallet, so hopefully things have changed and I'm wrong.
I've tried almost every wallet on iOS and Android, and Breadwallet is by far my favorite. I look forward to the day when releases and Android version, though I've read his posts and understand why one doesn't exist at the moment.
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:57:01
The education and experience that's gained from spending $300 on Bitcoin is worth far more than the cash.

Exaggerated headline.
Is Bitcoin gathering support from investors in India? Yes. *Massive* Support? No, not yet.
As a community, lets be more honest and less sensational.

There needs to be a longer pause between the two images.

This is a stretch, but... some people have floated the idea of redefining the word bitcoin to equal one bit. If that came to pass in the Marvel universe, then those "50 million bitcoins" would be 50 BTC in our present reality.

It's worth pointing out  At least as a temporary solution until you get approved for the mortgage. However, I understand your reservations and agree that this is a scenario that could use a better solution.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:30:23
Thanks! :-) I began the process of setting up a full node last night, but the "Importing blocks from disk..." is taking forever.
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:19:28
You weren't kidding on it "taking some time". Hah! However, the import completed overnight and now another full node is running on the network! Feels good. :-)

This. Last year I was very interested in the Bitcoin Investment Trust , but soon as I saw their high management fee I walked away. If Winklevoss ETF has low fees, a lot of people will be picking it up.

As excited as I am about the ability to hold Bitcoin in my Roth IRA, [their web site says this](
Annual Administrative and Safekeeping Fee: 2.0%
Unless they've changed their fee, that's just way too high. Always check the fees of your investments and stay away from anything that's over 1%.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:02:48
Another vote for Breadwallet on iOS. The author is obsessed with both security *and* elegant design. I hope an Android version comes out in the future, since I use both platforms.
Here's some helpful info in your search for a Bitcoin wallet:

It can be confusing. One of the technical papers from IBM on using bitcoin and the blockchain for the Internet of Things bounces between "Bitcoin", "BitCoin", "bit coin", etc throughout the paper. The guy who wrote it is a genius, but bitcoin is still new enough that these things happen.
It should just be "Bitcoin" or "bitcoin".
And what a fascinating topic for your Bachelor's Thesis. 100 bits @_date: 2015-03-03 21:19:41

Agreed, especially if Bitcoin is denominated in bits. "0.000001 btc" vs "0.00001 btc" vs "0.0001 btc" is not user friendly.

From [their website]( 
Annual Administrative and Safekeeping Fee: 2.0%
NOPE. That fee is robbery. The Bitcoin Investment Trust isn't getting within throwing distance of my Roth IRA, 401k, etc. If they lower their fees to less than 1% I'll reconsider.

Such a great list of charities. Thanks for doing this!

As said, [Coinbase]( and [Circle]( are easy, secure, and well-funded. Both of them are ideal for 99.9% of Bitcoin users that have access to those services.
I use "paper" wallets as well as Coinbase and Circle. Paper wallets are a pain in the ass at first (how to do it the "right" way is a debatable subject with many considerations), but for a geek it can be a fun, interesting use of time that provides additional knowledge and security.
Some Bitcoin enthusiasts are quick to dismiss anything other than paper wallets, but a similar line of thinking goes with some car enthusiasts, carpenters, painters, accountants, DIYers, etc. In a perfect world, we'd all have the time and expertise to do everything ourselves, but until then we rely on professionals in their respective fields so that we can focus on our own areas of expertise.
