The Euro is goig to fail in the coming years due to the ingenius policies by the EZB. This will probably strengthen the USD for a brief timeframe. 
But with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the fiat system will have to evolve nonetheless. There is no way it can stay the way it was constituted in 20th century.

Chillex,  brother. I am not willfully ignorant. I am just saying that the theory is not as bad as its real world application.
Just by coincidence I am familiar with Ammous' approach. Basically it's a translation of the old gold standard with bitcoin as the ground layer and means of final settlement. I really like that idea and already enjoyed myself many times listening to different talks of Mr. A.
But why bitcoin and not bitcoin cash, I ask you? Atm the tendency is there, but it is not yet clear that bitcoin will live up to that vision. We will see what happens.

How does it work then? And more important, if you have that god given knowledge, how do we fix it?
I would like to state that in theory the Keynesian approach does work. You got cheap inflationary money, you got credit, people spend more, the economy is happy and the debt cycle begins. And printing money to ease a debt cycle induced recession, again makes sense. But you have to put your emphasis on “ease“. Easing the pain is possible, easing not stopping it.
Now, in reality this beautiful theory doesn't work due to the human factor. At first (the first few debt cycles) it begins as everyone expects it to be. Economy goes up, economy goes down. But you have an overall gradually ascension. Then, someone says “Damn boy, I don't want no decline, I wanna have unlimited power. Capitalism f*ck yeah.“
Greed kicks in. The credit machine never slows down, even in recession times, but not to ease the pain, to help the economy. Nope. Mostly to make yourself (insert the institution of banks) filthy rich. Debt cycles goes out of control. Debt goes out of control. Now someone should pay the bill. Bad companies and bad banks should go bankrupt to cleanse the system. Capitalism, you remember how that works right? 
But hell no. The little human got used to his lifestyle and doesn't want to be poor again. Lets try to stop the pain by printing more money and inflate it even more, because the little human can't accept the fact that some pain has be be endured. What to do? Maybe print money and give some more credit. Gotta keep the game rollin'. And at some point we reach a level of no return. Although a superlittle minority profits and is the winner of that derby, the famous 99.8% of us are on the loser team.
To sum it up, the Keynesian theory can't live up to the real world stupidity of the little human, who has to have unlimited growth and hates to feel any pain.

I have a literature degree (fyi. Lolz). In my humble opinion the Keynesian view isn't that bad since it seems to make perfect sense, if you consider our debt based economy. 
But the overall architecture is flawed, providing wrong  incentives with disastrous results, because humans are irrational and greedy beings. 
We have to set up better guidelines in order to save humankind from its own psychological shortcomings. 
Todays monetary policies are f*cked beyond repair. A grand reboot would be nice.

With adoption comes price stability. 
One fancy billionaire could push the price up a couple thousand $, if he wanted to atm.
So it doesn't make sense to argue about the volatility. If you accept bitcoin, you are a gambler. Hopefully with a strong hand, but it's still a game.

You sound kinda dumb. 
Who would want to use an airplane? Everybody knows the Wright Brothers crashed so many times. You gotta be a braindead to enter such a machine. 
Who would want to use a personal computer. 
Four to eight big industrial machines should be enough for the whole world.
Who would want to play videogames? Thats only for nerds with no friends.
A mobilephone? I got my landline. 
Don't be so ignorant. DLTs are the future. The whole cryptosphere is still evolving. Someday it'll be ready for the world and normies like you.

But please consider the possible value of the bitcoin network.
And, yes, I understand that Mr. Schiff is not a fan of cryptocurrency, but his explanation of the current faulty currencies is pretty good imo.

Ok. F.e. my main problem is that I can't save money. I am not even talking about increasing my capital via interest. But I am losing money, if I put my money in a bank account. 
That can't be a healthy system. In every other system up until the 20th century you had commodity money. Now you have some sort of a bad joke, quick sand money that you need to invest in order to just keep the former value.

Well a steady inflation at 2% is the opposite of stable, but nvm.
And we don't have capitalism. Cut all the money pumping and company savings and we can start to talk about capitalism. Bad things die in a good economy, but all that cheap money and credits distort everything.
