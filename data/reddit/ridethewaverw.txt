No guesswork, again...technical analysis. I posted when BTC was above 14K, now its selling off below 13500 continuing the H&amp;S formation.  It will probably go back up and hit 20K next year, who knows, but don't be surprised at all if it goes to 9K first. Done arguing with an emotional kiddo, best of luck to you with your trading/hodling &amp; sorry if I upset you.

Because I don't trust throwing a good chunk of my wealth into this stuff, I'll grow what I put in and be happy with that.  Don't invest what you can't afford to 100% lose.  This is gambling, there are no dividends being paid meaning you are not investing in anything but top heavy mania.  I also bought in very late, here to scrape some trades for fun and a few bucks, not going to be a supportive bag holder when this thing pops.

I'm in LTC, out for now, will buy the next panic dip, rinse and repeat.  Just use BTC's chart to trade LTC because it's attached at the hip and overreacts to BTC's movements.  So easy to scrape coin out of the dumb "traders" who are getting fooled by the whales.  Weak hands as far as the eye can see.

Where did I say I was wicked rich?  Did I strike a nerve in you? I'm only playing with lunch money because this is all a bunch of speculated nonsense.  Turned $500 into $1800 trading in 2 weeks. Easier than the stock market, charts are more predictable.

Lol..yeah enjoy your Bull trap.  Chart is very easy to read. Better pray this is just tax loss harvesting and doesn't continue into the new year.  11Kish double bottom coming soon, and much much lower if it doesn't bounce.

Thank you, someone with common sense who can take emotions out of the equation and view the reality of how this is currently trading.  The blind optimism and naivety on reddit is sad.
