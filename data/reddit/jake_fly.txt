WOOOHOO WHO THE FUCK ELSE IS READY TO GO TO THE MOON??? UPVOTE MONEY PARTY, FIAT CURRENCY NOT INVITED!!!

Not our fault the Europeans like holding devaluing currency.

Yeah g-20 has jack shit to do with current gains
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:11:04
This is literally foreign banks liquidating their USD fiat money, how the fuck is that not an example of a fiat currency being abandoned?
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:08:04
This is why even the most authoritarian regimes can't stop BTC and how the blockchain is a tool to usurp any tyranny.

Sad state of affairs when the US dollar is a reasonable store of value.
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:21:56
Today an item that would cost 100 dollars cost 4.50 in 1916. 95% loss of value in 100 years does not a good store of value make.
@_date: 2016-10-21 13:19:53
Fiat being abandoned and fiat's obvious disadvantages are a huge focus of the sub since it's all about crypto.
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:12:19
I'm aware, but when the USD, the reserve currency of the world, is being relinquished for other store of value, be they fiat, commodity, whatever, it is bad for the fiat system in general.

So like 10x what's going into customer support now?
@_date: 2016-07-29 04:57:05
Nope. I think a world in which fiat sees its demise and crypto is king, government will probably become non-extant

My philosophy as a BTC hodler: Etherium is fucked and we aren't, let's celebrate.

Me? No fucking clue man, hence the "they're fucked". They could erase a portion of their non-obscured block chain but that's probably impossible.

Noob question: As a small time miner, are you getting a full 12.5 coin reward or do you share it with other miners?
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:28:33
Voluntaryism is freedom. Voluntaryism is complete freedom from aggression as long as you don't commit any aggression. This means while in a voluntary society one could form a communal economic system if everyone thy tried to involve agreed, the fact that two parties will often commit voluntary exchange means capitalism will prevail and be the economic system of freedom.

What a pussy, I sold my family into slavery for that sweet, sweet BTC  after we hit $500 this time.

Months-huge volatility for a variety of factors, including the situation with growing international markets but also a bit(lol) too much concentration of BTC in China, made worse by the amount of Chinese on the DNMs and the mining firms there, and also by the halvening. Overall I expect by October BTC will have highs in the 4 figure range.
Years-lets say within 5 years from now, we wills either see a competing currency emerge, bringing price stability and perhaps lesser value to BTC,  or we will see that BTC is here to stay and we are all going to be very rich and Bitcoin will be accepted like fiat. If that happens I think we will see BTC in the 5-6 figure range, and we won't need to convert our BTC to cash ever again.
Decades-like my years prediction, either BTC will be the cypto of the masses and we will all be the equivalent of millionaires if we just hodl, or another cryptocurrency/currencies will take over. I also think either way that fiat will collapse and crypto or another form of currency will be most common, probably crypto.

@_date: 2016-07-30 19:39:34
Lol civilians with vastly more effectiveness than the formal military they worked with.
Oh god their radical cause takes away from the point. Oh wait no it doesn't because you can't deny the effectiveness of civilian defense in post world war 2 warfare. Dumb fuck.
The Zapistas, as with the Rojovians, are a leftist collective of peasants and working class people. AND AGAIN EFFECTIVE AS FUCK, BUT YOU KNOW THAT SO YOU ARGUE MOTIVE YOU FUCK.
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:44:18
Don't worry my palsy ridden friend, there certainly aren't examples of voluntary guerrilla warfare, like the Vietcong, the mujahideen, the Zapistas, ect. Fuckin statesuckers always sucking state.

@_date: 2016-07-30 16:11:37
Lol and the he went full retard
There's a big difference between voluntary defense and rule makers. Your conjecture about "what if they go mad with power" is a lot less applicable in a society in which the group doesn't hold some kind of authority over an area.
