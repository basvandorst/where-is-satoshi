Independent accounting audits by a trusted outside firm are really the only way to assure an exchange is behaving as it should with your money.

Nope, the protocol doesn't scale to that kind of capacity. It was intended to create a small underground economy.

I love to post funny shit and highly doubt it will budge the price 1% one way or the other, no matter how hard I troll. I don't do it to hurt people, I do it to make people with a sense of humor laugh and maybe they'll make me laugh in return. Its the internet, there is no reason to be serious, thats what real life is for. IMO...

The only discussion allowed here are subjects which bring "new money" into the scheme. Your post will have the opposite effect and therefore has been downvoted by the angry bitcoiner nerd mafia. But I enjoyed it, Thank you.

They've done that before. They did it in Nov/Dec and people freaked out. Some ended up happy, some were sad. Its a crap shoot lottery.

I've always wondered if they had his passwords already too. They had been watching him use that library for awhile. It wouldn't have been too difficult to put some cameras in a drop ceiling looking down on him or something similar to capture screens and password entries.

Neo Bee should also allow a transparent independent financial audit. The investors deserve that much.

I think you've got that backwards, have a look at the front page next time the price climbs. When the price climbs and PR firms use their bots to vote their posts up to the front page, the trolls are the ones screaming stop buying you fools. We have one this morning, here it is:

Did you happen to notice what the price was when buys were first reenabled?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:05:35
Neo Bee should allow the investors to have an independent audit firm investigate how their investment funds are being spent by the principals. Are they using funds for personal purchases? How do we know without an audit, that is the point. There is more to running a business than making sure you have enough bitcoins.

The agent yelled she was sick of him and seized his laptop while it was on, open and unprotected. He should have had a kill switch like a snowmobile or atv uses if you fall off it. He used public places to logon from and had no plan in place for someone waiting for him to enter his password and simply yanking the laptop out of his hands.
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:37:28
That is how it works in the US. If you mined coins or bought coins, you are taxed on the profit or gains when you sell the coins. So unless you've sold coins, you probably don't need to worry but check with a professional, not some guy with a name full of random unix commands :)

If someone spends $1200 on a bitcoin and it drops to $550, they will not see the value you see. They will likely feel they lost &gt; 50% of their purchasing power by using this payments system.

Norton Ghost is also a possibility. It can clone the disk and skip bad sectors. If his wallet wasn't sitting on a bad sector and the original drive is somewhat readable, he might recover his majik money.

In my opinion, you're living in an echo chamber and potentially out of touch with reality. You had a brief glimpse of reality but someone has helpfully provided a graph which comforts you and reaffirms your beliefs. 
If I were you, I would continue reading alternative opinions and asking questions.

Audits eventually revealed their financial condition had been manipulated to appear stronger than it actually was. People went running for the exits, selling as fast as they could, driving the price down to nothing. What was I talking about again? I forgot.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:01:21
Given the sins of past exchanges, Neo Bee should be submitting to transparent independent financial audits to assure the investors money is being spent as intended. The audit firm should be picked at random and rotated on an annual basis to prevent any collusion.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:25:38
Yes but it would tear the community apart and likely cause a fork. This came up awhile back, here are a couple threads:

If it wasn't realistic, the Nazis might have won WWII because Enigma wouldn't have been cracked. I didn't say "the protocol", I said the encryption. Thats the part where a correct hash must be generated based on the transactions in the block. Are you familiar with hash values and how they are generated? How about if in 2009, I told you about ASICs, would you have told me that isn't possible too? The history of cryptography teaches us that all designs contain flaws, intentionally or unintentionally. Here is a reddit thread where more details are available for you:

“The bail-in has limited the pain to a small group of people holding just 4pc of deposit accounts. Two- thirds were foreign, and half of those were Russian. It was really the Russians who took the hit,”

Such anger. Why?
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:37:57
Cost would not be a factor, it would be an issue of available man hours and how quickly it needed to be accomplished. A government intelligence agency would attack the problem from an encryption standpoint and either look for existing flaws or try to introduce new flaws that allow them to generate the correct hash for a block very quickly. They would then develop hardware to take advantage of those flaws and dominate block generation on the network. It would be obvious if someone achieves and abuses that though.

If bmr was prone to the bug, it gave the attacker funds at bmr to use to abuse the bug. BMR stated they had withdrawal issues right before the shutdown. They said they had been hacked but didn't know how yet. They halted withdrawals and approved each manually. Maybe coincidence maybe related.
