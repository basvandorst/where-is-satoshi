Fair enough. Well, it's a very interesting product, looking forward to using it.

Let's give it a few days. I do realize I fucked something up so there's actually a higher probability than I wanted it'll go through, but still pretty low, oh well.
EDIT:- P.S. Sorry for the large delay (~ an hour) of actually sending this transaction after you posted the address, I was busy setting something up and didn't have the five minutes to spare.
@_date: 2014-08-21 11:01:57
Yup, and I understand why they want the ID, I just don't want to give them my ID, so, I won't use them. I'm not blaming them for requiring an ID, it's just something I refuse to provide.

I'm confused, what is this exactly? It looks like they're charging you $20-100 to allocate you ~25GB worth of HDD space plus the CPU power to verify one block every ten minutes (Which is nothing), plus maybe half a gig to a gig worth of RAM.
They also (From what I can see), don't explain the difference between paying $20 and $100. Following that, they claim 'our servers are backed by redundant databases and designed/tested for high API load.  We provide money back guarantee on our server uptimes.' and yet apparently can't afford their own domain or hosting space, despite, apparently, being able to host 'redundant databases'? Not only that, but, what does the database even hold? I assume just the blockchain? What we want is redundant servers, load balancing, something that actually matters. Not "Oh well, if our server goes down, least we have a backup **of the already public blockchain**"
They may be doing something amazing, but, their marketing team is just non-existent. It'd take a single run through quality assurance to be told that this isn't going to interest anyone.
For anyone looking for a setup like this, I'd like to recommend (No referral links here, because I'm nice, despite both companies offering them and paying a decent amount):-
[DigitalOcean]( - Very nice host that allows automatic horizontal and vertical expansions of your services when you need it. It's pay per hour, so, you only pay for the server when you need it, and is relatively cheap. It's $5/month ($0.007/hour) for a 512MB/1TB bandwidth/20GB disk server, or $10/month ($0.015/hour) for a 1GB/2TB transfer/30GB disk server. They support locations in New York (3 datacenters), Amsterdam (2 datacenters), San Francisco (1 Datacenter) and London (1 Datacenter), price is identical for all locations. They don't guarantee uptimes, but I've never, ever, seen two of their datacenters drop at the same time, and even when they do drop, they offer refunds (for the time it was down) to everyone involved. I believe they also have a $10 coupon for new users floating around the web, that's two whole months of the 512MB server, or one whole month of the 1GB server *for free*, see [Google](
[Kimsufi]( - This is another great host (Price wise), although seemingly always sold out. Their support, unlike DigitalOcean, however, is shit. This is completely unmanaged and I wouldn't reply on them for any critical application.
[SoYouStart]( - Same company as Kimsufi (OVH), so, same shit support, but, with this they do guarantee uptime. Kimsufi (Like DigitalOcean) is not *really* for production servers, this is their production range.
Note:- OVH (Kimsufi, SoYouStart &amp; OVH) all charge setup fees, DigitalOcean does not. OVH also is pay per month, unlike DigitalOcean's pay per hour model.
Note2:- I've used Bitcoind on all these servers extensively (I.E. at-least a month 24/7 on each), never had any issues with them.
Note3:- All hosts are unmanaged, I.E. don't provide support on setting the VPS/dedi up once you have it. They only provide support if it simply doesn't work, and even then, OVH probably won't provide support. Take this rough model:-
1. Will provide support if the hardware has failed
2. Will provide support if one of their services are down (Like repo mirrors, etc...)
3. Won't touch it otherwise
Digital Ocean:-
1. Will provide support if the hardware has failed
2. Will provide support if one of their services are down (Like repo mirrors, DNS, etc...)
3. May provide support it it won't boot
4. May provide support if there's a genuine visualization issue
5. Won't touch it otherwise

Where do you get these values? I've run a full bitcoind setup on a 512MB VPS. During the first launch it did die a lot (Linux kernel killing it for RAM), but, once it was fully up-to-date, it worked fine.
P.S. This was with zero swap.
P.P.S. `while [ true ]; bitcoind; sleep 1m; done` helps a lot during the initial blockchain sync.
P.P.P.S. This is in no way recommended, and, you'll probably hurt the network more than you help it, but, it certainly can be done.

For reference, the transaction is no longer on the network and has already been overruled by a much easier transaction chain (Although, I told you I fucked something up, right? That was me forgetting to send enough money to include a fee, otherwise, it'd have been "a much easier transaction chain with a monetary incentive"). Money is back in my hand, never accept 0 confirmation transactions.
Proof? Original chain:-

But then you have to have the file, that isn't dedicated storage, that's just a backup.
What if I want to keep a file on the network without having it myself? How will I be able to generate a random hash offset and calculate the correct answer without the file? Also what if I want to go offline for awhile (Like a month or two), who's going to check the files are legitimate while I'm offline?

Double attacks are super easy (against the majority of setups, probably not Bitpay because they're not stupid (They'll check the fees are correct, it's been seen by multiple peers, they'll keep broadcasting it, etc...), but, custom-coded setups? Easy peasy), I've done it against loads of different sites (And told them about it).
It's literally a five minute job:-
1. Create bitcoin transaction with zero fee, using brand new coins (Preferably also from a zero-fee transaction, increasing delay even more)
2. Send coins
3. Coins never confirm due to no fee
4. Upon confirmation from site, start a simple bash script on a few servers located world-wide (I already had) `while [ true ]; bitcoind sendrawtransaction $transaction; sleep 10m; done`
5. Wait a few days
6. ????
7. Profit, both money and product.

Wouldn't it be smarter to just throw away 0.00000563 (Or whatever the smallest amount is) then have a huge fee? So that the miners get it back? And the PoB would be the miner fee?
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:19:35
It means against the majority of 'home-grown' automated payment systems double spend attacks on zero confirmations are super easy and can be done in a few minutes worth of work. This is why I recommend at-least 1 confirmation, always, as it makes the amount of work you're doing worth at-least 25BTC (So, unless the value is &lt;=25BTC, it's probably not occuring. It may still occur with orphaned blocks, but, it's highly unlikely that someone is trying to commit a double spend attack &amp; the correct block is orphaned, but, can still occur)

The easy part is verifying they have the data if you also have it, it's a lot harder to verify that if you don't have a copy yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-16 08:11:19
But the point with this is, everyone is going to go running to places like OVH which have some of the best deals on easily rentable hardware with lots of HDD space. It's around 0.01EUR/GB/month on the cheap models and 0.004GBP per GB per month on their more expensive models.
This means that, assuming the price per GB is more than that per month\*, *nearly all the data will be hosted in a very small distributed location*. That's terrible.
Hell, even if I wanted to buy HDD space myself, let's assume I only was buying the worst HDD space on the market and had all the PC/electricity/etc paid for, I'd still be dropping about $0.03/GB at-least, that's excluding bandwidth, time, power, hardware, etc...
Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea, but, all I can see personally is about 90% of the data being stored over a few data centers owned by the largest companies to offer these kinds of spaces (Leaseweb, online.net, ovh, etc...) to the general public. I'm not saying 90% of nodes will be in data centers, I'm sure there'll probably be more home nodes than actual datacenter nodes, but, the datacenter nodes will offer more space, more bandwidth, more everything, so, people will flock to them.
\*It won't be due to free markets 'n all that stuff, but, that means that legitimate home users who *are* distributing the data and creating more redundancy to natural disasters/etc, will get paid even less and lower the likely hood on them doing it.
@_date: 2014-08-16 08:17:28
And how would the blockchain 'come in'?
EDIT:- Assuming you *also* had access to the data (Which I think makes this project redundant, so, this is useless) you could rquest variations mutations to be done on the data and sent back to you. Sort of like hashes, but, a hash where you can specify and offset to change it randomly.

But then how large at the blocksizes? Let's assume that the blocksize is 256KB, a relatively standard blocksize for the BitTorrent protocol, and each hash is 256b, a relatively standard hash size now-er-days (Although, 512b is coming on) and you want to store 1,000 checks, doing three checks a day (Let's just say "Enough checks for a year").
`256KB / 256b = 8,000`
`8,000 / 1,000 = 8`
You'll have to store 1/8th of the file, even when you're not storing the file, for it to last a year without you. That's a decent amount, if you're storing a TB worth of videos or something, that's at-least a hundred gig for you to hold worth of hashes, that's not including the yearly cost (bandwidth, temporary HDD space and CPU power) of downing all your files, rehashing them, and uploading them again.
Of course, you could check less often but checking less often results in a higher chance that more nodes will drop offline during that period, using a smaller digest may be possible now, but for how long?

It's more than checking for a fee, it's also checking that other peers haven't been informed of another, conflicting, transaction before (But not you). It's also checking that the parent TXIDs are valid (And confirmed), that the transaction doesn't have any weird scripts or timelocks (Although currently timelocks aren't supported on the main network, they may be one day, and, it's something you have to consider).
It's complicated. It can be done and I'm sure any company worth a damn (Coinbase, Blockchain, etc...) have all done it but even then there's ways to break it (Selfish miners who don't broadcast transactions, etc...), over all, waiting for one confirmation (or two, to prevent orphaning) is a lot easier (And safer) than attempting to predict a game of numbers.
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:29:28
Unless, you know, you're attempting to scam someone who follows the 'most idiotic' approach of saying you don't need confirmations. The 100 bit was purely because if I fucked up I didn't want to lose any large amount of value, and, same with the four transactions (Boosting the chance of it working), it'd still work perfectly fine over just one transaction.

How is it customs fraud? One is a product being shipped over the customs (I.E.

No company (Such as Asus, Amazon, Newegg, etc...) would declare a warranty going over customs because it's not a physical product.
Note:- The above is only valid if you can buy the product (I.E. Trezor white) without the 'data security services', if you can't, then yes, it's customs fraud. I've never looked into Trezor, so, depends.

For instance, I have a bunch of encrypted HDDs. I don't have time to type out ten passwords on every boot, so, I have a flash drive that contains ten key files used to decrypt them, but, what if that drive fails? I've made backups all over the world (With friends and family, to servers I have access to for a variant of reasons). All the data that's not on the flash drive is encrypted with a password I know, so, if the flash drive fails, I just have to acquire the data from any one of the tens of sources I have, decrypt it (locally) with the password only I know, then use it to decrypt the drive. Problem solved\*.
This is basically that (Distributed encrypted data all over the world), but, automated.

Basically, cryptography works by having a really big number (Literally a number, but, super super big) used to run some complex math. Bitcoin uses loads of big numbers and loads of curves and points on that curve to prove you own an address without actually allowing other's to prove the same thing.
A paper wallet is basically just printing that number out.

`while [ 0 -eq 0 ]; do`
I recommend you use either `[ true ]` or `[ 1 ]` for static true variables, makes it easy reading. Also, `if [ $i = 10 ]; then i=0;`, you might as well do something like this (at the end of the loop, of course), for readability's sake (You don't have to notice some odd statement in the middle of the code, anything that effects the loop is at the end of the loop:-
`$ for i in {0..19}; do j=$((i%10)); echo $j; done`
Last, but not least (Seriously, the one above is probably the least), [here]( it'd probably be better to check for incoming connections rather than &gt;8 connections, I do realize Bitcoind auto-connects to 8 (and 9+ would be incoming connections), but, that could easily result in false positives. Checking for the `incoming` flag would be a lot better.
Either way, nice script I guess.

We're talking about the actual services hosted behind the domain, not some obscure offshoot of one of their side projects.

I actually trust Wikipedia quite a decent amount, purely due to the fact that *anyone can edit it*, it's peer reviewed, unlike quite a lot of shit you read (I.E. Reddit (Yes, I've seen news sites source Reddit), 'the internet', specialists during interviews, reporters, etc...).
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:55:09
People don't even need to figure it out, there are even things like SSL client certificates that the *server can push to browsers with the simple click of an 'ok' box*, the isuse is, people clear their browser data and then... shit. No more client certificate.
For an example of a site that uses client certificates to auth users (Or, at-least did as of last year), see:-

There's no method I could see to sign up via Bitcoins using the generic site layout (And not following your link).

I would say you're buying the [128GB SAMSUNG 840 pro]( but that's only $30 off to get to $119.99.
@_date: 2014-08-09 00:06:13
I'll help with that later in August, I'll be moving all of my funds to multi-sig the second I can locate a secure place to store the third key.
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:11:19
Yeah, I saw it, apparently it's only $10 + $6 for insurance on a card that's about $50 more expensive in my country, only catch is a 25 day shipping time.
I wonder what happens if my product is DOA and I have to return it to the company (in this case, Newegg)?


and instantly I no longer have a use for it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:41:40
No, appropriate response is to report it to [phishtank]( to actually prevent it, not to waste literally only your time.
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:22:34
But it's not cool, you control no Bitcoins, you own a "IOWU" of Bitcoins issued by Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:53:46
I don't trust it because it's impossible to the extent of my knowledge\*\*. You can't encrypt data with facial recognition, facial recognition assumes that the device doing the check is secure, this is great for preventing the average person from opening your laptop and logging in, but, won't prevent anyone who is willing to boot into Linux and just mount the filesystem.
Same with stuff like GAuth, Yubikey, and other stuff like that. Sites that implement it (I.E. Blockchain.info, Bitstamp, BTC-E) aren't anymore secure from internal attacks if you use GAuth/Yubikeys/other OTPs\*.
\* Not all OTPs are insecure against internal attacks, Lastpass has a great OTP system that utilizes an already authenticated client to generate the OTP locally, encrypt the password, then upload the OTP to Lastpass, upon activation, the 'encrypted' data is downloaded, unlocked with the OTP, then you create a new session as a normal user using the normal password. Although this is great against keyloggers, it's still insecure against anyone who has direct access to the RAM/CPU of the computer using the OTP, and, can still be replayed.
\*\* Is it possible? Explain to me how, I'm listening. [No "and a miracle happens" please](
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:49:02
That looks really cool, but, they obviously have to know the private key to generate the physical product, that puts me off it, they can just wait six months then steal ye' money.
EDIT:- I was talking about the Armory seeds, I see they do custom BIP38 keys where you control it and they just have the encrypted version, but, I use Armory, so, hey ho.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:19:21
I don't. I use Armory and keep it in an offline PC 24/7, except for a bit I spread across my laptop/phone/desktop for easy spending.
All funds are sent from me directly to the company I'm purchasing from (Or the company they trust to receive their coins), I don't hold it anywhere else.

"The news is absolutely 100% correct about everything except the articles you have a first hand account of" - close enough quote of someone I don't know.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:21:09
I agree with the the "No" over "not yet".
@_date: 2014-08-18 04:36:20
Extremely valid point, although, I will point out:-


Is a null point as Armory is a python application and runs directly off the source with no compilation, the only compilation required is for [this]( (Which I didn't read, I admit, but did compile from source as there is no publicly available binary to the extent of my knowledge, you *have* to compile from source).

No. I honestly doubt anyone who's rich stores even a tiny bit of their funds in currency, currency is great for trading, but, it makes zero currency in return. If you're a millionaire and you've got a bunch of money, you're keeping it in stocks, real estate, etc...

All this seems to do is check that it's got a valid checksum, and, adheres to the base-58 rules, am I wrong? This has been done a million and one times over, Blockchain.info has this API, Blockexplorer.com has this API, I'm pretty sure so does coinbase and a few other places.

If you can buy the car on it's own for $10 without the services, then it's not fraud. If you can't, then, *like I clearly said at the bottom of my original post and [this]( one also*, yes, it's fraud.
@_date: 2014-08-21 11:01:11
Oh, in that case, yeah, customs fraud.

Yeah, I know Reddit admins can change them, but, that sounds like a huge conspiracy.
