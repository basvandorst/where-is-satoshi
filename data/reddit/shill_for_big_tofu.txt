It's like saying capitalism theoretically ended when Marx dropped the hottest mixtape of 1848, or that the copyright enforcement industry theoretically ended as soon as someone plugged one computer into another. Ain't over till it's over.

Robbery (in a decent country of course)


If the largest companies in the world decide you're worth more to them as atoms than as labor, who will save you? Who represents greater risk in their equation? The largest military force in history, or a very efficient private army? If they're so efficient, why would they protect you for $1,000 when they could sell you for $1,100? Because of their reputation? Why would they just sell one client, when they could sell all of you?


You're just making shit up at this point.


Yes. The state is the biggest fish in the pond. But it only represents a tiny portion of the biomass, and the other fish can swim together.

Socialism is the worker ownership of the means of production. For a time, nobody could imagine this taking place without a government and central planning, because the technology required for decentralized rule simply didn't exist. They made do with what they had, and mostly failed because centralized socialism contradicts itself ideologically. Now we have a decentralized, zero-authority ledger. That's an interesting development.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:37:18


Yes, they were. In many cases, these towns were isolated, and you couldn't leave if you held debt. Almost everybody had to take on debt to get in. Leaving, even without debt, would usually be a death sentence. Buying enough food to make it to the next town over would be impossible using only the extremely low wages offered.
The government does build things, I don't know why you think otherwise. You haven't noticed all of the monuments lying around? Infrastructure? Most cities?

I don't think communism is possible, but for different reasons than you.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:34:02


Oh, I see, it's been mathematically proven that communism is impossible, and you just forgot to cite the source.
Never mind that communism isn't centrally planned...
Even if it was, saying central planning is impossible, citing the USSR's inability to match financial markets in real-time resource allocation and supply chain, prior to computers, is absurd. A market is a distributed computer, and prior to widespread computer use, it was the most powerful computer we had. Of course some russians with paper and ink aren't going to keep up.

This is rotting ideological garbage but lets ignore that for a sec


Not true. Automation is constantly shifting that balance of power, and has since the invention of agriculture. Employees DO work for companies known to commit wage theft. Are you suggesting McDonalds doesn't have employees?


This is true in cases of monopolies and oligopolies that rely on government for that status, but those aren't the entire economy, and terrible practices including wage theft are commonplace both within and outside them.


Probably not the entire population - not at first. Just races, geographical regions, whatever's profitable at the time. Killing everybody isn't profitable until you've got a replacement lined up, which should happen within the next few decades (AI).


People make nukes. Companies make states. The state and the company, they are one. The lines drawn are all to make you think you can defeat them by cutting off one of their heads. You won't. You can't. It is unyielding.


The bad people have more money, and that is self-perpetuating through this effect you describe. Bad is cheaper. When competing for money, bad always wins.


Not true. It's more profitable to go to war if you can trick someone else into paying for it. However, wars are still done for profit. If not paid for with tax money, then resources plundered. History is full of such wars. If resources can be plundered for less money than they're worth, it will be done, and war is a fine way to do it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:26:06


Well, yeah. Tax accountant offices are what capitalism builds when it wants to do tax filing. A state is what capitalism builds when it wants to wage a war. You don't need tax accountants or states for either, but they're more efficient. A company that runs its wars through a convincing state makes more money than one that doesn't, it wins, the other dies. Natural selection.
You describe the costs of war as very high, so high that it'd never be profitable. Yet, history is full of profitable wars, from the establishment of every empire in history, to the banana wars, to Iraq. Unprofitable wars happen by mistake, and those who undertake them are less profitable than their peers. They lose. They die. Natural selection.
Keeping the wheels of commerce running is not the inherently peaceful endeavor you describe. Oftentimes, violence is more profitable than non-violence, and "keeping the wheels of commerce running" is the reason for almost every war. I already mentioned the banana wars, they're a great example of this.
To put it simply, taking over Disneyland is bad for piggie, while colonization and imperialism are good for piggie.

Farmers under socialism: Lets vote on who does what, what we plant, what tools we use, what we will need to buy this year, what we'll sell this year, who we'll buy/sell with, do we need a new coffee maker? Work together, party together, sometimes buy and sell dank memes on the black market.
Farmers under communism: I think I'll plant some arugula. Afterwords, I'll bring it around to my neighbors, as is tradition. They'll give to me some fruits and nuts and all kinds of shit they're growing, as is tradition. I'll spend some time working at the neighborhood school, educating my kid and others, as is tradition. They're putting a barn roof up in the field south of my house, so I'm going to go help, as is tradition. When the barn is ready, we'll use it to store hay and improve our yields, as is tradition. Money? What's money?
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:35:05
They'd fail? I agree. Maybe after a few hundred years of getting stomped on they'd band together to form some sort of militia, start electing generals, everybody could contribute a little bit of their food and shelter to keep the whole thing going. Could work.

This happened pretty much everywhere as soon as real estate developers realized that people could afford to pay more for houses than houses cost to build.

Most people who are robbed are poor. You're suggesting this could be solved by charging them for access to police. I think that's unlikely. Giving them guns would help for sure, but consider wage theft. It's one of the most common types of theft in the US. Their bosses can afford private police, and they can't. A gun in their hands levels the situation, but not enough. Like you said, private police can be efficient.


The reason why food producers don't buy hospitals and poison their food is because it isn't profitable. You're assuming that companies won't kill people because then they won't be able to get new clients. You're assuming that, once they're done, there will be new clients to serve. Why would there be?


Humans: one power
The State: ten power
Companies: one billion power
The state is an instrument of the companies.


Wars are almost exclusively for-profit endeavors. The Iraq war was profitable for those who made it happen, and those who made it happen do not print money - but they do have enormous influence over those who do.

Do you think communism is impossible because capitalism will always destroy its roots before it grows?
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:01:40
Literally opposite of that
Why does nobody like to be informed? It's not like Wikipedia doesn't exist. Socialism is when the workers own the means of production. Central management makes that easier if you don't have easy communications and need centralized leadership and representation, but those conditions ended a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:04:40


No system works this way. People are the component that computes this.


Capitalism does not seek to satisfy everyone's preferences. Capitalism seeks to maximize energy consolidation. Trading something relatively invaluable for something more valuable is how that is accomplished. If capitalism was after peoples' preferences, nobody would be hungry, especially not in places like the US, where one fifth of households don't have enough food.






Wait, so I can signal my preferences to multiple actors, but not one? What makes you think that's rational?
Markets act as neural networks, with humans and computer programs functioning as hidden layers. We've been able to create these networks artificially for quite some time now.
You need to do a lot more reading.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:38:45
No, communism is purely theoretical and has never happened.
Socialism is a basic building block which, if used to construct all of society, may eventually lead to communism. Problem is, blocks of capitalism naturally destroy all adjacent socialism blocks.
Edit: Put your katana down dude, I'm not a statist, I'm just literate. Yes, I know that one time a big authoritarian meanie said his country was a communist country. Maybe you should consider why you recognize his other lies as lies, but that one you hold as absolute truth, despite the literal fuckin' definition of communism describing statelessness.

1. We do have robbers perpetually raiding the people in every situation where the reward outweighs the risk.
2. Yes, the police and justice system are in almost all cases, "the risk"
You think after power has naturally consolidated for all of history, if we just break up one small piece of that power, it won't continue to consolidate?
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:30:31
pure free market capitalism implies that demand has the power to create government
Even if there's no demand, governments under capitalism are just companies with additional tanks and elected members. The additional tanks mean additional control and additional capacity for profit. Given enough time, any power vacuum will be filled by whatever's around it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:50:57


If each community hires protection, there will be firms competing for those contracts. The amount of protection provided per dollar, given time, should increase. That's how markets work. If an idea can generate capital, given enough time, it will. You know what else generates capital? Killing your protectors and taking your shit. That is a profitable idea as long as you have shit worth taking. If you have money for protection, you have shit worth taking. Anarcho-capitalists, for whatever reason, seem to think this wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen, IF and ONLY IF, nobody had the resources to take your shit. If you could guard yourself in such a way that it'd cost more to take your money than someone would get by taking it. These conditions are those of wealth equality.
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:25:45
That's because another company ("state") has a monopoly on both of those things right now. Previously, they did exactly that. In cases where they can get away with it, they do exactly that.

strawman, didn't happen, doesn't happen, nothing to do with veganism


Here's how supply and demand works. You buy a 24 piece bucket of drumsticks. The birth, life, and death of the lower portion of 12 chickens is paid for at the counter, as well as profit for each middleman. This money goes towards raising more chickens, as well as developing lower cost methods of chicken production including but not limited to lower quality feed, low-cost surgeries that prevent chickens from hurting each other in close quarters, government corruption, and eventually, given enough time, complete regulatory capture. The chickens were not just sitting there waiting to be slaughtered by the trillion. You didn't pay for the death of any chickens. You paid them to breed more. You paid them to lobby the government to subsidize them, you paid them to fund studies to hide their economic externalities, and whatever they were able to shuffle out of their legal responsibilities, you paid for in your taxes.
To be vegan is to avoid helping that cause as far as is practical and practicable, even if it means that you have to make a small personal sacrifice.
