I'm always thrilled to read very old posts on bitcointalk.org and see just how frighteningly prophetic some of them were, especially considering that before 2011, Bitcoin was to many (even tech inclined early adopters) little more than a glorified meme project between a few nerds and experimenters.
  
It's like coming upon the sacred scrolls of visionary ancients.

Wouldn't 14 million trillion be 1.47 x 10^18?  
  
EDIT: 1.47 x 10^19 , not 10^18

Wait, what precisely do you mean by "dump" here?
Wouldn't accumulation by big players looking to short the market be the cause the current skyward prices? (that is if there is anyone looking to short BTC right now in the first place)

Aren't you the same person that was FUDing about coinbase yesterday on Don't get me wrong, coinbase is a headache, but your post history indicates that youve been on a streak of anti-bitcoin FUD

Be back soon.

Thank you but unfortunately, I'm not a bitcoin OG. I was referring to at a small fraction of bitcoin owners who are.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:47:54
Oh I'm not one of them. I very foolishly ignored bitcoin when a classmate introduced to me back in April 09.  
  
I think that at least a handful of people here on are the legit early adopters who've been mining and owning bitcoin since the start.

And here I am laughing when I remember the day when bitcoin hit $1 and everyone was saying that the bubble ought to pop soon.  
  
And heck, i'm not criticizing them, since I kinda believed it.

I don't even own bitcoins (long, miserable story) yet I still enjoy posting "**HODL!**" anytime I can.

Could be the dip many of us have been waiting for

Dude, my dad threw $30K into bitcoin two days ago... but not on my recommendation, so I'm clear for now.  
  
I'm a diehard bitcoin supporter, but part of me can't wait to roast him for it when I get back home for Christmas :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:08:17
Thank you lots!

I've have nothing but admiration for anyone who was gutsy enough to try and short bitcoin in this market. They boldly went where no HODLER would even imagine going and lost their money in style.

Multiple coin exchanges and brokerages allow people with enhanced accounts to do so, Poloniex being an example.
