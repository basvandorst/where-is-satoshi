At some point, the payment would get routed through the third party, rebalancing the channels.

No, a full node would not help. Jeff Garzik (the S2X developer) intentionally did not implement replay protection, that is, any transaction made will be valid in both chains, so you can't simply choose the chain like you can with BCH. It's been suggested that you should make a low-fee transaction that will only be accepted in one of the chains and then make another with a higher fee that would be valid only on the other chain (since the outputs are spent in the first one). Anyway, you should wait a bit more to see if S2X finally decides to implement replay protection.

In the last year pretty much all blocks have been full, except AntPool's. It is widely known that AntPool mines disproportionately too many empty blocks.

I guess so. You could send 1 XMR-like token to each voter and have each candidate or party have a public address. Then, the vote is cast by sending the token to the address of the candidate you prefer. Because of the properties of the Monero blockchain, nobody, not even the candidate, can know the vote came from you. At the end of the election, the blockchain is frozen and every candidate shows how many tokens they have.
This system would allow proxy voting, i.e. designating a friend or trusted entity to cast your vote for you, but it would also allow on-the-go coalitions, since a third-party candidate could in principle send all their votes to the one they prefer before the election ends. This may be positive or not, but at least it shows that such a system may be possible in theory.

Why fiat &gt; Litecoin?

You can sign up for Revolut. They offer a personal EUR IBAN based in the UK for free and it's pretty much painless to set up.

The difficulty adjustments are actually very easy to overcome in BCH. Miners can game the EDA mechanism by refraining from mining the first 12-24h after the difficulty raises to trigger an emergency difficulty reduction, and then continue mining blocks every 2 minutes for the next ~2000 blocks until the standard difficulty period ends. That doesn't only make BCH vulnerable to much higher inflation, but also makes BTC suffer from the hashrate swings.

What he meant is that we'd probably end up changing the PoW algorithm and rendering current miners' ASICs useless in our chain.

GDAX is indeed the exchange that Coinbase really uses. When you buy/sell through Coinbase, they place a market order on GDAX (which they own) and charge you a slightly worse rate and a higher fee (1,49% for wire transfer and 3,99% for card instead of 0% maker fee or 0,25% taker fee in GDAX) . If you're going to trade Bitcoin through wire/SEPA transfer, you'll be better off moving it to GDAX first. BTW, moving between GDAX and Coinbase is instant, free and painless.

It looks like [he did in fact mention both](

Actually, if the miners only care about profitability, they could let difficulty drop to half what it was before the reward halvening and make the inflation linear instead of negative exponential.
Any way you put it, the EDA in its current form is a fundamental vulnerability of BCH. Its use as storage of value would be hindered due to the higher inflation, and when the rewards stopped (either literally or effectively, when they become too small that it's not worth mining for even every 30 seconds), the profit-driven miners would leave BCH resulting in a hashrate many times smaller and therefore making BCH way more susceptible to 51% attacks from small pools.

The problem is that there are **no ideas** in 2X because the **only** thing they want to change is the block weight limit. One side wants to change a magic number, the other is innovating and promoting research beyond that. A change in block weight may (or may not) be desirable in the future, but now there is no consensus to force it.

More or less. Most wallets nowadays (including hardware wallets) use something called HD Wallets, which allows the wallet to derive new key pairs for each transaction to enhance privacy. All of this is handled for you so you only have to worry about the seed.
If you really needed to for some reason, you could derive those keys in a computer using [generators like this one]( (you should not run it on a computer with internet access for because you would have to provide the seed. However, this is not needed outside of emergency edge cases, as most wallets now (hardware and software) support the same seed format, called BIP44, which means that if your hardware wallet broke, you would only need to restore the seed to the new wallet.


No, your Bitcoins are just an entry on the distributed Bitcoin blockchain (a trustless ledger maintained by thousands of nodes worldwide) that says that only you can spend those Bitcoins. 


The Bitcoins are "located" in the blockchain, a distributed ledger that everybody can agree on even if they don't trust anyone else. This is done through difficult mathematical problems that are constantly changing (called a Proof of Work algorithm or PoW). From your seed your wallet derives private keys and public keys associated with each one.
When you receive Bitcoin, someone has signed a transaction saying they want to send BTC to your address. When it gets verified by miners, everybody agrees your address has BTC in it, though only you know it's yours.
When you want to send Bitcoin, you sign a transaction with your private key, that everybody can verify without knowing it, only knowing your public key (which is the address you're sending from). This way you can be sure that noone else could spend your Bitcoin.
If you're interested in the technical details, I highly recommend watching [3blue1brown's video about Bitcoin](

I am moving away from Breadwallet because I don't like their stance on 2X or the nonstandard recovery phrase, but you can change the unit by going to "settings" → "local currency" and swiping left on the exchange rate shown at the top.

I think you meant Benoît Hamon, the candidate endorsed by the PS.
