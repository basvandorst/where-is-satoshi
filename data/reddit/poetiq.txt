If it makes you feel better, there are professions where it's ok to show up to work with no pants... so if things don't work out at your current job there is always the potential for a career change.

Interesting, my dream has always been that it's the last day of school and I'm on the verge of failing...
Not sure which one is more appropriate... but I personally think the no pants dream is better cause you still have time to make things right...

**TL;DR; it encourages deflation which discourages economic activity. Inflation encourages spending because your dollar will be worth less tomorrow.**
It's a fair enough point, and the author doesn't argue that Bitcoin isn't a good store of value, but as a day to day currency people are less willing to spend it because of what it might be worth tomorrow.
But I think there is a whole other macro-economic debate around that issue that I'm not versed enough in economics to engage in.

Without looking at their code base it's impossible to tell. Even if it were a simple change in one place, it's not out of the question that their code is in a state where they have to make similar changes across multiple systems in hundreds of places. Any number of bad coding decisions could lead to a nightmarish situation in making "simple" of upgrades.

My understanding is you only pay capital gains on profits. So if you buy $100 worth of bitcoins, and turn around and purchase $120 worth of goods or services because the value of bitcoin increased, you're only paying taxes on $20.

Cryptos have a total $611 billion market value with Bitcoin being at 45.2% of that.
We're seeing the rise of a much bigger bubble, where people will be rushing to find the next, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium,  trying to chase the next 4,000% gainer, which will increase the wild over investment in crypto currencies overall.
It's a crypto bubble, and at some point, who knows when, it will pop and Bitcoin will be affected. It's hard to say how bad the wild speculative greed will get before it all comes crashing down.
I'm already seeing ads on YouTube advertising "find out what the next 'bitcoin' will be."

Those priorities are reasonable. It's not to say segwit is unimportant, but if you fail at the first two, your business is done.
Security should go without question as the ongoing top priority. One major breach and goodbye Coinbase.
Given the outages during major trading spikes, it's justifiable to have performance at  Coinbase has some scaling issues they need to addresses.
So segwit at  makes sense.
Their engineering team is big enough that they should be tacking all three concurrently. 
But put it this way. Would you want them to deploy a code change that enables Segwit if it introduced security risks or impacted the performance of their trading platform?
The first two priorities are an ongoing given, and really Segwit is the top new feature priority which makes sense.

It wasn't more 5 months ago when I was looking at the price of Bitcoin thinking... is it too late!? I remembered when Bitcoin was $25 and thinking... holy shit that's crazy!!
Then after doing a bunch of research I realized it was far from too late. I bit the bullet and bought a bunch when it was between 2k-3k... haven't looked back since...
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:48:47
Maybe they took out a loan with an insanely high interest rate in a country with crazy tax laws to buy a crypto-currency!?!? But if that were the case, they you have other problems...
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:39:02
Agreed. Cryptocurrencies aren't going away, just like social networks and the internet.
It's possible that something comes along that knocks bitcoin off its' throne. Governments or banks trying to push their own crypto, or a far superior solution down the road.
It's really an equation of time. And none of us can really see that far into the future. Getting to 1mil per bitcoin leaves a lot of runway for something to happen that we can't predict.
So yeah, "0 or &gt; 1mil"

Under $500k it's on National TV, $500K to $1 mil we have to take his word for it.

Bitcoin market cap is currently at $66.5 billion. In total, big banks paid $110 billion in fines for the mortgage crisis.

Just sayin, if you want to talk about fraud, let's talk about fraud...
EDIT: If you want assurance that bitcoin isn't in a bubble, then just look to the banks that aren't supporting it. When JP Morgan and all these other investment bankers are trying to push bitcoin on you, then maybe it's time to consider that it's in a bubble ;P

Isn't that basically what derivatives are? It's all just speculative value.

It can be a signal of confidence depending on how far the price drops.
In this case I see it as a good sign that the price isn't dropping below $4,000. If the price only went up, it would be harder to predict any actual floor making bitcoin an even more risky proposition.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:24:53
So if I'm interpreting these lyrics correctly, it sounds like Jay-Z is saying HODL.

Was going to post the exact same thing. After reading, I was like, "huh? Am I missing something?"
Closest argument I could try and gather is that bitcoin has properties susceptible to fraud.

Pro Tip: Skepticism is good.
If JP Morgan is saying it's a bubble, it's healthy to be skeptical.
If JP Morgan is saying that Bitcoin is going to make you rich quick, it's also healthy to be skeptical.

This is actually an interesting experiment in a democratized currency. Hard to say what is right and wrong, or what the future will be.
We can all make arguments for what it right and wrong, but ultimately, there doesn't exist a single entity that makes this decision alone.

In order for Goldman Sachs to buy 200 billion in bitcoins, they'd have to buy it at around $12,000 per bitcoin, and they'd have to by all of them.
Even if they bought 50% of all the bitcoins, they're paying $24k per bitcoin in December... math seems suspect...
