That's an interesting take.  Do you have a link to explain the relationship?  Like why wouldn't the Chinese risk the Auction?

Could you re-phrase?  "more than that is an actual thing that actually happens in real life"
Ie. do you not feel that is the case?

Ah interesting.  Ty!
Are there any other world scenarios/events that could potentially effect BC in such capacity?

Does this have anything to do with the approaching Summer Split?
And how do the Aussies have $19m to auction?  Was it some sort of "cache"?

Any other than Coinbase in the US?  They just gave me a limit, they want last 4 of my SS.  Rather not give that info.

So technically:  increase of market effectively lowering demand?  Increase in Quantity letting the market adjust value?
Are there attributes inherent to BitCoin which normal markets would not have?

Do you feel the Ethereum collapse is analogous to the Brexit fear?  ie. the fear of a source of instability?
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:43:11
I was thinking about that.  But why would the fear subside?  The vote is still going to happen.  And why would the fear subsiding influence BC market rates/transactions?

How about sending from your wallet to Paypal?
