Before Christmas $200 billion was wiped from the value of BTC due to the bear market and panic selling plus obviously the infighting and the question over how to use BTC to buy stuff. They are turning it back into fiat.
That was a bubble popping. $200 billion was wiped from the value of BTC as it popped. All cryptos went down that day.
Just because something has bubbled doesn't mean the underlying value isn't still high. It just means people are investing massively because of emotional/gambling driven desires to get on a gravy train because everyone else is doing it, not because they understand why they are doing it. They failed to HODL.

The only reason I HODL is because I am just too bored to death with looking at a graph whizzing up and down all day long. I don't care anymore. Just sit on it and come back in December 2018. My plan.

It's not a science. There is no experiment for it. It's a combination of economics and encryption. A financial instrument. Think VISA but encrypted. The area is called financial encryption. There is a white paper on bitcoin but its peer review is basically the cryptocurrency communities views on it.
There are some computer network engineering papers on it.

Check that when you join a place that they allow you lodge money and trade before full verification but you will need to get full verification to take anything back out. They will also not allow you to buy or withdraw a few days into your account as it nears verification but you can usually stop a trade. So for a day or so you may be paused. Have a look.

They are just as volatile. There are lots of people playing the short game (which is just silly IMO) by switching between Cryptos but many places selling shares in these are also placing limiters on buy/sell options because of that volatility. I have no problem investing in other cryptos hoping to see a BTC type spike but BTC is still the one doing that.

It's like the Linux rebellion that goes from F* Microsoft to F* Ubuntu to F*Mint to...
What you end up with a whole chain of OS distros.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency revolution. To be honest the driving factor behind Bitcoins HODL community is that cryptocurrency as a whole is a mandatory step for the worlds financial institutions to take. Then the government has less worry over stocks crashing because of leaked details in the news with this level of protection.
So while bitcoin users in a niche might be F*BTC, they are really all for cryptocurrencies in the same way all Linux OS distros are for Linux.

In the annuals of trading history has $200 billion vanished in such a way in such a short period of time?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:37:38
That's not a bad answer.

It's called **Ripping your face off**.
He is practically accepting they did insider trading and trying to justify it.
So as they sold products to people which they knew was going to drop, they privately bought products which they knew were going to go up.
That's called *Ripping your client's face off*.

Yeah. He is like neutral. He doesn't have any stakes in bitcoin. He writes books and does talks and people donate BTC to him.

If alt cryptos really were strong competitors to have people pull their $BTC funds then you wouldn't be seeing this spam everywhere. A co-founder of Bitcoin domain name announced selling of his Bitcoin and denounced it for an alt.
It was nothing less than a very small whale and some dolphins making a big deal out of people's confusion over the difference between the co-owner of a domain and a co-owner of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin came right back after.
Then you had some other things negative in the news. So it dropped it bit. Then Asia came on and it went back up.
I don't mind alt coins or buying them, but to tell people to PULL OUT from bitcoin for an alt is just sowing chaos so someone can profit from your mistake. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:59:06
A single whale takes his earnings as a co-owner of bitcoin.com and tells people BTC is crap and buy BCH. The bubble pops after they do.
A group of people who seemed to have known this was to go down expected to be able to put money from a big pocket A into a small pocket B and make B look bigger as A gets smaller. To copy the whale.
What did they expect? They undermined the foundation and drove speculation into the bubble bursting. LTC owner sold off. BCH dropped. People pulled out of crypto.
So how did Ver's plan and the co-owner of a domain name work out in the end?
This. A crashing bubble.

Yeah because they had enough of having their faces ripped off by the BCH propaganda yesterday but it's a megacorrection not a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:13:34
It's like the advent of the credit card.
Governments and big business want to get into cryptocurrencies because of financial leaks. However, because there is no centralized control by these entities over bitcoin they have no way to regulate it so that they can control its buy and sell values. They are basically late to the game trying to find an in.
Eventually, financial markets and businesses will switch to this security. It is inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:25
Can you explain why?

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:25:32
Don't you think the timing is a factor here? Some of those drops took months if not a year. This latest one took hours.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:18
Why would anyone want to get into bed with someone who has been so unfaithful? So these people were telling you to buy bitcoin first and then they made a dip, created propaganda panic selling and propped up BCH with the funds they pulled out. What do you think they are going to do to BCH when they are the only one's inflating it? HODL? Like hell, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:06:08
I'm guessing you mean the whole stock market.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:04
A few BTC traders got stung by BCH propaganda and don't want to be part of big money trades anymore.
I don't think this is the end of blockchain tech or BTC.
Ripple is doing well and people are putting some money there for awhile.
BTC will rise no problem :)

You missed the deleted text above. Anyway, I think it should be clear what neutral means in the context I mentioned which obviously has to do with conflict of interest. He had no conflict of interest because he wasn't invested directly in the cryptos at the time. Now obviously he has some through donations.

The bubble has yet to happen. If anything crypto competition is behind the volatility. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:01:05
Jee some people invest in ripple for a bit and others leave because of BCH propaganda making them go into the red, doesn't mean BTC is crashing.
It means blockchains are cheap and finding their balance.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:04
JMO but I think bitcoin is like the advent of the VISA card only the value of the funds in the VISA fluctuates, hopefully for profit, as the VISA card becomes more popular to use.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:08:03
There are a few things likely happening.
The first is commercial sector is getting more in on it and testing it by making large buy and sell trades for analysis.
The second is a whale dump.
The third I suspect is more likely, which is that as bitcoin rises people change their stop losses upwards to keep a profit but they all trigger in a run when it drops.
The commercial analysis shouldn't have any long-term impact.
Whales dumping will happen. It seems a drop but then a rise as long as lots of whales don't keep dumping.
The chasing stop losses seems more likely.
Look BTC is at 14931 at this time of writing. That is still steaks ahead of where it was.
My prediction is that the buy in time people were waiting for is probably here right now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:15:42
Nobody is buying anything yet with bitcoin. Like not in any sense we use VISA or real money. The reason for that is simple. They are holding onto it. Most bitcoin value is being hoarded. It is being hoarded because it is the new VISA. Your money will be encrypted and even this involves a new technology called blockchains.
Let's put this another way. Banks, big business, and governments can't wait to regulate Bitcoin so that they can buy up as much as they can at the cheapest prices and then they don't have to worry about Wikileaks publishing their transactions anymore. Then they sell the technology to the public again under their management.
That's it in a nutshell. So Bitcoin holders (HODL) are trying to put the power of financial management bank in the hands of the masses.
The amount of people trading in other stock because they learned about Bitcoin has grown exponentially.
The only question you need to ask yourself is what value will your finances be when your banks force you to use Crypto solutions on your VISA?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:46:28
Same as Visa or MasterCard but more secure.

BTC is down but Ripple is good. I bet some people are pulling out because of the infighting.
Buy cheap :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:29:35
Yeah exactly. Don't know why you got downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:31
The attack, which is exactly what it is, has been a constant spam led by some speculators bolstered by some bad news and a co-founder of a website who pulled out of BTC and then slagged it off for an alt.
If that's all they got, then BTC has nothing to worry about. It was a few downward tends.
So you had a whale dump backed by some speculators and the co-founder of a domain and huge amounts of alt-spamming across trading platforms.
The ruse is done a few ways.
1) Confusion over what a bitcoin co-owner and a bitcoin domain name co-owner is.
2) That you can easily move your money between alts when one is low and another high to get a hockey-stick graph of profits.
3) That investing in them all is bad. You only need an alt to BTC.
So they tried a bit of psychological manipulation with the co-owner headline. The hockey-stick trading claim by day trading between them is unlikely to happen for you. Instead, your money will be locked into an alt waiting to break even to buy BTC. You can actually invest in more than one cryptocurrency. :)
That's my take on it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:51:54
You are going to profit on the turn anyway.

Sure after the push over a few hours in a day this will happen.
14k is huge gains for HODL.
Probably drop to 12k gradual rise and up again.

anarcho-capitalism is an oxymoron. It's just extreme capitalism without regulation. 
Anarcho-syndicalism avoids the top-down control of power that anarcho-capitalism inherently has.
BTC is much closer to the syndicalism than the first.

There is no bubble when a security-aware world is suddenly taking note that given the amount of cyber crime going around and leaks that government and businesses are taking encryption currencies more seriously. Markets open and then it will become clear that every big business analyst will be putting money into it to test it and to their surprise, it will be the most battle-hardened financial security transaction they will ever make. It's been out in the wild and lived.

Gold has some use in electronics and the rest is an emotional attachment. The closest BTC comes to that is in the electricity costs to mine it. I still think BTC has more tech to offer though. My original question is about a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:19:28
A small whale sells his share in BTC and uses his position as a co-founder of a BTC domain to confuse some into thinking its a BTC co-owner. He then props up the BCH market and tells people BTC is bad and BCH is good. This was obviously well organized as several organizations knew about this before it took place investing in BCH stock.
They propped up BCH by 30% or so and the correlation with the pullout from BTC can be compared.
The problem is not that BCH is a cryptocurrency the crypto community shouldn't support, but that the whale and followers want a portion of the community of BTC users to join them by aggressive action. 
If you like aggressive tactics then by all means have at it, but you swim with sharks in that whale pond and think about it for a moment. These are people who sold you on BTC and then took from you to sell you something else. Once bitten...
