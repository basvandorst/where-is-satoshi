slightly too advanced for me at the moment, added to my bookmarks though.

thank you, read and bookmarked for rereading again in the morning =)

You idiot this was about C-Coin not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:14:14
i like the concept of steering whatever assignments i can in the direction of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:50:55
wow.  makes me realize exactly how annoying it is dealing with the current financial system. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:15:08
Yeah, i think your right there, just being involved on a personal level will help alot.  not looking to be some type of guru like AA.

electrum wallet sorted.  that was all a bit too easy.
it generated 5 strings of 'numbers' under receiving are they my addresses?
and 3 under change...  what's change?
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:54:12
ahhhhh... i see, what T9b was saying now.  the wallet is just a way of managing my address easier.  thanks AgentZeroM.
edit: wow so blockchain.info is just going through the blockchain and showing me all the transactions going on in the world.  and if i had an address then i could see what's going on there.  and if i had a wallet i could do stuff with the bitcoins. like make a key to make it secure and spend it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:12:40
i think you've hit the nail on the head with this one... another bow in the arsenal.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:11:33
i never managed to figure out the difference, before.  i'm going to try and figure out the hosting bit.  it would be nice to have all my music stuff on my one address.
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:06:42
awesome we got an old school record label here.  money first music second (or third after the exciting stuff in the works)
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:59:13
this part might take a bit more reading into =)...
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:17:39
I hope i get to that stage, making the music was the easy part.  now gotta figure out wordpress and hosting etc as well.
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:36:32
that's a really good idea.
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:43:51
thank you.  i feel i have a starting point in my research now =)
my first question now is (for me, no need to answer it as i think it will just open up more questions =)
can i operate on the one address or will i need to change addresses many times?
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:03:18
not quite understanding the "cold" wallet yet and the principles behind why it should be not connected to the internet.  look forward to doing the research figuring it out though.  thanks vbenes.
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:46:55
i already feel a bit more empowered now, that, that sounds like a good option.  an hour ago it was all a bit overwhelming.  I think i got the theory down in my head just need to fill some holes in my knowledge before making that step.  might be time to move onto a practical lesson =)
...which leads to the question how do i do that?  (HA!)
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:45:46
thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:48:25
All brilliant ideas but also i live in a small australian country town 200km past Desperation.  We're lucky to have a university campus at all.  Any ideas further how i could do something like this but through the interwebs?
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:22:29
Thank you everyone.  that was the most friendly and painless lesson i have learned for a long time.  what an awesome community. what a powerful tool you've just unlocked for me.
I think with a little bit more research and learning (and a few more dumb questions) i'll be ready to give all my paper money to my wife and live off bitcoin exclusively ;)
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:05:19
Hmmmmm... would downloading Electrum be the right place to start?
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:41:17
thank you, i will figure this out before bed =)  (it's 1:40am here)
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:57:30
thanks for the help, now i only wonder why i never did it sooner =)
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:25:35
there probably are, i guess.  Has anyone genius pizza shop started to deliver weed pizza's yet?
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:44:26
ahhh Canada, the New Zealand of America.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:36:07
that i believe.
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:19:41
I'm not American, but this kinda ingenuity makes me proud to be American.

...as long as it's not illegal?  so in Colorado/Washington I can order pot?  What an amazing world we live in.
and munchies?
