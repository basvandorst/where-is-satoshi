I guess it's an Elliptic Curve system, which is vurnerable to QC attacks. So watch your wallet if QC becomes a reality. Obviously when that becomes the case the PKC will be changed to McEliece or something

As far we know quantum computer's real strengths lie in breaking the public-key cryptographic systems based on integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem. In general QC will speed up attacks on hash functions like the one used by bitcoin but I'm not exactly sure to what extent.

Well the mining is SHA256 which is a hashing algorithm, which is what I assumed he was referring to. The security of your wallet is PKC. Not sure which though. Not all PKC's are broken by QC.

Why aren't there an infinite number of private keys?

Sorry, people seem to think I was being skeptical of the security if there are only a finite number of private keys - actually I was asking a mathematical question, that is to say, for all hash functions there are an infinite number of inputs that will get you a specific output. Why is this hash function different?

So it's pretty common for a hash function to map the integers onto a finite set. In that case then there are an infinite number of inputs for each output.
As that was my understanding, I was curious why this property didn't hold for bitcoin private/public keys. Turns out it's because it's not a simple hash function from the private keyspace to the public one. The Elliptic Curve cryptosystem is in there and the specific version of the EC that Bitcoin uses has a private keyspace with cardinality 2^256. That's why there are a finite number of private keys that map to each public key.
