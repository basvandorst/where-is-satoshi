The ATM is in Cape Town Bitcoin in 38 Wale street first floor no identification need it. They sharing the entrance with Gold 'n Stones Trading and that entrance it's very secure and classy, only people announced can reach that floor . If I understood properly they have also private parking in the building for regular customers for better security and anonymity. I will tray to have a bigger pic next time I am going to buy few satoshi. and post it.

In Africa lot of people are unbanked and/or may don't have much knowledge how to buy online on top lot of African foreigners live in Cape Town that may have to send few bucks home and Bitcoin it's faster and cheaper than traditional money transfers like western union and more anonymous. Apparently in places like Zimbabwe the price of the btc it's almost double in compare of South Africa, this mean that if they send btc they even make money instead of loosing even if the commission it's high.

Guys ???? 
If anonymity it's the issue, 
nothing it's more anonymous and secure then put cash in a machine not yours and load the bitcoin on electrum wallet on tails os. 
Any electronic apparatus have a google account and/or a telephone number and/or mac address and/or ip address ect. and it's traceable.
