Yeah when he says "these cryptos are usually promoted as relatively low risk" i thought, wait a minute, every single crypto investor knows its a volatile market!  
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:09:54
Im leaning towards (atempting to be) edgy teen.. but i could be wrong.. much like OP
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:47:24
Yup, but if he cant grasp that simple point, you cant expect the child to grasp the intricacies of bitcoin and blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:04:27
Haha, absolutely! And were even seeing day to day, people that previously claimed "bitcoin is a scam!" Once they look into it, do some research to maybe back up their argument, they find information that proves their initial opinion wrong! 
I was 1 of them..
If OP can take off his fedora for half an hour and do some constructive research, instead of trying to be a hero on reddit for troll points, he may, MAY.. learn something
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:16:35
You literally did a list response earlier in the comments. Wow.. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:56:46
As i said, pig headed. But ill add ignorant as well.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:35:05
Im not gonna sit here and try to.convince you because frankly you sound too pig headed to listen to reason but.... you can actually pay your bills with bitcoin.. just so you know..
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:59:59
Ill go down with my portfolio like the captain of a ship! Ill never sell! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:30:33
Thanks! Ill make a note of this for next year! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:02:43
Forkbase!!! Coinflake!!! 
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:01:15
Komodo is killing it regarding Atomic Swaps! Not to mention the other tech leaps and bounds theyre not getting any attention for! 
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:17:31
I know this took you a while to write out, but for someone that has been DCA'ing for months now, with the goal to build a residual income, i appreciate your explanation
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:45:45
Good for a bit of a laugh if nothing else! 
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:23:06
If you dont have the private keys.. you dont have the bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:56:30
Sure it could be said! But itd be false..
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:13:53
Good!! 
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:42:53
My ta says 1 bitcoin is = to 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:54:11
Shit, i forgot to say im no financial advisor.. just incase i got all my lines wrong
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:09:57
Genuine in brackets!! Must be ligit! Msg sent!! 
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:36:24
The fact you think a currency is stable shows you know little to nothing about bitcoin, so jog on! 
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:00:18
Calling it! SHITPOST!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:08:10
Haha! Remind me in 3 years! 
@_date: 2019-08-22 05:04:28
Will buy this tonight after work!
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:57:46
I'm coming up on a year sober, all the cash I would've pissed away previously has been put into crypto! Hopefully it works out! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:24:36
Which was not the original purpose of bitcoin! Bitcoin dont give a shit for governments! 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:49:36
Unless they bring out a whiskeychain or beercoin, I'll be ok! 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:52:58
That's it! The way I figure it, I was drinking all that money away, it was gone! I still treat the money like it's gone but 1 day, it will hopefully come back (as a lot of my choices are PoS, or some other passive income form) and treat me and my family much better than constant alcohol abuse! 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:48:46
Congrats mate! We'll be better off in the end I'm sure of it! 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:24:19
Nope! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:29:50
You're maybe the problem.. maybe
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:08:33
Or down, like you seem to be guaranteeing alot lately
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:31:55
Moron. How about hold now and still buy when they hit 200
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:08:50
You have soooooo much to learn
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:46:50
I got a shit load of bitconnect you can have
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:39:37
Not a bad introductory read really! If i didnt know anything about it, id be shit scared of it based on the write ups in my local papers. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:50:12
Thats all great! Ill just give it some time and buy more! You and the rest of the fudsters are gonna have to pry my crypto out of my cold dead hands
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:46:56
Its all relative though isnt it? If someone bought in at 10,000 then selling now is at a loss, no one can time the market so whos to say in a months time its back above that
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:54:18
You assume he sold at 15
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:45:36
Oh you mean contributing to the dip? Cos thats what that is! 
Time in the market, not market timing! Im in this thing til my kids grow up, not for a year or 2! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:39:56
Only if it goes to 1000!
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:52:07
Hes a she, and i know what shes trying to explain. But it doesnt make any sense. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:19:03
Haha! You're laughable.. emotions?  here? Dude this whole market hasn't phased me 1 bit, I've dca'd my picks the whole time. You can call things whatever clever names you wanna come up with but dca is what it is! 
Back to trolling along elsewhere cendanal
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:08:45
Of course i know the general price on the days i purchase idiot! I just dont go out of my way to add it all up to see how down or up i am.. geez.. think about it
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:19:47
Like this, your post makes no sense
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:38:50
Can't, won't, don't care.. its all the same to me.. i could not care less, even if i really really tried, what your strategy is, and if you don't like mine, then you're the only person that bothers too.
i dollar cost average and accumulate on projects I've researched for days, weeks, months that i believe will be successful long term and i sleep like a Zen crypto Buddhist monk.. no good fortune about it. 
You must be trying to evoke some sort of reaction out of me or whatever but hey, that's what reddit heros do here i guess. And if you do honestly think I've sounded emotional then that's your own pretentious warped perception. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:20:18
Hey man, im thrifty anyway! So i wont spend my fiat on just any old thing either! I hodl my money just like my crypto unless its something worth spending it on! Using bitcoin to buy a dam coffee, like i see posts about, doesnt make sense to me! 
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:11:05
My portfolio says eitherwise
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:29:38
Amazing prediction! 
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:15:56
Thats why reddit isnt a good measurement.. im a holder and i havnt cared 1 bit over the last 6 months.. just kept adding bit and pieces every pay day..
Deleted my blockfolio app ages ago so i dont even have a clue what my investments are worth now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:08:48
Ahhhhhhh..... that was a satisfying burn to read
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:05:44
Yeah.. this makes no sense 
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:55:37
Apart from the fact that those 99.9 dont think its over, they barely know anything about it at all.
 It'd be more like 5% of mankind knows about crypto, of which 4% hates it or thinks its a scam... then the other 95% dont even know or care at this point
