Maybe so, but they're not mutually exclusive
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:59:16
Yea your wallet fucked you hard.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:39:11
Dumb enough or smart enough?  I wouldn't dump your whole savings in, but if you really want to make some profits you should drop at least $500
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:21:03
He seems like a real slimey sleazeball to me.  Plus, wasn't he convicted of some felony scam and served time then fled to japan?
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:41:05
Why not?  I started about that and had less money in the bank than he does, and obviously don't regret it now.  You gotta start somewhere, sure, but $40 is chump change and won't amount to anything.   What do you mean practice moving the $40 around? He gonna transfer to multiple wallets and lose money?
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:22:22
is this a troll or a crybaby supreme?
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:43:18
My thoughts exactly.  I was very excited about Trump in 2016 but this is just another entry in a long list of disappointments since he's taken office. Definitely disappointed but not surprised lol
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:13:07
Can we?  Certainly.  Will we? It's quite likely but not guaranteed
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:56:45
Dang man you got ripped the fuck off. Even at its peak you shouldn't have had to pay more than $50
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:52:09
In a perfect world, friend.  That's sadly not the case anymore (if it ever truly was)

i recommend to not use shit coin cash or roger ver's shitty scam site
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:57:25
no it doesn't
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:07:51
just save it bro.  what's a measly 1.1k when it could potentially be 10k this time next year or 100k in a few.  but if you're determined you just have to "sweep" the private key into a wallet of your choice then transfer to an exchange of your choice
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:14:26
More secure huh?  Why Digi coin, why not Faceberg coin?
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:23:45
People make new accounts all the time, dingus.  I cycle through one every couple of months.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:30:30
You think?  It looks like the halvening immediately preceded the retake of previous ATH and subsequently the run up to 20k
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:36:53
It's not, you're regurgitating shit you read on the internet with 0 proof or critical thought
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:01:52
Nice.  I feel a lot better myself after not having to worry about my coinbase account getting hacked or a trojan on my pc stealing BTC from electrum.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:26:59
you might make some short term profits if you can time the market well, but what do you really think the likelihood of binance coin being around in 5,10 years versus bitcoin's?
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:56:10
lol nice one.  anyone who defends that gayboy scammer roger ver is either delusional or stupid
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:58:36
Throw a dart at a wall of shit coins and you might get lucky and make some good money with a 100 euro investment.  You'll probably just 10x short term if you're less lucky
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:04:04
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:39:00
wonder how many heads this will fly over
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:39:22
No one knows.  If you sell and it goes to 100k next year you'll probably be depressed AF
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:29:55
just buy BTC instead
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:22:52

I knew there would be a donate link on there. ;) Downvoted
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:16:33
Lol been there man.  Just learn from this lesson and don't do it again.  Those flash crashes are usually temporary especially during a bull run, you should have bought more instead of selling.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:11:46
Good call, looks like you were right
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:25:40
he's saying withdrawal your btc to a wallet that you control.  coinbase stole his son's btc
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:59:06
lol.  that's just worst case scenario stuff obviously but it can and does happy so better safe than sorry.  karma doesn't really matter anyways so what's the point in using the same account for years and years?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:27:40
Why not?  Most new money is going to be trading IOUs on exchanges and not really using the blockchain
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:00:57
same reason i don't have a facebook or any other name-linked social media: privacy
i've been burned myself and seen others get it much worse from having online activity linked to real life via facebook or other social media platforms.
Reddit is "anonymous" but someone could easily parse through your comment history.  If you've got years worth of data, you may have slipped up and given personal details here and there over the years that allow someone to find your facebook profile.  From there any number of things could happen.  For a bitcoin related example, someone could know you have large quantity of BTC from your reddit posts, comb through your comment history and find that you posted your first name 3 years ago in a cooking subreddit, your last name in a motorcycle subreddit, and your hometown in a local subreddit, use that data to find your facebook, get your e-mail address and maybe cellphone number (if you're that negligent) through facebook, use an SMS spoofer to reset your g-mail password and then use that access to reset the password to your coinbase account and proceed to empty your wallets.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:34:39
Just beware is all I'm saying.  Lots of people think they can time the market until they realize they can't.  Look at what Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum were the last time that Bitcoin was at this price.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:11:20
true; i missed that third option
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:09:41
Get a ledger or trezor and sleep easy brother
@_date: 2019-04-07 06:07:08
Eh, you don't know any more than the next guy
@_date: 2019-04-07 06:12:06
Again, you don't know any better than the next guy.   
@_date: 2019-04-24 02:07:18
Never heard of it. You sure it's not a scam?
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:17:37
Same as all the other shitcoins, ride bitcoin's coattails
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:23:17
imagine if the the % gains follow the last bullrun. you'll sell at 20k and it could go 20x previous high to 400k
@_date: 2019-04-07 06:05:18
why don't you use local bitcoins and buy w/ cash
or get one of your friends to buy for you and give them cash
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:21:47
I think it's a shitcoin ICO
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:14:27
What are you blabbering about? Your ancestors would be ashamed.
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:41:51
Nice. That's how I feel about it. Worst case scenario, losing a few grand, is no big deal in the grand scheme of things when you think about the potential upside
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:47:02
I almost said fuck it when I was getting into crypto because I wanted some Bitcoin and ended up on and was confused about "Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Core, etc"
There would be no problem if they would fuck off the subreddit and use instead and use bitcoincash.com instead of bitcoin.com.  It's all designed to confuse you and trick you into getting into Bcash instead and anyone who says otherwise is a shill or a dumbass.
@_date: 2019-04-24 18:45:48
Whoa bro, you some kind of anti-semite? Reported.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:03:37
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:24:23
No. You can only trade/cash out. You should look elsewhere if you want to actually own your bitcoin and not just trade
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:57:54
God give it a rest with the sjw crap. You people have to make literally everything about diversity. News flash: it's not our greatest strength, and is in fact a weakness.
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:31:43
You're talking about nonsense and making a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:13:34
Yeah that sounds like some bullshit bro.  You'd think with both parties actively talking w/ support it would be done quickly.  Good luck!
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:12:47
@_date: 2019-04-21 18:58:49
So you're selling a stolen steam account with 2 VAC bans on file?  Good luck with that
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:18:08
just google it man, it's not very hard
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:07:01
Sucks you had to learn the hard way, at least it wasn't too expensive a lesson. Bcash is an ugly cancer on bitcoin's asscheek and unfortunately a lot of noobs get tricked since they sneakily control bitcoin.com and the  twitter handle
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:58:16
Bitcoin cash lol. That business is going to fail hard.

It's a scam

I put two spaces after each period.  Your big evidence is crap.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:14:58
Your posts and website suck
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:37:33
I do.  Reddit or my phone app must reduce it to one automatically.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:13:25
I doubt think face berg had anything to do with it. This was a continuation of the rally that was slightly dampered by the bitfinex situation.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:11:28
Did you even look at his chart?
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:16:14
Absolutely not.  Zuckerborg can't code for  shit
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:55:36
What do you think?
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:04:45
Why would you not ask this before spending money there? Some people....
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:57:47
Yep, if the pattern holds true.  Previous Bull run's ATH before the 20k run was only 1k.
If the same pattern holds, new ATH around 400k and bottom of crash @ 60k
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:39:32
U sell coin fast. U do it now. We no steal coin
