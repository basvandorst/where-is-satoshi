again, agreed, and being wary doesn't mean bearish :)
cripto is still a cool word
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:51:13
when someone snaps and goes hostile and all "fuck you" for no reason, it very much seems like much of a fuck was given yeah..
just saying, no need to be nasty to people who are having a genuine conversation with you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:04:43
i like and agree with your comment and i sincerely like your spelling of criptos; I'm gonna use that! :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:09:54
the stocks
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:06:09
put your phone on the other side of the room if you can. give yourself 20 min in the morn before checking it, even if you have to wake up earlier. you'll be stoked with how much easier the day is when you've had a proper boot-up routine for your brain thing
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:43:42
I don't think Phil was being retarded and your hostility is completely unwarranted
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:41:25
I appreciate the effort but it didn't really clear anything up for me; I would have preferred to find out more about what channels, nodes and hubs are-- I'll look into it though :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:01:29
anecdotally I feel it's around 50/50 from what I've seen
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:06:28
oh man but it's not about the morning time, it's about the rest of the day! I read something about the first 30 min after you wake up setting the "tone" for the rest of the day.. check emails and you will be all fragmented and checking things, do pushups and you will be energised and confident, go back to sleep/snooze and you'll be sleepy, eat early brekkie and you'll be snacking.. anecdotally at least it seems to hold up
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:07:33
cleapoll set to 3x IMO
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:53:05
and dismissed it with hostility :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:24
yes I would; I don't believe everything I read, I was just giving you my point of view since you seemed so interested.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:07
listen mate, you're taking me for some fanatic, i'm just saying I have a slight preference of r btc over r bitcoin because there are all sorts of people with differing viewpoints, and posts don't get deleted just for going against the agenda of the sub. it seems you're the one with the blinders on and making huge assumptions about me. i'm not even in crypto at the moment for fuck's sake, stop being so defensive and hostile for no reason.
oh and hey, I already explained I was using the term "outsider" in the context of the conversation between those two before and sharing my point of view, some people find it helpful
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:03:16
from an outsider's view it looked more like a conversation till you got defensive. just my two cents. carry on
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:18:24
Outsider from the conversation. I didn't say impartial (although I am) .. although I don't know about "on the reg" .. i got in one conversation in one thread there one time. truth be told though I do have a preference to r btc over r bitcoin because the info is more diverse the conversations tend to flow a bit better with less vitriol and emotion
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:23:04
*no coughing!*
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:10
oi, that dude was just explaining things, since you replied to a comment about stability and said you want the price to go up, and then you replied rudely instead of saying thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:05
whatever man, there's a lot of people with good info and interesting viewpoints there, posts aren't filtered, and I don't feel I've ever been misled
@_date: 2016-12-15 05:37:12
oh man the nightmare of how interconnected it is; having to make your brand page, link it to your profile page, confirm your brand page with links to your website, then de-link your youtube page from your personal page and link it with your brand page.. all just to get a youtube username. literally took me a month
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:26:18
genuinely interested in the answer to this
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:10:34
I'd agree with that.
Still think the number of people who are down outweighs the number of people who are up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:20:05
thank you. felt like beating my head against a wall for a bit there
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:19:22
is it possible that the majority of wallets created previously were coin tumblers? and I'm not talking about holders, I'm talking about the huge volume of people getting in at tops and then getting scared off.
I admit I can't be arsed backing up my assertions but I still think there are more people who have lost money than people who have gained. should have qualified it with an 'IMO'
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:07:36
maybe I'm out of the loop, what does nocoiner mean?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:45:38
I don't know why everyone is mocking and laughing at you, that's a shitty attitude for them to have.
It sucks that you took those losses my friend, I'm sure it hurts, but expensive lessons like this can help you remove the emotion from the money.. you can't learn that lesson without a sizeable loss.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:45:17
I'd say tumblers are far less used now than in the heyday of illegal marketplaces.
$ volume can mean losses too though right?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:55:14
yeah to me that stands to reason, but surely you agree the number of people dipping into cryptos has increased since early adopters? even if their losses are less than the overall gains of holders, I still reckon there are a lot more people who are down from when they jumped in, or panic sold and left cryptos?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:13:34
you know you can move stops right?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:17
are you saying that someone who takes profit = someone who has no stake?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:47:35
moving stops are a valid tactic to exit a trade, and stops are useful for trades where you enter due to indicators and expect the price to go in a certain direction, and if it moves in the other direction it means the assumption that got you into the trade was incorrect, so you exit the trade with your stop, rather than re-evaluating and being in a trade that you wouldn't have entered if not for the original assumption
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:56
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:26:48
you're supposed to grin and say "meh" so noone gets uneasy
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:56:47
It will get better. You learnt a lesson that only money can buy. Trust me.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:28:30
i reckon heaps fast
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:32:52
realistically there are more who are down
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:49:47
but you called that guy a nocoiner (twice) because he was proposing selling at highs rather than holding and never selling... to me that doesn't mean he has no stake or does not trade cryptos.. I feel you're making assumptions because their philosophy differs from yours, and you're correlating taking profits (or talking about taking profits) with not having a stake
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:18:57
out of curiosity does that timeframe line up with when bitcoin started making changes from how it used to be?
