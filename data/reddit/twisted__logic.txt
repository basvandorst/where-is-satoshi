gold is stable-ish because its physical and has been known for over 500 years, everyone knows what that is as a pretty &amp; malleable metal. that gold chain can be melted into a statue still or vice versa when bought or sold that is why it is by weight. 
BTC is volatility is because people are still learning / adopting it, and its new. most people here are trying to make money off of it buying and selling it as it is trying becomes a stable currency.
It will be a currency! &gt; but 1millon or 1oo? ; only the future knows. that's why it is still a risk, and you can still lose everything. but the greater the risk also greater reward if you are a holder. 
If you had gold under your bed it will still be gold everyone still knows what that is and it will still buy you rice! 
 if BTC fails or is just a FAD can you buy rice ? IDK   -5555-

search sell gold on any browser your not going to lose 90%. 
also that is not an extreme argument the likely hood of all the worlds gold losing value is very very low, but the btc chances still low are much higher

@_date: 2018-03-10 13:10:06
so all coins price is based off of BC because the exchanges exist where you can turn any crypt into another, but how do you guys select altcoins when diversifying your portfolios ? ;P
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:12:04

@_date: 2018-03-28 00:23:55
i want to believe you have a crystal ball tuned in to this, but my question is how you fabricate the gray area in the charts that is essentially the future. like what program are you using

@_date: 2018-03-16 15:47:26
I'm new to this thread, but there seems to be people on here that want BTC to fail, they are afraid of bitcoin. spreading fear. this is the new paradigm and will not be going away. fight the bear!
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:40:08

@_date: 2018-04-26 14:13:23

@_date: 2018-04-20 15:11:15
if you look at the lower charts 1m, 5m, 15m, there will always be ups and downs of people day trading. look at the 6h or 1d for "trends"
