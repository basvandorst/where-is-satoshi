Surely this wouldn't come under capital gains, but income tax?

Tipping thread? Great idea, also, some people ingenuity with the sentences forgoing their tip is hilarious!

How can someone into bitcoin not know how to take a screenshot?

Reminds me of a winning application at a programming course i went on two years ago, called twit-tweep, an application that makes a different sound when different people tweet that you follow, it gets annoying if you follow over 400 people without changing the settings a bit, but it's still cool, my team came runners up :(

I want to go to the moon :(

That's almost what I was thinking of when I was writing it, but couldn't remember what they were from maths lessons and such.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:59:47
It is indeed, that's a great analogy of it.

To teach him to use bitcoin exchanges when he may be too nervous to use his own money, that's what i would do anyway

Not sure if generally horrible comment (no harm done) or just general sarcasm. Either way this is the first Reddit post I've made and i have a comment, thank you sir.

Well in four years it's exchange rate has dropped from ~0.16GBP to 0.7GBP
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:15:52
Thank you sir :)

Bitcoin is still going to be spent at an equivalent to 2800 Bolivar regardless? It's not like they're going to ignore any and all exchanging into fiat when calculating the cost of a cup? Why do people seem to think this isn't the case?
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:34:53
Cannot be severely inflated? The picture you're commenting on is literally showing an inflation in the price of bitcoin over a few years? Also, you can't totally call bitcoin "money" until you can spend it unrestricted everywhere.

Nonsensical demand

This shit right here is why people don't take bitcoin seriously.

What other ways do you "fight the system"
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:23:44
Hmm technically not correct, and you can't "withdraw consent" to be governed. This is some Freeman on the land bullshit.

I still don't understand why people think BTC is going to save Venezuelans from devaluation of their currency. Like, they buy at one rate, and can then sell at another rate, back into a currency that's fucked
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:09:35
How does buying bitcoin "fight the system". I like bitcoin, and I purchase it at intervals that work for me. I'm just not completely ignorant and think that it's the be all and end all.

Do you really believe that because you spend some of your money that's printed by the government on a "magical internet coin" that your suddenly exempt from, what exactly, the laws of said government?

Stopped reading this bs when you said stop voting
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:52:00
The only chance of ever changing anything is voting. Or running yourself. If you do neither of those things you forfeit your right to complain about things.

"But it's so safe because you can't track the transactions and blahblahblah." Kind of obvious this shits going to happen anywhere yet 90% of this sub stick their heads in the sand and ignore it.
