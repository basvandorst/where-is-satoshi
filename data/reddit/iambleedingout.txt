"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
From the horse's mouth:

That's a good catch. However, as you mentioned, hot wallet is more likely to get hacked. I believe the recent news mentions that Mt.gox hacker(s) got access to the hot wallet

Yes, but it will be something like $20-50 with fees and what not. Plus that will be close to $3000 CAD needed to make that profit. Plus, you can only buy up to a maximum of $1000 CAD per week on coinbase even after all verification and waiting periods are completed. Lastly, the time it will take to transfer and sell etc, the price of Bitcoin can change as it is pretty volatile. So for individual investors/hodlers, it's not really worth it.

While Qudriga is an excellent Canadian Exchange there are a few reasons that still make Coinbase a good deal:
1. Quadriga prices are about $100 more to buy BTC whenever I compare with Coinbase.
2. It is much harder to get money into Qudriga and the no fee options like Bank Wire cost money at the bank to send. So unless, you are going to be buying MORE than $1000CAD, Coinbase Credit Card purchase fees are lower. 
3. I get 2% cashback on Credit Card purchases on Coinbase so a portion of fees is mitigated.
4. If you are a HODLER, selling coin is not much of an issue for a long time, so you can buy and hold in Coinbase and WHEN you are ready to sell, you can transfer to Qudriga and sell (for higher price).
5. Coinbase insures every customer's bitcoins. So if they get hacked or something, you will be covered. If Quadriga gets hacked and folds, there is no insurance to make you whole. Mt. GOX was a legitimate exchange too.
6. I consider the best approach to buy on Coinbase on a regular basis and then transfer the coin to an offline wallet.

To be honest, a few dollars is not the issue. 1 round BTC has aesthetic value :) Buying bitcoin is a pain so having to create an invasive exchange account and transfer stuff is not worth it for a few dollars. Once I am ready to buy a few more coins I will add some fractions for transaction costs.

As I mentioned, I want to make it future proof and importing will not do the "tree thing" where I can just have the seed phrase to safe guard.
