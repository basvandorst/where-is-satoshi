Using your own credit card to purchase a vanilla reload in order to buy money orders to buy Bitcoin with a seller from LBC?
No, it's not.
If you can't see why this isn't, you obviously know nothing about how these things are investigated...if it came to that.

He's in a group of people where the majority of the people know very little about this stuff.
If you put Einstein in a group of soccer moms to discuss physics...there's a good chance the soccer moms will make Einstein look stupid.

Like he's any different than most Bitcoiners.
Go to Amazon.com and search for the Bitcoin Trezor. Then go to the part that says "Other People Who Searched For Trezor Also Searched For" ...and look at the items it shows.
Gem scales. Because, you know...Bitcoiners are all also diamond enthusiasts.
"Bitcoiners" like you don't even use Bitcoin other than for a store of value. The majority of people that are actually USING BITCOIN FOR COMMERCE are using it for things like buying personal amounts of weed...and honestly, where is the harm in that?
Bitcoin would be NOWHERE if it weren't for this sort of activity. You're just too naive to realize it.
