This is the case, unfortunately. Write to Binance customer support and see if they can help in any way.

I think you're right.. halving happens VERY infrequently and it's quite predictable, AFAIK. The authors mention miners (really ASIC engineers) having tricks up their sleeves to solve the problem in a lucrative fashion when FUD hits before the next halving.

Block rewards (new Bitcoin awarded to miners upon finding a block) are designed to instantly decrease by 50% at specific intervals, tapering down the flow of new Bitcoin into the system until all 21m coins are in circulation. This instant halving could cause problems if all miners are using the same hardware when it happens. If the rewards (revenue) from mining suddenly drop below the cost of mining for all miners (possible if all miners are using identical hardware), then miners would turn off their machines to avoid losing money. This would completely stall the network.
The author(s) propose that instead of instantly cutting block rewards by 50% at specific intervals, the structure should be changed, through a hard fork, to one where every block has a slightly smaller reward than the one right before it. This would mean a smooth tapering of rewards instead of fearing moments when all miners could become unprofitable overnight.

I managed to have an order filled at $9980 on Gemini about 45 minutes ago.. neat! It's already back to $11k!
