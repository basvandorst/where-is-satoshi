Selling now is risky!
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:59:11
Far from it and about 50k
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:53:33
My tea leaves also confirm this is the bottom! Load up!
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:12:00
Buy it off her!
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:00:15
I think this goes over everyone head!
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:05:24
9.89% down is rookie numbers!
@_date: 2019-07-22 08:48:16
Day trader!
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:50:57
A lot of people on reddit have been buying during the bear market, because they've done their homework and believe in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:07:45
Hopes and dreams!
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:27:47
Don't be like Tom! Worth repeating!
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:40:42
Yeah buy the bottom!
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:24:17
I bought in December 2017 this is nothing to me! Plus i'm buying more like I have done every month since.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:06:08
Selling Bitcoin this close to the next halvening is madness!
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:42:59
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:49:44
This time next year, you'll wish you had bought more!
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:31:41
6% is good going and probably a good move! Don't be too greedy buying back in. 3-6% more Bitcoin Is still a good move! 
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:22:23
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:59:47
Well said.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:08:06
I bought before and it dropped 5% 2 hours later! The Joy's of bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-08 13:45:01
I'm just thinking more along the lines. If the exchange is using them against us for personal gain! I did enjoy the NXT airdrop beginning of the year. Half my coins are in my personal wallets so only half the risk and reward too! 
@_date: 2018-09-08 12:50:05
Should we take our Bitcoin off exchanges? So they can't be used against us? 
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:30:44
I won't be selling and if the price dives. I will buy more cheap bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:41:25
Please give me free Bitcoin. So I can be part of the new 1%! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:41:15
True but let's have some fun and enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:50:25
Relax and enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:21:56
Sounds great! Will be poor in no time. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:40:25
Do you have anything better to spend the money on? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:15:05
Rinse and repeat!
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:49:51
Wait till after the halvening for a good price rise! 
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:15:11
I'm gonna cash out 30% and then hold it for 6 months and buy back in! 
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:45:02
So whats the plan? buy high sell low! Wait for the next bull run and buy high again?
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:58:36
26% is rookie numbers!
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:40:25
Been doing that all year! 
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:15:02
Bet your kicking yourself! Lol
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:04:33
Just getting silly now! 
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:40:24
Did you have 2fa enabled and have you scanned for viruses? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:06:42
Dump coming later because of ETF?
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:32:52
Just a correction or someone betting against Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:54:48
I'm well in profit now and buying more! Quick sell before it goes to zero!
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:09:53
Thanks for your reply. I'm hoping not using the laptop for anything other than using my electrum wallets they will be safe. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:38:43
Price goes down and the hash rate keeps going up? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:40:51
I buy on coinbase and then send straight to my hardware wallet for long term hold.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:12:03
Bitcoin is dead... again! 
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:00:03
Let's hope so will hang fire on buying more though! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:48:51
If it was me I would buy Bitcoin with it and forget about it for a few years.
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:07:39
It has. I've done nicely :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:31:46
I hear your mum's got an nice d***
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:41:26
I'm using a old laptop with a fresh copy of Windows 10 to store my Electrum wallets. The laptop isn't used for browsing the internet or for anything else. Plus it isn't left on when not in use.
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:12:16
Hash rate is going up though! 
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:34:57
Do more research! 
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:09:46
Agreed we don't need W ankers lol
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:27:01
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:39:14
Doesn't seem to go much below 6k! 
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:30:46
Price goes down, I buy more. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:04:02
But we need banks to keep our money safe! Only joking lol 
@_date: 2018-09-08 13:46:49
I do spend a lot of time trading. But I do see it has a risk.
@_date: 2018-09-08 13:48:46
Greed can be predictable lol never owned Bitcoin cash so must be doing something right! 
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:27:16
Coinbase just charged me 5p for sending £50 to my wallet... Not bad!
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:01:04
Go leave a good review for the proper bitcoin website!
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:16:22
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:22:04
Thanks will look into it. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:10:32
Bitcoin Diamond twice?
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:00:03
Hopefully they will be worth something. But I don't buy into this FUD! Glass is half full. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:11:28
Everyone selling can buy back later for much more money! 
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:04:44
Do NOT download Electrum Pro.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:37:07
That's it I'm out! Millions lost plus the wife. So much for Bitcoin! O wait I've just came to my senses and bought more. Some of these comments lol 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:40:55
Yes buy some and have a play about with it! Watch out for fees 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:42:43
Here's me just buying the dips.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:09:18
Even less if you average your buy in! 
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:10:10
Maybe the price drops when demand drops! 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:20:29
Not for a long time lol 
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:55:17
Time in the market! Buy your moon ticket and relax! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:11:16
£6 billion trading volume on Bitforex?
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:41:08
£50 a week every week for the last 8 months. Pretty much ignore the price! 
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:12:51
Hasn't Bitcoin been dead 300 times before? Still up from this time last year! 
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:28:04
How many people wish they had bought February 2019?
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:37:09
Litecoin. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:30:47
Treat it has a saving account and DCA!
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:23:51
This will be good for my DCA!
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:21:13
Let's compare one ASIC miner to a motor vehicle! 
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:36:36
Litecoin seems to be doing well over the years! 
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:18:05
Friends and family still think Bitcoin is a joke!
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:39:22
Do your worst BTC whales! lol
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:48:08
Setup up a coinbase account and buy some Bitcoin. Then do lots of reading about keeping Bitcoin safe and how to avoid scams. Electrum is a good desktop wallet and is free. Ignore the price and focus on the technology instead.
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:50:20
Still buying
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:41:02
Who knows! I'm gonna keep buying every week.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:52:27
Use electrum or a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:16:50
Feel sorry for the idiots who bought BCH! 
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:37:53
Great time to buy! 
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:43:13
To the moon or zero and nothing in between. Its a gamble but i believe that bitcoin can be a game changer!
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:15:43
Scaling 
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:26:10
Good luck with that but greed is a powerful thing and that's how all this shit works!
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:44:43
Roger Ver is a scammer. Don't get scammed!
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:55:42
Yeah that did cross my mind! Probably doubled his money though!
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:07:16
Not your keys not your bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:45:48
I know I sold some to buy stuff I wanted and currently buying back the bitcoin I sold.
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:47:14
Push the price down and buy more bitcoin is the game! Later it will be a big buy wall!
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:23:40
I'll cash out when it buys a lambo or 2! 
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:25:29
Bitcoin goes up 200% and then drops 40% it's still up 160% lol plus if you think bitcoin is going to 50k or 1 million does it really matter if you bought at 12k or 10k!
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:34:00
Ok cool I'm currently 90% bitcoin and 10% alt coins
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:07:20
What's the rush?
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:18:25
Yay cheap bitcoins! Buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:22:49
Legend! Keep buying and you'll thank yourself later!
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:51:11
Go all in! No risk no reward! Buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:11:27
You should!
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:43:50
It's late but you get the idea lol
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:24:31
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:41:50
I bought the dip!
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:14:46
Some new money would be nice!
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:39:44
Let me guess your in it for the technology!
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:50:12
You will be in full control of your bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:20:15
Get a life!
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:05:24
I tried this last year and thought wtf
@_date: 2019-10-10 20:20:08
Go all in! No risk no rewards!
@_date: 2019-08-09 17:48:24
Alt season is gonna be massive!
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:08:32
Got lucky and sold some weeks ago now currently buying back :)
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:41:33
Crazy bitcoin sale with the halvening coming early next year!
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:54:15
I talk about it but no ones listens!
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:17:13
5x to 25x!
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:58:34
He does sound bullish on it!
Edit: Thanks for being an ass!
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:49:36
Avoid XRP and stick with just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:41:09
Definitely is that's why everyone buys alts!
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:44:57
Why are you here then? 
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:34:47
Definitely not priced in!
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:26:35
Hodlers are growing every day! Selling now is madness.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:13:32
Very good advice! I did the same years ago.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:39:58
Buy the dip! Great time to buy!
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:30:13
Download electrum and use 2fa on it! Make sure you know what you're doing before you use it!
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:21:12
All in on bitcoin is just plain stupid!
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:11:05
No thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:48:21
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:06:12
BUY BUY BUY!
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:05:59
Dec 2018 was a good time to buy!
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:55:10
How many people here wish they had bought in December 2018?
@_date: 2019-10-03 12:17:14
Buy half back now and keep the rest ready for any dips!
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:39:02
I'm gonna think about selling some in 2020 2024 2028 2032! Maybe 20% each time and put it into other assets!
@_date: 2019-10-07 08:08:28
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:58:38
Up 200% in 6 months and then dips 10% in a day! Look at the 1 day charts and buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:34:08
Wish I did but I'm in a very nice profit now after 2 years of buying the dips.
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:55:37
Buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-10-03 12:19:00
I sent to coinbase pro and then onto my segwit wallet!
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:34:32
I bought a few thousand in 2011 and there still in cold storage now! I might sell some and buy a island somewhere hot! I also bought December 2017 aswell lol
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:23:25
Every new high is gonna bring sell offs!
@_date: 2019-02-12 23:03:27
How did you work that out? 
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:07:00
Definitely not! Buy some every week or month! Average your buy in.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:49:28
You should of bought more!
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:10:40
Segwit is great! Use a different block explorer. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:54:25
Bitcoin is a global currency and 20 million a day is nothing! Daily trading volume is in the billions!
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:28:15
Very unlikely to see a 8k bitcoin or less in 2020! Every year that goes by, more people are buying bitcoin and holding it for future gains!
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:02:03
How did I pussy out? I bought every month since October 2017 and now I'm up! I bought on the 5th December 2018 at 7:50pm just checked lol
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:14:33
Try  
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:06:57
Silk road!
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:23:58
I hope a lot of people take notice of this!
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:56:53
Looks like I'm part of the 6% then! 
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:10:04
TRUST NO ONE!
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:26:52
More cheap Bitcoins! Thanks weak hands :)
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:17:00
This should work! I got this answer with a simple search on Google.
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:37:22
I've bought plenty Bitcoin's, but I've never used to buy anything! 
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:16:10
I didn't sell and I'm still buying! I'm either smart or a idiot! Time will tell. 
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:41:22
Keep stacking them sats!
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:30:35
A store of wealth and a currency!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:54:25
Buy the dip or live long enough to regret it!
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:27:25
I'm sure it will be fine!
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:51:23
20% is likely and 40% highly unlikely! Plenty people might be tempted to take profits!
@_date: 2019-02-02 08:49:44
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:48:02
Not your keys? 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:18:30
Roger Ver is a scammer and he's bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:27:07
I'm holding! I don't fancy buying back later for more! Will buy the dips!
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:10:49
Sorry I would just be guessing
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:14:10
Maybe depends on how busy the network is! Double check the recieve address
@_date: 2019-02-25 10:31:44
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:57:48
I break even at 10k!
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:19:30
Bought the dip!
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:18:51
Are you sending to a scammer?
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:12:24
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:08:15
Same been filling my boots! 
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:45:42
Shake out them weak hands!
@_date: 2019-12-29 17:47:53
Very good chance this is the bottom now! This is based on research and my own feeling.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:15:20
Is that Leonardo Dicaprio?
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:30:12
Chances of getting whatever back is slim and can you afford to lose 0.5 btc?
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:02:21
I'm torn between wanting 4k or 6k plus! 
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:54:25
fear, uncertainty and doubt
@_date: 2019-12-13 10:41:52
keep stacking sats DCA.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:11:17
Monthly Sunday morning! 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:48:45
I'm working on a DCA over the last 2 years and haven't sold even one sat. 
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:31:27
I'm also buying!
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:10:51
Not your bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:04:46
Better to have a horse in the race! Why not buy 0.5 of a bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:22:55
No use case for it! Which I think is highly unlikely! Its gonna be for new investors a great store of value.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:26:48
Not recommended! Not your keys not your bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:12:06
I'm gonna stick to DCA and sell at 1 million!
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:01:32
What a ride for you!
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:37:03
I'm buying now
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:28:55
Gutted, hopefully I won't miss 100k. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:55:29
December 2018 was the time to buy! 
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:31:26
I bought in December 2017 and I'm still here holding strong!
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:42:33
I use a old laptop and Electrum to store my keys!
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:59:17
I'm holding long term!
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:28:08
Same here! I also bought in December 2018 to even out my buy in price. Now I'm buying abit each month. I bet you wish you sold now lol
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:36:50
Yes this could be the start of the bullrun! 
@_date: 2019-04-27 14:03:31
Good afternoon!
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:58:38
The FUD is coming! Will you fall for it?
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:30:58
When 20k?
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:43:22
I'm guessing a small dump coming soon! Hopefully just before pay day!
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:01:51
What are the loan terms?
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:08:40
I agree don't follow the crowd!
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:48:39
Yes ignore the FUD!
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:02:02
I've been buying every month for 2 years and will continue to do so! Your friends will soon be coming to you, asking how to buy this Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:33:00
Send back to coinbase when ready to sell. It's much more than a pen drive!
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:00:44
1 trillion has a nice ring to it! Hopefully by the year 2140! 
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:55:51
Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:21:30
Do it and hold your keys in a hardware wallet. Think long term like 3-5 years+
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:16:21
Why is everyone so short sighted? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:37:22
Surely people can't be this stupid! 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:43:32
This makes great sense and I've been buying from coinbase pro and sending my coins to my hardware wallet for over a year now and will continue to do so. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:35:47
Nearly a million likes on Facebook and 270,000 subs on Youtube. This guy has a large following in the UK.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:33:52
I will just buy more. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:59:57
They will be the new 1%! Most will probably sell their bitcoins as the price increases over the next 5 to 20 years! 
@_date: 2018-11-06 23:12:11
It's a good idea to test your seed before sending big amounts aswell! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:49:21
This is great for buyers! :)
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:59:40
Yes. Just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:42:18
We are talking about maybe some more Bitcoin buyers/users not over throwing a government! Not sure what your getting at! 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:18:00
Good luck. See you at 1 million a Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:20:11
And the low price is doing wonders for my average buy in price! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:53:16
Do love my cheap coins! Roll on a full Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:54:40
I'm buying and so is my friend! 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:27:28
Very true. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:22:13
This dip makes no sense! What happened since summer last year? More tech, more users, a more secure network! Makes no sense to me! 
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:48:17
I keep buying and haven't sold any. Will thank myself later :) 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:15:36
All very good reason for Bitcoin to have valve but no one knows where the price will go! 
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:37:41
Let's hope they don't HODL! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:21:42
Good man! Don't over invest and I'll see you on the other side lol 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:10:19
If that million Bitcoin is accessed now or in the future it could be very bad for Bitcoin! Till then class it as lost. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:14:00
I'm not selling for any reason and I hope Bitcoin falls more because I will be buying much more! 
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:28:26
Surely everyone selling now are selling at a loss! unless they bought before Aug 2017 or are miners!
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:11:42
I'm hodling till Bitcoin goes to a million or zero. That money is gone now and I will get on with life and make more money to invest more at a later date. Think long term 5 years plus. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:54:01
Adoption is taking off!
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:55:27
Good idea! I've been doing the same with my wages each month from janurary. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:07:02
Positive thoughts people! Lots of work is happening behind the scenes. :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:19:25
If you can't find a job, make one! 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:06:18
A full Bitcoin seems do able now! 
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:59:19
Holders on the rise!
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:58:56
God knows I just keep buying little and often.
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:31:00
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:46:08
American? I'm just stating facts and figures! Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:27:53
I hope the little man is buying then! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:50:12
So who is buying? I'm still here buying the dips.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:19:46
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:28:32
This is good news... Bitcoin doesn't need this shit!
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:15:25
That will always be the case!
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:27:32
I think only a small percentage get Bitcoin! Open your eyes and see the bigger picture! 
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:23:18
Yep not out of the bearish market yet! 
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:39:04
Hopefully a lot of people learnt how to be their own bank! 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:33:22
Lol yes don't listen to me Bitcoin is dead! 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:06:46
Just read the comments on here and it's obvious! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:32:37
Absolute Nonsense and should be ignored! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:46:49
I don't get the hate for your comment! Your right no one knows! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:18:54
I'm only buying small amounts weekly! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:38:38
Average your buy in! 
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:38:22
Fuck Roger ver and Btrash.  
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:25:30
Bitcoin holder and altcoin trader.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:03:37
Bitcoin will continue to grow and maybe the price will reflect that in the future! 
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:43:34
Yes 6 zeros with a 1 in front of them! 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:07:46
I don't keep my Bitcoin on exchanges only my alts. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:08:14
Could you give a example of this please?
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:06:41
7k is cheap if you believe in the bigger picture!
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:40:56
I did buy that dip but it could drop further I guess! Some good news might bump it aswell! 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:55:24
So true! 
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:31:47
300k within 5 years! 
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:14:50
I'm gonna stick to DCA for the next year or so! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:53:23
Good man! Funny thing is I was happy buying Bitcoin at 6k so now is abit of a bargain and will average down my buy in! 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:16:26
NOT YOUR KEYS... NOT YOUR BITCOIN! download a wallet now and take control! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:26:04
Workout what your good at and sell it! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:13:01
No one knows! 
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:38:04
My Bitcoin is worth 1 million USD! Now I have to hold and wait for someone willing to pay that. I could be waiting a while lol 
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:00:24
Short term maybe not! Long term there is a good chance of a very good profit! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:47:49
I won't I'm thinking long term! I still have the Bitcoin I bought mid 2017 
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:21:08
More cheap bitcoin for me!
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:29:10
That won't be many and why didn't they sell sooner? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:28:47
Amazing and bullish! 
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:56:37
If they are over investing thinking they'll get rich when in fact it's just gambling. but if they buy a small amount each and sending it to each other they might learn something! 
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:01:10
OK guys, I'm calling this the bottom! Time to load up!
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:14:58
Bullish! 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:04:56
I think no one knows and I'm gonna continue to buy!
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:19:11
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:23:10
Disgusting scammer. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:00:24
Am I the only one buying?
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:24:35
Sell now and buy back later for a much higher price! 
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:39:44
If your new to Bitcoin why not buy a little and play around with it! Maybe get a friend or family member involved too! 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:38:15
Hold long term. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:24:37
Nice bull run just after you sell! Lol
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:00:51
Are you ok?
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:33:52
Never say never.
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:36:03
Most people keep their bitcoin on exchanges! So maybe just maybe they're exchange addresses which hold thousands of peoples bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:11:44
Still hodling and I have been buying £50 a week for last 8 months and i'm 20% down overall.
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:15:00
It's a r34 gtr if that's helps! I can't drive it anywhere without kids as young as 6 asking me to rev the engine for them!
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:56:00
How is it not? I'm here to learn from the master!
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:45:57
There a good chance the price of Gold will go down if that much is sold off!
@_date: 2018-07-09 10:57:57
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:10:17
Buy the dips
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:37:37
Data recovery?
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:36:03
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:58:33
Big fan of Bittrex for the last 2 years!
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:26:08
How are these asset valued? Do they continue to go up in value has more money is printed? Maybe we should compare these asset with other assets for a better idea of there true value! What do you think bitcoin should be valued at?
@_date: 2019-09-12 10:47:42
Priced in they bought a long time ago!
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:18:19
Time to go all in! No risk no reward!
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:01:55
Should I sell some bitcoin to finish the car I'm building? Parts are getting rare!
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:01:42
Maybe a small mining fee
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:53:01
Thanks for a answer. Sounds risky to me! 
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:18:53
Buy Bitcoin now and hold long term 3+ years!
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:32:22
Electrum means your keys your Bitcoin. Is it worth transferring from coinbase I don't know! 
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:10:23
I think selling any bitcoin between now and halvening I will regret it lol
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:58:57
Hopefully sooner 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:11:03
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:39:17
Cheers for the reply! Over in the UK a car is classed as a wasting asset which means it tends to go down in value not up! But their are a few classics which do go up in value. Otherwise I wouldn't entertain selling bitcoin and using the money on a car unless I view it as a asset which would give me a good return on my investment! Good luck man.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:08:34
Between $32 and 100k!
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:33:33
99.9% regret not buying Bitcoin sooner! 
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:17:24
Bitcoin is sound money! Fiat is not. Not your keys not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:06:37
I bought the dip and will continue to do so for years to come! The price doesn't bother me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:38:55
Keep buying!
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:49:18
Bull run starts at 10k! 
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:52:53
Send him to coinbase website.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:01:12
What about using handheld label maker printer?
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:32:49
I think hyperinflation is a long time of yet! 20 - 50 years maybe! But what do I know it's only my opinion base on what little I know.
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:02:00
Stacking sats
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:55:20
Extreme greed to buy more!
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:29:40
Bought the dip again!
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:07:42
Cheers I am looking after it and was tempted to sell it for bitcoin at one point! but gonna wait till its 25 years old instead!
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:15:43
People are stupid! They will learn!
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:07:40
High risk, high reward!
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:54:04
Yes you should! 
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:21:00
Maybe I should wait for 5500k! lolol
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:00:17
What's with the Vertcoin logo lol 
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:23:04
Thanks. I'm gonna continue with this strategy till bitcoin gets too expensive to buy lol I also have a 70/30 split between Bitcoin and my favorite alts but im working to drop that down to 80% by the end of the year!
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:00:59
That's how the USD will look against Bitcoin soon!
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:36:29
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:13:11
Only so much bitcoin to go around! Buy and hold off an exchange!
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:28:39
That's from 1994 but the hosts sound like they do today when talking about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-07-21 15:23:30
Maybe litecoin!
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:54:14
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:40:54
If you believe in the tech just keep buying small amounts every week or whatever!
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:26:27
Who's selling at this point? Miners? Surely everyone else would of sold weeks ago if they was going too!
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:22:57
Bitcoin doesn't care what I think!
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:19:23
You sound like a dick and clearly don't know me.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:15:02
He's full of shit. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:22:16
Relax and yes it could go lower but lots of things are happening behind the scenes! Keep your Bitcoin safe. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:34:03
Most people are waiting to see how binance handle it!
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:01:52
But i don't keep any Bitcoin on exchanges! I buy and then move it to my hardware wallet straight away.
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:07:26
I started buying in October 2017 and I'm still buying today. I've not sold even one single Satoshi and I plan on not doing for many years!
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:16:38
Shitpost. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:53:17
Wait for pump then dump!
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:05:52
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:58:08
Good advice.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:40:03
In this day and age you have to fact check everything you read lol 
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:22:38
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:04:14
Because you bought at $10 and would be stupidly rich! 
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:18:12
30k and 1 trillion usd total market cap!
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:45:25
I'm talking about sods law! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:51:05
They just don't get it :)
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:14:56
Same here. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:07:08
I bought in December 2017 not sold any and bought more every month since and will continue to do so! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:13:50
I use a new address every time I send Bitcoin to my wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:27:54
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:23:21
They're off
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:09:56
195 according to Google!
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:15:07
^ also wise man! 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:50:09
My guess too might see it pick up in early next year! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:34:31
Good attitude to have. No one's knows where the price will go but I won't be betting against Bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:49:10
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:18:04
Check out the 1 day chart for the bigger picture!! It could be a trap! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:36:27
Why not sell last December then?
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:04:27
Welcome to Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:55:31
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger! Reach for them stars lol 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:21:14
Guess I will buy them all then and then play with myself on the exchanges lol 
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:24:02
Don't trust anyone with your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:42:27
Yes I would... money at the ready. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:06:50
Good will buy more 
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:37:54
Buy on coinbase then go on coinbase pro and deposit your btc there from coinbase. Then send your btc with no fees! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:21:15
The network effect.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:11:59
It could be good! We'll have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:33:31
Fasten your seat belts!
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:36:09
Calm down who knows where it will go! Could go to zero or the moon or anywhere inbetween :) 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:02:46
Don't quit try and get your coins back. We could be talking a lot of money one day. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:53:23
Dollar cost average! The market could turn around at any time! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:56:35
Remember people Bitcoin has valve because we give it valve.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:13:28
^ wise man!
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:37:27
You could be right! 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:44:07
No it's not! Plenty games are being played. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:27:37
Maybe if it reaches a million or 2! I'm thinking 2024 or 2028 till then I'm gonna keep buying every month!
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:03:40
Legend. Keep it safe. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:12:12
Madness to sell now! 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:26:51
I'm gonna be positive and say 5k :) 
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:38:38
Take your coins off exchanges!
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:06:37
We all valve Bitcoin differently! A lot of people want cheap Bitcoin so they can sell it back you later for a higher price. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:06:16
Welcome to Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:20:22
Hopefully didn't lol
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:47:49
1 million USD. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:27:03
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:50:17
I'm buying more Bitcoin, are you? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:58:45
Was fun while it lasted! 
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:11:41
I'm being positive is that ok with you?
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:39:11
Bitcoin will rise again! 
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:43:00
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:37:53
Dormant for over 4 years. Probably just a exchange moving coins! 
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:13:44
Admiral Ackbar says it is!
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:50:46
Coinbase has transformed *856000 Bitcoins* into 107 wallet addresses with a balance of 8000 *BTC* in each for some reason!

I'm thinking I will run one too! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:20:08
Nice one. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:26:21
Why are you here then? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:58:38
Thanks to all the panic sellers! I do love me some cheap Bitcoin.

Install a fresh copy of windows 10 on a computer which is not online. On a different computer download electrum and verify its signature. Copy electrum to USB drive and move electrum to your fresh install of windows. Create a new wallet and write down the 12 word seed. Open notepad and copy paste the receive address. Save it the USB and then remove USB drive. Now format the hdd with the fresh copy of windows 10. This should be safe and you can now send bitcoin to your recieve address!

I don't think so! 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:32:08
Can we all agree that Bitcoin is worth 1 million and don't sell it for anything less! That would be great lol 
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:54:35
Not your keys, Not your Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:22:36
Yes and i went back and bought 21 million Bitcoin but for some reason it's worthless in the future! 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:30:15
People feeling more confidence about Bitcoin and maybe the bottom has been reached!!

Well done and hope your future is a great one. :)
Ignore the haters.

I've just bought some Bitcoin, so now the price will crash!
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:17:17
This guy is a IDIOT. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:50:56
Good guess! 
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:55:09
Use Electrum or a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:57:26
Some shitcoins can make you alot of Bitcoin! Very risky though!
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:52:07
Wallet at the ready lol
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:21:44
They would be crazy to sell now and not last year at 20k! 
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:10:47
It's ok I'll wait lol 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:55:03
I'm hoping to hit my target soon and like you will continue to use Bitcoin to pay for things where I can!
