You see it as undervalued then any value is technically a good value to buy at. Sure it may be unfortunate that it dipped a little after you bought, same thing happened with me, but use it as an opportunity to average down. I'm gonna buy some when my paycheck comes through in the next 20 mins. Stack them sats while they're cheap :)

Just as soon as it has a 'bitcoin accepted' sticker on the bumper;)

Ya u just need to no not 2 sell ur btc and hold it and make sure u dont buy alts wen they near top or just buy btc n hold !
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:04:51
I'd be disappointed if you can't buy with btc.

I imagine the same applies in lower denominations.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:09:10
Highly hypothetical but if EVERYONE holds then the price is technically infinite, or zero, depends which way you look at it. It's really based on the price in which people are willing to part with their btc at that point.. if nobody or very little people do and it still has demand then the moon is just the starting point.

Half of my weekly paycheck goes straight into bitcoin and throughout the week I often top it up a little more, especially if there's a dip. Sometimes throwing in the odd ETH or LTC buy if I'm feeling it. I just make sure I keep a little FIAT for every day needs and paying rent, haven't had to dip into any crypto thus far. Hodling strong.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:46:12
If you want to see it that way, I just helped with the adoption of bitcoin in the long run. You're welcome.
Fyi: I replaced that '$300' for $90 that same week;)

12.5 to 6.25. Also it isn't definitive that it will cause a higher price, only assumed.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:16:37
My plan is to ride the wave and hopefully catch a dip at some point
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:26:05
Hahaha yeah I spent some of mine before it started to moon and it's a little depressing seeing what I missed out on now but good fun nonetheless!

Spend the $30, it'll be the best and worst decision of your life in a few years.
Best because it'll be worth $6000 (or you'll get to see John McAfee eat his own dick)
Worst because you will wish you had invested more.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:05:58
I would recommend just buying in average amounts starting up rather than trying to time a dip because it won't always go to plan. I've been buying in small chunks of around 0.05 - 0.1btc since the price was at $2500 and all is going well. I've stopped buying now though as I am happy with the amount I have, but if there's a drop in the future I'll definitely take it as an opportunity to pick up some more.
But just ask yourself how much you think it will rise and how much you believe it is going to be the future. 
If you want to get in big and hodl to the end, don't hodl back. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:38:12
I did spend 0.029 on a Ledger.. so I can buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:46:38
I've been on Reddit for longer than a month but forgot my old account details so made a new one for bitcoin. Anyway if this is legit it's a nice thing that you're doing! I'll check your page out.

If anything is monopoly money it's FIAT my friend. It's just adopted by a wide enough audience to seem like something more. But really you just have a number of IOU's on paper. 
People *will* understand bitcoin because that's the way the world is heading, a more technological era. Those who don't will use sites such as coinbase which simplify it for newbies, I'm sure.
I don't even know why I'm replying to an obvious troll but just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:32:30
Because you wouldn't lose it. Bitcoins going to the moon!
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:44:17
Or maybe by then nobody will be stupid enough to cash it out to fiat and we'll technically hit the $∞ mark
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:27:09
My judgement would be that the second best place is as close to the calm, shallow region as possible. But whatever floats your boat.

Bitcoin is volatile my man, $50-200 price fluctuations are an every day thing and almost anyone could 'call' them with a stroke of luck.

I got my Aunty into it early 2018 when the price was ~$9.3k, she's seen her $350 investment plunge right down to the $150 mark and climb back up steadily. It was only recently actually she mentioned that she's in the green with it so it's good to know she's keeping up. I've talked to my best friend of 12 years about it countless times and his response is usually along the lines of "I don't have money for it", but he can afford to go out for drinks twice a week and rinse his liver.. Oh well, whatever floats your boat I guess. Yes i've mentioned DCA many times but he just shrugs it off. My girlfriend has no interest in it but she's happy that it keeps me happy. I can't say I haven't tried but it's really quite difficult to open people up to the wonderful world of crypto, I think it's something they have to do themselves.. maybe if I just give them some kind of incentive..
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:53:50
You forgot [one]( important thing.
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:44:35
If you day trade then sure but for the most part I've bought and held since early-mid 2017 and I'm well in the green, not to mention the added motivation behind saving. I can't really fault his answer, nor can I compare bitcoin to a lottery ticket. But each to their own.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:57:12

@_date: 2019-08-12 17:57:15
Your math is a little off, 10,000 btc is just under $114m. I do believe this transaction played a vital role in bitcoin adoption though.

Not to demote the usage of hardware wallets, I own two myself, but I think using one is a bit excessive for a $100 investment, I'd say $500+ it is definitely recommended but $100 would be fine on a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:19:05
Damn! I thought I messed up paying 0.029BTC for my Ledger Nano S a year or so a go. This makes me feel a lot better.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:11:52
Bought my first 0.1btc in 2016 at ~$500 a coin, picked up more early 2017 and accumulated a little. I did sell quite a lot for fiat on the way up which I'm somewhat glad about because I bought back in at the $4000-$4500 range in 2018 therefore maximising my profits, or minimising my losses rather, but I've held ever since. It's completely changed the way I look at money, I used to find it close to impossible to save up but bitcoin made it sooo much easier and actually very enjoyable. I look forward to my paycheck each week to buy more bitcoin as I know it will see me well in my future. These days I both enjoy seeing the price rise and drop, there's no better feeling than picking up some of that sweet sweet btc at lower prices.. apart from maybe seeing those tasty gains. I am invested in bitcoin for other reasons but I thought I'd keep it on topic.

My bitcoin wallet is my saving method, half my weekly wage goes straight into it and doesn't come back out. Just as long as I have my Ledger and my 24 words safe then the biggest risk would be favoring a heavily inflated currency thats guaranteed to lose value each year over a decentralized, deflationary currency that doubles value per year on a long term average.

If the amount of BTC you intend to gift is substantial enough then I'd recommend including a hardware wallet and a quick guide on how to set it up and use it. If not then just show them the ins and outs of a nice mobile wallet of your preference and the importance of backing up the seed and what not. It will be a lot more practical than a paper wallet as they will actually be able to use it properly.

Well that's unusual, considering the average transaction time is 10 minutes, and that's without any delays. I know that Mycelium shows the added balance before it's actually been confirmed.. but if you're sure then lucky you.

Exchanges, especially at this point of time, are the least reliable place to be keeping your money. Coinbase holds your private keys, not you, so you just have an IOU essentially.
Put the majority of your bitcoin on your own wallet which you control the keys to. This is important.
But look into Xapo and TenX. These are a couple that I've heard of that allow you to use a debit card which will instantly take the funds out of your BTC balance.  Xapo will actually give you the exchange rate at the time of purchase which is good. But be aware that for safety reasons, Xapo holds the private keys of its userbase. So only transfer a fraction of the amount of BTC you have into your Xapo account for spending. But keep the majority somewhere where you own the private keys. These are just my recommendations but you may have your own preferences. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:55:21
Create a backup of your HD wallet and write down the 12 word master seed that is produced on some pen and paper. This can be used to restore the wallets private key so this is essentially your private key. The private key is all you need to gain access to the BTC in the wallet. You can also encrypt your wallet with a pin for added security. But to answer your question, no you won't lose any coins from your wallet on August the 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:44:58

There's not always gonna be someone to hold your hand. Sure Reddit is all about sharing knowledge but some things are better done yourself and as stated, you have the internet right here with an almost infinite amount of information. Anyway, what he's saying is just keep gambling until the unlikely event that you earn a fuck ton of BTC from your small amount. I don't think that's appropriate or at all relevant to your question so I'll suggest something else.. HODL. Whenever you have a spare few bucks just invest it in more BTC. Don't overinvest and blow all of your cash on BTC, just do it this way to start out and you'll maintain a fairly average price. Your bits will be worth a lot more some day :)
