I am starting to become more and more convinced to your argumentation.  After watching my bitcoind traffic for several days, I see that the incoming connections are practically non-existent.  Perhaps it is a better idea to act as bridge between Tor and Bitcoin, as you said.  I will try it and see what happens. 
There isn't much documentation on how to configure bitcoind to use Tor.  The best I could find is the official manual:
and experimentation.

I got just 8 outgoing connections.  
Now my node is listening both to clearnet and Tor incomming connections,
you can check that it works by typing something similar to:
bitcoind  -onion=127.0.0.1:9050 -connect=3crtkleibhn6qak4.onion:14135,
My Tor-Bitcoin node's score is around 10 and I haven't seen anyone connect to it so far (in 24h).

What I also discovered while playing with my setup is that if you run:


and have a simple tor bridge listening on port 9050, you can accept incoming connections even when sitting behind a firewall that doesn't forward any ports in.  That is sweet!  Of course, a node that want to connect to you has to understand tor, which is not that common, I suppose.

I considered two options: first I run a tor exit node and a bitcoin node that listens only to incoming connections via Tor.  I found it interesting and this is how the server is configured already.  Second option is to be a Tor bridge and run bitcoind that listens to both Tor and IPv4.  If I am forced to reconsider my choice of running a tor exit node, I will definitely have a bitcoind act as a bridge between Tor and clearnet, as you described.
I don't think it is wise to mix the two set-ups, if I wanted to stay truly anonymous, am I right? 
The fact is that I want to contribute to both networks: Tor and Bitcoin, but I have only one spare machine...

Why would other nodes reject or ignore the .onion address that my node advertise itself with?
That document on github about Tor and Bitcoin clearly says otherwise:

I didn't think about it that way.  That's very interesting, thank you.
So what do you think is a better configuration in this case, where I intend to run a bitcoin node as HS?
I thought that running an HS and a exit relay exposes you primarily, when someone notices e.g that both servers go down at the same time.

Thanks for reminding me of that.

This post is really just me talking to myself, but I put it for reference:
After two days of running bitcoind 0.9.2.1 behind an .onion address (accepts incoming connection only through Tor, connects through Tor socket to any node), I have more than 50 incoming connections and mode than 4G of traffic (much more out than in).
So the setup works beautifully, and all this just on my old Celeron laptop and LTE connection.  It proves, what I've suspected already, that running a Bitcoin full node is not that resource intensive as they say.

I've recently set up a full bitcoin node on my old laptop at home and it works like a charm.  Moreover, I put my node in Tor network as a Tor hidden service.  That way it stays anonymous and what is really sweet, I can sit behind a restrictive firewall of my ISP that doesn't forward any ports in and still be able to accept incoming connections!  
Here is the original post:
I think modifying your script so as to launch a bitcoind node in Tor network would be really easy provided you have tor daemon running.

I should have mentioned that the whole traffic goes first through a VPN, which I moderately trust, so the relay's IP is of course not my home address. Do you think it is a kind of protection against problems you mentioned or is it just a false hope?

My set up works fine by now.  I'm receiving incoming connections from other nodes (currently 9) after just an hour since last boot.  I recommend to initially add a large number of tor/clearnet nodes by 


that speeds up the initial bootstrap a lot.
I have also decided to go for a little more anonymity and changed my node's .onion address, so now there is only tor relay at 3crtkleibhn6qak4.onion.
