will you take 0.01/mo? might need to have it shipped to Argentina
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:51:36
Damn that sucks. But well they can't charge us more than that because of the exchange rate, if they were to lets say, charge us 200usd, no one in their right mind would pay that

Come to Argentina, we have shitty internet (30mb, 100mb tops) and EVERYONE and be bribed. No, im not kidding, one dollar equals to 12 pesos, if you bribe someone in USD, you will have every fucking person in your pocket in a few weeks.

I actually read a lot. Although English is not my first language, hence I read books in my country's language.

Why Do You Write Like This. Are You A TeenAger?!

How so? U guys got shitty internet aswell? Our 30mb/100mb service is pretty expensive though, its like 800 pesos, or 100 usd/mo. (800 pesos is A LOT here) the norm usually is 10mb

Depends on where you live and how far you wanted to travel.
I assumed two Europe trips of about 6-8k each, per year, a decent car, gas, food, eating out twice a week and just living life without many restrictions (plus paying for education)

Are you in BA right now? we can go out some time, i can show you around.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:14:31
TIL, I've never done it so I budgeted as I usually do lol

Its enough to say "I'll buy a house, invest 250k, and use 250k to live frugaly for two or three years while studying and doing some traveling"

You basically just need a 10MB+ internet connection, and a rig calculating 500mb of ram for each of the Lineage 2 processes, GTX960 for your VGA (you can get by with an AMD7770 but open as many as 20 clients only, after that it's a bit too much for the card), and a good processor, which one is really up to you, a Ryzen 5 1600x is about 250usd and that will be good enough for up to 30 clients or so.
Then it's a matter of paying for the monthly fee to use the bot, plus a program that lets you open more than 3 clients on retail. That's 20 for the bot and 15 for the program.
Getting the 30 accounts to level 95 just takes a week with a script I use from a russian guy, he charges $7 to let you use it, and then it expires (it authenticates with his PC if he doesnt whitelist you it doesn't work). And it's literally 10 minutes to change some settings, and then 1 click per account to start botting.
Once you get to 95 you get them to a specific area and just bot away
(I answered someone in my PMs with that)

You bet, you can, with an investment of around 800 bucks, open up about 25 Lineage 2 clients, bot all 25 clients, and average an income of 2bill/day, which sells for 16-20 bucks.
480 bucks a month for basically just setting up the bot and forgetting about it is not that bad (-$40 for the bot -$40 for electricity)

eh...yeah you actually should. People are retarded here, tech savy people can get an upper hand in everything here.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:06:44
oh so that's really cool, more money for the same effort huh.
Do you know any "calculator" or something to calculate devcoin, ixcoins and namecoins amount per gh/s? thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:51:17
I know its not, but people buy it...
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:59:05
Isnt the 2.2gh/s already used for hashing bitcoin blocks? does it divide the amount of hashing per second or what?
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:05:17
I don't expect to get my money back soon, I expect to get into this with at least 2.2gh/s and expand into, idk, 10 gh/s with 3 or 4 more usbs, and then buy the Butterfly Labs 600gh/s card as soon as it has a release date.
Alright so luck based, that changes things.. but yeah I was expecting to make 0.002 BTC per day already. I don't expect to break even, just testing the stuff out, also, BTC are really expensive where I live (you can sell them for 560-570 USD) so im expecting to make some money off the mining, and then resell the usb (the same usb I bought for 100 bucks, can be sold for 250 bucks), and as soon as im able to buy the 600gh/s card i'll start "serious" mining.

Hm, and you know that, by living in Argentina...right? I live here, I know how the market is. Our "ebay" (its not called ebay, ofc, but I think they bought the company a few years back) has bitcoin prices and asic miners way higher than normal ebay (Importing stuff has a +20% tax that's why prices are higher, and there's a separate marker for buying USD which makes everything that comes from outside of Argentina way more expensive, I don't pay the 20% because i'll trave to the states and bring it myself saying its used, they don't tax used stuff if they are below 400usd or so, its a retarded law, but meh)
In said website: A 2.2gh/s miner is worth ARS 1600, that is approximately 240bucks. I'm buying it for 100 bucks, that's approximately 650 pesos or so. So i'll have a 1000 ARS net gain (lets say 850 since it'll be listed as used)
Also, you can sell bitcoins in there, they go for approximately ARS 4000-4500, that's 560-600 USD. And people buy them. (People hardly buy stuff the "official way" because they rather trust a physical person they can meet and do the transaction)
Thing is, its hard to come by USD here to buy stuff, that's why there's not a shitton people doing bitcoin mining, but I came by a few houndred, and since i'll be going to Miami, cha chinnnnnnnng.

Thanks for the BFL scammer thing, i'll see other kind of mining rigs then. I'll get more into it, ofc I wont buy one now! thanks
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:58:11
What do you mean by luck? isn't it a steady thing? it seems pretty straightforward, aside from the difficulty variation.
