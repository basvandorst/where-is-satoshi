Hello, talking as r/france.
Initially we didn't want to destroy any logo of bitcoin or anywhere. Example [here]( and [there](  
However we noticed that you guys went overboard on some orange scare, with numbers and such. You didn't contact us, so we considered that as an aggressive act.
Thus, we didn't do concessions and ignored any act of clemency from there. [Here one current plan]( Italia isn't very appreciated, the plan of moving italia on the left of our flag is an "compromise" because r/all and r/europe were all against us. We could only redirect the sheer force.
Now then, we have clear project, with the tower, megaman and clearing our flag of impurities. If Bitcoin is respecting our borders, we could even be friendly. You still have the text, however. So hopefully, you dont keep insisting on it, it would just be a waste of time as there's more than enough place on your left.
Have a good day !

We are not going further from our left border actually. Except for the Eiffel tower. Obviously we aren't going to kill our comrades lol. However, I have no idea what r/europe will do regarding the italia issue, but there's not much leveraged I think.

Open the links. You will see what was our plan. Then you guys did a massive square with numbers and such. Let's not talk about aggression please. We were first to get invaded by germany and r/all, we aren't doing the same to anyone, cause we don't wanna enemies.

Dunno what's the point.

I thought so, we might skip the letters for a bit, until the bots are gone. I don't also think that Italia might come on your orange area. They would have to do a lot of work they already did. So, I might think that you're safe for a while.
