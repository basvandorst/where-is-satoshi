Forgot to mention electron is full of security holes.

I have friends from and in Venezuela, BTC works for those who really need it and who put their efforts in it, as well as in any other country. If you haven't figured that out yet consider yourself low hanging fruit. 
Glad you made it out of the mess. 
Now download TAILS OS, and get to earning coins by trading goods on unrelated markets. It's how most real hodlrs gather coins with little to no effort.

No delays here now, just support delays at CoinCloud now.

You a noob?

Does both. Fees are high because they're based on tier levels, highest fees for those only willing to give out a phone number, up to $20k every 24hrs, with ID and all that up to $100k. Most of these machines are private owner owned and operated, so KYC etc is rendered useless as its very easy to use multiple fake IDs  and VoiP numbers making them actually great for grey area activity if you all know what i mean.

Wasabi wallet is the coolest sheep gathering tech ever. Wish i would've came up with it.
It's cheaper to clean them coins by swapping for xmr then back to coin than waiting for block chain forensic companies to break their ultra expensive fees for coinjoin.

Been waiting for 1.5hrs now.

Feels, bought cool hippy jewels and trinkets at One Love Festival directly at vendor kiosk with bitcoin. Now they are the most expensive purchases on my wall.

So another option to gyft,bitrefill, egifter, etc?

It is, I'm past 7 confs and haven't had a text, email, nor call from the operator.

You have obviously never tried open bazaar. It's so resource intensive on computers. Toppled with a wholesome army of schills and scammers, and horrible interface, and worst, horrible choice of alt coin that breaks the entire network effect.
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:52:59
Never type in absoluth less you're ready to be trolled.

I paid max fees to expedite things, usually show 1 conf and we're good to go. Not this time though. Starting to loose trust in mycellium, samurai, and blockchan.info as they are all showing different results using the same private keys.

That's by the fruity loop, those guys are awesome.

I just dropped 5k, income tax return. Looking forwards to hodlin till I'm 55, so far I'm 42k in for the run.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:18:54
Great place.
@_date: 2019-08-08 09:27:44
Didn't say hodlin?

Bought one of their gift cards thinking you can purchase any of the other gift cards they offer with their in house cards. This seems not to be the case and support seems to be bin existent so far.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:32:26
Wouldn't that be a cliff dive?
@_date: 2019-08-08 09:15:03
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:40:13
So like Purse?
@_date: 2019-08-02 07:29:07
Sounds like gyft app.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:05:05
Their servers under attack also?
Took a little toggling with 3.3.4 before it finally let me connect and move coins. 
Can we use the same seeds from electrum on another wallet?
Like xmr to monerujo seeds are compatible.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:16:18
You should have a transaction history.

$3.78 fee for .50 cent.

When you find out coinbase actually gives you the bch they made out of your btc holdings.
