Jeez you guys.... hahaha, I don't want to spend an hour typing every single detail to make a scenario which perfectly mirrors the real world we live in. You're absolutely right, but in the real world most of us here are paid in widgets (Inflationary fiat currency) and there is a transaction cost for transferring to fidgets. (Deflationary crypto currency) It makes more sense to spend the widgets for our essential and discretionary needs rather than convert to fidgets and then spend those.

You need to buy $5 worth of bread to survive. The only acceptable currencies you have are widgets and fidgets both of which are valued at $5. However, in a year you know the widgets will be worth 10% less while the fidgets will be worth 10% more. If all you had was fidgets, then yes, it is rational to spend them because you need bread to live, but since you have widgets as well it is not at all rational to do so.
Essentially you ignored the "You're better off using some other currency" part. His point was that in the presence of any traditional inflationary currency BTC does not make sense to spend, which is why people don't.

Yes... Look up in the comment chain... The present day is what we were talking about. If you want to speculate on future circumstances than that is a different discussion entirely.

Economics assumes rational, selfish actors. You may choose to sacrifice of yourself to enrich the economy, but I wouldn't expect others to decide similarly. The people who hold benefit from those who spend, but the reverse is not true.
Your second paragraph is correct, but only in the edge case situation where you are paid in BTC and your only access to fiat is through conversion. 99% of the time real world application is that people are paid in fiat, spend fiat on their essential/discretionary purchases, and then convert excess to BTC as an investment.
