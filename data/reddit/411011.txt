I have a few paper wallets printed and in my actual physical wallet. 
I get them from: 
then I will add all of them into my mycelium wallet. 
When I meet a n00b and decide i wanna give them some bitcoin, i pull out one of the paper wallets and send some coins to it. They get to see how easy it is to scan and send coins, but i tell them that they need to take this money out and put it int their own wallet since i have the keys to this wallet. Otherwise i will take it back in 30 days. This also shows them the importance of key control. Usually i end up taking it the coins back cuz people just don't care, but every once in a while, i see the funds move to new address that i don't control and then i know a new bithead is born.
