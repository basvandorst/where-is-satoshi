I expect to setup a money where the mouth is situation if we can get enough people on board where we can make it economically rational for the company to even consider it first.

i hear what your saying but i live in main street USA where grumblings of disatisfaction with big gubberment is much more common than any other mindset. In fact the last time i had a conversation with someone that was pro-tyranny it was a local politician. I've been stopped and "frisked"/interrogated randomly so many times i cant count and i am a white guy with no serious criminal record. Who are these "normal" people we needn't scare with our ideologically charged language.

I think the real reason btc will be unused in nyc is because no one will be able to use it at normal business that must obey laws.

how so?

I print mine on 24k gold plated paper so that my btc are backed by gold
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:08:06
Print on a fresh clean $1 bill because that is super material compared to any normal paper.

What im suggesting would lower risk by aggregating large units of capital at a market clearing price with a negotiation to match capital to economies of scale in a way that is profitable and recapitalizing for the business

does your sofa sidechain function without using btc as a token?
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:32:51
thanks, for the constructive comment
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:43:56
so can it function with no bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:00:43
Not what OP was going for but im fine with it as long as i get a trezor for cheaper while increasing their profitability.

Is there a way to do this using the security of the bitcoin blockchains hashing power with out using the btc token at all?

if you look at the percent of population incarcerated and shot by police, USA is easily an oppressive regime. It just seems like it is not to you the same way it doesnt seem so in north korea to the north koreans. People outside the US have a much different view and it is informed by facts and statistics.

So when you burn the btc for SideCoin is the btc truly burned or is it just locked somehow until you convert Sidecoin back to btc?
