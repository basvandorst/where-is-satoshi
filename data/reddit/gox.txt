Well, do you think this can be presented or accepted as a substitute for MtGox's liability? If that is the perception, then I'm sorry for the miscommunication on my part.
My assumption is that the money is long gone. Even if not, whatever debt MtGox has, has to be paid to the actual contract owners (account holders). I don't think you can legally enforce such a "goxcoin" scheme on the creditors anyway.
As I said, I see the idea as a fun experiment. And fail to understand what you are so worried about.

Yes I can. When I have too much money in a bank account, I begin to get worried. Especially if the account is in a country with a volatile political or economic state (I understand that westerners did not have similar worries for the last several decades; worries which would have saved Cyprus and Iceland a lot of suffering).
The only reason I don't withdraw and put them in a safe is because they will lose value in time. Instead, I only keep "excessive" fiat for the duration I have a use for it (usually some official business) and keep the rest as Bitcoin.

It is very difficult to have anything other than superficial discussions without bringing whole world-views to the table, because it's hard to communicate complicated things without context. It can be done concisely sometimes, but it's actually a rare thing.
For instance we both can certainly state our opinion that less regulation is needed when it comes to Bitcoin, but when we want to talk about how it will evolve without regulation, or why less regulation is good, or why Bitcoin is an exception, etc., there is no way we can communicate, especially over the Internet, without references to entire world views. Some people might not want to see these references stated explicitly, but I think it's just a superficial aesthetic concern, as they still have to be there implicitly.
Granted, people here are sometimes annoying, but I would rather invite people to being more polite and refrain from making assertions or downvote brigading than leaving ideologies at the door, since the latter would just be a political trick.

Redundancy is good, but keep in mind that anyone who has your seed will have access to all the money in your wallet.
Dividing the seed is the most basic solution, but do it in such a way that it would be hard to recreate the seed by collecting pieces in a single location. For more advanced methods, checking out Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is often recommended.

99% is a bit of an exaggeration. [Nearly half of Americans know that it's a digital currency]( I would suspect that much more than 2% of these people understand that it's a decentralized (e.g. no government backing) digital currency that works on the Internet, which is similar in depth to the average person's understanding of the currency they daily use.

What assets of 1 billion dollars worth can you buy that can't be reversed?
I'm all for a solution, but panicking won't get us anywhere.
Right after the conception of mining pools, the community discussed a lot about how to solve this particular problem. I had my own ideas, but after the inception of p2pool, I thought a superior solution was already available and forgot the whole thing. I think most of us ignored the social aspect of things.
At this point, I think all popular mining software should endorse a scheme where the block will be automatically generated on the client side if a running bitcoind exists. Failing that, they should at least suggest the option to generate the block on the client side by getting transactions from random "trusted" sources. I know this is not an easy engineering task, but for the lazy miner with lots of hashing power, performance loss, configuration requirements and new things to learn will be minuscule, which is what p2pool can't provide.

Although, I don't understand how he would not have knowledge of the number of coins in cold storage if we assume that the storage was not cold in the first place. The code that moves the cold-in-the-name-only storage to the hot wallet HAS TO KNOW the exact amount in storage because of how Bitcoin transactions work. You can't not have perfect knowledge of unspent transactions, otherwise you will not be able to determine which input to use.


That, I completely agree. It's surprising that we don't see many conspiracy theories about governments confiscating as many bitcoins as they can.
Sorry, I apparently misunderstood what you were saying. Yes, I agree that the actual cold wallets being irrecoverable makes a lot of sense. I actually had speculated that was the case [yesterday](


My reasoning was, if they lost the wallet, they would be legally liable. Not if they succeed in making it seem like an issue with the protocol.

Coming from zero, you can't have no volatility, without staying at zero. lifeboatz said that being "merely" 20 times more volatile is a feat. It is a feat, *because* volatility is undesirable. You could put forth an argument that explains why it could have been less volatile, but as it stands, you are attacking a non-existent argument. No one is saying that volatility is a good thing, or that Bitcoin is not volatile.
&lt;rant&gt;Also, why do most critics in this subreddit *have* to fill their post with insults each and every time? Pack your post with stuff completely unrelated to the content, and then whine about getting downvoted by zealots. A guaranteed loss of time for everyone involved...&lt;/rant&gt;

One problem is, the verify transaction still has to go into the chain; so it has to be confirmed. Otherwise you could still double-spend, though your options would be limited.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:36:41
When you create a transaction, you combine some inputs and direct the sum of those inputs to outputs. The remaining amount is the mining fee.
Since there is no concept of accounts withing Bitcoin, "money left" doesn't have a meaning, so for instance if you have a 1 BTC input, but want to send 0.7 BTC to someone, you add one more output to the transaction that directs the 0.3 BTC change to one of your own addresses.
Bitcoin clients do this automatically, and usually even hide these "change" addresses so that the user never has to deal with any of this. However, people make mistakes when they construct the transactions manually, and most of these high fee transactions are just that. Bitcoin community is usually very friendly, so there is at least some chance that you can get your money back if you find the miner who mined that block.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:33:32
The fact (or for now speculation) that MagicalTux managed to lose keys doesn't mean that it's an easy task. Even if you are not tech savvy, you would still think of making multiple copies of your paper wallets, store them in separate safe locations and try not to put all of them in one place. I think it's pretty much common sense by now.
A bit more thinking will help you make encrypted paper wallets, and maybe even divide and store the password in different locations. A bit more and you will divide the password to n shares with shamir's secret sharing scheme and even create a clever inheritance scheme.
I personally think paper wallets are a nuisance, so I just created an Electrum wallet on a disk-less net-less computer, noted down the seed, saved it in a "shared" manner (so that it is almost practically impossible to reconstruct it if you are not my legal inheritor), copied the Master Public Key, and shut down the system.
I think the problem is not that it is difficult to learn, but that it is not common sense yet. For instance dealing with paper wallets is relatively hard work, but people already have their own methods of securing pieces of paper. Securing data the same way will have to become an ordinary thing soon, and not just because of Bitcoin.

This is the single most important point, and no one seems to want to talk about it.
I am also unable to grasp the importance of the announcements about capital gains tax. In some countries, you do pay capital gains on currency as well, so the significance of these decisions really depend on the relative treatment. Furthermore, it's also obvious that your mining income is also "income".
It's puzzling to me that people seem to be surprised that the State wants to tax these.

Well, there are two factors.
First, it will be perceived as a political move against MtGox within the Foundation, which will not help with "Bitcoin's image" one bit. If it was something else, I would agree with you, but this is an entity they are a founding member of, and there is a multi-million dollar lawsuit against them going on with another founding member.
Second, acting like a teenager rarely solves anything. MtGox's PR fuck-up caused everyone the press would care about to lash out against them publicly, right before malleability began to be perceived as a real problem which painted MtGox as a victim of baseless attacks by people who want to save face for Bitcoin. What happens when you kick them out of the foundation and then it turns out that half of their problems was law enforcement? The other half will be forgotten in a day and you will have painted yourself as a fool yet again.
All in all, this is not a solution to anything.

@_date: 2014-02-25 14:20:18
I think the general idea is to not need centralized regulation either by having a technological solution to a threat that doesn't require individual authority (covers most of the case about MtGox) or distributing the trusted authorities (in other words, giving the choice of who to trust to people). No enforcement takes place, which means you can be stupid and face its consequences.
However, that's not the real punchline. Norms of the community determine how things evolve, so to me the question is not how you can constrain people into behaving in a particular way (which admittedly is a way to solve problems, if you don't see the constraint itself as a problem), but what will make us get to a point where we have proper behavioral norms and tech so that newcomers will not be so vulnerable.
In the case of high-frequency exchanges for instance, there are two positive paths I can think of. Either we find a way to do it without having to trust any individual entity, or we just decide to move on and begin developing solutions that don't require such exchanges. I think either of these will make it possible to continue without any sort of enforcement.
This doesn't mean we can't fail to advance though. I think we are already too slow in generating solutions.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:02:54
To my knowledge, no. Not visibly anyway. This thing attracts freedom geeks all around the world, so it would really take a very ingenuous method to influence the code without raising any suspicion.
I don't think such infiltration attempts happen in real life, because it requires a very rare sort of agent to pull off, its potential effectiveness is questionable, and it would be too dangerous to the entities involved if uncovered.
However, it's still best to have several competing implementations for both safety and health of the network and we are already moving in that direction.

You said they think that the price of Bitcoin will increase, and gathering from your explanation about the predictability of Bitcoin's price, I assume you think that's why this is a high risk investment. However in reality they are not exposed to Bitcoin's exchange rate at all, and don't benefit from price increases. It's still a high risk investment though, for countless other reasons.

I would love to get into a philosophical debate about the bias on the importance of these benefits and "necessity" of the burdens that comes with education (e.g. Americans are almost certainly not the happiest folk in the world). However, I'll assume that there is some common ground between us that can help describe a clearly bad regime, so I'll accept that part of the argument.
Regarding the need for government, we probably cannot disagree more. I think Statism and Nationalism (or Patriotism as Americans call it) will not prevail. I'm not saying this as a moral stance. They are just not the optimal solutions for human cooperation. Centralization, in every matter that involves multiple agents (be them humans or computer programs), is the first solution that comes to mind. It is how you project the will, often when there is some lack of imagination on how to accomplish the task otherwise. It is a single solution in a vast array of possible solutions. Arguments based on "history" are not very convincing if you move out of that scope and look at the 4.5 billion year old rock and some part of the slime that clings on it that's been around for quarter of a million years. State, just like God, is the most simple projection of the most primitive human.
Since I don't think there is any need for governance, at least for the likes of me, I can't appreciate what they are doing for me outside the scope of what is actually being done. I have argued here against tax evasion before, and successfully got downvoted, since it's apparently unusual for an anarchist to do so. However, I will not appreciate the need to thank them for not being explicitly oppressive. I'd agree that there may be some shame in not helping others out of oppression, but I don't think I can compare it to being proud to be part of the perceived better-off side.

Seems to be that someone got a hold of your password. Then requested 2FA removal from btc-e. You didn't challenge it, so 2FA was removed. Then the party with your password stole all your money.
From the general sound of the situation, it is very likely that your computer was compromised. However, you might have used the same password on some other site, and it might have gotten stolen that way. Your e-mail account might have been compromised as well.
If btc-e offered no way to challenge the 2FA removal request, then you could say that it's partly their fault. However, if they block the account for two weeks, then it's pretty certain that they are doing it so that you can cancel the request.

This probably doesn't apply to U.S and especially charities that work locally, but it's not uncommon for governments to turn a blind eye to charity fraud if it fits their agenda or put unnecessary pressure on politically motivated charities.
I think the best way to deal with this is full transparency. It's doable with Internet and Bitcoin and some local auditing. I'm not necessarily against auditing by a neutral State, but I don't have a specific reason to prefer them.
I agree with your general idea though. Thanks to Bitcoin100, we have a lot of charities out there that accept Bitcoin. We should promote them more regularly.

The way to go is do it in a way that an Internet connection on the customer's side is optional.
There are two things the customer needs Internet for. First, to learn the current state of their wallet, and second, to broadcast the transaction. The broadcasting can be done by the PoS machine, so it's the easiest part (the PoS can't alter the transaction once it's signed, so it's ultimately secure). There are many different ways to solve the first part though, from restricting how the wallet is structured on the customer's side to building a comm channel over the PoS system. It's not an extremely hard problem to solve, but I think it will take some time for a standard solution to emerge.
A current workaround to this problem is to use an intermediary (e.g. Coinkite or Bee debit cards) and do instant off-chain transactions.

To clarify, there are no "malicious" transactions by themselves in Bitcoin. Also, there can never be conflicting transactions in the blockchain. However, if a fast miner can build blocks quickly enough to produce a longer branch than the one being used for some time (e.g. for 6 blocks), the existing branch will be discarded in favor of the longer one, which means the fast miner could effectively cancel transactions selectively.
In the case of GBT, it really doesn't matter which transactions the miner includes. All we want is, blocks to be generated by different entities in order to decrease the probability of collusion.

I thought you were talking about problems with inclusion in a block.
What you say requires pools/miners that break the protocol for their own gain. It could happen, but I don't think there will ever be enough incentive for that. How many gasoline station double spends do you think will happen for a pool with considerable mining power to consider messing it up for everyone?
Nonetheless, if this zero-confirmation thing will become a world-wide standard, we shouldn't count on this. Obvious solutions are off-chain transactions and green addresses. There could also be off-chain insurance for ordinary transactions.

Or, maybe, just don't voluntarily trade your time for something else, if you don't think it's worth it.
Potentially, you think yourself and those like you are superior to the people who make these decisions. This is what I'd expect from any conventional contemporary leftist. The problem is not that you are not better than the people you claim to be protecting; you may very well be better. The problem is, there is no way of knowing that. Therefore, in principle we need to stop striving to make decisions on their behalf. That is why I think a laissez-faire environment is a better path to true communism.

AFAIK, the original Silk Road never betrayed their customers'  trust (customers scamming each other is a different matter though). The main problem was not trust, but single points of failure. You can circumvent that with decentralized tools, which are already becoming available. Innovation on the "trust" front is also possible with distributed dispute resolution, etc.
Besides, when you make Bitcoin illegal, the matter becomes political dissent. There are many honest and resourceful people out there who will continue doing business with Bitcoin and offer quality services. In some ways, I would actually expect better and more innovative services than what we have now in the Bitcoin space.


Depends on what you mean by meaning. In the short to medium term, it would cease to exist for the "ordinary" person. Anything can happen in the long run though. Unenforceable regulation means any financial turmoil will push some of the economy into the gray market.

If that were true, everyone would be using Freicoin right now.
You have to realize that there is no base value for bitcoin, so affordable-ness has no meaning. If you don't have a hard cap, that means the inflation will have to race with global economic growth, and the currency can very well become inflationary. Which means it will become a weaker store of value, which will depress its exchange value. As you see, I'm not talking about usability here. Even if everyone decides to use the new fork, it will not increase affordable-ness.
It's pretty much testable in practice. Do we really expect that reward dropping from 0.00000001 to 0 to actually have more impact than reward dropping 50 to 25? I don't think so. You can right now make a Bitcoin fork that keeps the block reward static forever, and see if how many people prefer that one. It's absolutely free to try.
EDIT: Just realized that my "explanation" was completely redundant. Basically, if you can exchange 2 apples with 1 bitcoin, and 1 apple with 2 forkcoins, it doesn't mean forkcoins are more affordable, since the use value of a currency is directly proportional to its purchase power.

I think we can do better than my bank or ebay or whatever.
Exchanges, please sign all your outgoing e-mail so that your clients can begin to learn how to check for authenticity. Also, give clients the option to give you encryption keys so that you can send their critical information more securely. (Remind them that they need to keep their keys secure and have backups.) Keep all of it optional.
People, please learn how to use GPG. Use tools that make it easy to check if the signature agrees with the sender's public key.

I don't know what to think about the quotes. Are you saying humanitarian aid to one particular side is bad because it upsets the natural order, or are you saying that it may be used to buy weapons?
If it is the former, then the case could be extended to the US intervention, since actively stopping it would also upset the balance. So I hope your concern is the latter.
In the Syrian case, the refugees were in a bad shape, and I contributed towards better settlements, etc. However, I have reason to believe that the aid was also used to buy weapons, and the settlements were partly used to regroup. So I share your concern. However, idly watching people suffer is also not an option.
I don't think the solution is to avoid helping, but being as vigilant as possible about how the aid is being distributed. If these donations can be used to aid suffering people from another political group, I'm not opposed to that either.
Also, as I said, the political situation in neither of these regions are insulated. There is really no "their own business" to begin with. It is unfortunate, that I would agree with.

Well, if you are asking about Swiss banks, to my humble knowledge, they differ immensely. AFAIK, most reputable Swiss banks don't open accounts to random foreigners of little net worth. Smaller private banks where you can get accounts more easily charge more than 50$ per transfer (I have seen triple that amount charged). You get a good deal if you have a good account, but then you are rich enough to not care about what they charge anyway. I have seen international transfers go through in just two days, but it has been rare in my experience.
The best deal I get is from within SEPA, where you never pay more than a couple Euro and the money gets there in a day, in theory. Of course, local transfers are also cheap and fast.
For international transfers, I have been charged from $30 to $150 both within EU and outside, depending on the amount and where the both banks are.
Some more rant:
It seems to me that what sort of deal you get depends on your status more than the effort you put in. If we are talking about "people" in general, having a bank account is a privilege by itself. Even for expats with decent permits, opening accounts can be a pain. But if you are a guy from Congo who works in South Africa to earn money to send back to your family, you lose a huge portion of it during transfer.

But does this really happen? Did MtGox track transactions and resend failed ones. It's important here to note that a rebroadcast transaction would not cause a problem, but an explicit re-send with a completely different transaction, with different inputs.

Buying and holding is just one sort of speculation. There are all sorts of speculation on Bitcoin out there, from long term short positions to unleveraged day trading. Granted, to hold any position, including a short one, you or some intermediary has to hold Bitcoin in the first place, which pumps up the exchange rate. Since any position you have is some sort of speculation (think about people like me who ordinarily use it as a store of value), "no speculation" is not a realistic option.
What I would instead prefer is diversity. When you have many different entities with statistically unrelated interests in the market, it should have a stabilizing effect.

This is not the first trouble MtGox have had. Every time the Bitcoin economy rushes to grow, we reach a limiting point where bottlenecks are identifiable. MtGox has many times been one of those things that initiated a collapse. 
I have always been positive about MtGox, even during the mess in 2011. Everything was new, the challenges were not clear, the stakes were low. But their current attitude was the final straw for me. They are keeping people's deposits hostage for more than 5 months now, and instead of acting humbly and apologetic or assuring that the deposits are safe, they go on to blame others about yet another failure.
When you get any assurance from them about the deposits they are supposed to be keeping, I will call it "being forthcoming".

Correction: Middle and upper classes of a subset of first world nations don't want a revolution. They are using stable currencies, they have relatively low corruption rates and they are relatively free (in the sense that they don't have free-er societies to compare themselves with, which can be unsettling). On top of that, they have working education systems that are more likely to produce content people.
Rest of the world, wealthy or not, we alternatingly want revolutions. We are composed of a million different minorities with dissimilar interests, content with the situation just because we know that it could be much worse. Some lucky minority with temporary grasp of power is content, and in turn others are kept content by bestowed positions and anti-American, anti-terrorist, nationalist or some other made up fear mongering rhetoric.
I'm not trying to depict the world as a hellhole, or Bitcoin as a savior. This is rather outside the context of Bitcoin. What's relevant to the debate is, most people I encounter that are not of the West automatically understand what Bitcoin is.

Small set of devs with administrative privileges. :-)
There is no guarantee of consensus in core development, or any opensource project for that matter. However, the fact that anyone just get the code and develop their version guarantees that the users have the ultimate power to decide.
Therefore, even though the development system is technically despotism (i.e. the person or people who have the authority to update the code repository have the final say), acting like a despot doesn't make any sense. It's mostly a meritocracy, where heated disputes are resolved in ingenuous ways. For instance in the BIP 16/17 debate, the developers decided on a vote by mining power, where all Bitcoin miners included a text in their block stating their opinion.

Consumers should be aware that they can protect themselves AND work with centralized institutions by not giving the control of their money to a single authority. The Bitcoin protocol supports requiring signatures of multiple entities to initiate transactions. Having these entities in different jurisdictions and demanding them to be of diverse interests (dispute resolution companies or notaries come to mind) makes collusion very improbable. You can't have a Cyprus-like crisis without a single entity deciding on your behalf.

I find it a bit paradoxical that you say a chargeback system is unnecessary and then say a system without a chargeback mechanism doesn't have value.
Besides, I don't know why you think it's convoluted. It adds negligible complexity over Bitcoin, and the structure you build on top is no more complex than the structure you have for the banking system.
In addition to all this, Bitcoin is programmable money. I don't think we even began to use Bitcoin properly. The case for Bitcoin will make more sense when there is a whole financial system built on top of this, with distributed crowdsourcing systems, autonomous robots, smart property and so on, and dispute resolution based on multiple signature schemes are a very small part of this. Check out NEOBEE and how they are implementing a bank that you can get your money out of even if it disappears in its entirety overnight.

Although you're right in your conclusion, falsifiability criterion doesn't say anything about the ability to repeat an experiment.
In this case though, there is no testable hypothesis anyway. I doubt that Krugman would call it science though. He is fully entitled to his "unscientific" opinions. I don't know why everyone's hung op on this particular person's opinion.


None of the "social science"s are simply science. The empirical part can be considered science, but they will always require an immense amount of projection and generalization in order to be applied to actual society.

Agreed, though it's an uphill battle because we are educated by the same system. Not only through centralized education, but being raised and accustomed to this sort of world.
Bitcoin already offers me something much better than second party deposit insurance, but only because I have insight into how this new system works. With the current state if the outer Bitcoin structure, people in general are not protected enough. I find it ridiculous that people still risk losing their bitcoins in order to use some service.
We need to replace centralized marketplaces with decentralized ones, and along with it, protect deposits with multi-sig schemes and distributed dispute resolution networks.
Also, all of these measures involving trust should be replaced by technology when it's available. For instance, micropayment channels can get us rid of some of the necessity of deposits. I guess we are just taking off, but I wish new services embraced these new ideas faster.

By services, you mean something like systems, or programs right?
Depends on the system you're using. With plaintext private keys, you already have the raw thing, so the fatal flaw would have to be in Bitcoin itself, which you can't recover from anyway. More sophisticated solutions could have flaws, though being paranoid isn't necessarily good for security.
Depending on what sort of offline solution you are using, you could probably preserve the same keys with different methods as well. This will create more redundancy, but keep in mind that you will be exposed to weaknesses of both in terms of security.

They are likely to go for a payment processor like BitPay or Coinbase, at least initially. These services can convert the funds partially or fully to local currency on the fly, take all the technical risk, but charge a fee for all that. If you are able to pay some costs in Bitcoin (wages, IT costs, etc.), you can reduce the amount that is directly converted to fiat.
Regarding subscriptions, to my knowledge, Coinbase supports recurring payments. Majority of Bitcoin users would never prefer unsolicited payments, so there is no such system implemented and there won't be an extra income in that sense. On the other hand, there is no possibility of chargebacks either.

Keep in mind that there are lightweight clients like Electrum, which are also very versatile.
Running a full Bitcoin node (which allows incoming connections) for long periods is indeed helpful, but it needs some dedication, and running it intermittently (e.g. just to catch up) does not contribute to the health of the network. I personally run a full node 24/7, but I don't use that instance as my wallet.


By creating value out of Bitcoin, and sharing what you discover with others. Replacing your usage of currency gradually with Bitcoin is educational and helps the economy grow, but what will really help us make leaps is finding how Bitcoin can help us do things that we ordinarily don't do.

That being said, one of my Linux systems had been compromised before through a broken ssh implementation. There is no way I will just "disinfect" a system. OS if choice doesn't matter there...

They apparently have difficulty tracking transactions that change ID. They are bullshitting about this not being their fault, but not the problem itself. It's their fault because the issue was known.
Basically, "transaction malleability" doesn't help with or cause a double spend. However, if you are a large exchange, it would make tracking transactions difficult, and if you don't take it into account, might result in all sorts of confusion.
On the other hand, they could have instead listened to warnings and did this properly, which would have saved another embarrassment for the whole community. Others are doing it right, why can't MtGox?
I have a hard time understanding their initial mistake (they could have halted trade for a day and implemented a fix long ago), but the latest release and the attempt to put the blame on the core protocol was unmistakably ugly. Shame on you, MtGox.

Bitcoin addresses contain a checksum, so it's very improbable to create a valid wrong address by mistake, or hardware flaw. A virus on the other hand, could try to generate a similar looking address, but it would consume a lot of computing power, take a lot of time, and still can't be very similar.
Another thing is, Bitcoin transactions are always spent as a whole. For instance, if you have a 40K coins sitting in an address that came from a single transaction, even if you only want to send 1000, the whole 40K transaction is consumed as an input. You can send back some of the coins (39K?) to the same address for instance, so that it will look as if you took out only 1K.
This obviously was the opposite though, since the transaction combined many other inputs into one. Why, I don't know.

Supporting dialogue almost always means getting caught up in the quarrels of other people.
Or to put it in another way, what have you done to support dialogue during the years of oppression that lead to this moment? Or what would you have done, if you were aware?
Or, what is your current plan to help both sides to chill the fuck down and solve the problem through dialogue?

Also, calling the peoples' struggle a blood feud is probably the opposite of how you need to think if you want to support dialogue.

So, why do you think it is hard to acquire bitcoins? What is the core problem about bitcoins that make them harder to acquire?


I sincerely don't get this part. Can you ask me a sample question about which part of the system you think you need to understand, but you can't?
You may be trying to understand every small technical detail. It's similar to trying to understand the whole deal, from how the actual money printing machines work to the regulatory details about the treasury.
In reality, most things become common sense in time, so you don't really feel the urge to dig deeper, even if you are inquisitive. Bitcoin is new, and is developing, so it is normal to need to get a better foothold. However, I think this is true for all new technologies.


You can implement reversible payments on an irrevocable system. You can't implement irreversible systems in a reversible system. Plenty of people want irreversible payments, and plenty of people want reversible payments. So it's a better engineering choice to have an irrevocable system if you want both solutions.


Then it's out of context. You think it's a problem, I don't. Of course I will claim that it's not a problem, and if demanded, will provide arguments to back up my claim. I've read tens of debates (some of which were mature enough) about this issue, right in this subreddit. Do you want us to close up shop and be done with it instead?


Why? I was there when the Internet was the new thing I had to convince people about. I remember being looked down on when I told people it's essential to have an Internet connection. The situation looks eerily similar to me.

Sort of. The transactions are "cleared" every 10 minutes or so, and it is possible that yours does't get included in the first block. However you don't have to wait for it to be cleared most of the time. I was never kept waiting by a merchant, but for instance Bitcoin exchanges wait for your transaction to be confirmed several times before depositing the amount in your account.
If the sender created the transaction properly (i.e. with enough fees to make sure it gets cleared rapidly), the probability of it getting removed from the transaction pool is low enough that it is not a concern for low value transactions (e.g. it's fine for a restaurant bill). The way to make sure the sender does so is a standard payment protocol that works on top of Bitcoin, which will hopefully become widespread this year.
Other methods include online Bitcoin services that make off-chain transactions (this works similar to debit cards or account-to-account transfers within a bank), and that use trusted "green" addresses.

This assumes that "society's guidance" is a meaningful term, or a type of information that can practically be attained. I don't think there is even a way to extract non-political information from the people's heads, let alone weigh them properly to form a consensus idea. In practice, it's mostly a feedback loop that goes through education and comes back as the "majority opinion".


What does make it legitimate? If I dominate you fully, you will have to behave within the constraints I impose. Can we call such behavior a societal norm? I guess so, but then it makes the definition useless for the current topic.
All in all, you think you have enough right over these people to suggest that they move to a different place, with no concern about whether there is a place that fits their criteria. I think this is still a psychological residue of the "right of conquest". Where did you get the right to dictate how others live? This seems to be the core issue here.

Not the ultimate solution, but the next step could be using the payment protocol to communicate some signed data to the hardware wallet, along with the rest of the payment information, so that the payer can see what he is paying for on an uncompromised computer before confirming.

A considerable portion of my family's expenses are made in Bitcoin (unfortunately not because I can pay groceries with it, but mostly because we can buy toys for the kids, electronics for me and clothing for anyone, especially the wife), and some part is made by cards purchased with Bitcoin (groceries, etc.).


If you are long in Bitcoin, it makes sense to save it as an investment. But that really doesn't mean that you can't spend Bitcoin. There is no difference between spending USD or Bitcoin in terms of "wasted money". That would mean that you are refraining from having more coins in order to be able to convince yourself to spend. Just determine some amount you are going to keep long term, and spend the rest.
Having Bitcoin income makes the above idea very workable. Not only you will be actively using them as you say, you will also be adding something to the economy by offering your services.

What will happen in a few years is (if regulations don't block the way), Bitcoin will be integrated with your web browser, at least as a plug-in, and will be authenticated by a click on a NFC or USB device. No need to enter any details, just click accept, enter your pin or whatever and you're done.
Regarding exchanges; I think Coinbase has a good model. But I honestly don't believe that fiat-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;goods or fiat-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;fiat (i.e. remittance) transactions are too appealing. Chances are that your mother will already have some Bitcoin income. Americans are probably used to using dollars for everything but having multiple currencies in your accounts is common in regions with volatile currencies (where free exchange is still allowed), and it's not that big a deal. However, this will take a longer time than hardware wallet solutions.

Wikimedia Foundation knows about Bitcoin and plenty of appeals have been made for years. The final outlook is, they think it's not even worth adding a payment method if it doesn't generate an additional half million dollars. Also, they don't seem to think dependence on centralized payment institutions is against their stance of neutrality, but rather think them supporting Bitcoin would affect Bitcoin in a good way, and thus is not neutral.
My personal verdict is, bringing this up doesn't help. You can donate via other means if you want to help the foundation.
Also, the content on Wikipedia is not owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, and I imagine one could support a shift to a different, more efficient sort of structure. I mean, if it costs more than half a million dollars to even consider a payment option, there really must be something interesting going on.
If you really want to donate in Bitcoin to make Internet richer, you could consider giving to archive.org.

What is meant by low transaction fees is, sending your bitcoins to someone else is almost free, globally.
Buying Bitcoin is a different topic. You could in theory buy Bitcoin without any commission, but it is usual to be charged if you are using a service. It usually is worth the convenience though (e.g. I would gladly pay a 1% escrow fee instead of risking to get scammed).
If you are talking about markup by local traders, I guess it can't be helped. More efficient solutions require a more liquid market. One thing of note is, you can actually earn Bitcoin directly and stay in the economy (where fees are almost zero) from the beginning.

True. I didn't want to mean that I see taxation as desirable or fair. I see a contrast with, say, vegetarianism though, where one less animal you eat converts to one less animal killed. With taxation, evaded taxes seem to me to convert into more taxation of others. On the other hand, I acknowledge that a massive evasion movement (which I don't see happening yet) could be a powerful political force, so I am rather open minded about that.
To further defend my position, most anarchists I know (or knew) usually call for the obsoletion or abolishing of the system. Communists may want to refrain from "trade" altogether, and move out of the taxable realm by doing so. Others violently oppose the system. Keeping in mind the undesirable political effect of being labelled as selfish, taxation isn't usually brought into the anarchist rhetoric. I came to understand that ancaps have a different approach, but as long as you are not vulgar about your tax evasion, and without some way to gain sympathy for this action, I don't think it is helping much, if any.

That's the problem of the legacy banking system. If you could buy things like Bitcoin easily, why would you need Bitcoin to buy things easily in the first place?

You surely meant the ultimate transparency and simplicity of the system? Otherwise, I don't really understand that how you can claim that you know how central banking does this better than you know how Bitcoin does it.


Bitcoin protocol has support for accountability protection and there are already existing arbitration services out there.


It has deflationary nature. You may think that this is a bug, but regardless, I don't think it's so hard to understand as a fact.
Last month I met a friend of the family, a retired chair salesman, who had just read about Bitcoin on a newspaper. He mentioned it in the conversation and he perfectly understood how the money supply worked. I certainly have met people who don't like the system, but I haven't met anyone who doesn't get how it works.

You have a point, though lack of options is also a problem.

They are not lunatics, they just have different ideas of how things should be like. You seem to completely dismiss normativity altogether, which is in fact what life is all about. You and one of those lunatics can both be completely coherent, and can still want different things for "humanity".




I'd like to emphasize here that I agree with neither your claim, nor Rand's conclusion.

I've read the papers but I'm not familiar with the developers, so I'm not sure, but I don't think anyone would be that ambitious. You would probably start with nodes on the internet, and then add meshnet support. At that point, long range traffic will be automatically tunneled through the Internet.
Assuming this thing catches on like Bitcoin in the long run, which is a long shot indeed, the network would have the capacity to sponsor expensive long range connections.

They are nowhere near identical, since you need to have a bank account and initiate the final transfer from there. He just made money from speculation and bought a car with it. Trading Bitcoin made him rich, but he didn't buy the car with Bitcoin.
I think the criterion is, you shall not use a different payment mechanism in the process. I don't know where to draw the line between coupons and prepaid cards, but making a transfer from your personal bank account is as clear cut as it gets.
What the other parties do can't be a concern, because they could be doing anything. When you pay a merchant directly with Bitcoin, do they keep it? Most of the time there is even an intermediary that converts it to fiat. So if we consider these steps, you either can't buy anything with Bitcoin, or you can buy everything. It becomes a meaningless measure.

The BTC also couldn't have been stolen as a result of transaction malleability. That's pretty much a fact. No amount of bad programming can result in such a colossal failure.
If the coins are in fact lost/stolen, it's more likely that it happened long ago.

Any data they currently have cannot be trusted either, though with enough data from the customer base it might be possible to reveal if those are doctored.

I have no extra information, but I had read their ToS before depositing and it did strike me as odd that there seems to be no way other than verifying for the next tier.

I think you care too much about Bitcoin's exchange rate. It seriously doesn't matter.
However, while instant conversion to fiat by retailers depresses the exchange rate, it does increase liquidity, which may convert to stability, which in turn decreases the urgency to convert it to fiat in the first place. Also, when you can buy just about anything anywhere with it, you don't really have to convert all your revenue to fiat to cover your costs. So eventually, this should pave a path for exchange rate increases as well.
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:30:33
Well, you can't just include a double-spending transaction in any block. It has to be a double-spending block that generates an alternative chain, since every chain needs to be consistent in itself.
As long as the miner has some idea about the block height, the problem should be minimal. Even if the miners merely refused to travel back in time, most of the potential attacks would be mitigated. You can even get this data through Electrum.

I think *you* are the one trying to dazzle nontechnical people.




What a ridiculous way to look at it.
Bitcoin was almost getting a Turing complete scripting language too. Bitcoin core developers had enough foresight to not let it happen, and it was an excellent (and as you said, pretty obvious) decision not to take the risk.
However, it's quite a huge leap to call it impossible, and therefore anyone trying that is unethical. That sort of stance is harmful as much as it's silly.

@_date: 2014-02-11 07:11:16
I think it's more complicated than that.
It's in fact a bit hard to have the same vulnerability; you have to have a broken custom implementation of the protocol (which is at least plausible) AND explicitly introduce a second vulnerability by automating re-payments or employing dummy support staff (which I can't understand).
I don't think CoinBase could even potentially have the "exact same error".
However, since they absorb the risk of zero confirmation transactions, and changing transacions ID's could pose a problem with chains of unconfirmed transactions, they probably changed a thing here and there to decrease the risk of this happening. We could speculate and say they were vulnerable, and it might even be so, but I don't think it's worth the debate as zero confirmation transaction risk reduction is not an exact science anyway. They probably just wanted to assure their customers that they are actively doing things.

But why do I have the dollars in the first place? If the increase in exchange rate is certain, I would have converted those dollars into Bitcoin (or would refrain from converting bitcoins to USD), and would have purchased more stuff with it through the same duration.
As it stands, it looks like I would be keeping the dollars just to convince myself to spend, since I will be inclined to save if I had bitcoins. It could be a psychological effect, but I don't think it makes a lot of sense (considering the initial ideal assumptions of course).
I think this works without the absolutes too, since with this rationale you would be more inclined to spend as the probability of deflation goes down. Of course that would also mean keeping other assets makes more sense (which is obviously the real case).

Is it absurd, or is it without meaning? :-)
What she means there is, money is a measure of how useful you have been to a part of society. You may not agree with it, but I don't find it meaningless. I don't think money is the ultimate measure, and I'm not sure that is very useful as a measure, but it is surely an indicator.
It's interesting that Rand also seems to think that if money we use can easily be mangled with, it tends to lose this property. This may be in conflict with the quote itself, but it also explains why Rand would oppose money printing, capital controls, etc. Having lived in a country where annual inflation hit above 100% level several times, I think I do have a grasp of what she's talking about, though I don't have as strong opinions. Reality is more convoluted than how Ayn Rand depicts it.


Many people think that Bitcoin is devil's creation and want it to die in a fire.
My reasoning is actually somewhere between you and Rand, or maybe an opposite of both. Contrary to what you say, except the results of government failure, money earned is a projection of how much the society values your contribution. So to me, *equating* money to the *power within you* is drone mentality, not freedom.
Being avaricious is not a good quality to have, and even though I despise such people, I don't think it's nearly humanity's biggest problem. People very often are being overly simplistic when they accuse other people of being greedy. It's blatant cynicism, which in turn is an indicator of lack of faith in oneself.
Anyway, to me it will inevitably boil down to how you measure a contribution for the "betterment of humanity". Without a proposed metric, your argument also becomes a bit "meaningless". :-)


Depends on how you define humanity and bettering of it. It's not a simple question, but I reject the claim that it's Nietzschean to constrain "good".

A LOT of people think lack of consumer spending is bad for the economy, me included, but I don't think many people can actually describe the mechanism behind it.
It becomes even funnier when the same people also think we are killing Earth by misallocating resources.
I think the reason it's bad for the society is about how we currently allocate resources, which is mainly a result of how power is accumulated by political structures. Otherwise, there is no unbreakable link between somebody producing less iPhones and someone else producing less food, leading to everyone going hungry. We can in fact consume far less, and still stay happy and healthy.
I don't think this conflicts with a deflationary currency, because if you are against mis-allocation of resources, you will want people to prefer spending on essentials like healthcare, dwelling and food over non-essentials, and also optimize the spending on these fronts, leading to more energy efficient lifestyles. You can increase your well-being by preferring to have friends (and definitely more sex with more people) and philosophizing in your vastly increased leisure time instead of trying to get the best gadget or the most expensive entertainment in town and working your ass off in the meantime.
This doesn't work in reality, because a society that usurps more resources will knock you down. That's why dominant powers will not naturally prefer a decentralized currency, let alone a decentralized one.

Thanks for putting so much effort into the explanation. I think most of it conforms to with my speculation that it would be completely wiped off the mainstream for quite a while. I will try to speculate for the long term.


On the flip side, it is hard to detect. I think in the long run it is very likely that "companies" will be autonomous distributed programs with shared ownership or even self ownership.
With enough blunders of mainstream economy, it can evolve from something that only hackers deal with to something everyone does informally, just like Internet censorship would drive people towards solutions like I2P. Like weed, it could eventually bring about a wave of decriminalization like what we see with psychoactive drugs.
Also, services with no single point with the power to control the money flow will reduce the possibility of government confiscation. We could also use tainting to remove any confiscated money out of the economy altogether to reduce the impact of such actions.


I don't think this is true. Most of what we see in the case of underground markets is an ignorant user base failing to notice the weaknesses of the system they use. These can be remedied in time. Also with no way of legally obtaining Bitcoin, the number of identifiable transactions will be vastly reduced.


I think we can still reach a steady state with high volume with a very low exchange rate. Emphasis on the "long run" though.


This may not be such a bad thing for volatility. You will have to "earn" bitcoins, and spend them in the economy. In the case of information products, you will ultimately be safe.


It's a good analogy, though if we consider the potential remedies, Bitcoin has a much higher potential of success (of course with the Internet staying intact) than meshnets (in the case of Internet becoming illegal).




Agreed to both.
My argument depends on two ideas. First, the mainstream economy is a joke, and technologies like Bitcoin (doesn't have to be Bitcoin) is one of the things that could save humanity a great deal of suffering. Second, we can innovate better in a free market even if constrained to information technologies, and mainstream VC funding is a distraction that steers minds towards less disruptive innovation. Maybe I am far too optimistic though, we'll see how it goes.
There is also a case to be made for Bitcoin remaining underground, but helping lessen the problems with the mainstream economy just by existing as a safeguard, analogous to anonymizing solutions helping to keep Internet censorship at a minimum.

I got the impression that you think he is explicitly saying that Bitcoin is not "libertarian". However, he is just saying that it's not a mere libertarian fairy tale (e.g. like all other libertarian fairy tales), in that it is realistic. I'm not saying he is asserting that it is in fact libertarian either though, there are plenty arguments in his article that tries to reinforce the idea that it can be appealing to non-libertarians too.
If you check out rest of his article, all of his points are about gaining efficiency and political freedom by getting the power out of the middle-men. We can discuss individual points if you like.
As a side note, if we take the word "libertarianism" out of its American definition and use it as a generic term as the opposite of authoritarianism, then I would rather retract my earlier point and say that he is actually trying to sell libertarianism to everyday people. It is a very sympathetic approach, but think of it from the other side of this "sign" (presumably a QR-code) the most hardened anticapitalist political organizer is holding. He *is* the libertarian in the eyes of the authority.
All in all, the idea that giving the power to transact (whether information or money, which incidentally is also information) to an authority decreases efficiency and freedom is libertarian. Don't mind the libertarians who think they own the term though.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:18:52
Redditors surely love to use that phrase.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:32:01
Firstly, core Bitcoin software is an open source development, and every change to the code can be and is reviewed by many different people from around the world. So even if they manage to include something nefarious, it's really not that realistic to expect that it will make it to a release without people noticing. They could still try to distribute it, but I doubt that they would succeed in establishing much, since most of the node operators keep themselves informed.
So, it is more likely that they would try to influence the binaries by coercing the developers to give out their signatures. A lot of people build their own binaries, and some portion of the binaries (especially Linux distros) are built from source before distribution, but there is still some danger there. However, it will be noticed eventually, and that sort of attack will be made impossible in the future by introducing multiple signature authorities. Then why is it not made impossible now? I guess it's not viewed as a potential danger right now, and I agree. There has never been a successful attack of this nature in any opensource project that I know of.
And, assuming it succeeds for some interval, what happens after it is discovered? Since it is really unlikely that the change introduced would require forking (that sort of thing goes through immense scrutiny), people would simply update their software. The potential problem there is the people who don't update, but that would likely only affect people who don't update. If it affects the overall health of the network, we would need a method to identify compromised nodes from the outside and drop connections to them. This would be a different sort of fork, effectively dividing the network into two. I think at this point it is very natural to assume that the compromised half would be obsoleted very rapidly.

They could do a couple of double spend and rollback attempts, and what they will accomplish is, 1) destroy themselves in a couple of hours, 2) adoption of already existing technologies for better allocation of mining power.
For instance, powerful miners should be checking what they are working on (e.g. using getblocktemplate). It removes the threat altogether and doesn't affect profitability (e.g. like p2pool). The attack you are describing would result in everyone adopting such solutions.


I don't understand how the LIBOR analogy works in your mind. How are mining pools similar to banks? It's more like interbank networks deciding to screw up people's transfers. There will be minor damage, some loss of trust, and that's about it.


Stolen money is not analogous to counterfeiting. I will not argue that theft is not a problem, or irreversible pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin doesn't make it more advantageous, but your argument is out of place.
Risks involved with Bitcoin based investments are different than more conventional vehicles. If someone is not aware of the risks involved, they should be made aware, like any investment out there. Such warnings about Bitcoin are abundant.
There are also some protections Bitcoin makes possible that you can't get with anything else. Check out how NEOBEE deals with deposits, and compare it with the current system in the context of Cyprus. Vague generalizations fail to do justice for either side of the debate.


As long as it is given, how does this relate to the original problem? Some people are richer than the others already. Surely, rich people have more influence on the economy, but the incentives you are comparing are not similar at all.


You are probably right. Yet, what part of this speculation is a bet on the currency's future utility, and how much of it is pure pump and dump? It's hard to tell. As long as pump and dump is not able to kill it, I see it as an unfortunate obstacle. Time will tell I suppose.


Depends on what website you are talking about. Surely blockchain.info going out of business would not affect many people. Probably not true for Coinbase.


This is also a given.


There we go... I think you are reading too much Reddit. Give it a break and involve yourself with some of the tens of different projects that is going on in this area.

I'm not very qualified to respond, but basically miners build their own blocks, so they can include whatever transactions they like. The coinbase transaction comes with the template (so that the pool gets the fees+reward), though I'm guessing even that can be modified. So, even if the same pool produces 6 blocks in a row, the blocks themselves will be created by different miners.

Difficulty is a function of the total computing power, and has gone down several times in history.
If mining becomes less lucrative, the least efficient miners stop first, the hashrate drops, minutes per block go up, and difficulty goes down in order to match 10 minutes per block. This re-targeting happens every 2016 blocks, which is optimally two weeks.
In a perfect world, mining would always be barely profitable enough for only the most efficient miners to go on.

Sorry, I fail to get your point. Chargebacks are not against the "core values" of crypto, it's just a type of contract among many sorts of contracts you can create with this system. I am pretty enthusiastic about Bitcoin, and also find the subject of dispute resolution very intriguing. 
You can't have dispute resolution without the concept of authority by the nature of the process, though I'm pretty sure some advances will be possible in the near future that could help distribute this authority. For now, you at least have the choice of who to trust.
Furthermore, as bbbbbubble said, you can build a reversible system on top of an irreversible system, but the opposite is not possible. That's one of the things that makes Bitcoin sound from an engineering perspective. If you need chargebacks, the system supports it. Why would users support it? Because it's a good idea in many occasions. People use escrows all the time with Bitcoin anyway, it's just not easy enough. We need to find the best approach, support it so that it becomes a standard procedure.

Yet people still run binaries they don't trust. Let's just say that it's a good idea to run them in a separate environment, *and keep running them that way*, if you are going to run them anyway.
To clarify, I wasn't prescribing a way to test whether these binaries are safe. I wouldn't trust binaries that are not verifiably compiled from sources I can access, *at all*. I don't even run Skype as a privileged user, and neither should you. However, people still do often want to try out software, and if they do, it's not a good idea to give that software rights to access personal or system resources.

Before ASIC Bitcoin miners existed, we experienced the same thing with Deepbit several times. The community reacted the same. Critics responded the same. All of this have happened during the GPU era. So I don't really understand the basis of your primary argument. As long as people use pools, without verifying the generating blocks themselves (a technology which is shared with Bitcoin as-is), it really doesn't matter how you distribute the mining equipment between individuals. If we were talking about a proof-of-stake network, or anything other than an exact Bitcoin clone, then there might at least be something to speculate about.
The second point also looks, at least to me, a bit moot. It certainly was the case when Litecoin was going to be a CPU-only network. If you have a chance to read the discussions from that era, you will notice that the "centralization" argument that is now being used against ASICs were being used against GPUs. Now that Litecoin is being mined on GPUs, it suddenly became a non-issue.
With regards to hobbyist mining, I think ASIC equipment has a potential to have a greater reach than GPU's. With specialized devices, you just plug in and it works. You don't even need a computer. GPU's, not so much. However, currently the advances in this technology are too quick for the consumer grade equipment to arrive on time to be able to compete with specialized mining farms. I would agree that this poses a problem, but it will hopefully become less of a deal. As we have seen, mining pools are a bigger problem anyway.
Regardless, I don't think any of these really matter much.

Yes, that may be relevant to Bitcoin deposits, but by accounts being frozen Freemanix certainly meant fiat bank accounts.
Furthermore, I don't think your question regarding ownership of coins directly apply here either. On the Bitcoin network, there certainly is no concept of ownership. But that does not map to Bitcoin "deposits" to an institution that you make in your name, to an account that you have verified with your passport and address documents with apostille. If all records are available, this certainly proves ownership, just as it would for fiat. So the question is whether MtGox can alter their own records freely to commit fraud, which is a completely different topic.

AFAIK the default pool is ~~200~~ 100 addresses deep (it can be defined by the user), so the 50 recommendation is probably to be on the safe side.
In theory, you can use any number of new addresses per transaction, but only the change address will be automatically generated by the client.
You may want to back up your wallet more frequently to save the labelling though. If your client supports label syncing (e.g. Electrum), you don't even need that.

Well, multisig and P2SH is a part of the protocol itself, so it should serve as proof that it is designed with shared authority in mind, for which trust is a key component.
As for the ideology, I myself believe that it is about freedom of choice. In the end, in the real world, you can't get rid of trust. For instance when you send money to a merchant, you will have to ultimately put faith in them. I don't think many people here think that we can completely do away with it in practice.


Yep, so that you can do things without having to get permission from or announce what you do to intermediaries. But you can custom design many different types of trust systems on top of the trustless base, without oppressing anyone.


It's more efficient if you already trust the other party (which is most of the time, at least for me). Privacy concerns can be another reason. Irreversible transactions are also important for financial services, as chargebacks are commonly used to scam these entities. In many circumstances, bank wires are used for these purposes, but they are expensive and offer no privacy.
Bottomline is, if you don't trust the other party, you have to use an escrow. We need something that makes this easy. For reputable merchants however, the consumer's risk is much lower when making a direct transaction than the merchant's risk when accepting a transaction with possibility of chargeback.

I won't debate deflationary economy here, but a "spending coin" doesn't make much sense. If keeping your wealth in Bitcoin would be more profitable for you, you would keep it in Bitcoin instead of any other form (USD, Doge, Feather, gold, whatever). If you wanted to spend it, you could spend Bitcoin directly. Converting it to something else to persuade yourself to spend isn't really that rational.
The ultimate altcoin that was designed for being a "spending coin" is Freicoin. It has a lot of thought behind it. However, it can't work because of the above facts. Even if everyone was paid in Freicoin, they would directly convert it to Bitcoin (or another deflationary alternative). You need to introduce some friction, like difficulty in exchange, which cryptocurrencies don't have between each other.

If I remember correctly, one of the reasons is that a public Wi-Fi spot can fool you into believing that you are connected to the Bitcoin network, but you can't fake a tor network since you don't have the private keys of onion addresses.

One could argue that it could help make such activities more difficult than they could be.

I did some research about these regulations before, but couldn't find clear figures about their effectiveness. I also have acquaintances who work with regulators directly, and they were also unable to help.

Yes. They need to have automated the re-send requests. And they need to have completely ignored by whom and in what frequency they were being made.
On top of that, they need to have automated the transfer from the cold wallet to the hot wallet, which removes the very analogy of cold-ness from the equation.
They need to have refrained from using any other cold wallet and put everything in a single machine and never ever checked that wallet again, even though it was always online. Presumably for years.
Since the code that has the ability to create transactions out of the cold wallet has to already know the balance there, they need to have chosen to ignore it when writing the script.
All people involved with the company should have refrained from doing an inventory or any sort of responsible accounting, again, for years.

Proof-of-bandwidth idea and the currency aspect may be inspired by Bitcoin, but I don't see much in the proposed system that I can honestly call as "Bitcoin's algorithm". And even if that were so, how is it bad for "cryptomoney"? No cryptocurrency even worked before Bitcoin.
I am a long time user and huge fan of I2P, and mass adoption would be great. It was developed with anonymity in mind, but you can tune it for performance (anonymity features can be completely disabled), or you can go the other way and establish your own darknet. It also has support for persistent storage.
However, the adoption is not happening, is it? Bitcloud seems like a generic protocol, and unlike I2P, it has incentives built in. That is a big difference, which can break the spell.

To me, it looks like they are trying to make it look like they found a solution to others' problems. It doesn't seem that way, especially considering exchanges use different implementations, both to interface with the network and internally. We need a network wide standard normalized transaction hashes that we can use to identify transactions. If I understand correctly, the exchanges that did it properly should already be using this technique MtGox "just invented" all along.

Even if they managed to do that, continuously blaming the protocol has already revealed their true nature.

The most basic thing we know is, the attacker had OP's user and password, and attempted to disable 2FA. OP didn't tell btc-e to disregard the request. 2 weeks later, the attacker got access.
So just a compromised password could explain the situation, other than the pop-up, which is why I suspected a compromised system.
Even if they could access everything in the system, *they would not be able to withdraw coins without access to the 2FA device*. That's why they needed to disable it.

What I would expect from the risk takers is to not cry about it. And it's actually what I am observing.

Short answer: It isn't.
Assuming they are not confused about what cold storage means, they would need to be moving coins to the hot wallet without any sanity check. Even if this is not very plausible (how can you type on a keyboard in the first place if you are that stupid), it is possible in theory. Ah, and they would also need to re-initiate "fake" withdrawals automatically in order to reach that magnitude.
Of course, that in general is assuming the "leaked document" has any authenticity.

@_date: 2014-03-12 14:18:39


I disagree, as long as you can exchange between these currencies with little friction.
Assuming the increase in value is a given as you have stated, converting the USD into BTC and slowly spending as BTC as needed will result in more goods purchased, so it's very clearly the rational choice. Even better if you already have the BTC to begin with.
So the deflation argument is bogus IMHO.
However, if we don't assume the guaranteed increase in value, and if your default investment is USD (i.e. your income is necessarily in USD and you start off completely with USD) then it's a different story. I agree that spending and replenishing BTC is not by itself rational. It may be a more enlightened form of rationality, where you do it because you want Bitcoin to succeed, but I won't argue for it.
If you have the choice of currency of your income, or you have invested in bitcoins and they have gained in value (similar to having income in BTC) then it's natural to spend bitcoins too. You may be inclined to save more, but if that inclination is more than your inclination to save USD, it may not be rational as I explained above (i.e. you would convert USD into BTC then).
Reality is more complicated of course, considering the risks, diversification, wealth management, etc.

Since you will require a Web of Trust system for this to work, why issue completion degrees at all? You can get rid of the concept of "completion", and also stop separating learners from teachers.
You can create a multidimensional Web of Trust which could be used to calculate all that is necessary for a node to calculate the suitability of a different node to an intention. This is generic and programmable, and could be versatile enough to create matching research teams, find someone suitable for a job or gather academic statistics.
The biggest problem I see here is the decentralization of WoT itself. It's not an easy task to do. However, you probably don't need an insanely secure system and this can be handled with relatively more conventional methods.

1. Accounting for Bitcoin income shouldn't be too hard to deal with. It's actually quite a bit like gold. Instant exchanging to USD doesn't defeat the purpose by itself, but if you keep some coins and use them to pay for some of your costs (e.g. partial wages, hosting, new stock), it would help other service providers in this area grow.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:54:32


I might be misunderstanding this question, but I'll give it a shot. You don't need any third party to move your coins, and using this sort of entity to store or move coins is not recommended. I don't want to dismiss all uses of such services (e.g. automated payments, off-chain transactions), but they are in no way essential for storage and transactions.
Regarding artificially reduced value, it's debatable whether we can call the current events an artificial effect. There is a lot of turmoil, and it's natural for this to affect exchange rates, especially because the market is not liquid. We need more things going on, more exchanges, more people using Bitcoin, more speculators, etc.


Bitcoin's value is decoupled from real world indicators, so it's not clear to me what more government regulation can bring to the table. You could create a new cryptocurrency with a guaranteed exchange value, but then how would it be different from any fiat currency? Actually cryptocurrencies are far less efficient than centralized currencies in every way, if you assume that you can trust centralized authority.

Without knowing your status (where you are located, citizenship, whether you have a bank account, etc.), I can only recommend localbitcoins.com. There are far more convenient ways though.
Also, earning Bitcoin directly can also be convenient, depending on what you do for a living.


For long term investments of non-techies, people recommend paper wallets. You can make multiple copies and can optionally use a password for extra security. Creating these papers on a clean offline computer is recommended, so booting with a secure live Linux CD can be a good idea.
The most convenient way to spend it is via your mobile device, since QR-code support is very widespread. Keeping a back-up of your mobile wallet, and using a strong passphrase to protect it is recommended. I use Mycelium's app, but there are other nice apps out there.

I think this is the most important item here, and I suspect the most in-development part of the infrastructure. Entrepreneurs will either succeed in building almost flawless and foolproof systems that can do instant transactions, or Bitcoin will never go into mainstream. There is plenty of money to be made, though failure is possible too.


Most of what you need to do is easy if you know how to do it. This is a typical problem innovators face. I think this is the most easy item to fix, though chances are that these solutions won't interoperate well with the solutions for the above item, which would cause both to fail to go mainstream.


Internet culture. It by itself is a setback for everything else, so we have to endure it, Bitcoin or no.


Second important item. The community needs to demand dispute resolution contracts from the merchants. This is essential, and I think will gradually build itself in the long run.
Of course, this also needs to work well with the first two items.


I want to keep this apart from other parties. This is a crowdfunded project, so it's pretty much expected that it will be delayed. That is also the reason it was "overvalued".

Yeah, that's an issue. The way around that is obviously not accepting transactions that don't include a proper fee. The payment protocol could help with that.

Yes, it makes sense. Though I wonder what happens when you put the price in Bitcoin.
It's like declaring that you want to exchange your stamp collection with a brand new microwave oven. Then someone comes and gives you Euro's that match the market price of that oven and tells you have to accept it or face legal consequences.
Even if you could argue that this is how it should work, it's already hard to "legally" determine the exchange rate. For instance you could argue that Bitcoin's exchange rate is X based on Bitstamp, or the average of most popular exchanges, but I myself might not have a bank account and therefore have no access to such markets, increasing the unit cost, sometimes by more than 10%. And imagine the seller only has a MtGox account, effectively cutting its value in half.
From this point of view, Bitcoin is more like a stamp collection than a microwave.

To be perfectly honest, I don't see an advantage of converting EUR, through a bank and a Bitcoin exchange, to bitcoins, only to be converted back to EUR again. I am also usually skeptical about the claims people make about "real" Bitcoin transactions. I certainly don't have counter claims either.
Bitcoin is extremely efficient and useful when you use it in the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin has no facilities that help it work with the outside world, and all of its design principles are agnostic to real world indicators. Bitcoin could be easily working with account certificates instead of addresses, which would make the design easier, the database less bloated, and the p2p nature could still have stayed.
Actually, if it is as you say and it will be used to empower centralized institutions, why use p2p at all in the first place?

Currency is not the only parameter here. You can have a social structure where more people work on essentials for less of their time.

Actually it's "very high on the development priority list" as Gavin put it. However it's a multifaceted thing that requires true innovation, and you won't find potential solutions listed as "transactions per second". We don't want a central group of developers pushing block size limit increases. You can't just remove the limit either, as this will result in all sorts of denial of service vulnerabilities. We need a naturally scaling block size, which works in conjunction with a dynamic network wide consensus on fees.
I don't think attempting to resolve this once and for all is the best approach and I'm glad no one is promising that. Floating, smarter fees would be a good step towards resolving scaling issues.
But, what happens if we can't find a way to make it scale? Actually, not long ago, the community was discussing whether we *should* try to make it scale, since there is also the view that the block chain should function as the backbone for a greater structure that employs lighter protocols. This point of view seems to be forgotten nowadays, but it can make a comeback if scaling turns out to be more problematic than competing approaches. There are already implemented solutions, some of which are full blown decentralized protocols, that do off-chain transactions. Some of these are unquestionably better suited for micro-transactions for instance, so they will likely be used commonly even if transactions per second never becomes a problem.

Actually these payment processors let you use Bitcoin merely as a payment network, so there should be less to explain. You ask for $50, you get $50, and you don't even have to do the calculation. It works pretty much like the conventional payment methods without the risk of a chargeback.
If you are talking about subscriptions, I think you could ask for recurring payments from the client (since you can't pull the money out without consent), but don't expect them to forget and pay excessively.

This is about reducing single points of failure. There is no point in keeping bitcoins on exchanges, or "bank"s that use a mixed wallet, if you are not a trader. Less paths to failure means less need for control and therefore higher efficiency.
Trust isn't free, so we should be able to rely on less of it. For instance the fact that NEO uses 2-of-3 wallets reduces (though not removes) the vigilance required from the customer base. If this were the norm for MtGox (which is pretty much cost-less), we wouldn't need to trust them this much and some of the catastrophes would have been avoided altogether.

I guess I misunderstood your question after all. I don't think distributed exchanges are the only answer. "More exchanges" should do as well. It will be quite a while before volatility becomes a non-issue, and whether it will ever happen through better exchanges depends on the future regulatory climate. If exchanges continue to be a problem, either because of incompetency (I personally don't think this will continue to be the case) or because of regulatory problems, then adoption will take far longer, through people that really need something like Bitcoin, rather than a mainstream push by opportunistic western players.

Don't leave your coins on a mixing online wallet, that's for sure. That leaves out all exchanges unfortunately.
If you trust that your computer is not compromised, blockchain.info wallet is pretty secure. It's very much like a thin client than a web service.
If the server is compromised, they will not be able to access your coins. However, the attacker could tweak the software so that it steals your password.

In situations like this, banking system and "fiat" itself can collapse as well. What is useful is something that has value outside the region. That's why people with USD/EUR do *very well* in these cases.
What makes foreign banknotes better is, a lot of people can immediately accept them. What's worse is, there is no way you will be able to inject USD into the hands of people who need it. Also, smuggling/storing/carrying it can become life threatening. Bitcoin can indeed help with the latter two issues. At the very least, you can exchange it with expats or anyone with a foreign bank account for goods/precious metals/foreign currency. In that case coins will act as tokens to accelerate the process and help organize the effort. Best case, you will find someone with an Internet connection (or have phone access to some trusted party who does) that would accept them directly.

First off, there are limits to such transfers already. You can't just register with bitpay and receive any random amount of money without limits. Second, the initiation of the actual bank transfer will take days, if not weeks, even if it did work without raising alarms all over the place in some sort of parallel reality. Certainly more than 6, or 60 confirmations. You can't do it for even three orders of magnitude below that amount.

1. Get a Bitcoin wallet for yourself only for this purpose. Any wallet that can import keys would be sufficient. I'd use Electrum.
2. Install a mobile wallet on your kids' phones which use a single address and therefore doesn't require constant backups (e.g. Mycelium requires only one initial backup)
3. Add the private keys to those wallets to your personal wallet. You can get them from the backups. If you are using Electrum, it will enable you to move coins between addresses in the wallet. By default, "Freeze" these addresses so that you won't accidentally move money from one to the other.
You won't be able to put daily limits this way, but other items will work.
Electrum can generate as many new addresses as necessary from the same seed, so assuming Electrum &amp; Mycelium, you will only need to get 3 initial backups, and no updates will be necessary in the ordinary use case (e.g. as long as you don't manually add new private keys to your wallets).

It's an interesting subject. We can imagine a regulation that required MtGox to be regularly audited by an authority.  We can also imagine a Bitcoin exchange that operate extremely openly, where everyone can see the accounts and pseudonymous money flow. But does current regulation allow such a transparent exchange? I imagine most of the secrecy surrounding MtGox's PR blunders are about some form of legal thing that requires them to be secretive.
Whether so many people trusting MtGox is a market failure, time will tell. We don't know the current facts (e.g. regulation could turn out the be the prime culprit), and we don't know whether having these issues by itself will spark more innovation. It could very well turn out the be a boring scam, too, though I sincerely doubt it.
All in all, my attitude didn't change. Central regulation is always the easier response to complicated problems. No doubt about that. It's a weakness about how the human mind constructs reality. Does it solve problems? Sure. But at a cost. It isn't likely to be the most efficient solution. Finding more efficient solutions requires work, imagination and people willing to take a risk. Essentially, arguments for centralization are usually (though not always) arguments from lack of imagination.

Yes, that's why I was assuming you would associate users with their public keys. There may be other methods but I'll have to think about it.
Forget about public keys and Bitcoin for a moment. How do you hope to know that the in-game agent made a payment, with ANY decentralized system? Or any payment system for that matter... You have to have a system to associate the payment and the user. Whatever mechanism you use, the game world will know that a payment was made.

This has been rehashed many times before.
Coins are scarce. Even if they were generated for free, what is the mechanism you figure connects it to exchange rate? That's the part you missed.
There may be some weak feedback from mining cost to exchange rate because of friction, but it's a very big leap to say that it is a dominant drive.
Regardless of all this, if generation costs were low, more people would want to generate and costs would go high. With ASIC, mining costs will be mostly about the initial investment rather than the operating costs, but they will still be there, so actually even your initial assumption is incorrect.
@_date: 2012-07-17 01:41:18
It is most likely a shared wallet. In such cases, the system keeps accounts of users, not the block chain, so there is no point in tracing where the money went (just like you don't care what the supermarket does with your cash), it's their business. The service got your money, they are probably waiting for enough confirmations to display it in your account page. Depending on the service, this may take some time. You really need to ask them the question.

It's very hard to harvest IPs this way. I have made around 500 transactions from my home wallet to date, and haven't seen any public service figuring out my IP, not even accidentally. The reason is, transactions are relayed, and there's no way to be sure who initiated a particular transaction without controlling a huge portion of the network. It can theoretically be done, but totally not a huge privacy issue.
Having said that, since all the donation transactions are visible, the donators' own input transactions (where they got the money from) are connected to your donation address. Also, the change they receive from the transaction goes to their own wallet, and when they spend it, it will be indirectly linked to the donation act as well. Since one of these transactions can potentially lead to the identity of the donor (bank transfer to an exchange, online purchase with real ID, etc.), there is a privacy issue there.
I don't think it's worth generating a new address merely for donations, but if done it would remove all these concerns.

I think auditing might be a legitimate concern for most, though I think it's a trade-off. If you think you can just go into a financial business for an audit and come up with healthy information, you're dreaming. The business itself has to conform with some protocols that would allow the auditors to be able to scrutinize historical data with at least some degree of accuracy. It is costly. Besides, it would definitely mean more state involvement, which would certainly result in more customers getting screwed.

Bitcoinica provided the leverage with its own money + customers' deposits. It even paid interest on deposits to encourage placing your savings there.
If it's not a bucket shop, there shouldn't be too much risk. Bitcoin was actually being traded online through MtGox. Though I think some preliminary matching of orders were done prior the real trade, so there may have been some minimal risk (which I suspect, would be reflected to customers).
Since there is no guaranteed liquidity, I think Bitcoinica absorbed some of the losses there. If I remember correctly, the customer's balance reflected this, becoming negative.

Lightweight clients are possible for all platforms, including not so smart ones. There are already many clients for Android, including one that directly connects to the network, though most are lightweight. AFAIK there is at least one client for iOS, though Apple's policies seem to be too restrict to allow all kinds of wallets. I don't know of Symbian, though I guess you could access online wallets, blockchain.info/wallet supports surprisingly diverse browsers. There is also Electrum, which can run on platforms that support Python.
I'd prefer one that preserves the keys on the device itself. If you'd rather a service to maintain them for you, make sure they can only access them in encrypted form. This way you won't have to trust the service operator, but you will be screwed if you lose your password. In any case, back-up your wallet before ever sending money into it and make sure the wallet on the device is encrypted (in case you lose your phone).

If trusting anonymous people wouldn't work, SR would collapse in a minute. Scams will happen and a way around it will be attempted to be solved. Reputation or web of trust aren't the ultimate solutions, but they are a good start. As it stands, direct communication seems to be the best way to make the assessment.

Good questions. First off, fees are not an ethical obligation. Miner who mines a block determines which transactions to include, so if you don't include a fee, it might take some time for your transaction to get confirmed.
I don't think there is an accepted common way people deal with multiple wallets in different locations.
One way to deal with them is to use a lightweight client on multiple devices and use the same wallet everywhere. For instance, if you use the [Electrum]( client, transactions will show up in every copy of the same wallet on all your devices. This is not possible with the default Bitcoin client as of yet. The same is possible with an online wallet, like  . Blockchain.info has mobile/tablet clients as well, and Electrum runs on devices that can run Python.
Second option is, using only your mobile device for Bitcoin. I tried this and it feels awesome. I use Electrum on N900 but there are tons of different clients for other platforms. Just make sure it supports wallet encryption.
Also, separating the bulk of your Bitcoin fortune in an encrypted savings wallet might make sense. Then, even if your current wallet gets stolen together with your password, you won't lose much sleep over it.

What are you going to do to enforce inclusion? Fees are already an incentive to include transactions, so if someone is not including them, they most likely have a secondary motive. If you just put a minimum transaction limit then they can create as many transactions as they like between their addresses on the fly without actually having to receive/relay any transactions from the network. The only effect would be an increased chain size.

Well, that shouldn't be the case, or else why do we need Bitcoin in the first place? Why do you think it's more secure? What if your money at MtGox is suddenly blocked (by law enforcement, robbery, by MtGox's own audit, etc.)?
Maintain your own coins. Problem solved. That's the intended functionality. Learn and teach how to keep them safe. Separate your savings investments into different wallets and preserve their copies securely. If you think your mobile device is more secure, then put your current wallet there.
You need to pay tax on inbound transfers, and it probably doesn't matter where you sell them if you have bank transfers into your bank account, though doing all in one place, like MtGox, is more risky than selling OTC for instance, because you will have a lot of transfers (or one large one) from the same entity. They don't need to have any access to MtGox records to know your income.
If the intention is long term investment, these can be remedied in various ways when the time comes. You might be able to use Bitcoin directly in most cases when you need to spend your money. If you absolutely need to convert to USD, you will most probably be able to trade them directly for cash.

This is a very hard question to answer. We all have our guesses and opinions about it but there is no science to support them.
Something becomes a store of value because it is considered a store of value by people. I know the sentence is stupid and redundant, but I want to stress that there are no inner rules about that.
You can force people to use something as a store of value, or it may be tradition, or it might just be very convenient. The concept of "intrinsic value" pops up all too often, and even though it's been historically a very important factor in the emergence of money, I don't see the clear mechanism that necessitates it.
My view is, if Bitcoin is here to stay regardless of being used as a store of value, then it can be used as a store of value. This necessitates the quality and quantity of trade that makes it very plausible to think that it will be utilized in the long run. I believe this property in itself is the actual mechanism which also makes "intrinsic value" work.
Having said that, my above prediction is based on my understanding of how society itself works and is in no way a rule. I can see a distributed Internet currency being used as a store of value without any actual trade, but I would consider it as too fragile.
As more people use Bitcoin for their day-to-day exchanges, they will have more confidence in it and tend to use it as an ultra-convenient store of value. The stored value can be arbitrarily larger than the actually essential amount required for trade, just as it would turn out to be through the "intrinsic value" mechanism.

Nope, I'm sure they are conforming to generally accepted accounting practices, and that's already being audited, as required by law. Why would you even think the opposite?
On the other hand, the "generally accepted accounting practices" will give you zero information if your concern is insider trading or whatnot, that's all I'm saying.


As I said, I can't wrap my head around how you would be able to get reliable information that way. You could get the things financial services authorities already know, that's for sure. Otherwise, maybe you need to describe the auditing procedure in more detail, because I don't get it.

No. Probability doesn't work that way. If everyone did it your way (let's assume there is an immense reserve power that *can* do that, which is probably false), it would decrease the average block time (short intervals remain short, long intervals shortened), hence increase difficulty. Then all short intervals would lengthen, and you would need to do what you propose more and more.

I haven't produced precise numbers, but with enough velocity, Bitcoin can become a very popular payment vehicle and the USD exchange can still linger around 5.
The idea is, with that kind of stability, investors would be inclined to use it as a store of value, and this would in turn decrease velocity / increase price. Even if you can be certain that it will happen (actually the duration of stability is thus far too short for anyone to know), we can't know *how* it will happen.

I'm assuming the payment will go through a server (e.g. stratum), so you'll need good connection or a nearby station (e.g. in a shop) for transactions to work. Still useful enough though.
Actually I wish they *would* allow direct exchange of transaction data as an alternative. Sure, double spends are possible that way, and accounting will get confusing between syncs, but could make sense in some circumstances. They probably won't add this feature.
EDIT: After thinking about it, I think the transaction data can be transferred directly and the burden of submitting it to the network can be on the receiving side. That would merge those two use cases.

If you don't prefer buying person-to-person, you can use one of the well-known exchanges as others have detailed.
Another enjoyable way of getting them are by earning. You could sell stuff or your services on a bitcoin auction/classifieds/forum site.
I would recommend using a local wallet for storing them. The official client if you don't mind keeping the entire blockchain or Electrum for a lightweight alternative. Both have an encryption feature. The downside is, if you lose your wallet, or your passphrase for decrypting it, your fortune is forever lost. Fortunately, it's pretty easy not to lose them (just back your wallet up now and again, and write your password down if you have to).
Mining is not so much fun if you are not a hardware enthusiast. You can still buy shares in mining companies if you are only in it for profit.

I tend to view the State as an autonomous entity rather than a conspiracy. As such, it is inclined to make itself more resistant to control by external will, such as the government or the banking industry. I can't quite work out how Bitcoin is disruptive to which party, so the optimist in me says that the State might stay neutral towards Bitcoin. If so, it may still be persecuted, but would stand a chance if accepted by the public as a beneficial tool.
I think the key is to spread its use around the world, especially to diverse political factions and social classes. This also renders the outcome of prohibiting its use less certain.

This sounds too intricate. If I am tipped 100 times for instance, I have to claim 100 different private keys, and probably have to transfer donated coins to a different address in a regular basis since otherwise my reddit messages might accumulate enough money to become a target. Plus, if the recipient doesn't claim them, the coins are gone.
A simpler solution would require an external service. If I could just connect to this through my reddit account and access coins donated to me, it would be lovely. Plus, donations that remain unclaimed for, say 90 days, can be returned to the sender. (EDIT: Plus, this would drastically decrease the number of PM's the service has to send.)
Don't know about the begging part. This extension would allow any reddit user to receive a donation, without their consent. I don't think this would increase begging, as beggars can already do that. Karma whoring on the other hand, I don't know... Maybe people would donate more to the under-voted marginal comments, which would have a cooling effect.

The fee goes to the miner who includes your transaction in a block.
The network works in a way that a new block is found by a miner roughly every 10 minutes. The miner isn't required to include any transaction in the block. The block could even include only one transaction, which is the mining reward to the miner him/herself, and still be valid. This reward is separate from the fees. By including a fee with your transaction, you give incentive to the miner to include your transaction. Miners usually include all transactions with recommended minimum or even lower fees, and some even include transactions without fees.
That is why it's a good idea to include some fee.
Why is the network designed this way? There are very good reasons that things are so, but understanding them would require some insight into why it was so hard to to design something like Bitcoin in the first place.

The reason this isn't the same as memorizing your bank account password is, you can easily imagine that there is nowhere else that these coins "reside" other than your brain. In the bank case, the bank has control of your money, which you can conveniently use a password to access; nonetheless the money's "there". With thoughtcoin, you can even generate an address without having Internet access, give it to someone and they will be able to transfer money directly into your brain.

What Daminvar said, there are several tools that may help. If you just formatted the drive and haven't used it since, the wallet is probably still there. At the very least, you should be able to recover keys one by one. If you decide to go down this route and one of the tools doesn't help, please ask here or in the forums again.
Plus, if you have a backup from even months ago, you should be able to recover all coins. It doesn't matter whether coins were in the wallet when you backed it up. The file keeps a list of at least 200 hidden queued keys.
Good luck! Backing up your wallet takes just a few seconds, so next time... ;)

It also supports various methods of two-factor authentication, secondary encryption password option, supports easy backup methods, has browser extensions that help detect that the server isn't compromised, and also has an android app. If you set a secondary password and two-factor authentication, enable automatic backups and don't forget your passwords, then I'd say blockchain.info is secure enough for day to day use. You can also print your private keys on paper and put them in a safe for additional measure against lost passwords (e.g. you die).
I'd still keep the bulk of my wealth in an offline fashion, and divide it in different wallets. I know this sounds like too much work but actually it is pretty straightforward once you get a hang of it.

They are GPGPU's, so they can be used for generic computing purposes. AFAIK Coinlab is developing a platform to make use of the GPU's released from mining.
Mining should ultimately be opaque with regards to the currency aspect. Utility to end user is what's most important, which mining does provide (security, reliability, etc.), but a change in proof-of-work algorithms is not relevant to that. Removal of the proof-of-work logic could call for a new crypto-currency, but even that should be incorporated in Bitcoin itself if and when another method is proven to be better.

I'll just repeat what MR_KETTLE said for emphasis. It doesn't matter if you've created the address yourself after the backup, it would still be in the backed up wallet. If it's not, then it is sent to somewhere external, and it wasn't really there before you restored either. Your transaction history says 0/unconfirmed, so dumping and loading from the web wallet is actually a pretty good idea to make it certain.

I can think of two simple factors:
* If we knew perfectly that it would be more valuable tomorrow, it would be more valuable today. That's why decision to "spend today" and "not spend today" would have equal weights on average, if we can assume that the market is rational.
* If there is a detrimental effect, it can't happen suddenly. The valuation itself would take this into account, deflation wouldn't occur, which means the effect wouldn't have happened in the first place.
Also, from my perspective, since I can always keep my savings in a deflationary vehicle, why would I want to spend anyway, regardless of which currency is accepted in the stores? Let's forget about Bitcoin; there is USD and gold, inflationary and deflationary. Instead of spending my USD, I could always convert it to gold and delay my expenses. You can apply the same reasoning here and expect people to stop spending. Which doesn't happen in reality.


I think the above factors counter this, but also there are reasons that you might want to have those goods today. The common example is consumer electronics. You can always make do with your current one, they are not essential for life and arguably they don't increase your productivity at all. Even though they are a net loss to begin with, and you can buy the same item for half the price if you just wait half a year, you still buy it.

Electrum supports specifying the wallet file from the command line, but I'm not sure how many people use it. By all means it's not an essential feature.
However, it's much easier to switch between Electrum wallets than Satoshi wallets, so it is a better fit for people who actually use multiple wallets. You can even launch multiple instances of Electrum with different wallet files.
Multiple wallets are useful for anonymity purposes, i.e. to make sure coins from different identities don't mix. I have a clean wallet like that, which I keep the coins that are not connected to any of my identities. Separate savings wallets with different passwords might also be useful as a measure against theft, but fast-switching isn't actually needed in that case.

One reason is to avoid regulations that just don't make sense. If I have a golden watch, I can leave it to my son as inheritance. If I have money in the bank, my son will have to pay 5%-10% inheritance tax to be able to access it, and will have to do a ton of paperwork beforehand. (I just checked and spouses aren't entitled to any inheritance where I live, lol, good to know. So add lawyer fees.)
So, my options are, store as gold or store as BTC. Keeping it all in Bitcoin might not make a lot of sense, as you said, but I'd definitely keep some (I guess the same is true for gold, since it has other weaknesses). If this becomes a convention, in the future it might make more sense.
This is just an example though. I think there might be a lot of reasons to keep some money in a brainwallet and share it with people you trust, besides it being so cool.

It's **not** a question of security.
If your computer is compromised, you won't be able to securely access an online wallet securely. Your money will be stolen exactly the same way it would be in the case of a local wallet. There is one single point of failure in the case of a locally maintained wallet, there are two single points of failure in the remotely maintained one.
The only reason you might consider an online wallet is convenience. You will be able to access your keys regardless of which device you're using. Most clients don't run multi-platform and are not lightweight.
Plus, online wallets do back-up your money, instead of you doing it. However, since you yourself don't have access to their backups in case they disappear, I think it cancels out. Having them send you a backup of your wallet and e-mailing your wallet to yourself is practically the same effort.
So, my suggestion is, use an online wallet only to "test it out" and then switch to a local one as soon as you decide using it. Or else, use a local client directly.
The main [Bitcoin client]( is very easy to install and use. One drawback could be the downloading of the blockchain. Though it's doing it much faster in the newest versions.
If you are looking for a lightweight client, I suggest [Electrum]( It's ready right after install; the block chain is preserved on a server, but your wallet is in your own machine. *You need to backup your wallet yourself.* It uses a deterministic scheme to create your wallet, so once you take a backup you don't need to do it again. Redundancy is important though. Also, since you can also back-up your generation seed, you can even restore your wallet if you forget your encryption password.

Sure, that equation is true anywhere, not only the Internet. For instance I made a video game in early 90's, which became pretty popular in my country back then, but I moved on to other "exciting" stuff. Looking back, I can't tell you how absurd my decisions have been. However, if I hadn't been this kind of person, I wouldn't have worked on a video game in the first place when I was 17. I'm imagining the same is true for zhoutong and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:55:38
That's right. But that's an additional cost. That's why I'm taking about heuristics.
Please also keep in mind that you can't spend the same money twice within the game itself, so if you want to double spend it, you need to find a secondary target to deceive. So, while creating 1000 double-spends may be attempted on a double target, a single 1000-fold spend (or even a quadruple for that matter) is both technically and politically impossible (and would hurt the game a single-spend-worth anyway).
So, to summarize the cost; you need to be able to double spend zero-confirmation transactions, which is no easy feat. You need to be able to create thousands of accounts without getting detected. You need to be able to run that many instances in parallel (again, without getting detected, probably through thousands of different proxies), and find something in-game that you can use all this technology on to fraud. You also need to find at least one secondary target that needs to fit the criteria. All this while risking a lot of your own money.
One thing to think about is, as I said, the in-game counterpart of this fraud. I imagine you can't use this money to purchase in-game thingies for instance, because they can easily be removed if the transaction doesn't confirm till a deadline. The most likely target would be automated gambling machines. As an additional measure, these machines could accept your transactions instantly and let you play, but pay back your reward after all your transactions confirm. However I don't think it would come to this because the attack is already implausible.
I would be much more worried about transaction costs.

As others have said, it has been removed for good reason; with an ordinary CPU, generating a block now would take around 10 years on average, if the difficulty were to stay constant.
With a good set of GPU's, you could start generating some decent amount of coins, you could maybe even profit if you manage to get it right.
However, _it's not worth the hassle_! If you already have a good graphics card and just want to test how mining works, I'd recommend cgminer and p2pool. Otherwise spending your time on doing something else to earn coins is a much better investment of your time and is actually better for the Bitcoin economy.

Bitcoin is a unit of account, there is nothing in the system that corresponds to "a bitcoin".

I agree that you should keep the balance in your actively used wallets low. Accidents happen. You can accidentally shout out your password while drunk, your device can get compromised, etc.
However, I don't see sufficient reason to keep an encrypted wallet in a safe. I'm keeping thousands of coins in more or less publicly accessible places, including my smartphone, my e-mail account (which I guess is equivalent to the cloud), all hosts I control, etc. It's pretty much impossible for someone to brute-force my passwords. The only thing I'm mindful of is to use symmetric encryption (with long passwords I can remember), though I don't even care which cipher is actually used.

No one can say with 100% certainty that you will get your money back.
My personal opinion is, that you will probably get it back. The situation is messy, but the money they lost isn't huge. The problem is the database and open positions. As you are asking only for your deposit (and not some speculative earning from an open position), and assuming you have proven that the account is yours, I would expect to get it back.
These things take a long time. Sometimes years. However, time runs fast in Bitcoin land, so I'd say the whole affair will be more or less concluded in a couple of months.

So, if I understood correctly, you downloaded the default client from bitcoin.org, created a wallet, encrypted it and then forgot the password.
If so, no, you can't recover the coins without the password, unless you've somehow backed up the private keys or unencrypted wallet. You might try to brute force the password if it's very short or you remember some details about it.
If they were recoverable, the wallet wouldn't be theft-resistant.
If you don't know whether the wallet is encrypted or not, just place the wallet file where it should be and launch the client. You should see your balance. Now, go to the "Receive Coins" tab and click on "New Address". If it's asking for a password, then yeah, your wallet is encrypted.

Is there a limit price where bitcoins are not usable anymore? No. If the exchange rates are relatively stable, the exact numbers matter not. The only danger of one entity controlling huge amounts is their ability to dictate the rates.
Can they buy the majority of coins? What would you do if you wanted to buy 5 million bitcoins today? Maybe with enough perseverance and loads and loads of money, they might be able to. However it would get difficult very fast.
What would that accomplish? I say not much. You can cause price instability with far less money; I'm not sure controlling the number of coins after a certain degree wouldn't change much. If your intention is to damage the network, you can do it with even less money.
Furthermore, you'd be directly funding highly resourceful people who came up with Bitcoin in the first place, with billions and billions of dollars.  It would be most welcome.

The answer could be not requiring confirmations for casual transactions.
The game is a controlled environment and that by itself reduces the risk of double spending (e.g. game wallet can be separate/embedded and public keys can be synced with the server, which allows throttling payments per user). You could even identify (and maybe authenticate) users by key, which would make accounting very easy.
Furthermore, although double spending with no confirmations is cheaper than with confirmations, it's still very hard to perform and will not likely ever be worth it for micro-transactions. Confirmation requirement can be made effective for larger transactions (e.g. greater than 100 USD), which don't take place very often.
Of course some measures need to be taken on the server side to prevent getting surrounded by malicious nodes, but that is pretty straightforward.

* Not sure what you mean, so I'll give several answers:
 * You don't need to convert "real" money into Bitcoin, you can earn bitcoins directly, in which case they might be truly anonymous depending on how you make them.
 * You can convert Bitcoin to "real" money too. Since exchange is not a concern (at least right now), there is no reason to avoid converting to Bitcoin. If you need Bitcoin for something, you buy it. If not, you don't need to.
 * If you don't need Bitcoin, but asking if you should buy in as an investment tool, I can't answer that. The default answer is, Bitcoin is a risky investment, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. I have some Bitcoins saved on the side and I try not to spend it all. My rationale is, it has a good chance to succeed, and if even if the market stays like this, I have use for it already (buying services, gifts, etc.). Me preferring Bitcoin is good for the economy too, and don't have any particular disadvantage for me.
 * Control your own money.
* Bitcoin mining doesn't produce any results that can be utilized externally, because there is no currently known calculation that is both useful in that way and also meet the criteria for a distributed notary system. However, it's not useless at all. It serves the function of a notary, and you can do a lot of things with this, which are not restricted to currencies. If there were an algorithm that could produce externally useful results and accomplish this at the same time, Bitcoin would probably switch to that.
* People who own it, utilizing it. Offer services for Bitcoin, use services with Bitcoin. If we make it advantageous for ourselves, people will surely follow.

Store the bitcoins in your mind: Use a single, long phrase to generate all your bitcoin addresses. It's practically as mobile as you, no need to rely on a data file. There are services and programs that support this.
Plus, for foolproof security, you soon will be able to use two different address sources (wallet data, pass phrase, pin code, whatever), which you would need to use on two different devices (e.g. pin code at store + an SMS confirmation), so that using a virus infected device would not put you at risk (i.e. both sources would need to be compromised by the same party in order for them to steal your money).

I agree with others' recommendations. Use Electrum. You only need to store your seed safely (no need to update the backups every ~200 spends), you can use the same wallet on multiple computers and you don't have to maintain a copy of the block chain. If you are going to keep a copy of your seed on a live computer, I suggest you put it in an encrypted file and don't access it unless you need to; but keep a copy of it offline too to be safe.
You may still want to backup your Electrum wallet to keep your labels though. Or you can always assume labels are temporary.
In either case (Electrum, the default "Satoshi" client or with any other wallet), always use wallet encryption feature of the program. If you are going to make a backup of the wallet file on a publicly accessible location (which includes anywhere on the internet, however private), I suggest you encrypt the file a second time with your favorite program (7zip, gpg, truecrypt, etc.) with a different password before you do so. (This is because you can change your local password if it's compromised, but you can't be sure your backups haven't been accessed even if you update them. Backups should always be fire and forget.)
It's also crucial to rehearse the recovery process so that you trust the system you use. The totality of this process shouldn't take more than minutes anyway.
*Less newbie friendly items (nothing important really):*
Using the Satoshi client doesn't have a lot of advantages over Electrum, though there are two things to consider. You are helping the network by relaying transactions, and it's the standard implementation (which may or may not make it less susceptible to bugs).
Electrum also has the disadvantage that the server you prefer to use may associate the addresses you use with your IP.
Both can be remedied at once by running an Electrum server yourself. This is the most newbie unfriendliest item, and I'm not suggesting you run an Electrum server, but this might give some insight into how things work.

"Physically" is correct in that context, since if we could have fast enough computers that specific security would break. It's protected by the fact that physics doesn't allow it. Pure mathematics doesn't care about complexity.
It is incorrect in the sense that you aren't necessarily protected against physical access. But I guess that's only a nuance.
However I suspect the quote is about asymmetric key cryptography, so I'm not sure it's relevant to scarcity. Theymos' explanation is insightful and correct though.

It doesn't matter how many characters it consists of when you accidentally type it in an IRC window. Keyloggers don't care either. While you may try the motto "don't decrypt while intoxicated", I'd recommend you use a secondary level of encryption for your back-ups.

Bitcoin isn't a magical solution to all. I think the key point here is the ease of set-up Bitcoin allows. At the same time it doesn't disallow any other mechanism. AFAIK it will soon support various different types of transactions, including reversible ones and escrow, without the need for a third party service.
What I want in the future is to be able to transfer value to any identity with a tele-connection. Why? World is getting smaller, the guy in prison in the US or the 12 year old kid in Iran will become less and less irrelevant to me. There are more things that have value in easily transferable form. At the same time, regulations are being put in place to be able to control as much as possible. Authorities might not be aiming to disrupt business, but they can only operate within their own definitions, which drags us towards their normal. What business means is changing, or at least can change, but this kind of top-down attitude might not allow us to shift towards a more optimized form of living and interacting throughout the world. It's like how travelling and assimilating is getting easier while crossing borders and immigrating is not.
If we are to achieve this, a pure currency seems to have more advantages than a web if IOU's like Ripple. And I'm guessing any such currency would have the same practical problems with Bitcoin. Since there doesn't seem to be a radically better approach than Bitcoin for doing this anyway, I think building on it and spreading the usage is the best thing we can do to achieve the goal.
And tangentially, most of the arguments against Bitcoin seem to be that it doesn't particularly allow better ways of doing things we do, and it's already easy enough to do them anyway. The problem with centralization isn't that you have to think more about how the system works, what the extent of your rights are and what kinds of things you can accomplish within the system.  The problem is, you are unable to think that. It's obscure by nature, and you can't do anything to change it anyway (this aspect feels like the difference between proprietary and open standards). If I want to be able to (not necessarily want to) do things that I'm not already doing, the choice seems obvious.
It's a pity that arguments for freedom, privacy and such are always convoluted; you can only back your arguments with generalizations and give examples about things that don't exist in practice.

Some of it, maybe 0.5M (wild guess) is in investments (loans, mining companies, etc.) and commerce (considerable, but spread too thin to be noticed). Maybe we should make a blind-signature based system for commerce sites to privately submit their volumes to be able to make a general assessment.

That, I agree.


For Africoin? Maybe. For Africa? I don't know why it would be the case. It may very well result in the opposite.
I really get the concern, but am unconvinced that the value of individual coins matter "in the long run". Especially when there is no *naturally privileged* external force that's determined to fuck you over by playing with their value.
Massive Bitcoin adoption in Africa can lead to Bitcoin becoming a powerful currency of commerce, and Africa can benefit from this immensely. Africoin on the other hand, may lead to a new level of segregation. Not only it will endorse the requirement to trade in external currencies, it would render the whole cryptocurrency thing less useful, including Afrocoin.
These are all wild speculations of course. I just don't think the advantages of a new chain are so clear cut. I'm not saying this because I'm an early adopter, I'm saying this because I know that I'll also be an early adopter of Afrocoin. ;)

The same baggage can be implemented on top of Bitcoin and can result in the same outcomes, but this doesn't mean you'd have the same situation. As a user, you have an option. As users have an option, the banking systems have a limited amount of power. The structures which cause undesirable results cannot survive without a reinforcing mechanism, which doesn't exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
I don't think it's required that everyone has to run a fully independent node for the system to be perfectly decentralized. The only requirement is that anyone *can* run a fully independent node.

In the end, you will want to transact with the outside world. You will have island money to USD exchanges, external bank accounts which transactions must go through, etc. You could try to bring a bank branch on the island, but Bitcoin seems like the ideal alternative solution. Besides, even if you do business only through banks, you're pretty much on their mercy. Another problem is the relative values of imported stuff and island produce; you will most likely end up indexing the island money to outside currencies anyway, or deal with other sorts of currency management issues.

A "from" address (as stated in step 2) almost never has any meaning in the context of Bitcoin. If you are to distinguish different transactions coming to a single address, you can use transaction IDs. However, since it's transparent, I could try to detect transaction IDs and send an e-mail to you before the real originators. In certain cases, they may not even be able to prove they've sent it. I can also think of other scams that I won't reveal here.
As dsterry said, it's best to give a separate addresses to each participant and identify them with mail addresses. Maybe you can start with txids or manual address generation and automate it later. The easiest way I can think of to automate it is using a Bitcoin payment processor, but I don't have enough experience with them to recommend one. Check out [bit-pay.com]( and [bitwillet.com]( [bitcoinpayflow.com]( looks like the best fit but seems to require a bit of coding on your side.

For all practical situations, having a dedicated mining station doesn't change whether your customers can double-spend, therefore they'd still need to wait if you think it is necessary.
However, I would trust 0-confirmation transactions either face-to-face or with returning online customers up to a few hundred dollars. The most plausible danger seems to be the Finney attack, and it's not really that easy to pull off.
On the other hand, in a situation where you are selling a ten thousand dollar antique vase to a tourist, you might want to wait for a few confirmations, which can be annoying depending on the circumstances. Green addresses might be of help there.

What I mean by an external service is some entity who holds the coins until claimed. It doesn't have to have a web interface, but it probably would be more convenient than having to install a browser add-on. If reddit doesn't provide an authentication interface, a link unique to the user could be sent via PM. This way, every reddit user would be assigned a single unique Bitcoin address upon receiving a tip. They can change their address and set an account password if they want.
Just an idea though.

If the blockchain is not corrupt, you should be able upgrade without a glitch. It will continue downloading new blocks over it. If unsure, you can run the new client with the -checkblocks and -rescan options. Encryption is still not enabled by default, and the client will load your old wallet without issue.
You won't be able to downgrade though, so it's a good idea to preserve a back-up of your old wallet even after the upgrade, in case you'll need to do that for some reason.

Yes, most of the debate would boil down to the pointlessness of the article itself. Since the magnitude is arbitrary (including Bitcoin), eligibility becomes the central issue. That's why putting Bitcoin there might not look so good.
The article might be of use if one can assume that currency regulators aim their unit to make sense for person-to-person exchange of daily necessities (water, bread, etc.). The intended unit value would therefore converge to a certain range. In this case, Bitcoin actually is not of interest, since there was no intended unit value to begin with.
I'm sure we'll be seeing 1000 USD corresponding to 1 BTC soon enough and it might look a little awkward. ;)
Anyway, maybe something along these lines regarding Bitcoin may be inserted as a note in the article.

Investors most definitely are. Day-to-day users' knowledge would vary.


It's always a mystery. Around 200 thousand coins seem to change hands everyday, in about 50 thousand transactions.
Silk Road and similar sites seem to have a huge throughput (millions of dollars monthly turnover), and I bet it causes a rise in anticipation of utility for investors as well. Some (I think a minor number) investors might have been introduced into Bitcoin for investing in HYIPs (some might be Ponzi schemes, some definitely aren't, some probably in between). However, I think Bitcoin is gradually penetrating online lives, being used more and more for widely different value transfer purposes, from donations to game currency trades.
More importantly, the market is beginning to acknowledge that Bitcoin might have some sustained usability. It's still not certain, but if it is here to stay, it may become a common vehicle for savings. This makes me think of the theory that gold's place as an investment tool is somewhat dependent on its utility as a metal, even though its use value is very small compared to its exchange rate. If Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, why not park some of your money on it? The fact that it's impossible for any entity to stop you from using it has an extra appeal.
This is all speculation though. We might discover that a totally different factor was causing it all along.

That is the obvious solution. In-game currency can be called Bitcoin as well, just as MtGox calls the deposits Bitcoin. But actually they are not, they are deposits. By the way, good old witcoin.org had done something interesting by calling deposits witcoins.
Developers can take the fees from these deposits, or else make money in other ways. Second Life is an interesting concept where connecting is free but owning a plot isn't. It's not a game of course, but I can imagine a game setting allowing that sort of thing. You can always sell in-game material to the players.
An alternative solution could be where the game client itself is also a thin bitcoin server/client. In-game transactions would be done over the Bitcoin network itself. Kinda sub-optimal, but might work if it fits into the game setting itself. Again, instead of fees, revenue can be generated by selling in-game material.

Disclaimer: I'm using the term laundry in a general sense, it isn't limited to the context of illegal trade (i.e. privacy concerns).
Money laundering works this way: you give dirty money, you get clean money back. In Bitcoin context, since the relation of these two transactions remain outside the blockchain, it's only possible to relate them if the entity that sends you the clean coins are cooperating with the investigating party. If you are using multiple such entities, it quickly approaches impossible.
The only problem is finding an exchanger who is willing to launder those coins. When you use a general purpose service, it is highly probable that you'll get other dirty coins back. You have a lot of deniability, since you aren't actually connected to that crime, but it might still get you in trouble. Best discourse would be to find someone outside the jurisdiction/reach of said investigator.

I wouldn't keep any at MtGox.
Assuming you have created an encrypted wallet file (via Satoshi client, Electrum, etc.), simply re-encrypt the file with your favourite software (gpg, truecrypt, 7zip, whatever) using a secondary good password you won't forget (write some clues down if you must) and upload them to multiple remote locations (your e-mail server, dropbox, personal web server, etc.). Rehearse the recovery process, preferably on a clean computer, before deleting any original wallets (if you are even planning such a thing). As ZhouTong said, that last part is very important, even if you know what you're doing.
No need to split up in this scenario, but you'd probably feel the urge to update all these backups once in a while. That's why splitting off a smaller current wallet could have some practical benefits. Also, you might be left with no choice but to access some bitcoins from an insecure environment, in which case a keeping a smaller wallet file could be a saver as well.
@_date: 2012-11-29 22:59:04
I'm assuming the money is never "in the game" in the first place. You need to bounce the money back to yourself from other agents somehow. That requires an automated mechanism, doesn't it (e.g. the gambling machines)? In such cases the withdrawals could be limited to confirmed deposits.
I agree that such secondary measures would be necessary if there is a mechanism in the game that would make all this worthwhile.

Attacker is just a technical term here. Doesn't matter if it's law enforcement. But since we are good guys...
And what form of laundering does hide the changing of hands? That residual information is always preserved somewhere. With Bitcoin, you can spread that info all around the globe and fast.
So you bought some coins from an exchange (real identity, logs, etc.), sent them to an online mixing wallet, then switched coins with someone (preferably from a different country), who sent them to a different mixing wallet in a third jurisdiction. All this may take a few hours but doesn't require more than a few minutes of attention. Do you really think there is a practical way to trace back the resulting coins?

For me, as with everything Bitcoin, the minimal risk introduced by GLBSE deciding to close its doors (IMO very low probability) is worth the reduction of hassle for me (dealing with banks, loss of privacy, limits and whatnot) and doing away with the cost of external regulation. It's literally a few clicks to send/withdraw money from the site and I can do virtually anything, including creating companies myself, in mere minutes.

We're on the same page regarding the State.
On the other hand, as I explained, your perception of "violation" already requires property rights. If I don't recognize them, and try to take/use/claim your property, there is no common context where this conflict may be resolved. If you use the naturality card, the proponent of property rights would be at a disadvantage, since associating personhood with physical body is far easier than defining ownership.
My personal view is that right to property is a good idea. But it's still a choice and there are many ways to live, most of which conflict. That's why I also agree to your insight about why Bitcoin is so beautiful.

A site that accumulates and distributes microdonations.
Let's say I'm developing a tiny bitcoin client, making use of libbitcoin and qt, and I want 20% of all donations to go to libbitcoin and 10% to qt. The site will accumulate donations until they are worth transferring and then distribute. The graph could be very complicated (might even contain loops), and should allow collective management. If this were huge enough, there would be more incentive to write useful libraries than user facing applications.
Another, more basic example could be partners receiving mining revenue from p2pool. The system could accumulate the output and send dividends. I think something like this already exists though. I'm thinking more of an extensible, visual and collaborative web-like thingie.

Well, there are countless solutions, so it depends on your own use cases really.
The easiest way to use Bitcoin would be putting your active wallet on the device you think is the least vulnerable. For instance, my wife is using a Nokia N900 and I installed Electrum on it. The wallet is encrypted and I don't really expect a keylogger to find its way to that system. Electrum uses a deterministic wallet, which means that she can generate the entire wallet just from a single number. I've recorded that number in a few secure places, and there isn't anything else I need to do really. I recently copied the wallet to her Android tablet, and since you can use the same Electrum wallet in multiple places simultaneously, she can just spend on one device and the transaction will instantly appear on the other one. I was worried that Android somehow would accidentally record the password but it seems it's not the case. :)
If you trust that your desktop isn't compromised, then use it. I'd re-encrypt my wallet with a second password for off-site backups just in case though (truecrypt is fine). For instance, if somehow your wallet password is revealed, you will be able to change the local password, but not your backups.
Regarding savings/bank wallet, you might want to consider why you are keeping it separate from your active/hot/current wallet. If you are worried that your computer might get compromised, then opening your savings wallet on the same device would remove that protection. Accessing different wallets from different devices would help in that case.

For one, if you think the fact that the money is coming from a multinational corporation by itself changes anything, you might be a bad person already. If you have a justifiable enmity against that specific corporation, that's a different matter.
Otherwise, I think it depends on the work being done. Apparently, someone somewhere thinks that the work is worth it, so how you do it should be of minimal consequence. On the other hand, this assumes some degree of innovation. Depending on what you are doing, it might border on exploitation too (submitting work that is passable but you know is useless, submitting work already done before, etc.), in which case it would be your duty to report.

I don't think people are buying their lies, and the nature of those lies are within the limit accepted in such circumstances. I'm not saying it's not wrong, it's just that they are selling a miracle machine, which gives them leeway to act in this manner. People won't be boycotting their machines any time soon.
How I see it is, there are obvious risks involved and buyers are already aware of these risks. You don't have much assurance. It's part of the equation. If anyone isn't, they should be made aware by clearly stating the facts. FUD spreading attitude is prone to divide people into camps.
BFL doesn't disclose their contact information, and they are asking for payments in advance. This tells me they need the money to be able to produce the devices, and there is a serious potential that they won't be able to.
They might not be able to deliver ASICs like they delivered FPGAs, but I don't see any plausible mechanism through that fact to convert them into scam artists. The potential they are trying to scam people is near nil. The potential they won't be able to deliver anything at all is considerably high though.

With that setup, you might generate some coins (I'm guessing 0.1-0.2 a day), which you can use to further your knowledge about the system. You won't "make money" though, not in the real sense. If your only interest is making some easy bucks by mining Bitcoin, I wouldn't bother. You can make much more coins by offering something in exchange. However, the whole mining deal can be a lot of fun too, depending on your personal interests.

Don't get your point, you go to another terminal if that one fails?
If you are on a safari, you surely could use an SMS service to send BTC via your satellite phone (if it's an old model). Otherwise use an ordinary smartphone. I'm sure a smart card is possible if you have devices with batteries, but not sure if it's very essential. You could as well use physical bitcoins (there are some in coin, card and note form), but that would be as prone to failure as ordinary cash (risks like counterfeit cash, having to trust central issuer, etc.).
These are of course about the essentials, and since Bitcoin is not widespread, are not common sense yet (i.e. getting things working at this stage is a tad harder than they can be). So if you don't like things that you aren't used to, just wait until everyone else is using it. Or depending on the outcome, maybe help a potentially world changing technology to fail by not using it.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2012-04-18 16:07:42
If you have to use an e-wallet, that's a very sane choice. blockchain.info works client-side (they can't access your money themselves, the keys are decrypted on your local computer and never leave it), so assuming your computer/connection is not compromised and you verify the source code (there is a chromium add-on to do this automatically), then it's totally safe. They also have an Android app. I'd use the secondary password feature as well, and also make an e-mail and paper back-up before sending coins there.
EDIT: The reason I'm suggesting a paper wallet is, you can always reclaim your coins even if blockchain.info shuts down, without even having to decrypt the keys. If you trust that you can decrypt the keys, an encrypted data backup is just as good (the site has e-mail and dropbox backup options for this).

I don't see any reason why the Bitcoin network or exchanges might not be able to handle such volumes.
Bitcoin doesn't operate through clearing houses, however there a multitude of established exchanges for different currencies and precious metals. I'd suggest using diverse methods of exchange, which I'm guessing would happen naturally anyway. Once you have your bitcoins, you can transfer them from peer to peer, to anyone/anywhere in the world, without involving an intermediary. That's the beauty of it.
Although there aren't many technical limits on how fast you can convert fiat currency to Bitcoin, I'm hoping it will be gradual. Buying too many bitcoins all at once might cause unnecessary fluctuations. Since you are talking about making bulk purchases, I'm guessing it would be wiser to find trusted over-the-counter sellers, instead of going through the exchanges. Finding sellers and building trust (between all parties) might require some effort, but it would be worth it.
I haven't read about the concept yet, so this might not be relevant, but one way to bring Bitcoin to the economy (without buying them) could be by letting outsiders invest on the island using Bitcoin. This could be in a kickstarter-like fashion or through a stock-exchange. Both approaches could be used for different purposes.
@_date: 2012-06-27 20:15:48
As I understand, the rationale for demurrage is to encourage spending. Which means, this currency is not designed to be held onto. One thing you can buy with it is Bitcoin. I don't think likes of Freicoin would be successful, but in a world where people use Freicoin for everyday transactions, Bitcoin would be the default storage of value. Just like real estate, gold and such in the fiat world.
That's why folks, you can only prevent the rich from getting richer by preventing them to trade or directly taking their money.

Yes, if there will be wi-fi coverage, using smartphones to exchange coins could be the norm and would actually be pretty cool. There are also alternative ways to transact/store coins if need be.
One concern that might arise is that Bitcoin is a world-wide currency. It would most definitely help the island become a commercial hub, while at the same time keeping it free from unnecessary obligations. On the other hand, world-wide markets would have a say in local pricing. It might be inevitable either way though.
Regarding investments, I was thinking about business opportunities on the island. Say, I'm a resident of the island and have a cool IT project. I can start a stock using one of the Bitcoin stock exchanges and sell shares to outside investors. I then, for instance, hire another island dweller to share the workload and pay in Bitcoin.
You can also do something like this for the initial investment, but I'm guessing it will eventually be converted to whatever currency the island is sold in, so this might be a little unnecessary if there aren't a lot of people who explicitly want to buy shares using Bitcoin (e.g. for privacy reasons).

From what I understand (correct me if I'm missing something), you haven't completely downloaded the block chain. You won't see transactions taking place without downloading the blocks that contain them. I suspect there is an in-built way to do this, but you can also compare the "blocks" field with the latest block number at  to see if your chain is up to date. Furthermore, transactions usually appear instantly in listtransactions with "confirmations" field of 0, even before they get into a block.
EDIT: Also the general sluggishness is probably related to the downloading and verification of a huge number of blocks, if your problem is really the above.

148 PetaFLOPS is a projection of an estimation. Hashing only uses integer operations so FLOPS doesn't exactly apply, and the number of operations required per "hash" isn't an exact number, but since it's larger than others by a wide margin we can easily say that the Bitcoin network is the most powerful distributed computing project as of yet.

First of all, as others have said, forget about mining, it shouldn't concern the casual user. Depending on where you live, buying them can be a pain, but more commonly it's not.
You sound like you're more interested in what Bitcoin really is or can become rather than the investment aspect, so you might be interested in earning coins rather than directly buying them. Think of the things you can offer to the community in exchange for bitcoins. I think this would be the most serious experiment.

It is a safe solution if you use the encryption feature. Re-encrypt before uploading using your favorite encryption tool (7zip, gpg, truecrypt, whatever).
It doesn't make sense to hide your doubly encrypted wallet if you aren't accessing it. If your two different passwords aren't especially weak, then you can place the file in your private backup locations. The concern should be about the circumstances where you actually decrypt it.
You don't have to make backups too often though. Electrum wallets for instance don't even need backup updates. Satoshi client needs backups at least every 100 new keys (outgoing transactions + newly created addresses).
Regardless, my wallet is copied with 'backupwallet' RPC command every hour to an external drive, encrypted, and uploaded to a remote location everyday. I also burn a CD containing my secrets every two months or so.

It is possible to get such returns without investing in illicit/unethical businesses. I actually don't believe illicit businesses are much more profitable, they are just easier and more guaranteed; not everyone can come up with a good idea to make money. But with Bitcoin, there are a lot of untapped sources. There has been some legitimate assets that increased in value 2-fold to 10-fold in mere months.

For the standard Bitcoin client's wallet, assuming you haven't [made more than a hundred transactions or created more than a hundred new addresses]( technically you should be able to fully restore all the transactions you've made after the backup. In other words, if you have used a key that  wasn't in the key pool of that wallet (which is of 100 length by default), then you're out of luck. For the casual user, weekly backups should be just fine.
For Electrum or other deterministic wallets, preserving the wallet seed or backing up the wallet once should be enough. Updates are only necessary to preserve the address book and notes.
Another good practice is to keep the bulk of your coins in a savings wallet and create redundant backups of it. That way, whatever happens (e.g. all your devices were compromised somehow), you won't lose all at the same time.

How many keys in your wallet have a balance? The most guaranteed way is to dump the keys manually and then import them to a different wallet. You can do it using "pywallet.py -dumpwallet". AFAIK you can use blockchain.info or MultiBit to import the resulting data, or use bitcoind's importprivkey call to import them one by one to a new Satoshi wallet.

Because you have to create all the books and submit to the government at least once a year, and in some countries, every month, signed by a certified accountant? Those include all bank statements.


Those aren't what I was calling expensive, for those you hire an accountant, and you have to pay a certified one anyway, at least for the signature. I'm actually guessing what sort of structure needs to be implemented  for you, as an auditor, to expect to be handed a database that contains real trade records. That would at least include a certified liable auditor planted in there at all times. As an IT person, I don't call even that reliable, and it's shown time and again that it really isn't (wife is a bank inspector for 15 years).


They are probably not required to match individual records but the totals have to match for accounting books to be consistent.








The fact that these are consistent doesn't mean they're real, and that's my only point. If I were cooking the books, I would've already created fake records for you to audit.
There is a cost attached to all these things, and it's a trade-off. There is a difference between "we don't even know who the fuck runs it" (the comment I was replying to) and "it's a registered business conforming with the local law" and "it's a registered financial institution operated according to the local and international banking regulations". You'll get the bank one at one point if there is enough demand.
What you are proposing is something in between, i.e. a business that is privately audited. I don't find it very appealing for the reasons stated. Yes, that might prove that they aren't blatantly robbing people, but I doubt that they lack the skills to hide that fact. A private audit might be a good tactic to shut the critics up though, which is also the reason it won't.

It can stabilize at certain price points if it's supported by commerce, and I suspect that speculators are aware of this fact. The market stopped trying to sell things you can already buy online and started focusing on things Bitcoin gives you a great advantage.
It's still not very rational to use Bitcoin as a long term store of value, and it won't be for a long time because of the fact that it can be cloned easily. When it's established that there is nothing in Bitcoin to quickly fix to make a better replacement, then the money could flow in.

If that was a question someone here could reliably answer, then the price would have already moved there. I don't mean that you can't have an insight to the situation though, it's just that the public opinions would cancel each other out.
My personal opinion: I don't have any idea where the price is leading, but it's apparent that volatility has increased, and therefore there is a bigger chance that you might get them at a lower exchange rate during a dip. Having said that, you should manage the situation according to your agenda. For instance, you could get a little amount at market price and then enter larger orders below market price. A dip to 7.5 is very likely, though there is a real possibility that the new support would be higher than that.

This is in fact a very good idea. However, I think you could start building this task force on a forum like bitcointalk.org, and then establish a specialized system after it gets moving.

I'm too sleepy but I'll give it a try.
The work isn't generating capital. The Bitcoin network is designed in such a way that people who help make the network secure are rewarded, to ensure that there is more incentive to protect the network than to harm it. This reward also coincides with how the currency is issued, it's kinda like a two birds with one stone situation.
To get a grip on what kind of work is done, here is a basic description of the concept: 
For starters, asserting that the process is "useless" doesn't make much sense. It's like saying a paper weight is useless because it's just sitting there. The existence of a proof-of-work system helps with a lot of things, but the amount of work done is also very important. An attacker less powerful than the totality of the Bitcoin network is very unlikely to succeed in disrupting it.
Proof-of-work is a replacement to trusted authorities. It creates easily provable but impossible to forge witness accounts. There is no method that I know of that can be used instead of proof-of-work to create a distributed notary system, without needing any trusted authority.
What the miner does is simply to look for a number that satisfies a condition. The condition itself is purely defined by the network, i.e. it has no other use. There is no known "impure" (or "useful") function that can satisfy the necessary criteria, so we're out of luck. You can find more about why it is so if you dig deeper into the bitcointalk forums.

I think trolls are very damaging to an online community, and even though bitcointalk was hurt a lot by trolls, moderators didn't take action against them. There isn't any methodical way to identify trolls, so we have to endure them. It can't be a free community otherwise. And sometimes the drama is entertaining.
But when a troll starts systematically abusing the system, I think the overflow can be safely called spamming and be acted against. Since Atlas puts a lot of effort into these, he's in a gray area though. I agree with either the ban or a better ignoring technology.

If this gets wide acceptance, the operators could allow payments to go through the wifi payment portal. They allow credit card payments, so why not just allow a certain protocol? Of course, this is too optimistic, because it's almost at the same degree as all operators accepting Bitcoin universally.
Keeping on with the optimism, I imagine if it becomes widely accepted for a lightweight Bitcoin protocol (e.g. stratum) to go through in general, it would be immensely helpful both for the operators' profit and Bitcoin.

Complementary to this tutorial, I'd like to add that bitcoind has a **backupwallet** directive that lets you copy the wallet safely while the client is running. It's probably not necessary if there aren't any wallet operations going on during backup though.

Others have already explained the situation, I only like to clarify the key elements.
The block chain is a ledger which keeps records of transactions, which in effect say which address has what number of coins. The chain is self-consistent and creating an "alternative" chain is really really hard, though not impossible. There is nothing in the system that prefers one alternative over the others by itself, so the majority always wins. Minority alternative histories are quickly discarded because building new blocks on them gets harder and harder, you basically need to compete with all the network by yourself.
So, the consistency of the system depends on the fact that rewriting history is very hard, and majority of mining power will always agree on a single history.
Addresses themselves are based on public key cryptography. Addresses are basically very huge numbers. There is a mathematical trick which can be used to prove that you possess the key or keys to that number without revealing those keys, which is called signing (you might have heard digital signatures before). Using this trick, it's easy to prove that you "own" the coins at that address, and sign a transaction moving those coins to some other address. This signature, with the directive, goes in the block chain.
It's impossible to spoof these "private" keys, so it's impossible to spend someone else's coins, *even if* you could rewrite history.
In essence, the brilliance in Bitcoin lies in the fact that no one has to trust any other particular party. You only need to trust that the majority wants the system to function properly.
@_date: 2012-04-12 09:32:04
You're right. Though I meant that multi-sig could replace the letters themselves, not the institution behind them. There still is a signing authority, and its responsibilities, etc.
Multi-sig can be used when the buyer can pay fully and escrow services act as arbiters. In the case where the bank insures the payment, it can initiate it itself. I know these signatures aren't binding in the real world, but would at least serve as proof that the funds are available. If the financial institution behind it is not an established one, might make sense.
@_date: 2012-07-28 10:35:58
I agree, though network effect can only depress to a degree. A counter effect (such as advertising power) or things that cannot be changed without replacing the whole system stay as a threat. I myself think that both of those are non-issues but apparently I don't trust it 100% since I still keep some of my wealth in other currencies. Bitcoin is still more of a risky investment than a store of value. I'm positive that this will change but it needs time. This, in turn, is also a non-issue, since everyone can take full advantage of it as a currency with or without it becoming a trusted store of value.

Maybe the term "block reward" should include the fees to avoid confusion. There is always some reward for solving a block, even if no new coins are created.

Ah, well in your scenario, coins don't correspond to energy usage. That's what I meant by determining the energy usage. For instance if I print application specific chips, which is hardly a technological advance, I'll consume much less energy while producing the same amount of coins. Also, the energy "encapsulated" in older coins would be usually higher than the newer ones.
I guess their price can fall well below production costs though, so I stand corrected. It might work if there were a way to tie coin value to energy consumption.

I don't think you got what I'm describing.
I'm talking about using Bitcoin without waiting for confirmations. That's instant (less than 10 seconds), and as decentralized as it gets. No trusted parties necessary, no centralized wallets, no shared private keys. Volume is not an issue, though transaction fees might be.
If you initiate transactions in-game (through the local client), and associate users with their public keys (or identify them with their signatures), then you can decide, in-game, whether to wait for a confirmation or not using some user-based heuristics. I think the overwhelming majority of transactions will not require a confirmation, and the double spend risk will be minimal.
The heuristic may be as simple as "if the totality of unconfirmed transactions from a key (or a set of keys) is above X USD, begin waiting for confirmations for transactions spent from this key", which in effect would prevent people from exchanging stuff more than X worth on average per 10 minutes.

What is the degree of anonymity required, and how soon do you need them? Regardless, I'll list some ideas:
* Find someone in your area and buy them face-to-face with cash. (see 
* Buy some Bitcoins (via Intersango, etc.) and then find some trusted entity (a remote person met online who doesn't know you, a laundering service, etc.) who's willing to switch coins with you.
* The same as above, but don't bother with switching, just send them to various services (anonymous accounts) which store all coins in one place and then withdraw them after a few hours. This will add enough deniability even if you get some of the same coins back, which you probably won't.
* Sell something or provide a service.
You can of course use multiple of these options. :)
Bitcoin software is very straightforward, but it needs to download the chain before you can start using it properly. There are alternative clients/web services which you can start using right away. There are concepts related Bitcoin which can be confusing at first but actually are simple after you get familiar with them. What part of the client are you having difficulties with?

If the server gets compromised, it can send a false script that can log your password and private keys, so you in fact have to have some trust (though installing the blockchain.info validation plug-in is a partial remedy). That's the reason e-wallets aren't usually what's recommended for newbies. However, if some key measures are taken I don't think it's ultimately insecure either.
Foolproof ways to secure your money is being developed (i.e. two-factor authentication directly over the network without having to trust an authenticating party), so this security recommendation bombardment to newbies should hopefully end soon. :)

Well, if you use one of the shopping cart interfaces, the only thing you'd need to do is to install bitcoind, which is something you would almost always want to do manually.

Sort of. Not sure about "fast buck" as the main motivator, though even if you do it for the betterment of mankind, the eagerness to get in early results in the same catastrophe.


Most money in the world is digital, but even though there are security breaches here and there in the banking world, we don't see heists like these very often. Maybe the biggest reason is that Bitcoin related services strive too much to create as little friction as they can. This and similar mistakes are all around the place because no one is running an operation that plans to become profitable in 5 to 10 years. Everyone is concerned about the imminent competition, which I think should almost be irrelevant.


I think the oldest services which survived have learned a lot of lessons, and there seems to be more interest in Bitcoin from entities which are more experienced about security and finance. I'm positive that services that "do it the right way" will dominate in the very near future.

Maintaining a copy of the blockchain and acting as a relay node is helpful to the network. That's the primary reason I'm running the desktop client, and I find it counterproductive to advocate against it. It's also kind of the reference implementation, so it will have all the mature features.
My second preference is Electrum. With it, I don't have to keep my keys online and also share the same wallet across several devices, including my desktop. Best of both worlds. There are a multitude of servers I can choose from in case one of them goes offline, and I can run my own if privacy is a concern.
Third preference would be blockchain.info though. It has pretty decent features. I use it whenever I need to access coins through a private key. I like how backing up your wallet is just one click. I don't like keeping my keys online, or having to rely on a single server. I also wouldn't use it, or any other online/lightweight client when privacy is a concern.

I know what you mean, but it is only one aspect of currency. If that were a general rule, we'd need to separate the concepts of *store of value* and *currency*, which prove to be very hard to do. In practice, when you keep your "stored" wealth as Euros, you are using it as an investment vehicle.
Everything changes in value relative to one another, so if your stored wealth is a thing, then it will inevitably change in value. It is only a mere tool in the sense you use when the actual exchange happens. Maybe for practical purposes, the day-to-day amount you hold can also be exempted from being called an "investment".
The reason currencies change in value is a problem with the concept of accumulating wealth. It's neither a government conspiracy, nor a design issue of some p2p protocol.
I'm not advocating for or against storing wealth as bitcoins. Just wanted to point out that you are storing it anyway.

Apparently your transaction is confirmed, and that's all you need to know. You don't need to understand the excess jargon.
After the transaction has been confirmed, it's up to the service to include the sum in your account. In this case, it seems to be taking too long for SR to acknowledge your transaction. The issue is not related to the Bitcoin network or the block chain.
It has been reported before that deposits to SR might take a long time to show up, so I'd wait a few hours more and then take this issue to them. (Also check that it's not a phishing site.)

Your questions about development will all be answered if you do some reading on how opensource projects work. Basically anyone can do anything with the code, but people will use the version they trust the most. Currently that version is led by Gavin Andresen, which AFAIK took over the repository from Satoshi himself (basically Satoshi gave the necessary keys to him to maintain his code repository). But there are other clients that are gaining ground as well. Although the people who maintain bitcoin.org are effectively the same group of people who are setting the standards, there isn't any mechanism that can enforce people to use their client or standards. Therefore the system runs mostly on merit rather than other sorts of authority. Plus, there isn't a particular measure to keep anyone from joining in.
People not downloading updates should not be other people's problem in principle. If most people aren't downloading a fix and that is affecting the system's health, then the community would start an awareness campaign. There is nothing else to be done really. The Satoshi client has a feature that can display warning messages, but can't do anything else.

What is the proposed mechanism? If you somehow suggest that people are buying Bitcoin using an anonymous transfer and then selling them again in their own name, fully paying the capital gains taxes, I don't find it very plausible. For one, it doesn't explain the increase in exchange rate.
If you are suggesting that people are buying bitcoins using "dirty" money, could be of course, though it's not exactly laundering but an ordinary investment, maybe with a laundering motive included for the long term.

The organization will endorse international small businesses and students, but still be be open to anyone.

You don't have to even be online to receive a transaction. You can even accept transactions to your brain wallet. It's when you make a transaction that it can possibly be detected, and then it's not that easy to distinguish whether someone's relaying a transaction or initiating it. Also, you still don't need to reveal your IP to make a transaction (you could run a full or lightweight client through tor for instance).
You can even submit raw transactions to a service to be relayed. Paste it here and I'm sure someone would pass it to the network. ;)

The presumed difference is, this would allow the attacker to spend any address. Common sense is that whatever the exploit, an attacker can never make a transaction without the corresponding private keys. This is the most basic reason you can trust the Bitcoin network, and why a 51% attack isn't worth it. I'm not sure if this exploit is really practically possible (can't wrap my head around what the response of the network would be, the block should immediately become orphaned), but it's at least a reminder for not keeping too many coins (&gt;10000?) in one address.

I'm assuming you would be running a single [bitcoind]( instance (per cluster at least, if you are operating in more than one location), and your program(s) will interface with bitcoind through JSON-RPC.
The call you're interested in is `getwork`. You can build anything you like on top of that if you need a different interface.
You don't need to derive the work directly from the Bitcoin network, it wouldn't give you any advantage whatsoever.

They have to reject it because of the implications of both Bitcoin per se, and the fact that something like Bitcoin can succeed.
I don't think the common people are likely to hate the idea of Bitcoin. I told many people about it and they either like it or don't care about it. There is no reason to hate something that's benign. No one has to use it, no one will ever have to use it. Everyone that's a practical part of the human society can understand this very basic fact without having to spell it out.
It's actively hated by the people who think they are the embodiment of the human cultural progress. Which constitute the majority of nerd community. They think they are at higher positions in the human cultural hierarchy, and only want to look up. They already know how it all works, and you are naturally wrong just by challenging it. They *get* how it has to work while going through their soul crushing formal education, which is likely to be 20 years for an average mature nerd.

That guide must be outdated. 100 MB recommendation is a bit silly as well.
If you encapsulate the wallet file in an encrypted volume, you can then safely copy that volume to (possibly remote) backup locations. It provides a secondary measure (you can change your local password in case it's compromised, but not your back-ups) and also prevents people seeing the balance or even detecting it's even a wallet, which may significantly reduce potential attacks (assuming if you didn't name it "mybitcoinfortune.truecrypt").
Why not encrypt the file directly though? I suspect it maybe is easier to do it that way on Windows, I don't know. Another case is where wallet.dat is a symlink to a file inside the encrypted drive, though I prefer to run bitcoind 24/7 and use the backupwallet command to create copies.

The problem is, you don't know how it will evolve when you create the system. I've been following Bitcoin for some time now, and at no point the people involved did know what the next development will be. If  you check the [historical difficulty]( you'll see that it remained 1 for half of its history as of now.
With your scheme, we don't even know if anyone ever would adopt Bitcoin. We don't know where to start the difficulty, when to lower it, and then when to let it free. Will the durations be 1 month? 1 year? 10 years? How about difficulties? 1? 10? 1000000? Would someone find a way to hash faster? Remember, GPUs weren't being used until mid-2010. Would Bitcoin be adopted instantly by the whole world in 2009? Would it be discovered as an obscure technology around 2019?
Even if you boot a new one now, you don't know how it will evolve. If you don't have time to try that, just investigate what happened with the other alternative chains and make a mental experiment. Try to pinpoint the exact constants you'd use to make the distribution flawless.
(EDIT; add this to the above experiment: People don't believe in it until it proves itself. It proves itself when it becomes beneficial to people who are involved, who actually made it something out of nothing. After that, you can't go back and remove that advantage. Risk takers always have a higher gain in everything that's successful, and higher loss in everything unsuccessful. If you could take an average, pioneers would be at a loss. That's the only reason people didn't adopt, and still hasn't adopted Bitcoin.)
I think the curve Satoshi chose to use was the safest one. I even think it's still the safest one if you wanted to restart today. I'd probably adjust the reward more often though, but even this comment is premature without passing through that phase several times.

If you are using an encrypted wallet with a good password, I don't see why not. Though I explicitly encrypt it (for a second time) before backing up, in case I accidentally write my password on IRC or got it stolen somehow. You can change your local passwords but it's a good habit to assume all remote backups are immutable. So encapsulate your wallet before backing up. If you want to automate it (to not have to enter password every time you make a backup), you could use asymmetric encryption (like what GnuPG provides).

In his defense, there hasn't been many successful "ambitious" Bitcoin businesses. AFAIR he wrote, or helped write, the first command-line client for GLBSE, which was the right way to go for the exchange. If genjix was active in the business, I'm sure we wouldn't be in this mess right now.

You can safely do that, yes. It's better than not having backups because of laziness. But as I said above, there are additional security benefits of re-encrypting it.

As others have said, in the following years, most of the cost for block creation will be in hardware rather than operating costs. This will however change yet again and I can see it focusing again on energy costs. There is also the real possibility that mining will get less appealing in time. We just don't know.
We need sample numbers from other financial sectors and extrapolate the numbers from Bitcoin to match and compare. I estimate that the current global operating costs of Bitcoin mining are equivalent to a very large banking branch (or a very small bank), though the transaction volume is probably minuscule compared to such a branch (about 1.5 million USD per day). On the other hand, mining costs aren't simply correlated with the transaction count or volume, so the numbers would be hugely on Bitcoin's side as usage inflates.
I think benefits of Bitcoin will always outweigh maintenance costs, and the casual new user won't even be aware of the concept of mining in a few years. As for alternatives to the proof-of-work mechanism, I think we need to wait and see.

@_date: 2012-06-21 10:15:44
Good question. The irony of the situation is, the fact that bitcoins are hard to get is a demonstration of how flawed the current financial system is.
I think you are somewhat comparing apples and oranges. Bitcoin is much like gold. All you are describing as possible with a bank (convenience for a fee, etc.) is possible with a Bitcoin bank. The point is actually what's possible *without* a bank. Also, I guess what you mean by fees is somewhat different than my perception. I'm guessing you don't regularly send money across borders?
Now, you got a 12 year old kid from China to help with creating icons for your website, a Greek guy to help with the translation and an American with some programming stuff, while you reside in Pakistan. The concern with how much fees you'd need to pay is more relevant here. Besides, all these people need to get bank accounts, and you need to count that in as a cost too. With Bitcoin, you can receive money from anyone and anything at any time, and send on a whim.
Without Bitcoin, receiving small amounts of money is one concern, but receiving large amounts is usually the real problem. I try to gather what I think about when I have an idea worth working on. Half of the concerns I have are about how and where to operate, what kind of bank accounts are necessary, which permits, how much I need to legally pay for financial certifications, etc. They are the biggest concerns because those are the things that get you in trouble. I don't know which country you're residing in though, these things differ a lot. What I do know though, is with Bitcoin, you'd need only focus on the work itself.
Most of what's revolutionary about Bitcoin applies to a Bitcoin world. That was what my "early adopters" remark was about. However, I don't only imply the number of people who use it. The change in how we live our lives and do business is more important. We currently don't regularly get together with random people throughout the world whom we don't even know, to accomplish new things. We live in pre-defined social structures we don't even notice.
Even if this feels totally irrelevant to you, the properties of Bitcoin as a currency might still be of interest; mainly the fact that it's not controlled by a central authority. I think the effect of this is not so much the utility of Bitcoin itself, but the implications of this on the financial and political world.

I think the Linux analogy breaks because the proposed solution (ditch the chain and tweak the code) can't project to Linux adoption. Or you have to see the Bitcoin protocol as the kernel and the blockchain as the OS, which is too weird for me to reason about.
My point was, you can't use what we've learned from Bitcoin to develop another system that doesn't have the same problem. Any kind of sane projection to future adoption requires application of outside force (either physical force, or another kind of top-down persuasion, like Bitcoin-only pay cheques, advertisements, education, etc.) which requires either centralization or some kind of social mechanism that doesn't exist yet.
In other words, people just don't want to take the risk of investing in Bitcoin, and there is no "fair" way to make them do it. This is the other side of the fairness argument.
I acknowledge the problems you mentioned, and that the situation resembles the chicken-and-egg problem, but I don't see a way to remove it completely. Bitcoin is advancing just fine and there are no downsides of accepting Bitcoin as a payment. Let it grow slowly.
Also, as others have probably already said, Bitcoin's exchange rate doesn't matter if you are planning to use it, so it's questionable whether it would be easier for people to adopt if the exchange rates were lower or mining gave more rewards (which again means, exchange rates were lower). What is the difference between 1 coin worth 10 hamburgers and 10 coins worth 1 hamburger? Everyone including my grandma was aware of Bitcoin when the price was $2 each, but people didn't seem too eager to acquire them.

Security requires insight. IQ or plain knowledge just isn't enough. Unfortunately being aware of your lack of insight requires insight as well.
This case is exceptional though. Why keep 40K Bitcoins on MtGox in the first place, even two months after trading stopped and there has been an immense security breach? Who made this decision? Even the newbies on this reddit are advised not to keep their coins on mixing wallets for prolonged periods, and certainly not huge sums.
For my own sanity, I'm trying not to think about the notion of using a duplicate string as your master password or willfully deciding not to use two-factor authentication to secure your $350K account. Or did that idea never occur to any one these security experts?
Even stupidity isn't a good enough explanation. You can be this negligent with your own money, but not with other people's savings. I think this leads to the gist of the problem. They actually *were* this negligent *because* it wasn't their money.

That's not money laundering though. You have to be able to prove where you got it, to have laundered successfully.
You could say that Bitcoin helps you buy stuff without having to launder money, exactly like cash. Consider you have 10 million dollars worth of wealth you need to use to invest in a regulated vehicle (e.g. buying an apartment). The fact that you bought it using Bitcoin doesn't change the fact that you need to be able to prove where the money came from under investigation. You could say it came from mining, if you have been paying your taxes on that, which would constitute a proper laundry.

Because a 20 year old person doesn't know shit about life.


Not true, in my case at least. Actually probably not true at all. A lot of people are very conservative but they don't realize this until they start taking real responsibility. Also, there are a lot of "old" people living extremely freely, but you don't realize them because they are wise enough not to attract attention. Conservatives however, are always more vocal.
If you are in your early 20's, you might still have the idea that there is a new way of doing things, and most of the world is stuck in the old way. It is a misconception. Is drug prohibition a new or an old thing? Is sexual freedom new or old? And where? Things turn out to be massively more complicated as you age. Conservatives are the ones who decide to stop becoming and start living, regardless of political views.
What has this to do with Silk Road and Bitcoin? Not so much I guess. My belief is, it really doesn't matter whether Silk Road exists or not. They would still use the drugs rhetoric just as they use imaginary assassination markets and child porn rings. It's not very hard to generate evidence that they are a clear and present danger either.

I think it depends on the person.
Why not do the opposite? Bitcoin is by far the most convenient and secure way to store my money, so I store most of my liquid wealth as Bitcoin. Most of my wealth is stored as real estate, but I have very little cash in the bank compared to the value of my BTC savings, which aren't a lot.
When there is a low-commission Bitcoin debit card available, I will use it to convert BTC to my local currency while shopping, and will be able to keep ALL my savings and earnings as BTC. This is the absolute opposite of what you're proposing. ;)
It might not be for everyone, but I suspect in the coming decade, more and more people will learn how to secure information, just like they now know how to use locks and keys properly.
It might seem as magic to some, but it's not very hard to secure your coins. Most guidelines out there are either too paranoid, or too lax. The reason is, we aren't yet sure what the most convenient method is for the casual user, what they are reckless about, what can be hard to grasp and what is more easy to adopt as a habit. Also, technologies like the P2SH protocol extension or the bitcoincard might make this transition a lot easier.

A few guidelines:
* Use the encryption feature (Settings -&gt; Encrypt Wallet) (*)
* Always keep a backup of your wallet.dat file, preferably offline
 * You don't need to back up after each transaction, the client keeps a hidden pool of "future" addresses for you to be able to recover if you lose your active wallet.
 * However, regular backups won't hurt. A little redundancy is good too.
Future advice:
* If you use multiple devices and want to share the same wallet, the standard client is not the best choice
 * I suggest you take a look at [Electrum]( which is also lightweight
 * Though, running a full-blown node is better for the network
* Refrain from web wallets until you have some knowledge about how they function
EDIT: (*) ... and don't lose your password.

The Bitcoin network keeps balances as integers, where 1 BTC represents 10^8 units. Service providers traditionally adopt this standard for their internal representation. Those numbers you see on the screenshot are kept as integers in the database.
If what you mean is that the stock-exchange bots are using floating-point, it's both irrelevant and obviously not true, since the numbers we see are adjacent in the integer representation. Repeating 9s are because people are racing to be sold first while not losing money.
If what you say is that someone can buy half a share, it's not true at all.

Cryptology and Cryptography combined I say. Secret messages found, which in turn are converted to numbers, etc. Background should be relevant as well, more profound than a simple treasure hunt. Maybe the message isn't a private key, but a transaction. You never discover the private key. Transaction itself is the trigger.
Combine this with the SkyNet scenario. I actually, in real life, think about programming such a beast. What I mean is, bots can now manage their own money, and in turn pay people to do things for them for a change. In other words, outsource the thinking they can't do themselves into humans. Or physical stuff, like buying more expensive hosting, cloning yourself there and thereby start generating more money somehow. This is a movie though, and doesn't have to reveal the details. In the first movie, the evil mastermind is the SkyNet. In the second one, heroes are trying to save the world using Bitcoin.
What's the motive, what does the transaction trigger? Maybe we are already in the future and humans are led to unravel an ancient bot? Maybe SkyNet actually wants the humans to boot it to power? I'm sure there is a better idea.

Nefario is a very well known public figure. His name and address is known, he has appeared in several conferences to represent Bitcoin and GLBSE. There is no no-shadowiness standard that would help with this case. The problem is both Nefario's ineptness and the law itself. It doesn't matter whether the institution you're dealing with is shadowy if the State is threatening the very thing that institution wants to do.
However, we didn't need to deal with an 'institution' at all. A distributed stock exchange was very possible even from the beginning. It was Nefario's posts which got me convinced that it wouldn't be preferable because it would make high-frequency trading impossible. Well, apparently this solution wasn't worth the risk.
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:08:21
Some people also think the incentive to mine will diminish and Bitcoin will collapse as rewards converge to zero. As usual, there are yet again two conflicting arguments that are both supposed to be negative for Bitcoin, and that's a good thing. It makes perfect sense to expect that the market will find a good enough solution to this.
Basically, there will always be an optimal point for mining costs. As block reward approaches zero, I expect the miners to become analogous to payment processing companies that charge users purely based on their expenses. This way, there will not be any excess energy use that the nature of transactions themselves doesn't require. So far that the market won't even let the network get "too secure".
The resulting carbon footprint will be negligible compared to what's being spent on creating and moving money today. However, since the greater financial structure won't get smaller, I don't expect the reduction in costs of the actual creation and transaction of currency to have a measurable effect on total carbon footprint.

Instead of transferring your coins to a remote location, you can back up your wallet to a remote location. This makes more sense in the context of Bitcoin. You should pick up one of the tools that help you locally encrypt your files and devise a way to not lose your passwords.
After you have safely encrypted your wallet with a **strong password** (that is different from your wallet password) you'll **never forget**, you can safely spread it around the globe (e-mail it to your wife, upload it to your server, burn it on a CD). I find this more practical than using paper wallets and such. Also, you can keep your savings wallets off of your computers and use a 'current' wallet just for day-to-day business.
A second approach, as others have said, is using two factor authentication with an online wallet (Yubikey, Google Authenticator, etc.). Though, even if you choose this method, I wouldn't prefer mtgox for storage. There are tools (such as blockchain.info/wallet) that are built for that purpose. If mtgox is destroyed, it goes away with your coins; with blockchain.info, you can just restore your keys from an e-mail backup. It's actually like a local wallet which takes automatic remote backups. The downside (compared to a wallet application) is, you have to trust the live script on the site itself.
@_date: 2012-07-25 06:04:20
Yes. The private keys in that file are indeed physically encrypted. However, your addresses remain clear, so that you can see your transactions without having to enter your passphrase.
I recommend a second layer of encryption (such as your truecrypt volume, but I'm sure there are more convenient tools for that) for backups though, for the reasons I stated. However it introduces another password that you absolutely must never forget.

This. Maybe at first few people will have such devices because of the shortage of supply. But that also means less impact to GPU/FPGA miners. The premise would only make sense if everyone thew away their mining devices and only a few lucky people who received their ASIC equipment continued mining. That's a fantasy.
In the end, there is no reason not to produce and sell those coffee warmers by the thousands. Even haters would buy some. The profit margin will continue to be very slim for the miners. The transition period might cause some volatility, especially because it coincides with the reward change, but I don't think it will change the fundamentals, at least not in a way OP suggests.

My question is, why they would want to hold all money in one address. It's unnecessarily vulgar. An entity like SR would try to obfuscate, that's why I suggest that the owner of that address could be an exchange, *assuming* the claim is true. I, at least, couldn't manage to replicate the claim of two hops (or any other number for that matter).
Silk Road gives the vendors an option to hedge the payments, so the payment escrow payment is converted to USD on the fly. That would explain why the money ended up in an exchange's wallet.

Others have commented on trust issues, but I think technical reasons are more important.
Local bitcoin wallet applications like the Satoshi client or Electrum, and web applications like blockchain.info/wallet or StrongCoin manage and create transactions locally using your own private keys. You have access to your money through your keys, and at least in expected functionality, private keys never leave your local computer (i.e. even with online wallets, they are decrypted locally, and transactions are created locally, and the server never has access to your money).
With mixing online wallets like MtGox, you don't have access to private keys, your money is merely a record in MtGox's database. It's like traditional banking, with all the risks involved. If their databases go corrupt, your money is gone. If their servers get confiscated, your money is gone. If their wallet is stolen, your money is gone.

You'd need the full public key for generating the address to both deposit money and print on the note itself. Am I missing something?

To be honest, when I first read about Bitcoin on Slashdot, I was convinced by the deflation speak and this resulted in me missing Bitcoin until late 2010. As far as I remember though, since the exchange rate wasn't sticking out, the focus wasn't early adopters at first, but rather about deflationary currencies being bad for commerce or somesuch.
The problem I have with this argument is, as long as there is a deflationary currency you can freely trade for your inflationary one, it shouldn't matter which one you are using for transactions. If keeping my money as gold is more advantageous for me than spending it, I won't spend it (yet I usually do). So, for their argument to work, I should be actively prevented from investing in anything not decreasing in value, other than active commerce. Since I can already invest in things like precious metals or land, it should prove that, Keynes or no Keynes, the existence of a deflationary currency doesn't change anything. Is there a flaw in this argument?

I really don't know where to begin... Implausibilities aside, there is no league of criminal organizations that plan and execute such things. And you really need to begin with that in order to actually need something like Bitcoin. Otherwise it's like saying Silk Road invented Bitcoin.
Besides, if you follow the history of this thing, especially the cryptography mailing list, it's sort of an expected development. Anyone there, all brilliant people, could come up with the idea, and most likely have considered something like it but didn't think it would scale. I'm sure Satoshi wasn't so sure either.
If you have worked on such projects, it should be apparent that Bitcoin doesn't look like an engineering work. At all... [That's why it came so late, too.](
Also, the notion of "making something popular so that when a better one is invented it will not become popular and the main one will remain attackable" is very funny. Real world is not a chessboard, only cheesy novel characters and children invest in so convoluted plans. Especially if you consider that the way they are making it popular is by us, enthusiasts. If this was a consumer thing endorsed by both governments and market leaders, then it might have made sense.

Yes, it's very refreshing to see that most are getting there, albeit slowly.
Slashdot crowd has always been fiercely against Bitcoin and ridiculed it in every way they can. The ridicule was so self-conflicting that it actually drew me towards checking Bitcoin out myself. Proof that there is no such thing as bad advertising.
My guess is, it's hard to accept for your typical geek that such a bottom-to-up game changer was so within reach. Most people both here and on Slashdot still have the statist mindset.

I saw your thread on the forums. I don't think it's a problem specific to Bitcoin.
Consider this. You didn't know where your cash was and threw them in the washing machine in the pocket of your jeans. Would you stop using cash?
People will eventually learn to backup their wallets and realize that being able to back it up renders it much safer than a physical wallet or a bank account. However, we don't know this automatically. This is what makes early adopters special. You can decide to stay and invest your time and effort to learn, develop habits and spread them so that it becomes easier for others to do the same later (for instance, if you have an idea on how your incident could have been prevented, send it to the author if Android Bitcoin Wallet).

A packet sniffer is useless there. bitaddress.org, brainwallet.org and similar tools work on your local computer and should in no way communicate with the outside world during key creation.

I'm not talking about self-laundering though. There are laundry services that keep at least two distinct key pools. You send into one, and it sends you from another, therefore the blockchain doesn't carry any information whatsoever about the transfer. Much better than a mere mixing service. Don't know about the fees though.
Of course I wouldn't trust a single service for any of this, you need to use at least two distinct services which you think most likely would not collude. Therefore, I might actually use torwallet just for mixing, but I don't think it is meant as a transitory store in general. It doesn't seem to be perceived that way either.

I think the totality of coins wouldn't matter. If coins can be generated for less than the market price, and supply isn't limited, then all coins will be automatically worth that. Also, such advances usually affect efficiency by degrees of magnitude.

I know this has been discussed before, but advanced deposits are a huge risk for all parties involved.

Yeah, I don't get that either. I have a "current" wallet which is on a par with my actual expenditures, have a few online "watch only" wallets, and all my savings is spread around the net in gpg-encrypted form. Some people prefer offline paper wallets, some others deterministically generated savings wallets, all of which are quite safe.
Granted, if I were spending more bitcoins, it would be a pain to constantly transfer off of a backed up wallet. However, I would still keep two separate wallets and probably wouldn't take the fat one with me when I'm mobile. Even if I did (maybe I'm a constant traveler), I wouldn't put them (wallet file, URL, private key, passphrase, whatever) on an obvious location.

I'm probably getting this wrong, but I don't know what you mean by coin discovery. Are you talking about the traversal of the merkle tree or the block chain? The phrase "Calculations are done until a solution is figured out to the problem" doesn't seem to fit in either context.
Maybe there is a fundamental misunderstanding. Coin generation doesn't involve a discovery of some discrete coins, the money is just awarded to the address(es) who solves the [block]( by finding a suitable [nonce]( A bitcoin doesn't have a structure, it isn't data, it is a unit of account.

Maybe I am a total geek but I fail to trust local storage over remote storage. If your computer isn't compromised at the time of creation of the private keys (a disconnected computer is a good idea), you can easily encrypt and distribute them all over the place, just the same as printing them on paper. 
I have some paper wallets and casascius coins lying around, but since they are unencrypted, I see them as a higher risk than my encrypted wallets. Besides, they can get damaged or lost more easily. However they have the nice property of being recoverable in case of a brain-dead owner (literally or otherwise).
Regarding the original question, I'm somewhat wary of hardware theft because I'm not informed enough about whether the passwords or the keys might be recorded somewhere, like a clear swap file or even an unintended string memorization feature (applies mainly to the mobile operating systems and experimental Bitcoin clients).

Those who are unfamiliar with gpg might want to see whether other archival tools they use support encryption, such as 7zip. (Though gpg is very useful in general.)
I don't think local on-disk encryption is essential for standard Bitcoin wallets, such as the OP's 5G TrueCrypt volume. The wallet is encrypted as it is (please use that feature if you aren't already), and that volume is probably going to be unencrypted throughout operation, which is the only likely duration where your password AND wallet can be stolen.
You might need secondary encryption for backups, and an archival tool is usually more suitable than TrueCrypt in those cases.

Well, they can't make sure you've accepted all payments through that address. You wouldn't anyway. Also, it's very inconvenient to use a single address, the best way to utilize Bitcoin for payments is using a different address for each transaction.
Having said that, this is exactly like cash payments. If they can tax cash, they can tax Bitcoin. You usually can't perfectly tax cash in the third world anyway. What you do is penalize excess stocks, etc., so people pay some tax.
&lt; wild speculation &gt;
Actually, if you are the State, you probably don't want to enforce it that much. Taxes are too high for small businesses to survive anyway. Corporations pay their taxes perfectly, and ultimately become the sole sponsors of the State. Eventually, most of the commerce is done by the big corporations. Banking industry aside, Bitcoin doesn't change the picture here, and actually is better for international business.

1. There is no reason for them to keep the wallet online for donations. If they'd like to know who donated what, they could easily use an external service for easy security or a pre-generated address list.
2. This is the most credible explanation. On the other hand, it being a Torrent site and already accepting donations, I'm kind of wondering about the details. Do they really keep a list of real-life identities who donate for instance? If not, what difference does Bitcoin make? If the only concern was the actual unit of currency, they could use something like bit-pay pass-through and receive USDs.
3. Another explanations is, an influential admin made a statement about Bitcoin some time ago without researching and now doesn't want to give way.

Disclaimer: I'm not Greek nor ever lived in Greece.
Reducing the value in your wallet by paying directly from it, or reducing the value of the currency stored in it are in effect the same thing. Yes, you can tax all the population by printing money, but raising and collecting taxes are a better solution (let's say lesser of two evils). At least that way, you can refrain from overtaxing the poor. Also keep in mind that the rich utilize all kinds of stores of value (land for instance), and it's the poor who have most of their wealth tied in national currency.
Furthermore, I don't think the question is whether Greece should switch to Bitcoin, which borders on the absurd, but whether it makes sense for someone living in Greece to start using Bitcoin for day-to-day trade. In the meantime, the State can print whatever currency it wants to pay the debt, that's a different issue. I think, in the long term, using Bitcoin would be better for business, which *should* be the whole issue anyway.

I don't know about Kronos, I coincidentally began following the issues starting with bitcoinrebate.com.

This new site has almost the same issues, but it's a much more serious trading platform. No matter how stupid or incompetent you are, you don't release such a trading platform without testing. It makes zero sense, I can't even explain it with malice.

Bitcoin can be protected like any other money can be protected. For services that store money and provide instant access, there is no easy way out. They need to implement security measures comparable to all other professional financial services.
However they don't, and they get robbed. Each and every heist reveals another poorly implemented system, a system most of us IT people wouldn't implement. We haven't even seen a cleverly implemented system that the hackers had to outsmart. The problem isn't stupidity I guess, but hasty behavior, inexperience and immaturity.
I don't think a new breakthrough is necessary for these services to be protected; conventional security measures are still applicable.

Currently the most plausible attack on the network is the so-called 51% attack, which requires the attacker to have access to at least half the computing power the network has (i.e. in effect, doubling it). Since Bitcoin is the largest supercomputer on Earth with at least an order of magnitude margin, this scenario is extremely unlikely.
Regarding exchange rate volatility; you can balance the volatility risk by converting some portion of your Bitcoin income into other currencies or investments. There are automated systems that can do this for you on the fly. As an example, it would make sense to convert income to the already spent currencies to cover costs first and to keep the profit portion as Bitcoin.
One perceived risk is, that another instance of Bitcoin will rise and become more popular. Bitcoin's history until now shows that this also is not very likely, but we can't dismiss the probability, however remote.

Actually what I do is, create a new wallet with the Satoshi client and get some keys, encrypt it with the client, then re-encrypt with GPG (symmetric) using a different password and copy it all over the place (local and remote). I can send money to such wallets afterwards, and they are ultimately secure. Assuming I don't lose my passwords of course, but hopefully my wife will remember them if I die.
I also use paper wallets for my vanity addresses. I don't use blockchain.info myself for making transactions, but I do use it to monitor these accounts.
If you don't trust your computer, you can do all these with a clean computer (e.g. linux live CD) without connecting to the Internet. You can even save the bitaddress.org web page and load it there to generate new keypairs for you even if you're offline. Also, Satoshi client might not be the best tool for this purpose, just create a bunch of private keys and make sure you keep them secure and safe, that's the gist of the matter.

If it was simply that, they could convert BTC to USD on-the-fly via a service like bit-pay and the problem solved. Besides, the organization isn't the entity that's making the investment, it's already made and the amount is transferred as a donation. I'm pretty sure this is not restricted. But as I said, even this is not necessary, it could easily be converted *before* arrival.
The problem might easily be anonymous donations, which Bitcoin does enable even if it's converted.

Any mixing service should do really (instawallet included), you can analyze the results using a block chain explorer. Send some money from your exchange to your home (unique address each time), by passing it through a mixer (let it stay there a while) and then check if there is any remaining clues in the block chain (not likely). More popular mixing wallets should work better with this.
If you are not planning to use your own wallet (that you control yourself, not MtGox) directly to pay for something with your name on it, then you wouldn't need to use a mixer on the way back either. You could do the opposite, i.e. pass it through a mixer to order something in your name, depending on which activity you do more often. I personally keep two separate wallets for each purpose.
If you are really paranoid, there are other methods than mixers that would make the transaction untraceable through the chain; blockchain.info provides such a service for a fee but you could also exchange coins with any trusted person that lives out of US.

I would advise you to stay clear of generating coins yourself (mining). It eats too much time for little return and is apparently addictive. Converting other currencies to Bitcoin is far easier, and converting your skills to Bitcoin is more fun. Having said that, there are professional mining companies you can invest in if it makes sense to you. It is a very competitive market, so you will probably "indirectly" mine more coins that way than trying to set up a mining rig yourself.
Regarding spending, it depends on what you want to do. Since the market isn't very large, you might need to look harder to find a particular thing, but it's slowly evolving. Do you have anything in mind? Also, if you encounter an offer which looks shady to you, you can/should always look for references.

First of all, do you see your balance. I'm assuming you did, so you've successfully restored your coins.
You can continue using the default wallet, but I'm guessing that it would make it easier for you to switch to either [Electrum] ( or [blockchain.info] ( both of which enable you to use the same wallet across multiple devices. Of course, you'd need to send the money in your current wallet to your newly created (and backed up) wallets.
In case of wallet loss, with Electrum, you can recover your wallet fully by generating it from your seed (which is given to you when your wallet is first created) even if you lose your encryption password or your wallet file altogether. Blockchain wallet is an online solution, which has easy backup methods and two-factor authentication.

What Julian said.
Also, there is a slim chance that this might spectacularly backfire. If Bitcoin survives such a treatment (which is technically easy, it only requires some effort from its users through the transition period), there will remain no way to stop it anymore. You can't scare people off something they've already decided to use despite being illegal (like alcohol for instance), and your money can't compete with Bitcoin unless it becomes like Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin survives, and people continue valuing it, it makes quite a lot of sense for people to use it for their savings. It will be free from a wide variety of taxes (e.g. inheritance tax) and regulations (e.g. easily take wherever you go), and will be more resilient to most type of disasters. Since all kinds of people will keep some BTC, it will continue to make sense to shop with Bitcoin for items that aren't illegal themselves. Even now, Bitcoin sites are almost exclusive, so we wouldn't take a lot of impact if legal sites weren't allowed to use it in specific countries.
Of course, the world could turn out to be as boring as it's claimed by the state, and people might just decide to bury it because it's labelled "bad". I have friends who say Bitcoin is a good idea but stay away from it, just because it's "revolutionary", so it's a real possibility.

Well, I don't think my statement is incorrect then, but maybe I should have been more clear when I say "distributed".
The problem that prevents HFT is the exchange of money itself. With a centralized system, you can move "deposit" coins from one account to another and move the shares in the reverse direction "at the same time". With a fully distributed system, it is impossible to do this in one go. To prevent DOS problems and race conditions is a challenge which can be overcome at the price of transactions taking a long time.
Either way, thanks to Nefario, I'm now convinced that HFT isn't actually necessary.

You see, you can't even be sure you're not overly influenced just because you are against the government. For instance, fragmentation based on artificial problems can be successfully used to render a population impotent. If the challenge is to get together and force the government into submission, there are immense difficulties you'd need to overcome before guns even enter the equation. If we were talking about reusable drones which could identify and shoot single people out of a crowd without getting destroyed, then I would pause for a moment.

The transaction should be witnessed by the network, so there needs to be a server somewhere.
Bitcoincard presumably can list transaction requests in range, and has a keyboard, so it should be easy to give someone some money.
On the other hand, if there isn't an actual connection to a proper node, the card technically should be able to transfer the transaction data, to be submitted to the network later by the receiver. Double-spends are possible this way, but you can still receive money from someone you trust. I have no idea whether they are planning such a thing though, it's not very likely.

These people are making a shitload of money by doing basically nothing. Well, they do generate the FUD, so I guess they are being paid what they are hired for.

Forget about the "account" concept and you're very close.
Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that keeps which address has what money, by maintaining a history of all transactions. Each transaction is digitally signed over to the owner of the receiving address. Only the owner of an address can sign it over to another address (i.e. send the money to someone else).
"Owner" in this context meaning the party who has the "key" that can sign it. There isn't any other proof of ownership than having the key. Your wallet has the keys to all the addresses you control. Other data in your wallet is just for technical reasons and convenience.

Dropbox is a convenient way to back it up. If you are using online e-mail storage (GMail, etc.) you can also e-mail the 'wallet.dat' to yourself or even a friend for backup purposes. Take a local copy too (CDR, memory-stick, etc.). Should be enough. Do this every month or so, you don't have to make a backup after each transaction.
However, you need to use the wallet encryption future to make sure no one can steal the funds from your backup wallets. So, encrypt first. And don't forget your passphrase, there is no way to recover it. Write it on several pieces of paper if you have bad memory.
If you know how to use an encryption software (gpg, truecrypt, etc.), you may even consider symmetrically encrypting the wallet file (once more) before back-up. This is only necessary if you don't want others to discover how much money you have.
After you get a hold of it, you will encounter other options to store your coins, which are more fun. Some prefer paper wallets. Some store the coins in their brains.

Cgminer can switch to failover pools and can also do load balancing, connecting to multiple pools simultaneously, including p2pool and local bitcoind. On the other hand, you could as well connect to p2pool directly, which would already be resilient.
I think a 50% attack by DDOS'ing isn't feasible. You need to somehow get the difficulty down by doing so, which isn't instantaneous. Miners are incentivized enough to switch to other methods, and the small number of hashing power that didn't react in time would probably be compensated by a general community reaction.

If we are talking about the default Bitcoin client, the wallet stores private key**s** to your visible addresses and invisible addresses (where the change goes), and a pool of queued keys (usually 100 keys). It also stores labels and whatnot. But you only need the private keys to access your money.
Since there is a pool of "future" keys, you don't need to make a backup so often. But keep in mind that when you send coins, some change is almost always sent back to a new address in your wallet, so even if you don't manually create new addresses, you might use all your backed-up queued keys after you initiate 100 transactions.
Alternative clients have different approaches to key generation. For instance, with deterministic wallets, you can always generate your full wallet if you have your generation seed. Some wallets use a single key for all transactions.

Actually, the computation needs to be pure in order to be resistant to tampering, which means having no side effects *is* its purpose.
I guess you could replace it with an isolated mining game with provable difficulty, but I agree that it would be terrible. Also it's very hard to come up with algorithms that are easier to solve by the human brain, but easy enough to verify by computers.
Maybe if someone can come up with a game that can be played cooperatively, is helpful for mental development and is suitable for the purpose... Then again, how would you prove that computers will never be better at it?

Then bitfloor didn't sent it yet. When they make the transaction, you will immediately see it in your wallet, *even before it confirms*. It might show 0 confirmations at first, but it should show up. In the meantime, you can make a different test transaction to yourself from one of the faucets.
I'd also recommend setting a transaction fee. It's very tiny anyway.

What about mobile wallets? If keys aren't supposed to leave the house, Bitcoin will never succeed. Best security practices should never have this requirement.
In addition, if properly encrypted, redundant remote backups make a lot of sense.
Online wallets (the likes of blockchain.info and strongcoin) can also be useful, especially combined with two-factor authentication. Users should be more aware of the security trade-offs in this case however.

"Mining" is not an exact analogy. Blocks need to be created regardless of a block reward. Block reward is there as a form of distributing initial wealth, and is not essential for transaction processing. Otherwise why have fees? (Though like everything in the Bitcoin protocol, fees have a secondary usefulness, which is preventing block chain spam.)
As extra reward per block decreases, miners will need to be compensated more and more by fees. As it is totally up to the miner to decide which transactions to include, most miners will require appropriate fees. They won't make more money by excluding transactions with low fees, but there is a community incentive to set a norm there.

Doesn't matter. "White"s have the know-how, incentive and capital, so they would still be the early adopters of this Africoin. This time, not geeks, but professional investors. Hence, fixating on balanced adoption issues, IMO, is myopic. Colonialism or non-colonialism, this is how things work.
Also, the notion of not having control over Bitcoin should be clarified. In what way? Bitcoin development is a meritocracy. If you are referring to the BIP 16/17 issue, I don't think it was more about hashing power than a technical debate between informed developers. I don't object to the fact that miners have the authority to dictate the rules. However, the law of large numbers is at play here, and reason shall prevail. Otherwise Bitcoin is a bad idea to begin with.
In other words, they should use Bitcoin because no one has control over it.
Maybe I'm too unimaginative, but I can't see that a technical concern could divide the "white" miners and African miners. It hasn't affected Russian miners nor Chinese miners. I myself am a Middle-Eastern miner.
If ever, this divide would happen about the initial rules (inflation rate and whatnot), hence they wouldn't be the same chains to begin with. These fundamental rules shall never change after genesis anyway.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2012-04-16 21:24:00
With Bitcoin, your money is tied to numbers called private keys. Every Bitcoin address you have corresponds to one or more of these keys, and having these keys means you can spend money sent to those addresses. A wallet is just a collection of these keys.
As these are merely numbers, you can guess how many different ways there are to store them. You can even store them in your brain.
However, the most common way to create a savings wallet is, creating the wallet with whatever client you prefer (usually the official Bitcoin client you download from bitcoin.org, but others are also fine), sending the money to it, backing it up and then using a different wallet for day-to-day expenditures. You can access your savings just by switching to the savings wallet file. Also, most Bitcoin clients support wallet encryption, which is a good idea as long as you don't lose your password.
Assuming you've encrypted the file with a strong password, storing it on a remote location (e-mail account, dropbox, etc.) is an option. So, local catastrophes aren't a concern. I encrypt my wallets a second time and e-mail them to my wife every few months. I'm hoping she'll remember the password if I pass away.
Other popular options are [paper wallets]( and [brain wallets]( which take their names from where you store the private keys I mentioned.
EDIT: Ah, also, Electrum uses the so-called "deterministic wallet" scheme. Which means, if you save your "wallet generation seed" in a safe location, you can always generate the entire wallet from scratch and access your money, even if you lose all backups. The downside is, you need to keep that generation seed hidden, for obvious reasons. :)

The reason people trust established exchanges is the same reason people trust any established business.
Also it depends on what regulations we are talking about. If they run away with your money, they are liable for it just as any other financial institution. The point is, these are just exchanges and you don't need to keep your money for extended intervals within their walls. You can store your bitcoins on a CD or a paper just fine.
Furthermore, you don't have to use these exchanges at all, you can buy Bitcoins directly from a seller, or directly earn them.

Both have pros and cons, really depends on your personal needs. There is also the middleground; you can use a lightweight client like Electrum. Manage your own coins, use the same wallet in multiple devices at the same time, but don't maintain the block chain.

It depends on the platform, so the installer should handle this (AFAIK it isn't doing it yet). I use Chromium on gentoo Linux, the bitcoin-qt package comes with the necessary desktop file, so what I only had to do was:
    # xdg-mime default bitcoin-qt-bitcoin-qt.desktop x-scheme-handler/bitcoin
This should also work for Firefox.
Basically the client accepts the URI directly as a command-line parameter (no need to parse, etc.), so it's very straightforward to configure.
Also, Electrum has this tutorial for configuring Firefox and Chrome: 
Android clients and browser plug-ins should be automatically doing this, but I really haven't tested.

There are a lot of financial instruments that can be made to work with Bitcoin like options and futures. Interest bearing accounts and loans can also be made to work. At the very least, they can do everything they do with gold with Bitcoin (exchange, insured vaults, mixed funds, etc.).

1. GPG/PGP has optional symmetric encryption, which doesn't even require you to create a keypair, so it in effect is easier than asymmetric encryption. It's exactly the same as putting a password to a document, but using an external tool.

Utter nonsense. You probably don't know how open standards and open source work.
First of all, you can inspect every change as they happen, and get involved in every discussion and present your opinion, present your solutions and submit your code. Not just for bitcoind, but any standards regarding Bitcoin.
There has been many changes to the standards so far, and there will be more in the future. Even if you don't see block sizes or script changes as fundamentals (they actually are), there will need to be changes more fundamental than those to increase scalability.
You can judge those changes as they happen, and campaign against them specifically. Your proposal as it is, is useless.
Besides, what if standards change and bitcoind doesn't implement those, but other clients do? Blockchain.info and similar js based clients are becoming widely used, Electrum is gaining ground, there are many other clients for mobile devices and desktop we don't know usage statistics of. What about the likes of bitcoincard?
So, as you can see, we need a system where proposals to the whole system needs to be judged by the community even before implementation is considered. Welcome to the BIP system. Go read the wiki for god's sake.

No activity is really anonymous, if you are assuming limitless information is available to the attacker. Depending on how you look at it, face-to-face exchange can be considered the least anonymous one, and when you offer a service, the channel you are using to communicate usually has enough information to be able to discover your identity.
Some common sense is always required in real world situations. For instance, logging in to a site through [tor]( is usually enough if you want to hide your IP. It's highly implausible to assume there is some entity which knows all connections to each and every tor relay, *and* will reveal this capability just to get to you.
Also, what you refer to as pseudo-laundering is actually laundering. Essentially, what you are doing is making a transaction outside of the regular channel, regardless of the monetary instrument in question. Granted, the transaction information is available somewhere else in some other form, and this information could be made available to the attacker by entities who have access to it. So, use your own judgement. For instance, if you have switched coins with two unrelated parties in sequence, what's the possibility of them conspiring with each other? It should quickly converge to zero. This also goes for "potentially" conspiring/cooperating online services.
Also note that coins diverge very fast.

Exactly! That pool of addresses also get used as "change" addresses, so you are still consuming them when you send money, even though you might not be using the "create new address" feature.




Yup, the wallet software doesn't show the "change" addresses, so it's most likely one of those. I don't know why you had to wait for confirmations, it seems to me like a blockchain issue. Maybe it was corrupt or something. There is also a -checkblocks option to verify the whole chain.
Also, as Cowboy_Coder said. There is no feature in the main client that provides that functionality, but since you have the idea (when multiple inputs are merged to create a transactions, the sources are associated), you could use various techniques to prevent coins from some sources from mixing with other sources. Using different wallets is IMO the most convenient option.

Very little, and yes^*.
You just need to run one bitcoind instance and all miners can get the work from that one. For decreased difficulty (and therefore decreased variance), you can run p2pool too. In that case miners connect to the p2pool instance, which gets work from bitcoind.
(*) The bitcoind instance will still get and relay transactions from the network, but only one node is enough to support your cluster.

I suspect gold didn't catch on instantly either. Even the most enthusiastic proponent of Bitcoin can't be sure whether there is a better alternative within reach. It just needs time for Bitcoin to prove itself. This is not a problem, it's how things are supposed to work.
I think there is a cultural side of things that depress adoption as well. Bitcoin is a bottom-to-top approach in an arena where top-to-bottom structure dominates. For majority of the people, that structure is a given. For them, what needs to be done to fix the world is to somehow cleanse that structure. We are taught to think that whining about big corporations and corrupt politicians accomplishes something. Most people can't actually grasp that Bitcoin is bottom-up and try to give meaning to it as if it's a scheme by a group, that isn't actually there. Alas, it's the only pattern people are trained to recognize.
I myself think it's hopeless. Most people will not adopt Bitcoin until it is presented to them from the top, which is yet another chicken-and-egg problem. However, the world is vast, and there is enough conflict of interest that one region of the world might overcome this problem and use Bitcoin to its advantage. At that point, your "smart money" will surely follow.

Besides the fact that there are much, much fewer possible addresses than you think, the "running out of" phrasing is not entirely appropriate because addresses aren't drawn from a pool, they are totally random, so a collision can occur right now as well. However an analogy would still be correct, since the probability of collision increases with time.
I can't imagine collisions ever being considered "likely", but if we want to extend the address space, we can do it pretty easily, without breaking compatibility with the legacy addresses. That can easily be called "the plan".

Difficulties in determining the energy usage and the impossibility of merchant adoption notwithstanding, I don't know why this would create a more stable exchange rate. Since you don't have any incentive to store wealth in the currency, you would immediately convert it to something like gold (or even EUR) upon receipt, which would prevent it from gaining any value in the first place. But there is always an incentive to mint more of these, so I think the exchange rate would converge to zero.

That's what I meant by the debate bordering on metaphysics. Since nothing has intrinsic value, and everything can be used as a currency, by that definition everything exchangeable is a fiat currency.
I agree that the definition sucks, though the basic difference in viewpoint seems to be that gold is a commodity (it's redeemed for itself), so it's not fiat to begin with. Economists seem to draw the line there.
I think the fact that traditional terms are ceasing to function properly shows that we are stepping into a new paradigm. This is very exciting.

All I'm saying is, the definition of fiat depends on both school and context, and debates on whether Bitcoin falls into fiat is usually about what fiat means rather than a criticism of Bitcoin, so it's of no consequence. Also, basing the definition on whether it's voluntary doesn't strike me as an ultimate necessity, since from the perspective of pure economics one might see governments as an ephemeral element and generalize the definition of fiat from this perspective. The paper makes the context clear through referred sources, so there is actually a definition.

Bitcoin is the one of the most interesting and multifaceted experiments I've witnessed and deserves support if only for that. There has been a lot of unrealistic expectations from both supporters and critics of Bitcoin, which fits the "Hype cycle" explanation up to now (which doesn't tell much by itself).
The technology has merit and has potential to be useful in areas we yet haven't imagined. However, it can't grow as fast as we would have liked. Neither the core technology and surrounding services, nor the public understanding of the technology can possibly mature in just a few months.
It will take a few years for the core technology to become mature enough to start looking for solutions about scalability and for conventional use cases to develop to serve a stable user base. After we reach that point I expect a new "anything is possible" phase to begin.

What Bitcoin can do and other money can't is easy and free (as in freedom) transfer of value across borders and regimes. It allows a 15 year old Turkish kid sell his drawings to a web designer in Argentina.
It will go "high" when the world changes to adapt what Bitcoin allows, and this will take some time. What we can do is, not only provide services for Bitcoin, but also get in touch with people whom we don't deal with normally. We need to change our "normal" behavior and expect more from the world.
Also, the currency itself isn't there to make us money. By getting in when the price is increasing and getting out when it's going down, you yourself created the bubble. I don't think it was all bad that profit seekers are repelled though. Now, we just need to make it grow by using it for its unique functions, for the things it allows, and not only for the sake of using Bitcoin.

How can you exchange tokens of USD/gold/whatever across borders easily and freely? Who would be the responsible party to transfer the actual "thing"s that the tokens point to? You will need to create a new unit which purely consists of being a currency. You will have to create a decentralized ledger. And voila, it's Bitcoin!

Though it's not obvious to me how you would convert Bitcoin to other currencies at end points. If offices at both ends have some kind of an agreement, they don't need to use Bitcoin. If not, then it's essential that there are functioning high-volume exchanges available locally at each point. I don't see it happening without other sorts of trade with high frequency going on. Am I missing something?
I don't think Bitcoin will *replace* anything *specific* in the short run, but instead gradually grow in all directions. However, imagine that, for instance, it proves useful as a meta-currency as you say, and becomes dominant in that sector. That would strengthen the currency and stabilize the exchange rate, which in return would solve most problems the article is addressing. Bitcoin can do most tricks other currencies can, and a lot of fantastic stuff that they can't. So in the long run, that kind of stabilization would enable it to compete with credit cards and de-facto international currencies like USD.

I'm sure Euro is much much more complicated if I want to know who decides how it's produced and why, in what manner it is produced, what the protocol is between the mint and the banks, how SWIFT works, how SEPA works, how VISA works, etc. I'm sure most questions I could ask are inherently stupid, just like most Bitcoin newbie questions.
So I don't think it's complicated as hell, it's much clearer and plainer than many currencies we daily use. But we *can* know and we *need to* know how it works, *because* it's unconventional, and that's what makes it seem complicated.

Thanks for reminding me why prohibition and even regulation turns everything beautiful to shit.
In my home country prostitution was under government regulation and hence prostitutes were forcefully kept inside the facilities by debt scams (libertarian logical conclusion worked surprisingly well in that case). Since there is no competition, the sex is terrible, prices are extremely low so ladies try to trick you into giving money for what you eventually won't get, and the thus the usual clientele are low wage workers who don't have money to pay for illegal sex. If you go through the illegal route, you most certainly will get scammed anyway, especially if you are a tourist looking for fun.
The country I live now is pretty Catholic and prostitution is illegal. It's the most peaceful country otherwise but there are shady neighborhoods pretty much for this very reason. It's dangerous so you don't go there. Also any girl you meet in a strip club or such places try to exploit money from you in return for nothing.
I payed for sex in countries where it's fully legal and it's fun for everybody. This pretty much goes for drugs as well. I don't know how people are gullible enough to support legislation against peaceful acts such as these.
However though, hookers don't have a use for Bitcoin because they can accept cash and guys prefer to pay at the point of sale. Maybe in a trust-based setting, like an escort agency where the client trusts the lady/guy anyway, they could use it to get paid in advance.
Places that are designed to exploit needs of men might be more interested in Bitcoin though. Like strip clubs or brothels, where the client might be tempted to do more but doesn't want to carry that much cash. Most accept credit cards, and try to keep clients' desire for privacy by registering ordinary looking business names, but it can't be 100% discreet. Some guys might prefer using Bitcoin to hide the fact from their wives. Who knows, if you have to get divorced in court, you don't want this to appear as evidence.

~~I still don't get how you could prevent double-spending and arbitrary minting without POW+distributed db. And if I misunderstood and we are actually building a distributed system like Bitcoin (but different somehow?), how can we notarize things that are external to the system, like URI ownership? That's why I think purity is a necessity.~~
OK, having re-read your comments, I think you are talking about a Bitcoin-like system where minting works in a different manner. How about a distributed stock-exchange like system based on the same technology? Anyone can mint anything they like, and even introduce their own rules? I haven't given any thought to how you could take authority from the issuer (for instance, something like karma tokens), but it could be an interesting experiment. :) Which of course could co-exist with Bitcoin, and even use the same computing power via merged mining.




I guess if it's required that you provide POW for your own transactions (like hashcash?), that would be the case. If you could actually buy POW, than that would be identical to paying fees to miners, a la Bitcoin. Or I got it totally wrong...

Bank collapses via economic failures or direct business failures would count as a metric. Scams or hacks are not issues about Bitcoin, as long as they are not related or caused by to core functionality.
Regarding hacks, Bitcoin is a technology, not a company. It's normal for people to misuse it until some common sense arises. Though if it turns out that people in general are unable to comprehend how to manage their money in this particular form, I would consider it as related to core functionality. However I don't think we have enough data as of now to measure it. I've been using it actively for a year and still haven't formed habits around it. Consider someone who isn't used to carrying cash or gold, and haven't seen anyone doing so. He goes out, gets her money stolen, and at that very moment realizes the first time that there is nothing she can do about it. But we all know that if you know how to carry cash, it's very rare that such a thing would happen to you.
And regarding scams, well, they will always be there, sorry. I'm sure wallets with some form of insurance will come up, and there are already escrow services, but they aren't able to prevent all kinds of scams. It's a side effect of setting value transfers free.
@_date: 2011-12-19 16:08:58
Well, the common answer is, mining isn't supposed to be profitable at all.
&lt; IMHO &gt;
In the ideal conditions, mining would give you what you put in. You wouldn't profit, but earn bitcoins without asking a third party.
In practice however, mining would be profitable when there is a gap between the exchange rate and difficulty. Now that so many people know about Bitcoin, and the exchange rate have already dropped from a spectacular 30 USD/BTC (which to me says there are a lot of people with mining equipment just sitting in the cupboard), it's very unlikely that it will be as profitable anymore. Keep in mind that there will always be serious mining businesses who are much more optimized (equipment costs, electricity, specialization, etc.) than the average hobbyist.
Maybe, if the exchange rate gains very high momentum it might get profitable to mine for the average GPU miner, but that would only last for a couple of weeks tops until the difficulty catches on.
So, regarding your post, there are two tragedies involved, if I may use your terminology. ;) Price is low *and* even if it gets higher, mining still won't be profitable to justify getting in the business. If you already have the equipment and know-how though, well, there might be periods you would want to power on the rigs.
&lt; / IMHO &gt;

We can keep trying to match people's demand that it must look like something that they already use. But actually, it's not. Bitcoin has a myriad of advantages, none of which would be put into use if you cover it in a paypal like shell.
I hate seeing ideas fail because the society is stuck in a local minimum. Yes, Bitcoin *can* fail, but I would still blame the world we live in rather than how Bitcoin doesn't fit into it. I hope more and more insightful people will see the brilliance of the idea itself and support it so that it gets more useful for the layman.

Same with other technologies they adopt, like the Jabber protocol. Or the enterprises they purchase instead of replicating themselves. Take something already working and ride on its success. It's a win-win. Besides it's a good corporate-culture-as-a-strategy in the long run.
Of course, Bitcoin has a totally different aspect to it. But in general, there is no obvious reason to replicate Bitcoin, since you wouldn't be controlling it anyway. If there is a new functionality that they can not add to Bitcoin itself, then it would make sense. But I don't really know what it could be.

Short answer: Yes
With Electrum, you have more control. You don't have to update your software for starters, and can do it when you feel that it's tested enough. You can use multiple different versions in correspondence (e.g. in the case of offline wallets), which would minimize the risks associated with newly introduced code. You can select which server to connect to, and it's very unlikely that you will be kept from spending your coins whenever you want. Plus, the information you receive is verified using SPV.
Furthermore, more control and flexibility lets you take better precautions. This is where I think using Electrum may have an advantage over Armory too, because it's less of a hassle to react to changes in the operating environment.
I would still keep my savings in a separate (preferably offline) wallet though, regardless of the client.

LTC is not inherently bad.
It's like, you've made yourself a very original and sexy dress for the dance and shared how you did it with all your friends so that they can suggest changes or use the techniques to make their own. However, when you go to the dance, you realize that one of your friends brought the exact same dress, with some minor but mostly invisible alterations.
Now, not only the worth of your dress went down, the sum of both of yours is below the value you had before. I'm not talking about the market value, but the intended utility.
All this doesn't mean we shouldn't encourage people to come up with their own designs, even if they've received most of their inspiration from the original dress. Actually the total value of the general innovation increases by achieving better designs. On the other hand, even though minor alterations are a necessary part of this process, there is a damaging factor in attending dances with too similar dresses.
I guess I've forced the powers of analogy a bit too much. ;-)

The scheme targets naive newcomers to the crypto-currency world for the purpose of "investing".

I think going directly to alt-coins to imitate early Bitcoiners resemble cargo cult behavior a bit too much. I don't want to be dismissive about altcoins, but people should first begin to use crypto-currencies, understand what's going on, and then make their own minds about whether the alt-coin concept is legitimate and if so which one has the most promise. Since currently most people in the community are interested in it as an investment, this is not the usual advice newbies get.

I'm pretty sure it depends on which is better for them in that particular case. They can easily call it a foreign currency if it helps them with taxation, which is exactly what happened to me in customs with an invoice denominated in BTC.
I think I know how you think it works. But are bitcoins really like diamonds you bought locally? I'll try to give you a counter example.
I go to Switzerland and buy diamonds there, for $100K. A few years later I go there again and sell them for $150K. This sounds more like Bitcoin to me.
Since all the trade has happened in Switzerland, it should be taxable there, don't you think? I personally don't need to fine tune where I want the income to arise; all jurisdictions that care about what I do consider it as arising abroad, and it works for me.
I don't claim to be a tax expert, but if a random guy like me is looking for a property to invest in with Bitcoin, I'm sure there are many affluent individuals who would be interested.

Something like Ubuntu is the ideal fit. While we are wishing, I would also love to see applications that make use of the OS-level integrated support for Bitcoin (purchasing content, donating to upstream developers, accounting apps that are able to make payments, etc.). All can be done through the already existing Bitcoin protocols, so we don't actually need a huge unifying company like Canonical or Google; just the OS that makes use of the Bitcoin enabled services.&lt;/rant&gt;

Keep in mind that, with Bitcoin, what happens on the other side is what's important, so the case is different. I imagine you can exchange Bitcoin to local currency through a local trader, or in some countries using automated exchanges that do not necessarily have to work with banks (correct me if I'm wrong but M-Pesa is an example).
What these local traders do with the Bitcoin is the actual problem. I'm pretty sure exchange rate will suffer in the short run.
Best case scenario, some local merchants will begin to accept Bitcoin directly, which is much better than any solution. I know it's extremely difficult to reach critical mass, but there still might be some scenarios which could help boot this up. For instance, importers might find an exporter (e.g. in China) that accepts Bitcoin. Since the exchange rate initially suffers locally, the deal the merchant is getting will be much better than a bank wire, which is also the case for the exporter. The burden will be on the person who injected the coins into the economy from the outside, so as soon as this burden gets lighter than the burden banks are creating, this route should become optimal.

The data is sitting on your disk in either case, so they are equally exposed. Apparently Armory aims to add additional features like corruption-resistance and some measures against brute-force attacks, but IMHO these don't add enough value to switch.
However it supports simultaneous multiple wallets, which would make people more likely to use a different wallet with a different password for long-term savings, considerably reducing the risk of theft (assuming you don't access your savings wallet daily). Same goes for off-line wallet operations.
It's open source and there won't be backdoors (unless you somehow manage to get a compromised version). However that doesn't mean it's bug-free.

Not an expert, just speculating.
I guess the main problem about orphans is the waste of work that would otherwise be useful. AFAIK, assuming the same amount of work, 2.5 minute blocks are more resilient to attacks in an identical duration. Don't know how these two opposing factors compete though. It's safer to assume that orphans create a bigger problem.
Another disadvantage is the increased overhead of faster block generation, which could intensify the effect.
All in all, assuming propagation time scales linearly with block size might be too naive, even if you disregard the overhead.
I think if at some point we become sure that faster blocks are safe, Bitcoin can successfully adopt this scheme.

I would still use this system for small amounts but it isn't, by any means, secure.
They could send it in encrypted form, or send a voucher instead. The problem is, people would forget their passwords, etc., though it's not an impossible problem to solve.

Say, you have a friend in a completely different jurisdiction. You swap coins. Now the coins you have don't have any taint. The only thing tying the taint to you is in the brain of your accomplice, not in the chain.
Also, there is a thing called untraceable transaction, which can be implemented on top of Bitcoin. With that technique, even the man in the middle wouldn't know whose coin went to whom.
Furthermore, even with powerful enforcement, there would still be an incentive to buy tainted coins, especially for a nice discount.


You need the cooperation of all exchanges and even local merchants if you really want to have any chance to catch the perpetrator. I assumed this was the proposal. Even with those sort of measures, taints will spread very fast.
All in all, the system itself is especially not designed to deal with that sort of thing.

So, was your initial question merely rhetorical? Nevertheless, no.
Firstly I'm talking with currencies that are inherently decoupled from direct external indicators in mind, even though this may apply to some others.
For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that we can classify these currencies by goal, and then classify features as good or bad within the respective context. What I'm suggesting is, having multiple currencies with the same goal but different features only has an advantage when the question is not decidable. Whenever a feature is proven to be good, it only makes sense for the whole group to include that feature, which removes the competition involving that specific feature.
So why this model instead of a survival-of-the-fittest scheme? I actually think this model fits that scheme better than a naive "best one shall survive" stance. In the end, even Darwinian evolution is about survival of the genes (its analogue here being features) rather than individual organisms. If these were branches of a code repository, I could see them as organisms, but they are also stores of the same shared value, which IMHO removes any hope of a  plausible projection.
So, why suggest a heuristic instead of striving to create a perfect competition atmosphere? Because we can't have a functioning economy big enough to test every combination of every possible parameter.
In other words, after grouping these networks by economic ideology, what remains is solely an engineering problem. From this perspective, having alternatives is good for general resilience and experimentation, but that's all there is to it.

Nobody lost thousands of bitcoins to MtGox here. If what they are saying is true, they actually doubled their bitcoins. Just buy back. If fiat is the problem, you can sell elsewhere again. It's not like you have sold them on MtGox with less than 10% extra profit.
MtGox was never a MTG trading site. Someone bought the domain for that purpose, and then decided to build a Bitcoin trading site instead. The only silliness on their part is naively sharing the story for all idiots to display themselves.

As others may have said, Bitcoin's initial distribution algorithm is very deterministic and there is a maximum amount if coins that will ever exist. These will not all be "mined" until about 2135, though since distributed amount per block decreases over time, more than half is already circulating.


Do you mean financial institutions who give out loans in Bitcoin? Actually I don't think it's a good model, since the currency is deflationary. However, some sort of trust to all deposit taking institutions is needed. Centralized regulation is one idea. Private independent audit firms, insurance companies, etc. could play the same role as well.
NeoBee's model is also interesting. Instead of introducing a secondary insurance deal to establish trust, they opted to not having full control over deposits. The Bitcoin protocol supports multiple signature requirements for transactions, so they will share custody of coins with both the owner and a third independent entity. This way, they can't lose or run away with the money, and if NeoBee disappears completely, the owner can come together with the third party entity and access their coins. You decide whether this model is better than State insurance within the context of Cyprus.

Well, since Bitcoin is a currency, the term "market cap" might have mislead you. It is only indirectly linked to the size of the economy. The transaction volume of Bitcoin per day is 4-8 million USD per day. This doesn't include transactions that aren't exposed to the chain, like the trade going on exchanges, etc. It also doesn't have anything to do with the price per unit, since the granularity is completely arbitrary.
@_date: 2013-02-19 13:56:20


This is not correct. 0.8 does not support lightweight mode.
Currently, lightweight clients have to download all transactions and discard ones they don't need. The bloom filter functionality of 0.8 is to help lightweight clients and decrease network traffic. The reason 0.8 downloads faster has nothing to do with this. It's just more optimized, uses a more suitable database, etc.
AFAIK bitcoin-qt will eventually support lightweight mode, before the 1.0 release.
EDIT: Edited out the unnecessary claim about mining nodes.

Whether this is a worse engineering approach is not an engineering problem.
I think it is more beneficial in the long run. You won't get bug-for-bug matching between versions of the same implementation, and there is no guarantee that these bugs aren't platform dependent. We've had an external library setting causing a massive fork.
It's better to break it and fix it sooner than later. It's better to reveal more bugs more frequently. How is this for engineering? :)

That's one of those problems that can't be conclusively solved with technology, but now and again, technology helps to level the playground.
What Bitcoin does, is to decrease the barriers of entry tremendously. At this point, anyone who as Internet access and means of communicating internationally can instantly get in the market and gain wealth in exchange for their skills. I'd agree that it still doesn't help the majority of the poor, but it's unprecedented on this front.
Now, we need a social change, a change in understanding that would build a culture around this new potential.
Also, it's not a coincidence that the remaining barriers of entry are defended uncompromisingly by the states of the world. We need local Bitcoin exchanges everywhere there is Internet access, but it doesn't seem to be happening at all.

I think there are plenty of people who act on ideals, and even if Xelank is mainly talking about exchange rate, the comment chimes with their reasoning (mine included).
I did continue using Bitcoin as preferred payment method during the last crash, and before that, and before that. I will continue doing so. You can only make a judgment about rationality of an action based on goals. For me, Bitcoin is about freedom, not getting stinking rich, and Bitcoin didn't become what it is today because of the people who think otherwise.
@_date: 2013-01-14 10:03:14
I think one of the biggest concerns about Bitcoin advocacy is the perceived pyramid effect. People arguing for Bitcoin have always been accused of working towards inflating the exchange rate rather than benefit to the society. That's why a direct "Bitcoin" ad is a bad idea. I would think promoting a Bitcoin-related thing (like this subreddit itself, or something like bitcointip, or both) in the ad text rather than Bitcoin itself would be more successful.

Ordinarily, you will have a new address for every send (keyword: change address) and every receive. I'm not sure what you mean by a spending account though.
If you have two different wallets, like a savings and current accounts you'd have with a bank, then each time, you will be sending from a different address and receiving from a different address, so it gets harder to trace with every such transfer.
If you are talking about receiving coins from an address and transferring to a spending address, then it doesn't make sense. Just spend from the address you've received the transaction to.
Basically, Bitcoin is comprised of transactions, not addresses, and especially not "account"s. If you check out how transactions work, you'll see that it is not an easy task to track transactions of someone who uses Bitcoin in the recommended manner.
Right now, I don't have access to an Android device to test. The blockchain.info app would be able to do what I described, but I'm not sure whether it's the best choice. I'm personally waiting for a decent port of Electrum to Android.

Ah, alright.
I guess our misunderstanding stems from the fact that Apple's idea would run over iTunes or something similar. You already have to have the amount in your account, or you need to have credit in your bank credit card. 
That is why you wouldn't need an innovation in the case of Bitcoins. localbitcoins.com already provides the service.
However, I think what you have in mind is more like a credit system. Which, I think is external to Apple's idea. The credit is what you have with your bank. We don't have a credit system with Bitcoin. I even think it's unrelated to the subject, because implementing a proper credit system is an immense amount of undertaking, whereas a service like "find-a-creditor" is just an app.
If this is the case, I think Ripple is a much superior idea than this. I personally don't think a credit system implemented casually would work. Banks and the State put a lot of effort into making it work.

I think the problem with the argument is, assuming that they don't have more because the rich people keep it all for themselves. Although I agree that most rich people consume more than they need to, I can't agree that economy is a zero sum game. It's pure envy that makes people think it has more to do with what rich people do than what they do. This sort of broken worldview creates cynical individuals who keep themselves ignorant about what sort of place the world is. Unfortunately, this infects the whole culture, including the rich, which fuels greed for mortal things. Being rich doesn't make you interesting, but unfortunately both the poor and the rich continue to obsess on this deception.
As a side note, money is immaterial, and you are only taking something away from the world when you consume. If you don't consume, you aren't taking anything away from anyone, *even if it were a zero sum game* (which it isn't). This, by itself, should make your original claim about Bitcoin a bit weaker.


The problem with this is twofold. One, you let the majority, and those with public influence, define what morality is. The morality of the majority is already engineered by people with influence, so this sort of system is only useful to advance a single dogma. Challenges between norms don't happen at the society's level, but at the level of the intellectuals and bureaucrats. In the end, you get inorganically engineered norms applied to whole societies. You get shaped by it, and if you resist, you are pushed away, or put away. This is immensely fucked up. What makes you a person is the extent you are different, so almost everyone is like a zombie compared to what they have the potential to become, and I'm including myself to this.
By the way, when I hear the word "feeling" or "being human" or "democracy" uttered, I cringe, since no one, including the speaker, really knows what they mean. The dominant culture is shaped top to bottom, and is very similar to religion.
Second, you are assuming the actions of regulation itself is somehow moral or at least amoral. The problem is, regardless of your beliefs, there will always be some action, taken in the name of regulation, that will be immoral to you. However, the system will prepare your mind for that.
As a standard example, there are many lives being ruined by unnecessary regulation on recreational drugs right now. Black markets created because of this caused wars, ruined societies. Millions either died or are in jail. An immense amount of "extra" regulation is in place, and is causing an absurd level of friction and loss of resources and opportunities. You can't even send money to people through a bank without getting paranoid about money laundering laws, which are ultimately either justified by the made up solutions to the made up dangers of drugs, or made up solutions to the made up dangers of terrorism. I'm not trying to be sensational here. I only want you to see that this whole structure is supported by the belief of people, that is systematically manufactured by the system. "Drugs are bad". It's *that* easy. No one really is responsible to make it any better, and having more control is always desirable for regulators.
Now, to prefer this sort of system, you have to believe that we can't all be prosperous without some powerful authority telling everyone what to do. You have to believe that people can't just decide to form a society that will benefit everyone, without creating a central brain, completely external to their own brains. I don't understand why it has to be so. I think most attributes that would make it so are programmed into people by this very system.

How much government is spending is either irrelevant or is a negative. Why do you even mention that? Bitcoin doesn't require that category of expenses to be secure. You might be of the opinion that such overhead is necessary but I don't agree. For instance, I certainly think gold is a better store of value than USD, and gold requires no such management, which is exactly why it is better.
The relevant security is more like what banks themselves spend to secure their networks, etc., which is also considerable, but not what you are talking about. That is what the greater Bitcoin infrastructure is lacking currently.
Furthermore, I never argued that I am less confident about my dollar or gold savings. I'm just saying that, dealing with the financial authorities, banks, "offshore" banks, tax consultants, etc. made me realize Bitcoin is actually a very viable option.
You are free to put the word currency in quotes. I don't know what you gain by mocking here. It is not a get rich quick scheme. It is not a regulated currency. If you aren't going to accept that and then get frustrated, maybe this thing isn't for you anyway.

How did you arrive at that conclusion? ASIC's will make the barrier of entry lower, since you will soon be able to get a stand-alone mining device with very little money. Compare it to the GPU's where you would have to buy and install a specific video card yourself.
Actually, the ordinary miner spent more money on their GPU rig than they would spend on one of these "mini" ASIC-based rigs that are being sold right now, and configuring and running them is a piece of cake compared to building your GPU-based mining rig. Even though this is the first generation. Future generations will have better stability and warranty measures.
Additionally, with ASIC-based solutions, primary investment is higher than the electricity-cost, which gives less advantage to miners with lower electricity fees. Which of course, lowers monopolization incentive.
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:50:28
Sometimes, yes. Generally though, there really isn't a destination of that $200. You likely will find something to spend it on in a near future, and decided it's a good idea to preserve the value as USD instead of BTC. If you had something to spend it on right away, you would probably do it instead of converting to fiat.
In other words, if the dominant method of attaining coins were to provide services for it, the economy would quickly become enormous. Of course, this won't happen for a long time in developed countries, but hopefully will be the norm for developing countries.

You have missed the "free money" period, so to speak, because there was no actual free money period (i.e. it was "free" only in hindsight, like buying a random piece of land just before the area gets popular).
A few years ago, investing your time, expertise and focus on something like Bitcoin would seem laughable. Some people did just that, and some of those people made good money. Since most of these people were in for various ideals, rather than making money, for some of those people it's a net loss (e.g. spent a lot of time and money to facilitate the growth of a market using Bitcoin, left with nothing in the end).
As expected, once Bitcoin network and market became more solid, more and more people came in, especially to mine. The developer+user vs. miner ratio decreased, with the exchange rate. Mining profits decreased rapidly as a result.
Now, we are seeing a surge of new users, who are neither interested in the development/ideology, nor the profitability. I think this is the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin; finally we will have "casual user"s.
From this point on, I don't think the hobbyist miner will ever make good money. It will be a hobby; you will help the network while showing off your USB mug heater that also generates money. It's good enough for most geeks.
Having said that, mining as a hobby can introduce you to the mining business. I think these businesses will continue to make money. You can either think of a new idea for a mining device and have it produced by one of the ASIC developers (or yourself), or a new investment scheme where you operate a mining farm somewhere electricity is cheap for a portion of the profits.
Either way, as others said, forget about GPGPU's and FPGA's. Also, if you are thinking about this as a mere investment, and you can find a trusted mining company, investing in it instead might be much more profitable for you. Trust is the key though.

One way to help with both concerns could be trusting two or more distinct entities instead of a single one (e.g. via 2-of-3 transactions). As long as I can tell these are run by different people from completely different backgrounds, in absolutely distinct jurisdictions, I wouldn't worry much. If there were a standard protocol to connect them, users could also choose among multiple of these entities, and pay a fee depending on how many they use in parallel. This protocol should support transparent auditing as well.

To be clear, in theory, "general WoT public" shouldn't mean much, since everything is evaluated within context. If you are a member of a cyber crime network, you could opt to view the world from that network's perspective.
Also, depending on the implementation, the system could prevent untrusted names from resolving at all.
Optimally, I would rather see implementations not calculate "overall votes" at all. These become confusing as we have seen on the  network. People there spend their time tracking "shills", duplicate accounts or circular trust scores, although these are never a problem in a web of trust environment.

Fees are currently almost optional. They are only essential when you are transferring a value lower than 0.0001 BTC. Otherwise fee-less transactions do get verified eventually. You should, however, pay some transaction fee to both support the network and get confirmed faster, though it doesn't have to be 0.0001.
Also, the "Bitcoin is good for the third world" rhetoric is about the remittance situation, in which case a fee of 0.0001 BTC is already relatively minuscule.
What I do agree with is, the protocol doesn't help with user friendliness at all. You don't know what fee you need to pay at a minimum, and this can't be solved at the client level. Hopefully this will also be dealt with when they also solve the blocksize limit issues.

Of course, there is no harm in variety. I think the criticism is about whether this constitutes variety. Note that you can tweak many parameters of Bitcoin to create thousands of variations as different as Litecoin, all of which could be argued to be better in some aspect. Also, since all these systems use the same protocol and almost the same economic principles, I don't think they add as much to the resilience of the system as you think.
There are many ongoing projects that differ from Bitcoin in both functionality and philosophy. Those are the ones that create variety.

It's an interesting concern to have. Thanks for posting.
However, I don't agree that power corrupts. Although, naturally, power attracts corrupt people.
I think the effect you are apparently seeing is not about people becoming worse, but the worse in people beginning to show. It's not really about money, but about change. When things change, it's an opportunity to see what you and other people are really made of. This reminded me the likes of Stanford prisoner experiment.
Keep in mind that, good in people begin to show too. If someone is obsessed with Bitcoin, but otherwise doesn't have an unhealthy relation with other material possessions, I wouldn't be automatically concerned.

To be honest, the gain is not nearly close to the required effort. I love Bitcoin because it's extremely convenient. Easy to use, to store, to secure. Immensely easier than dealing with a bank, commodity money or cash.
In addition, with the proposed "solution", cold wallets become unfeasible. Bitcoin is not durable anymore.
I suspect that the guys who prepared the proposal weren't there when people were struggling to create a decentralized digital payment system. If you really want to require people to connect in regular intervals, or stay connected all the time, why not ditch the block chain approach completely and switch to one of the several proposed systems in the past decades?

Actually, the rest of your description in the article is quite decent, the only problem is about what a bitcoin is. I don't know how to edit the paragraph to fit the article, so I'll just describe how it works.
A block, which is a partial list of most recent transactions, is considered solved, when an answer is found to the "complex mathematics problem" unique to the block data. In this sense, every solved block contains a solution to its own problem^1 , and since there are no limits to the blocks, there are a practically^2 infinite number of such problems.
The Bitcoin network allows the entity who solves the block to reward itself by a limited number of bitcoins. Since the upper limit of the reward is predefined (if it exceeds the limit, the network rejects the block) and halved every 210000 blocks (around 4 years), it is known that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. However, even after all the bitcoins are mined, block generation will continue with zero reward, and the miners will have to make do with transaction fees, which should be plenty by the year 2140.
(1) Since each block contains the solution to its own problem, and an indicator unique to the block that comes before it, the validity of blocks are easy to verify, going backwards in a chain, which forms the blockchain.
(2) By practically infinite, I mean 2^256 , which is practically infinite.

The only "issue" I see here is that some data that can otherwise be removed will have to stay in the pruned chain forever. Though, even if you lost 1 billion keys this way (e.g. half the money supply in 1 cent denominations), it would be less than 1 TB of data. Nothing to be concerned about really.

If you believe so...


What pole is that? Do I really have to judge things by how people rate them? Do you really believe that you have to? Your mind is a jail.


You are probably from somewhere prostitution is illegal or very heavily regulated. These things are a result of prohibition, just like any prohibition, or extreme poverty. It is a complete fantasy if you really think this is true in general. You need to socially hang out with some prostitutes from a wealthy country where prostitution is legal, to see that it's because of people like you that it has been the way you describe in some parts of the world.


Oh God...


Let me get this straight. It is the way it is, because it is the way it is. Really?


It's a moot point anyway, but the interesting thing is, you seem to really think that this is some sort of justification.
Homosexuality has been "that way" throughout history as well. Sometimes less, but almost always more so than prostitution. I guess you see homosexuals are lesser than yourself, am I right?
Women also have almost always been lesser than men throughout history. I mean, not always and everywhere, but I'm guessing statistically it would be similar to your claim about prostitution. As history is proof, I assume you consider this true as well?
Should I stop with the examples?
Do you understand that neither the fact that people around you believe something, nor a claim that historically people believed in something, can be used as a justification for any belief?

I don't think displayed price is all that important. Basically, if you are converting the funds to any other currency upon payment, you have the right to do refunds in that currency, and you should do it that way. It means giving a higher refund when converted to BTC, if the exchange rate is lower. Put this policy on checkout to avoid any future misunderstandings.
Another optional principle is, the buyer should be able to buy the same exact thing (new discounts, etc. don't count) with the refund.

I presume it would be exactly the same as gold.
If you have somehow declared it in your will as a possession with proof, then maybe it could be considered an asset. Otherwise, considering no one keeps track of or can prove who owns which address, owning the money sitting in an address only means knowledge of the keys and nothing else.
So, if claimants know the keys, I don't think anyone can claim that they were inherited and attempt to tax the money.

I think the only difference between the problems with USD stated in the genesisblock article and problems with other centralized devices is that, as I said, there is a convenient enough anarchistic solution to the former. I don't see anything that makes money supply more fundamental than, for instance, education. Education trumps anyway, if only because it by itself is enough to engineer public view on anything.
I'm closer to Europe, and familiar with the terms negative and positive freedom. It seems to me that you are associating positive freedom with Statism, which I cannot agree with. You can find, in the works of historical anarchist figures, how positive freedom can exist without the State and what "public schooling" should be like. By giving it to a central authority, you get a population that can only "fully explore" the range of persons one can be oriented to be. If we had freedom, do you really think we would have great nations to begin with?
Regarding the State doing things without coercion, I don't really get what you mean. What is it then, that distinguishes a cooperative, or a corporation, than the State?

Well, Bitcoin protocol specifies that you get a reward by generating a valid block and getting 120 confirmations. You don't get a reward by merely generating a block and miners should never count on that. No money that was owned by someone was taken away.
The only people who lost real money were the mining pool operators that pay per share. However, they are being paid fees by miners for taking the risk instead of them in the first place.
Also, it's completely miners' free choice whichever block they will build on. No committee can force miners to prefer one over the others.
If you need to blame someone, you could blame the people who introduced the bug. Then again, those are the same people who developed this protocol and the software. And anyone is free to develop a better version.
I don't mean to complain about complaints, but I don't think this was handled poorly or in an overly centralized manner.

I don't get why you got so many upvotes. The analogue of what happened with BFL, in the fiat realm, is cash only pre-ordering.
They offered accepting money through PayPal's escrow, or direct digital cash as Bitcoin. The problem with your perception is, these are not each other's alternatives. They could have offered an escrow mechanism with Bitcoin as well. As a buyer, no matter how much of a Bitcoin enthusiast I am, would not consider pre-ordering with Bitcoin equal to pre-ordering with Paypal.
Paypal is no different to buyer protection services in the Bitcoin realm, other than the fact that it's much more established. I have made tens of trades with Bitcoin over escrows, both as a buyer and a seller. I have cancelled orders and got my money back.
Finally, we want decentralization in order to be able to choose who we want to depend on. Trade isn't possible without some sort of trust, so there will be some central points somewhere along the line. In this case, BFL betrayed that trust, and it's obvious that buyers should not have paid without an escrow. I don't see an irony.

The problem with this argument is, you don't go and "invent" something by mere want of a secondary result. The universe doesn't work that way. Maybe you could re-invent some wheel and tweak it a bit your way, but Bitcoin is a major breakthrough, not a tweak.
Consider this... I suffer from the fact that I don't own any gold mines. So I invent cheap rocket fuel and competent AI so that we can send some bots to go mine some of them golds from the asteroid belt. How greedy of me?
Anyway, after the invention happened, you could say that Satoshi favored the idea of mimicking the behavior of gold. That doesn't really mean he prefers the gold standard, but rather the idea of using gold directly. It may seem like a nuance, but consider that the main strength of Bitcoin is decentralization. It could mean a different political preference entirely.

If you use Bitcoin as prescribed (i.e. don't alter the way your wallet software works), it takes an agent with access to internals of the services you use to invade your privacy. That means they have to have invaded your privacy in the first place. Even then, success isn't guaranteed.
While this means that you aren't automatically immune from government spying, it is better than VISA, depending on your use cases. For instance going through my transaction list, apparently I transact with people in vastly different jurisdictions. With VISA, this really wouldn't have mattered.

That's because Bitcoin is also an abstract unit of value. It's not that Bitcoin is imaginary money, but just a misconception about what bitcoins really are.
Pretty much like the dollar. There are no individual dollars, or physical location of any unit of dollars, etc. It's an abstract value assigned to objects by an authority. These objects can be physical, like a "dollar bill", or a number in some database, such as a bank account. There is no place where these dollars "reside", other than people's brains or some reminders encoded in media. In Bitcoin, value is assigned to keys that are made hard to counterfeit both by their nature and by the construction of the block chain. In fiat money, value is assigned to a diverse range of media that is hard to counterfeit either by their nature (e.g. banknotes), or external audits, insurances and enforcement (e.g. bank accounts). In neither system there is a notion of something that you can point to, which corresponds to the value assigned.
This, however, doesn't make either of them imaginary money. The fact that there are no instances of the units don't make them imaginary. Looking for these instances betrays a misunderstanding of what they are.
These currencies are not commodity money. I don't think the subject we are debating is deeper than this realization. However, they are value stored in encoded information to remind people what they represent. As such, they perfectly exist. Just don't confuse them with commodities.

A paper wallet is certainly safer than a (mixed) online wallet, but depending on the person, it may be less safe than a proper electronic offline wallet. I find paper rather clumsy. It can get damaged, lost or stolen easily. It's not very convenient to carry around. And they can still get electronically stolen if the computer you redeem them with is compromised.
If you have skills to boot up a computer without Internet connection (read: live CD) and trust your memory more than your ability to look after pieces of paper (my case), electronic offline wallets with watch-only capability (e.g. Electrum's Master Public Key feature) are more convenient and safe.
Actually, if we are talking about a considerable amount of money, I would prefer to use an offline computer to sign the transactions even if I used a paper wallet, so the paper wallet step is quite redundant.
Either way, hardware wallets are about to arrive anyway.

Loans are not bad (or inherently good), and Bitcoin probably won't be used for giving loans in the near future. Banks could use Bitcoin for other investment purposes. I think Bitcoin will bind well with Islamic banking.
Since bitcoins and banks aren't even remotely similar concepts, it's hard to answer the question. For instance, there can be Bitcoin banks. Actually some wallets like Coinbase can easily be categorized as a bank.
Nevertheless, deposits on conventional banks are usually insured. There is nothing that prevents a Bitcoin bank from doing the same, though AFAIK it hasn't been done yet. Also, conventional banks are usually more physically grounded, and this may help people trust that their money is safe.

Sorry, but I wasn't trying to answer your question, just giving an example relevant to the topic.
I don't think there is anything wrong with regulation, as long as everyone has the chance to opt out of it. I think creating that opportunity is the moral obligation of the regulators. Not gonna happen, I know, but that is the principle I am willing to accept to welcome all sorts of regulations.
Since we already have a thoroughly regulated monetary system, and it is getting stricter in a violent pace, unregulated money and banking Bitcoin provides is exactly what I think is needed. We can now see whether regulation of money is really justified.
I think regulation of Bitcoin is bad for this very reason. It's not fair competition. Also, apparently I don't believe in money laundering laws, so if you are specifically asking about that, I can try to address it as well.

Yes, I also felt that it was unnecessary to make such a meaningless claim, but I don't know how to phrase the idea better in a concise manner myself. Maybe "scarce like gold"? But gold isn't absolutely scarce like Bitcoin, you can always mine more gold. I think that is the difference they wanted to point out.
Regarding early adopter / Satoshi "power", I think you are talking out of context. With Bitcoin, you can do whatever you want and no particular entity has the power to change the rules. That is what's meant there, and I humbly think that it is clearly understood.
Within the context you perceived that element; well, everyone knows that some people are richer than the others and rich people have more power over the economy. There aren't too many good reasons to be afraid of the people that have a stake in Bitcoin though. We want smart people to have a stake in it, and Satoshi is one of them. If you are worried about the exchange rate, I would focus on temporary speculators more than the early adopters who have stayed on board this far.

Why do you want people to invest their life savings in an experimental technology that was invented less than half a decade ago?
Not to correct you, but to put things into perspective; just a couple of years ago nobody thought that volatility was the biggest problem with Bitcoin, not because it wasn't volatile, but because people saw much more grave problems about it. So I think our new "problem" is quite refreshing, and your first three points and last paragraph are solely about that. As you already answered, as more people use it for day-to-day trade, volatility will tend to dampen down.
Regarding government censure, you need to realize that what is happening here is even more naive than people exchanging integers. There is nothing that can be done about Bitcoin's ability to facilitate value transfer without regulating all information flow, everywhere.
We need to stop equating the "average guy" to sheeple and understand that everyone is different, and can only be viewed as sheeple when averaged out. There are many many "ordinary" people out there who would understand what Bitcoin is, and want to trade with it for the sake of trading with it. This simple fact carried us from absolute zero to here. I don't see why not over the next obstacle.

Not sure if this by itself makes you an anarchist, but it unmakes them "the State". What makes them the State if there is no coercion?


That's quite alright. My point was, anarchism is very relevant to Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is very relevant to anarchism. Even if you don't want to be associated with anarchism, by Bitcoin's "nature", you will be. We can pretend to make the association go away by playing politically neutral, but I don't think it would have the desired effect.

It kinda feels like he's saying it's a good thing, but the government regulation will crush it, and as a defeatist he doesn't see a future in it. It's not the worst approach, and this article certainly didn't give me a stroke.
What this sort of critics miss is the process that led to Bitcoin, plus the duration between the beginning of Bitcoin and the moment they heard about it. His categorization of its "allure" is as realistic as his optimism about the regulatory reach over Bitcoin. Since all the thought and effort put into Bitcoin by hundreds of enthusiasts throughout the years is completely opaque to him, he goes on to imagine some sort of spontaneous organization scenario circling around caricatures of various social roles.
Although most of this could be overcome with some research, the conclusion is mostly about one's perception of reality and insight about how the world operates. He's basically saying that it can't work because the world doesn't work this way, and the "rationale" part is filler. I guess we will find out soon enough.

Sometimes you need to carry around a lot of cash, which may not be a good idea in some areas, especially for tourists. You carry a smartphone anyway, so Bitcoin doesn't introduce additional risk. Would definitely pick someone who accepts Bitcoin if it's somewhere I've never been before.
Also, as I said previously, I would prefer paying with Bitcoin instead of giving up any personal information in advance.
In a red-light-district sort of face-to-face shopping situation in a safe neighborhood in daylight, I don't think using Bitcoin brings any advantage. It's just an additional payment option, which sex workers actually don't have. I always carry around coins with me, just as I carry a credit card, but I can't use the credit card to pay. Assuming the learning curve isn't too steep, and that most sex workers already carry a phone (even a smartphone), this should be an advantage too.

Given enough scale to cover the initial production costs, which isn't huge, I don't know how it can be less profitable.
When Litecoin was supposed to be GPU-resistant, I could understand the appeal of everyone mining on their own machines, since everyone already had the majority of investment (host machine, PSU, etc.). 
However, now that you need a dedicated machine in order for it to be profitable, an application specific device will always be much more efficient. Obviously, the difference in magnitude will not be close to what BTC mining gained from ASICs, which is immense, but it's easy to imagine an order of magnitude gain.
(Plus, installing and using ASICs are easier than GPUs, since most ASIC devices are stand-alone, and will likely be as cheap as or cheaper than GPU solutions.)

As for losing customers who don't/can't/won't use TOR, I highly doubt that it would be a significantly high percentage. This is becoming the new norm, and installing TOR isn't harder than installing any app.

* The parts of the system you are talking about are not reliant on timestamps.
* Precedence is not a factor within this context. If some later transaction is confirmed, which conflicts with an unconfirmed prior transaction, the prior one will be discarded. It really doesn't matter when they were made. Verifying timestamps would be impossible without trust anyway, and block height is a clever way to solve that very problem.
* Transactions are mainly prioritized by transaction fees, required storage and how old the input transactions are.
By the way, it seems to me that you don't think block height is sufficient in ordering of transactions. Why is that? From Bitcoin's point of view, the only time unit is block number.
Timing can be important when working with unconfirmed transactions, but time order of transactions still does not make a difference. If a later transaction propagates faster, it may prevail.

Even if Electrum is discontinued as of now, no one created any relevant programs for some reason, and all copies of the code you use today somehow disappeared from the face of the Earth, the algorithm itself is simple enough to program. The paranoid should keep a copy of the current python source.

I share the concern, and don't want to sound like an expert.
In this case at least, I don't think they are hiding the sources, so it's neither money laundering nor tax evasion. They are trying to create a disconnect between the sources and the destinations, but even though you can't follow the trail without internal info (which is probably not a secret from the government anyway), both the source and the destination is clear to the government.
Of course, you could say that Bitcoin, like your money in the bank, might not be considered fungible. Only in that case, how you created the disconnect matters. I agree with this, if it's the main concern. If they are moving money in their pockets out to unknown parties and receiving different money back, even they can't be sure it's not money laundering, and regulations would apply even if you do it within Bitcoin. But pure tumbling should be perfectly harmless.

I think most people are wary of forgetting the phrase, so they remove punctuation, uppercase letters, international characters, etc. and try to find a long and obscure but publicly known phrase. Every one of these are against the very idea of having a brain wallet.
If you are not going to create a random phrase using a method that is independent of your personal biases, which is the safest method, here are some ways of making your brain wallet more secure:
* Add a piece of personal information to all your brain wallets. It can be the same information, inserted the same way for all your phrases if you worry about forgetting. Even better if it isn't publicly known.
* Similar to the above, modify all your phrases in a way you can remember. If you use the same method for each phrase, it would be easier to remember.
* Combine phrases from multiple unrelated sources to create your brain wallet secrets.
Then again, creating a random phrase and memorizing might be much easier, depending on how your mind works.

Not only uncontrolled, but accessible. This should be true for both the data and the devices. I don't think your regular hobbyist will be able to run a Bitcoin node, let alone a mining node, in the not-so-distant future. But we will still be able to come together and manage one (e.g. buying a dedicated Bitcoin node in a datacenter and run it as a private Electrum server).
Or at least, that should be the limit. I agree Bitcoin nodes shall never become so expensive to run that only transaction processors have them. However, that is not very likely even if we raise the block size a couple orders of magnitude.

And all I'm saying that the way it's been treated in recent past is the same it's always been treated and we've grown despite that.


Maybe you shouldn't? That's what payment processors are for. Of course, that doesn't make it a currency, but a payment system.
What Bitcoin is trying to do is become a currency that would satisfy your metrics. I understand that it isn't now. But there is a path from here to there, and using it as a payment mechanism helps a lot with that. While *you* might not have a reason to use Bitcoin to buy something (since you will have to get some first, which is in your case pointless), people who want to make money without any friction might. Don't only think tax evasion and gray/black market goods, think people who can't have bank accounts, who don't have access to working permits, etc. Or just people who would prefer the volatility risk to interaction with the banking system.


Yes, it was a successful pump and dump for some, and a bubble in general (if not in a technical sense).
Admittedly, I don't know how to satisfactorily measure use. My evidence is anecdotal. I had very few people close to me who used Bitcoin at the beginning of this year. Now I see friends of friends who use Bitcoin. I have access to more services from non-Western countries. We saw some exchanges open in countries I was least expecting. I am now able to buy a lot of things directly with Bitcoin, which wasn't possible last year (have a brand new TV thanks to that). I expect that I will be able to pay my bills through an intermediary with Bitcoin before the end of this year.


Are you seriously suggesting controlling Bitcoin using capital and centralized exchange regulation? That can not happen. People will move to different exchanges almost instantly, and you will burn all your money, almost instantly. I'll just assume you haven't written that paragraph.


I don't think so. You said "it will die as a typical pump and dump", and it really is difficult to argue against that. I imagine that's why the discussion didn't progress into sane predictions.

To the skeptical mind, this might sound as if it's an investment scheme than a currency. I would let them figure this out themselves, or learn through questioning. Also, the amount of increase in value depends on many different factors, such as velocity.


You could mention that this is the real purpose of the dedicated processing power and the process called "mining". The minting of new coins is the secondary purpose of mining; a clever trick to distribute the initial money supply to people who help the network.
In addition to all this, it's worth mentioning that the barrier of entry to the Bitcoin market is almost zero. Anyone who has internet access, or even only a phone, can transact in Bitcoin.

Depends on the sort of crisis.
If I think a crisis is likely and decide to invest in gold, what do I do? I don't go out and buy gold. Well, maybe a limited amount. Most people would find it risky to store a huge amount of gold at home. People who move around a lot can't even store a little amount. You can't cross borders with it. So the usual reaction would be investing in gold representatives.
If everything goes so bad that you don't have lights on, it's pretty much certain that trading with gold will become forbidden anyway. Gold will be seized and hoarders will be punished. Unless it's full armageddon though, but then all bets are off.
All in all, I see a slight advantage of buying and storing gold at home, since there is a narrow gap where having real gold will be very useful. But after a reasonable limit, it's all representative investments and Bitcoin is the most resilient vehicle.

I don't think it matters why miners mine, as long as they do, and it helps. In time, fees will dominate as an incentive anyway.
I don't think "real world" problems are a good fit for proof-of-work. The core principle of Bitcoin, which makes is so resilient, is that it is agnostic to the real world. It's hard to solve the problem of introducing external problems while avoiding centralization. It might very well be impossible.
Also, you need to find a problem that is hard to solve, but easy to prove. You need to know how hard it is to solve beforehand. Being able to determine the difficulty helps as well. It also needs to be an area that is well understood.
Besides all this, the problem needs to be a function of current transaction data AND the transaction history.
Crytographic hashing is invented to satisfy most of these criteria, and in conjunction with the block header concept, satisfies all of them. Prime number discovery is a neat idea, but I don't think it is as useful as some people think, especially if you have to pick only certain kinds of primes. Also, more complex problems make it harder to reason about potential vulnerabilities.
Considering all of these, I don't think the current PoW algorithm is useless at all. Quite the contrary, its property of "uselessness", which I would rather call purity, is what makes it so useful.
We now have a worldwide network that we can use to notarize anything without trust. Thanks to merged mining or the ability to make use of Bitcoin as a base protocol, we can make use of this very pool of processing power in various ways. It can become an essential part of our daily lives. Imagine how much energy we can save on notarization, issuance and registration. Immense sectors will not need to exist at all. Even when Bitcoin is at its fullest scale, its energy needs would be far lower than what we are wasting on these currently. Additionally, considering the minuscule amount of data transfer required for mining, we can move mining centers to places where renewable energy production is not happening at all. This is not possible with the current systems in place.
We should of course consider and develop alternatives. It would be even better if we can spend less energy for achieving all this.

What if it never gains universal acceptance within any physical region, but you can still get anything you want with Bitcoin almost anywhere in the world? These are almost mutually exclusive within today's technology and political landscape.
Within monetary theory, it's perfectly understandable that you'd want to use the requirement of universal acceptance within a physical region, which will give you enough historical evidence to work on to build a science. It doesn't make it a practically useful definition though.
So, with all due respect, I don't think there is enough reason to consider that definition suitable for general use. (Of course, the theory will still be inapplicable for likes of Bitcoin.)
Also, hopefully the relevancy of physical distance while considering locality (or the meaning of "endogenous") will become questionable in the near future, and you will have to change the textbooks. ;)

If the allies begin attacking Bitcoin, I'm sure there will be a decline in the exchange rate. I'm not sure the demand will dry up though. There are plenty of people in the world who desire something like Bitcoin more than the peoples of USA, UK or France, and plenty of jurisdictions that will see this an opportunity to profit from demand. Besides, dissidents will always use Bitcoin.
The problem is, if major importers such as USA decide that they don't like Bitcoin, there will be less incentive for major exporters like China to embrace it.

I am simply asking how it is being used. I can't claim anything, because I have neither the evidence, nor a plausible scenario. Sorry but, "it could potentially be used" does not constitute a scenario. Some insight into how Hamas launders money and how Bitcoin could fit in there would count, for instance.
What I could claim is, as it stands, this is a completely baseless claim. You can say that it could potentially be used, with accompanying evidence of such systems being used in terrorist activities. I don't think people here can even provide this last bit, let alone anything supporting the claim that it is "probably" being used.
As a side note, "terrorist attacks" don't require much money, if at all. We are mostly talking about funding of foreign political groups here. At least that's how I perceive it, and why I mentioned AML.

If you are mining solo, your block is different from everyone else because you are sending the reward to yourself, which makes the whole data unique.

Too late? Bitcoin is in its cradle now. *Everyone* knew SHA2 would not last forever from the *very beginning*.
And what is it that is binding about the money invested? You do realize that protocol changes are by user consensus, and not up to the miners? Users/merchants/exchanges/etc. will always migrate to the fork that is best for the currency, and miners can continue using the legacy network if they choose to do so.
Besides, any mining hardware for the foreseeable future will have a limited duration of positive profit. Assuming there is near consensus, you can announce algorithm change 4 years in advance and you will have new hardware even before the algorithm gets into effect. No one will lose money, so the above paragraph is a non-issue anyway.
Bitcoin could even get rid of PoW altogether, if there were a proven alternative, and actual demand for change. It is certainly a challenge, but abandoning a multi-billion dollar worth of currency because of a programming challenge would be silly. And then what would be next? Abandoning the other fragmented alternatives when the time comes?
Seeing this as an evolving open-source protocol will obviously prevent a lot of headaches.

I used to like the idea of direct democracy and was pondering about how to build such a system. When I grew older, I realized that a direct democracy would directly result in an immensely oppressive social situation. In most (all?) regions, this would mean rule by religion or some other sort of zealotry.
The practical reality is, you can't expect the majority of people to be a good judge of character, be free critical thinkers and in general, be smart (i.e. as smart as some minority). From this viewpoint, even our shitty democracies are preferable, since there is at least some merit involved.
In other words, the social requirements of a functioning, freedom loving direct democracy are so high that, at that point you wouldn't need governance at all. It would automatically dissolve to prosperous anarchy. 
What would be the best for the world in the short term are autonomous cities. This also requires the same kind of enlightenment as the above, but lower. And it would create a fair ground for competition between regimes.
Anyway... One can always dream.

The exchange value of Bitcoin fluctuates more than most State sponsored currencies, since the value is determined purely by supply and demand. If and when the Bitcoin economy becomes big enough to have plenty of opposing forces, an equilibrium will be easier to reach.
As others have said, this affects merchants the least. What I would suggest to merchants and service providers is to convert the costs portion of the received amount directly and immediately to the currency they pay those costs with. This doesn't only apply to Bitcoin by the way. They can keep the net profit portion as Bitcoin or convert that as well. There are intermediaries that manage this on-the-fly.


I don't think it's fundamentally more manipulable than any other currency. However, unlike State issued currencies which give a huge advantage to the State, Bitcoin can be manipulated by anyone.
Keep in mind though, that, Bitcoin's monetary base cannot be inflated; i.e. no one can create bitcoins from thin air.


It's not easy to make online transactions that are illegal where you live with conventional online payment systems, so it's likely that ordinary people would prefer hard cash transactions for these purposes, or Bitcoin.
For larger amounts, created through organized entities though (e.g. "funding terrorism with drugs", etc.), I suspect the banking system is the preferred transaction mechanism. So, just like we don't know what portion of Bitcoin transactions are illegal from the perspective of the initiator or receiver, we don't know what portion of transactions in the conventional banking system is dirty money.
Another difficulty I'm having with this question is, what we should consider illegal. For instance, a load of people buy and sell shares from companies that exists solely in the Bitcoin realm. The activity these companies are involved in are not illegal, but I'm pretty sure you can find a multitude of laws that don't agree with running this sort of business and/or investing in it. It's quite ridiculous when you think about it, but there are so many regulations in so many jurisdictions that if you are doing something slightly out of the ordinary, you are quite possibly breaking some law anyway.
If we are talking solely about drugs, I would speculate that they form a minuscule part of the total transaction volume, and a considerable part of the traded goods.

Basically, I don't have an answer to that problem. Though I never claimed that I had one. I also have no means to prove that Bitcoin is a good model, let alone the best one.
As long as I can't prove that it can't be done, it's a valid pursuit. All I'm saying is, as long as these ideas can compete, there is nothing wrong about coming up with new ones.
I just believe for the time being that only a technically pure currency is capable of being truly transparent and neutral, and Bitcoin is just that. I also know that something like Freicoin has no hope whatsoever. Without the monopolistic nature of fiat currency systems, Bitcoin would automatically win.

I'm assuming you are talking about transaction analysis and recording of IP addresses.
The block chain is completely open, as well as the Bitcoin source(s), so the function or existence of the NSA doesn't change anything. Transaction analysis is available to anyone, and is being openly researched at the academic level, which consequently will bring us better ways to protect our privacy.
Same goes for harvesting IP addresses that have a naked connection to the Bitcoin network.
However, recording of IP addresses together with broadcast transactions and following analysis can be used to determine originators of transactions. It's not a sure bet, but can break anonymity in some cases. This can be easily circumvented by many different methods, which you need to practice to protect your privacy anyway.
For extreme security, off-line transactions can be used, and can be submitted over TOR. I use a dead laptop with no hard drive, a functioning CD-ROM and a live CD that has no networking functionality to do just that. Most people (actually including me) don't need such level of security, but if you are paranoid, it's not harder to set up than burning a live linux CD (optionally with Electrum and disabled networking).

What you say might be true for those who sold there before the withdrawal problem was known by the market and the exchange rate difference reflected this knowledge. I am one of those unfortunate people, so I know what you are talking about. However, honestly, this doesn't include people who claim to have sold at $1200 a coin when other exchanges were trading at a far lower range. There is nothing lost there. Just buy back and sell elsewhere.

The law is unenforceable for hobbyist miners, but could be slightly more effective for mining companies and such. I don't know enough to judge, but the extra regulative pressure could keep mining more decentralized, which is a good thing.

Yes, confirmation time needs to be nearly zero. That would be pretty useful. Also, free micro-transactions.
It seems Ripple is the best candidate on this front, but from what I heard, it's not nearly done yet. I don't think Bitcoin clones are likely to get ahead of Bitcoin regarding this. It's more likely that a p2p layer on top of Bitcoin will eventually provide this, making everyone happy.

AFAIK, they were always an open source exchange platform, and they had been talking about the idea of opening an exchange themselves, using this platform. This doesn't seem to have changed. Remittances is the angle they seem to have chosen to advertise the exchange to masses.
I'm just speculating, but it makes sense if they will still be developing the exchange open source and expect revenue by selling maintenance service (and premium features) to other exchanges who use the platform. You could have huge a remittance industry working over Bitcoin and exchanges using the Buttercoin platform as a standard.

Yes, you can refute him easily. If he is good at maths, he should be able to read the [whitepaper]( which will clarify some facts about what Bitcoin is all about. I'd recommend him to check out asymmetric key cryptography first, if he's not familiar with the concept. Most important to note is that Satoshi (or anyone else really) has no special authority over the network. The whitepaper should be convincing enough.
As for your questions:
1. No one can set the price of Bitcoin, since no one can create Bitcoin at will. More correctly, no one can devalue Bitcoin by printing more than the predetermined rate. However, if you are rich, you could destroy your coins, thereby increase the value of the remaining coins.
2. Read 1. You can't directly manipulate Bitcoin's exchange rate, since no one has the authority to issue coins.
However, the wording of (2) makes me think I'm not getting the question correctly. Maybe he thinks there is a way to set bitcoins' exchange rate other than issuing more of them?
The exchange rate of Bitcoin is a function of supply and demand. If you can influence supply and/or demand, you can affect the exchange rate. People of economic or political power may have such influence, including but not limited to Bitcoin developers, Satoshi included. I'm pretty sure he's not talking about this sort of manipulation though.

Try and find the best ways you can benefit from Bitcoin. For instance, can you produce intellectual work? Produce things and sell them to people around the globe, without worrying about barriers and formalities. Do you have tangible items to sell? Try one of the Bitcoin auction sites (e.g. bitmit.net).
Also [check out the list of businesses that accept Bitcoin]( and see if there is one that you can benefit from.
Mining is a very specific endeavor and I don't recommend to get mangled with it, especially if you aren't a hardware enthusiast. When more practical and cheap mining devices are available, you can buy one and connect, just to help the network. Otherwise don't bother.

In fact, it doesn't.
Two factor is strictly about usage. If I had a reset switch well concealed, as long as I don't expose it, I'm still using two factor authentication.
Look at it this way. Almost all sites have some kind of reset system. You can actually reset MtGox's Yubikey if you fill in a form and wait for two weeks. Most systems that use some sort of two factor authentication can reset the keys for you when some documents are presented. There is a reset switch already.
I consider a string I safely inserted in an encrypted document pretty safe. It really isn't about the encryption per se, it's about my usage pattern, what kind of environment I decrypt the said document in, etc. For some other people, a closed envelope given to a friend for storage is safe. If you think it's a risk, you don't need to activate that option.

What if I can't push that button? What if I'm stranded on a foreign country because of visa issues and my computer is confiscated? What if I temporarily don't have Internet connection? What if I have a surgery and the computer I thought was alive has crashed at home?
Also, in the case of offline wallets, the cost is certainly higher than "push a button". Not only you have to "do things" to transfer to a live system, this adds to the risk of screw-ups, and maybe in my case, a two-weeks-in-advance appointment from my bank to visit the safety deposit box. I'd just stop using offline wallets altogether. Not to mention that all novelty "physical" savings coins will have an expiry date.
Regardless, I would forget to update anyway. I lost several Namecoin domains because my update script was stopped without me noticing. I'll give my domain keys to a web service next time. No one can care about this stuff constantly.
The result of all this would be most people beginning to use mixed online wallets that update automatically.

This is an untestable hypothesis, but a silly one nonetheless. If people somehow weren't able to do exchanges with fiat (e.g. fiat disappeared altogether), service providers would still charge something.


I'd quote fiat exchange rate from a fiat exchange, because it's the most efficient way to communicate the exchange value, because fiat is the most established form of currency. I'd even use USD instead of CHF. What this has to do with the topic, I have no idea. I'll call this useless pragmatism.


Clearly, we are discussing different things. OP's is a proposal, and what really matters are if's.
The question: **If** people were more inclined to offer services instead of fiat in exchange for bitcoins, it would be more beneficial for Bitcoin.
Your answer: People need dollars, because you can't pay for everything with Bitcoin.
My answer: Irrelevant, it still is beneficial for people to prefer paying (for Bitcoin) with services instead of fiat. From a Bitcoin seller's perspective, if there are more services available, you would be less inclined to convert to fiat.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, and is very flexible. Achieving different levels of anonymity is possible with such a system. If you need complete untraceability, you can use zero knowledge proof systems already implemented on top of Bitcoin. But you usually don't need that.

I'm not an expert, but doesn't this assume perfect uniform distribution? The search space is still 256 bits; it is far from certain that you will match the hash in the first 2^160 , so it shouldn't be called "at most".
As you said though, once the public key is revealed, this won't apply. To defend against direct attacks to ECDSA, one would need to refrain from sending from the same address twice.

As far as I can tell, it is a good thing that they explicitly specified that it's not a currency in their definition. If it was, then they'd probably have to heavily regulate it. This doesn't mean Bitcoin is perfectly and indefinitely cleared, but it's a start.
If I was any large business, I would re-evaluate my position regarding Bitcoin after change in regulation. Since there was no regulation before, you could consider this an unprecedented change. This explains why they stopped immediately. As we can gather from exchanging not shutting down but complying with the new rules, things are looking good. That doesn't say anything about businesses adopting Bitcoin, but I don't see a bleak picture as of yet.

(Sorry, deleted my previous comment because I just asked what smurfing is to a banking person.) :)
In the case of Foodler, they have records of their source of income, which they can easily demonstrate. They also probably have all the trail of what goes on inside and with trusted "clean" parties as well, even if obfuscated to the outside world.
Even if that is not the case, I would argue that it really doesn't matter which transactions they do internally, or with clean external parties, as long as their accounts are correct.
An analogy to the clean party I'm talking about would be a cashier on the neighboring store. You go in and give all the change you get from your clients, and they give you banknotes in return.
All in all, I don't think this whole activity counts as structuring as long as it isn't used to avoid regulation. And there is no legislation about the transaction volumes within Bitcoin.
However, if they (hypothetically) use an external "public" tumbler, then this foundation gets shaky. They may receive dirty money, in which case they could be considered to be aiding a money laundering activity.
I think the problem with terminology is the (deliberate?) confusion created between how money laundering legislation works and what money laundering is. You could be affected by money laundering regulations even if you are not laundering money. There are many things you can do that would be considered illegal because of money laundering laws that are not themselves money laundering activity.

It's overshooting a bit, but keep in mind that by far the biggest criticism about Bitcoin less than a year ago was that you couldn't buy shit with it.

Same reason you would exchange Bitcoin for Dollars. A higher inflation rate doesn't change things that much. Until it gets so high that it would alter the purchase power within days, there is always something to do with a currency. 80-90 million people use Egyptian Pound. You don't need black market tricks to make use either, maybe you expect the inflation rate to calm down and got a fixed interest rate from your bank. Maybe you don't expect BTC to appreciate in value. Maybe you have BTC income and want to buy something in Pounds.

There is a number of Bitcoin based sites who do the exact same thing, including a subreddit. Since buyers who own Bitcoin are a very specific group, you would need a critical volume of sellers listing on buckmeup in order for these people to check it out when they need something. Maybe you could contact some prominent sellers/artists and ask them to consider listing on your site. If it is better than the rest, it will catch on.

Even if you transfer between your own addresses, the default Bitcoin client creates a change address; i.e. it pulls a new address out of the pool for every "send". If you have done less than 100 such transactions, you should be fine.
I'm not sure whether encrypting an unencrypted wallet still refreshes the key pool though, so I'm assuming you haven't done this.
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:36:30

@_date: 2013-12-20 15:39:53
There are a lot of people who think that this processing power requirement is just there to make it hard to "extract" bitcoins just to imitate gold. This false perception is just a side effect of the poor analogy of the word "mining" with what's really going on. Many people predicted that the poor choice of word would result in confusion and proposed to change it; alas the world doesn't work that way. So to clear things up:
* High amounts of processing power is needed to make it hard for attackers to alter the transaction history of Bitcoin. This requirement is there whether or not new bitcoins are minted.
* Rewarding of Bitcoins to processing power donors is designed to incentivize people to help make the network more secure, not the other way round. The mining process is not invented so that people can mint bitcoins.
* The processing power requirements or achieved security per hash don't go up or down with the number of processed transactions. You can't predict the power requirement to go up 1000-fold when there are 1000 times more transactions.
* As bitcoins' value increase, the incentive to mine increases as well. This results in an increased hash-rate, and hence power requirements (depending on the efficiency of new mining tech). However, the mining reward decreases in time and transaction fees will become the dominant incentive. At this point, optimally, the security requirements should directly dictate the power expenditure. No one knows for sure though.
* We don't have a proven alternative to proof-of-work as of now, but there are many experiments going on and it could be replaced with something more efficient in time.
@_date: 2013-02-24 03:48:32
I'm saying it's "not feasible", rather than impossible. That's why instead of confronting it with a new law, they would play it dirty, like harassing exchanges based on formalities. Whether they can succeed by playing dirty is a totally different discussion. Also, I haven't said item 3; even though they can't shut down Bitcoin, they can seriously hinder its development.
I think we still differ on the initial point. A law addressing Bitcoin without defining the entity run a huge risk of failing to be enforceable. You say that the name "Bitcoin" is enough. I tend to not comprehend the notion of it being enough, since it lacks precedent, at least to my knowledge.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are saying that even though such a law is confined to only have an effect on stores directly announcing the name Bitcoin, it would work. I instead think it's hard to imagine how the market would react to such an easy to circumvent law. My guess is that a lot of big names would be intimidated by government getting involved, but smaller businesses who would want to continue accepting Bitcoin would do so.
To my experience, these sort of ambiguities push people to gray markets rather than scaring them away from it. I've never been in the U.S. so I don't know how it might evolve there. I've lived most of my life where gray markets were dominant. However I tend to think things work better for the states of the west *because* laws are well thought of, and not the other way around. Gray markets are a very direct result of unenforceable or conflicting laws.
As to refutation 1, I think we are not on the same page on what "precise" means. As I said, we don't need to switch to Bitcoin-2 in order to alter the protocol, even every part of it that is specific to Bitcoin as we know it. (We might have to agree to disagree there.) So the law has to refer to unchangeable parts of Bitcoin. I can re-consider the whole affair when I see some clear description of it, instead of hypotheticals. It shouldn't be so hard to do, if it's easy to do, right? I have asked people to do it before and never got a reply. I myself can't derive a plausible precise-ish definition by looking at the protocol. Have you tried?

Bitcoin is not a drop-in replacement for the current system, it's a game changer.

@_date: 2013-11-11 10:33:52
This is the first time I agree with you.
The truth is, computers are a relatively new technology, most people will only have insight enough to reason about security only through immersion, which is only possible when there are enough people around who display the correct behavior. It will take a generation or two.
In the meantime, we'll have:
* Hardware wallets, for the more tech savvy people and those who keep a Bitcoin savings account
* Two-factor-over-blockchain sort of mobile wallets (e.g. used with some small OTP device)
@_date: 2013-03-13 00:46:02
* They are investigating, you can find the FBI report on the net. They might try to shut down the exchanges but it would have minimal effect, as exchanges are spread around the world already. It's very improbable that they would attack the network itself, and it's unlikely to work. They might come up with new laws to prevent its usage, but whether that can even be done remains to be seen. I expect none of this to happen though, but we'll have to wait and see.
* Bitcoin as a currency is not regulated. That's the whole point and the reason it will increasingly become popular. However, it's mostly like cash in this aspect; it's the user's responsibility to follow the law, not the currency's.
* Everyone running a Bitcoin node, and particularly miners ensure the integrity of Bitcoin. Its value completely depends on supply and demand.
* See above.
* Bitcoin is already being used in international trade. How it will evolve is anyone's guess. I think it's more likely that it will be used, for a few years, parallel to other online payment systems. If it survives that kind of load, and no one else comes up with a better idea, it might begin to replace traditional currencies in worldwide trade. Bitcoin is superior to everything else that is being used as a currency, but it's also experimental. We don't know what sort of flaws it might have, and whether they can be remedied. It needs time and users to develop.
* As largish businesses begin to accept Bitcoin, it will become legitimate. That needs people who actually use Bitcoin so that it provides enough incentive for them to adopt.
* I can't tell you to invest in Bitcoin. It's a currency, not an investment vehicle. Start using it and if you happen to gain some insight into its future, you could consider using it as a store of value.
* It's not a stock. All Bitcoin exhanges are already international. If all goes well this year, I expect more popular currency exchanges to begin trading as well.

One advantage I see in Bitcoin over traditional cash is, sex workers can accept earnest money before meeting the client. I don't know the scale of the "no show" problem, though I have witnessed agencies getting personal information of the client (at least a cell phone number) as assurance. Of course, the client now has to protect him/herself by using online reputation systems, which is recommended anyway for obvious reasons.
Others have already explained face-to-face transactions with smartphones. I don't think you need to wait for a confirmation; the transaction should show on the receiving side almost instantly. Again, online reputation systems should protect the client from scams (e.g. money never showed), just as with cash. Still, an industry standard reliable mobile Bitcoin client, specialized in face-to-face transactions, would help.
I also would recommend the sex worker to reserve a different address for each appointment. Upon reservation request, s/he generates a new address (it's easy as a click) and sends it to the client for an advance deposit. After receiving the deposit, s/he takes a note besides the address in her Bitcoin client. This can be used to identify anonymous clients if needs be, and is also good for personal anonymity (e.g. clients won't see each other's transactions).
Last, but not the least, always have a back-up of your wallet, and always keep it safe with a good passphrase.
@_date: 2013-08-06 21:36:17
It's still better, because it's distributed.
In theory, intermediary parties that form F2F connections can remain quite anonymous, because the notarization part of trust is handled by the network itself. In practice though, Ripple shares the same weakness as the old ripple (and most darknets): the difficulty of creating real F2F networks.
Still, instead of a single well-known clearinghouse, you get many small trusted entities sharing the task.

Since we don't yet have a world that works on Bitcoin, it's pretty much certain that my grocery store will want to convert the bitcoins they receive to fiat immediately, at least a great portion of it. So, my 0-fee debit card is practically the same thing, without requiring anything on their side.

You could actually use an encryption system that produces a valid result regardless of the password you enter.

However, I don't see the reason the analogy with the Euro zone would work where there is an absolute freedom of exchange in practice. If you do believe that leaving the Euro zone would benefit Greece, imagine the same happening with Bitcoin on a personal basis, any time, anywhere, at will.
Now, if I understand correctly, I can send someone in Kenya two bitcoins for a graphics design, and then they can immediately convert it to rent. That's definitely good for exports, especially of services. In the ideal case of everyone in Africa choosing to use Bitcoin, I can't predict what will happen, but I see no reason for any currently known scenarios recurring.
The caveat is, I did actually assume that there is little friction during exchange of Bitcoin to other currencies. A further assumption is, if exchange becomes tricky, Bitcoin will not gain wide adoption. In the extreme case of everyone using Bitcoin despite regulatory problems, I think the example about Euro zone may apply, but keep in mind that the situation will be unprecedented, and the scenario itself requires an immense benefit of Bitcoin in the first place.

It's not a flaw, since coins are divisible, and 21 million is an arbitrary number anyway. You could lose half of them, and the result would be identical to the total issue being 10 million, i.e. currency unit gets more scarce. You don't lose any functionality of remaining coins.
Also, as coins get more valuable, number of lost coins per unit time should decrease. I think in practice, the percentage will never be very high.

I'm assuming that wiki page is older than Ripple.com. Although the mature project doesn't change the basic idea, they have a slightly different strategy (than, say, ripplepay) which may help with the risks.
By the way, although weak links are a problem, the transactions aren't completely dependent on them. The transaction happens instantly, and everyone is only responsible for their credit after the fact. When there is enough traffic (e.g. just a few per person each month), no one will come and say "hey dude, my friend didn't give me the money for your transaction you made last month, so I will pass the damage to you".
Also, Ripple seems to think they can achieve scalability and stability through promoting trusted exchangers (which trust each other), which would decrease the chain size considerably. In practice, you would be able to deposit to one exchange and withdraw from another, which would help a lot with fiat transfers.

Nothing is easy, but you make it seem more complicated than it is. You remember that once upon a time viruses used to spread through diskettes, don't you?
Once you have the exploit, all you need to do is constantly infect writable media and retrieve the data. When the exploit works, harvesting and returning the data is not a problem. The hard part is having the exploit and a compromised computer in the first place.
Additionally, your offline computer seems to be booting off of a writable disk, which would let the infection stay resident.

The most versatile solution to this problem is achieved by thinking in value. People should get used to getting paid their refunds in the "current value". It doesn't matter what the value is measured in. Since you had paid in Bitcoin, it is certain that the value is convertible to Bitcoin. The principle is, you should be able to buy the same thing with the money you get back. This works just as well in other situations, like sharing a bill with friends that will pay a later time in a different currency.
However, I'm pretty sure this won't work with the mentality contemporary consumers are trained with. It's a pity though.

I don't think hoarding is a real problem; currency isn't an essential supply for life after all.
Instead of exchanging fiat to x BTC to hoard, you could buy x+y BTC, save the x and spend the y. If the value is "bound" to go up, you have already profited from doing this for the time it took you to spend the whole y. I think people are already doing it intuitively.

One thing you have to consider is, the loudest doesn't mean the most dominant. Second, consider the natural bias of the sources you use to gather information. If you are an Anglophone for instance, you will be heavily restricted. If you additionally limit your interest to popular channels, such as Reddit, then it's natural that you will be bombarded by the typical American dichotomy, which doesn't even mean anything elsewhere.
I'm not sure even the majority of developers are libertarians. I can recall that a few months ago some Redditors were calling the lead developer a Statist, and another one a religious freak. A considerable amount of our hashing power comes from China, Russia and Europe, where your dichotomy is, if not entirely, mostly irrelevant.

I can always say I'll accept Satoshis. Or all of us can suddenly switch to calling it Freemoney. You have to define what Bitcoin means. If it was a legal entity, it would be easier to define. There is always an unmistakable definition or reference/directions to a definition in the law, it's how it works.
Your analogy is not correct. You can ban specific books with specific content. You can ban all books. You can't ban a group of books without specifying their nature (e.g. romance novels).
I think you think banning Bitcoin is equivalent to banning a single book. That is not really true. As I said, you can replace everything, including all the data in the block chain, and still have a functioning Bitcoin. Hell, even if you found some unreplaceable data in Bitcoin that you could refer to, people would just switch to Litecoin.

Ripple is a payment system, not a currency. The reason XRP (or, as you say, Ripple Currency) exists is to prevent payment spam. So it needs to have some (very little) value.

If the message is very unspecific, the party receiving the signed message may be able to use it to lie people about owning the address.
For instance, I ask you to prove you own an address, and you sign the message "Hi there!" and send me the signature to prove it. Then I go on and use this same text and signature to prove to a third party that I own the address.
That's why you should always sign very specific messages, unmistakable in any other context. You could include your contact information in the text itself, and that you want to correspond through that channel. That way it will be impossible to use it for phishing.
For the cryto noobs; if you change the text, the signature won't match. The magic is providing the correct signature for that specific text, which proves that the signing party owns the private key to the public key provided (in this case the Bitcoin address).

If it is users versus ASIC miners, then users automatically win, and it really doesn't matter where the miners mine.
If it is some users versus others, the switch should not be attempted. You need a great majority of users' agreement, otherwise it will not happen anyway, regardless of the wishes of some faction (e.g. developers). I trust the judgement of the Bitcoin community.
Hopefully, this whole deal would be handled in a way that causes as little problems for ASIC miners and manufacturers as possible. Announce it a few years in advance, let the old hardware become obsolete, give some time for the new hardware to be developed and tested, and everyone should be happy. It is actually an exciting opportunity for people who are into mining.

There is an obvious misunderstanding here. I'm not talking about inventing a political movement that doesn't exist. I'm talking about coming up with a specific organization structure without clear evidence, and proceeding to restricting liberties by implementing laws around these claims for the protection of the people, and detaining/torturing/killing another bunch of people.
As I suppose you already admit, we don't have access to any information that justifies the reaction to the threat of money laundering by terrorist organisations. These organisations, be it AQ, Hamas, Hezbollah, PKK, and really any others I can think of, are supported by ordinary citizens. They may have some income from illegal trade, but I'm not sure why they would be affected by any money laundering regulation.
Shamelessly quoting from Wikipedia: :)


In the cases of massive resistance movements like Hezbollah, you take precautions at the political level (banking sanctions, etc.) as there is no way AML laws will help you.


I don't get it. Are you claiming that everyone who have been accused of being a terrorist was in fact taking credit? I'm talking about real, physical people, not abstract entities.
As a side note, also quoting, "For several months after the 9/11 attacks, no one, nor any group, claimed responsibility for the attacks". This is in fact wrong however, since Japanese Red Army claimed it was a retaliation for Hiroshima and Nagasaki right after the attacks. It took Bin Laden several years to say anything resembling taking credit, which still sounds pretty moot to this day.


I think we are going off-topic here, but, how about the link between Saddam's regime and 9/11 attacks? How many people have been killed by a war facilitated partially by this lie? How about non-existent links to Syria or Iran? How about the more plausible links from within U.S. allies, namely Saudis? How about the many communists that were stamped out around the globe with imaginary connections to terrorist activities just a few decades ago? How about hundreds, if not thousands of ordinary people killed by the Turkish state in the name of fighting terrorist activities, which is just recently coming out, at least partially, as operations of deep state? I can come up with better examples if you tell me what would convince you.
Since we are going sideways, I'd like to clarify what I mean by justification of efficiency of these regulations. For instance, I would be the first to accept that AML regulations may indeed help with narcoterrorism, assuming it exists. I'm in no position to claim that it is indeed a clear and present danger, but let's accept it for the sake of argument. I however claim that, lessening drug prohibitions would directly reduce and remove any such threat. So, why doesn't the state pursue such solutions and instead embark on creating a totalitarian level of restrictions on people's liberties, globally?

I'd like to add that this is one of the reasons the Bitcoin clients don't automatically update themselves. The devs could issue a warning that would display on the client, but they can't force an update. Add to this that the best connected nodes and most powerful mining nodes are run by people who are integrated with the development, so it's practically impossible (at least at the current state of the development and network) for the corrupt code to gain majority without anyone noticing.

Thanks for responding.


I think this is the root of the ethical problem I perceive. You willingly support the existence of a system that does things that you think are unjust, and as long as you have hopes that it may change in the future, you feel that your hands are clean. It seems like a trick to me.
You can actually see this sort of stuff in action in the open. A nation invades another based on a lie, kills by thousands, destabilizes the region, causes wars between internal factions, resulting in loss of hundreds of thousands of civilian lives. Then the same nation elects a different party and leader, blames the previous leadership for all the evil, forever cleansing itself from the blood. They don't even have to admit that they know, deep inside, that the war was for their nation's (ahem, "majority"s) benefit.
These are all tricks, in my humblest opinion. ;-)
I think the motivation to begin calling yourself an anarchist is fueled by the desperate urge to get rid of the uneasiness. Even though I'm an anarchist, I have in fact, with my own conformance and my own money, sponsored actions that I think are despicable.

For the casual user who want to store coins on their computer, I suggest Electrum wallet. It doesn't download the blockchain, you can launch it instantly whenever you want, and it's easier to back-up (i.e. as long as you keep your wallet seed secure and private, you can re-generate your wallet).
The only downside of Electrum is the weakened privacy, because you need to expose some of your addresses to the server you connect to. I think it's still a better model than blockchain.info though, because there are many different servers to connect to, and anyone can set up their own server.

FWIW, it's more neutral than most other subreddits I visit.
Never been to the US really, but when I see "libertarian", I think about what it means in the context of Bitcoin, so it's not very confusing really (if only because libertarian doesn't mean anything else for me and most others). It really maps well to what's called liberalism in my home town.

I suppose you don't need that with Bitcoin.
The whole idea is too much of a hassle. Encrypting your wallets, creating brainwallets, etc. is also a hassle. When I compare both, I kinda prefer the latter one.
All my liquid BTC wealth is accessible through my smartphone. If my wallet is empty, I can access the money on my secondary wallets/keys through the Internet if I really need to. It requires going through some more hoops for me to get money out of my bulk savings wallets, but it can be done in a few minutes nonetheless. In extreme emergencies, I could tap into my brainwallet.
All this doesn't require more than remembering a few passwords (and a phrase for the brainwallet example). Which I have to do in order to access my bank account anyways (one bank requires me to remember 3 passwords, two of which I have to change every three months).
One more thing though... I use a VISA card that is refillable with Bitcoin. I don't pay any fees to convert BTC into a meal, just the exchange rate. However, it takes some time for the coins I exchange to go through the system. If the deposit took a few minutes, that would be extremely convenient; without the stores having to accept Bitcoin, and much much easier than Apple's human ATM idea.

ASICMINER doesn't need this revenue to expand their mining farm, they already have more than plenty of funds to do so. They are giving out dividends like crazy and this extra revenue goes to that. They could easily be expanding their mining farm with those profits instead, but they are not going above their promised schedule (I'm not arguing that this is because of ethical reasons though, but it is the fact anyway). They are actually months behind their deployment schedule.
I get your perspective, but AM's business model is more or less neutral. They are trying to balance the network hashrate while maximizing profits. Selling cheap devices is bad for shareholders, and not selling is bad for everyone.
It is the reality of the last point, i.e. the fact that they have to compete with themselves is the problem here. The reason is other ASIC hardware producers. Instead of wasting millions on pre-orders, we could group up and create more companies like AM (more than two AM's for a million dollars), but we didn't want to "gamble", and this is the result. Now we are demanding AM not to maximize their profits, which I think is as silly as it can get.
Hopefully we'll see better competition in the coming months and the expensive ASICMINER devices will be a funny fact in Bitcoin's history. I bought two of these USB miners, without expecting ROI. I'm not a fan of mining anyway, but these seem cute, and can be bought with Bitcoin, so why not...

I think this is the source of the misconception.
We need to clarify, if miners can not dictate the POW function (and all hard forks really), then who does? It is miners vs. who?
In these cases, I think we are talking about users. By users, I mean merchants, exchanges, node operators, etc. So, the argument already assumes a dominant level of penetration.
If the huge majority of all nodes agree on a POW function (or whatever), then we can assume that the switch is made. Of course, the miners can continue on the minority chain, effectively resuming a parallel (and hopefully obsolete) currency, probably with the hopes of the other function failing the users somehow. This has no decisive power over the fork users prefer, though.

I don't think you get what I'm saying. Euro has a meaning, a definition, an issuer, a reference, a contact. Bitcoin doesn't have those. These analogies have nothing to do with my argument, you need to find something we can compare. At this point, I don't really comprehend how law can even refer to Bitcoin.
EDIT: In your example, why doesn't people accept renamed Euro notes? They know they are issued by the same central bank, they have the same face value. So why wouldn't they? They definitely would and it would circumvent the law. That's why the US wouldn't just say "I ban Euro" in the law, it's a ridiculous notion. The actual law would be a very sophisticated incomprehensible legal monstrosity that few could understand, and it would refer hundreds of different things to the details about what ECB is and how it operates.

I think it ultimately depends on whether they can use it to their advantage, and also suspect that they wouldn't attempt to control it if there is a considerable chance that they will fail.
Keep in mind that U.S. is very powerful, not only because of military and economic might, but also in cultural influence. Most political entities that use the democracy rhetoric construct it relative to the U.S. and Europe. Granted, U.S. is rapidly falling from grace, but there aren't many political entities that will appear to make a move about freedoms completely independent of what's going on in the U.S.
One thing I would be optimistic about is the fact that most governments are far less powerful to regulate intricate things, such as Bitcoin exchange, and there are countries where people are far less obedient. It's very hard to render Bitcoin irrelevant without an all-out attack, which may very well fail miserably.

Pretty confident about SHA-2.
Regarding ECDSA, the paranoid should avoid keeping coins in an address that has been a destination of a spent transaction before. If you are using a conventional client, it means "do not use the same address twice". I guess publishing addresses for small tips is still OK, if you aren't going to amass a fortune there.
Since "not using the same address twice" has always been the recommended usage, I bet most people are already doing that.

Consider these scenarios:
1. Bitcoin -&gt; Inflatacurrency -&gt; Stuff
2. Bitcoin -&gt; Stuff
Scenario 1 doesn't have any functional advantage over Scenario 2. Unlike gold, you can transact Bitcoin directly. So if converting it to Inflata makes you spend more, it's completely a psychological factor, not a rational one.
Now, for the rest of your question, consider below scenarios. I don't want to argue that Bitcoin is completely deflationary, so I will use Deflata instead. We'll just assume its value always goes up in the long term.
1. Inflata -&gt; Stuff
2. Inflata -&gt; Deflata -&gt; Stuff
Now, I do argue that Scenario 2 has functional advantage over Scenario 1. Since we don't spend all our currency on stuff immediately, converting it to a deflationary but easily transferable currency first protects us from loss of value, while having no functional disadvantage.
So, if you are assuming Bitcoin is deflationary, the only rational thing to do is to convert all your inflationary currency to Bitcoin and spend as you normally spend. Staying in the inflationary currency only to be able to spend is irrational. All the price adjustments that you think will prevent you from spending applies even if you don't use Bitcoin.
Luckily (or unluckily, depending on your perspective), there is nothing that says Bitcoin's value will go up all the time. If we were certain of that all of a sudden, its value would rise to cancel out that expectation anyway. So the claim against Bitcoin in this case fails regardless of whether Bitcoin is truly deflationary or not.
I've talked about this extensively with critics of Bitcoin, but I usually don't get very many responses. I'll appreciate any counterarguments.

Liquidity argument is usually a good one, but fails terribly here. By converting to fiat on-the-fly, the merchant avoids suffering as described in the article. The author is still thinking in terms of legacy banking, as if Bitcoin transfers and exchange will somehow take days.
The Volatility item goes with the above as well. Regardless of Bitcoin, it makes sense to convert on the fly to the vehicle in which your debt is denominated in, anyway. If Amazon somehow pays some of their costs in Bitcoin, they can keep that portion as Bitcoin.
Other problems are all about different aspects of the fear of government pressure. Duh.

Nice, but I don't see Bitcoin offered in any of the subscription pages. If I'm not mistaken, this seems to be strictly directed for Bitcoiners, which will likely be unsatisfying for the service in the long run. There are only a few of us who would subscribe. On the other hand, many people who would think about subscribing anonymously, upon seeing the Bitcoin option, could consider it. Especially with the discount!
I guess we could at least spread the word and show that it can work for MetArt. It might convince them to include it with the conventional options. If recurring payments are the issue, accept Bitcoin only for the yearly non-recurring option.

Well, I think we agree that *if* you had enough you can spend on directly with Bitcoin, you could move some part of your checking into Bitcoin with no rational downsides. At that point, if you don't spend the "extra" checking portion of your coins, it is purely psychological. I hope we are on the same page. However, we also agree that this isn't the current situation.
Two things I'd like to add. First, I'm more optimistic about the route from Bitcoin to "stuff", since for the last few months, most of my expenditures are in Bitcoin. Arguably, we could include vehicles such as gift cards purchased with Bitcoin in this (and services like bitspend, etc.), since they help you to hold your wealth in Bitcoin and directly spend anywhere. If so, I can say that most of my expenditures fit the "Bitcoin to stuff" route. Although this wouldn't even remotely fit everyone's routine, I think we are getting there.
Second thing is, as you said, it's hard to imagine the effect on the economy if Bitcoin were widespread enough. The "purely psychological effect" (at least the way I perceive it) could ruin it for everyone. On the other hand, it might completely disappear with these mechanisms becoming common sense, which I think what would happen.

Exactly! We can all help each other live peacefully, share our ideas and donate with each other to make the world a better place.
What does that have to do with taxes? If what you are saying is true, why in hell would you want to coerce people to pay taxes, with the threat of throwing them in prison, potentially for life? That is the exact opposite of the perspective you project in that sentence.
Taxes are not donation. I donate AND pay taxes. If I didn't pay taxes, I would voluntarily donate more to whatever causes I see fit.
I share my ideas with others about what I consider a worthy cause.
I help people and I live peacefully. I don't see money as a means create pleasure for myself but a means to change the world to my will. While this includes healthcare and education for me and my kids, it also includes helping create a better environment for everyone. It includes helping people in poverty. It includes helping people have access to information.
The key point is, I decide what is better for the world, to the extent of my means. My monetary wealth is one of those means, just as my skills, knowledge, strength and other resources.
I am not forever, nor my legacy. What can endure is my idea of "good". That is why I am for the things I mentioned above.
Tax me and use that money to kill people, indoctrinate kids to be content with what you see fit, and I become bitter.
Honest question: Who here hasn't contributed, with their taxes, to killing of innocents. I'm not an American but I know that I've contributed to killing of my own citizens in my own damn country. Maybe you are of a different point, but I think Western nations are far more dirtier in this aspect. Some of them are directly responsible of killing children in my country's neighbors.
God speed, if you really think you can change the world with your votes. As long as education is part of the system, you are out of luck.
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:24:03


Sure. I also don't know who is really controlling the world economy in general and to what end. While Bitcoin is a lot more transparent, it is a lot more shallow than the fiat currencies I use. I'm equally concerned about all of them.


Of course. The demographic changed a lot in time. I think the number of casual users continuously increase, while the capital being hoarded seems to remain a constant ratio of all coins, evidenced from the fact that [the 30-day average Bitcoin Days Destroyed graph]( seems to be linearly increasing.
However, there were always people trying to corner the market. You were able to do it with thousands of dollars, now you need millions. What may have changed, besides the required capital, is the competence of these manipulators. That could be a worse situation (I'll actually ask about this to a game theory prof I know). On the other hand, it would make sense to assume that the variance of these manipulators will get higher as well, so the conflict of interest should lead to a more stable market.


It would be a service if limited to remittance to local currencies. I'm mostly talking about doing micro-business with random people on Earth, which, despite what you may think, was not really possible before Bitcoin. The only remaining barrier I see (assuming Bitcoin gets adopted by enough people around the globe) is language. I'd go further about fighting against English as the Lingua franca, but there is no doubt in me that you would find it delusional. ;)


Definitely! It's hard to communicate all the risks, so what most (or some?) Bitcoin enthusiasts preach is "do not invest more than you can afford to lose". It's not a replacement for a good understanding of risks however.


There is no supranational entity that can regulate Bitcoin exchange, so you don't have the means to do anything about it. If you even could halt trade on exchanges worldwide, what would happen is metaphorically-over-the-counter traders making a shitload of money.


I was talking about [market liquidity]( Even if you can easily trade it for any other currency, you need a huge volume to gain stability. Since the exchange market is shallow, you can affect the rates with a few million USD worth of any currency. Volume traded in bitcoins is surely important, but we will never have enough liquidity with the current exchange rate. If BTC/USD was 1000, with 100K coins a day, we would have lower spreads and volatility would resemble the Foreign exchange market.

@_date: 2013-09-04 07:19:35
One could say that the reason is, countries don't want to deal with tax evasion and criminal issues of other countries, and 10K is a safe limit which no one will care about to look for. The value will only get lower through inflation, and I don't think the limits will be increased.
Of course, the real reason is, because they can put a limit. A world dominated by colluding states means that every single human will be prevented from doing things that the majority of people can't clearly reason about to find a motive for doing. We are all getting confined to the limits of imagination of the commonest form of idiot.
Nothing is more obvious than the fact that taxation is not practical or efficient, and causing an immense amount of problems. Try explaining it to someone who believes anyone who talks against the status quo has some sort of sinister agenda. It all depends whether this status quo is keeping the said person fed and sheltered.

Why would you want to consolidate the revenue in a single address? Is this related to paper wallets or something similar?
You can insert all the private keys you mentioned into a single electronic wallet and spend from there. If you want to consolidate all of them into a single address, you can do so with a single (high fee) transaction moving all inputs to a single output. Any wallet software would do this "combining" thing automatically.
However, I'd rather create the addresses through a deterministic process to do away with all the work and any limit on the number of addresses. If the concern is security, you can do all this from a computer that has no networking capability.
Just launch Electrum, create a new wallet, do what you must do to preserve the seed and keep it secret and copy the master public key. After that, you can use this master public key on any Internet connected computer to create addresses as needed and see your total balance. When you need to spend the money (or consolidate, or whatever), you can generate a transaction and get it signed on an "offline" computer (i.e. no networking capability), thereby avoiding losing the money because of a compromised computer.

@_date: 2013-11-28 10:28:43
Not sure how common, but I've been spending Bitcoin on everything, from online services to electronics, clothing, consumables and recently even vacations for the last 3 years.
I began spending right after I purchased some coins, primarily because I wanted it to catch on. It was easy to use for me and you could constantly find something interesting and attractive, especially if you are online all the time. I made a habit of purchasing more coins during crashes, so for a while most of the appeal to spend it came from the increase in value. Also, it was fairly easy to make money in Bitcoin, especially if you are more comfortable with doing random peculiar things than working on a single task for a certain income. At times, I was making more coins than I did spend, and other times I was getting close to depleting my Bitcoin wallet, but in general I think I have maintained a balanced investment/spending strategy, albeit mostly accidentally.
The way I think, the expectation of an increase in value doesn't conflict with spending at all. There isn't much difference between keeping some fiat money around and doing your spending with it, and keeping some coins around to spend, especially if the exchange rate is increasing.
However, even though I don't mind exchange rate dips (just as I don't follow coupons and discounts all the time, and it averages out very nicely anyway), others might care more about this sort of fluctuation, and it makes a lot of sense. All in all, the "deflationary nature" of Bitcoin shouldn't hinder trade, but volatility is certainly doing it. I believe it's a temporary phase, but we won't know for sure until it's over.

Then those people don't remember how it happened back when GPU mining was first implemented.
You get a bit of centralization, because more agile entities dominate the market (if you can even call it a market at that stage). Then, the hashing power gets homogenized. It's already happening, though not as rapidly as I would have hoped. This would already have happened if BFL didn't exist and actively discourage competition and then fail miserably themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:49:43
Then you would have to sell them off at a lower price, if you could sell at all. Also, you are taking the exchange rate risk (which is huge, a USD/BTC collapse would lead you to a situation where you are in an immense amount of debt) and mining difficulty risk. As a manufacturer it is very rational to try and sell off machines as quickly as possible. Even better if you are operating on pre-orders.
The problem would be price discovery. It would be optimal to sell the units at the price of projected mining income minus cost of risk. However, I imagine first shipped Avalon units got far less money to Avalon than they potentially could. Conversely, if competition succeeds, it's not hard to imagine that they could be forced to sell off newer units at a loss.
That's why ASICMiner is selling only completed units, only through auctions, which is as close as it can get to a win-win.

And the total will never get close to what we are currently spending for money to exist.

Most Bitcoin clients I use create a new (normally invisible) address, called a change address, each time I spend. Also, it is always recommended to use a different receiving address for each payment you receive. These help with tracking your own transactions, helps with privacy and has no cost to the network.
The above combined makes it very difficult for someone to track you. I have always used Bitcoin this way, and it really hasn't bothered me. 
If having a single address for a specific sort of payment (all I can think of is donations) is more practical for you, and you want to announce this address to the whole world, and have enough volume coming in for this to be a concern, you could use some mixing. I don't think most people fit in this category though.
I think your experience is affected by the fact that your Android app uses a single address. I would dump that app and use one that actually conforms with the recommended way of using Bitcoin. Addresses should not be seen as "account"s, and you should have hundreds of them.

I'm not saying they don't need some license, but it's far from certain that a costly money transmitter license is the one the State will be looking for. You may get it, and it may still turn out to be other criteria that gets you into trouble. VAT was just a simple example off the top of my head.

In the modern world, banks are effectively the financial police, so it all depends on how they will be influenced from the top by key people. There is nothing "official" that forces the US banks act the way they do; it's a pretty much unknowable situation for us, including the managerial staff of banks.

Namecoin is not only for domain name resolution. It's basically a list, linking "name"s to data. The data can be anything. You can store your public key or your contact info in it for instance. It is very useful for distributed, notarized data. As an example, if I get your Bitcoin address from your website, it could be that the site is compromized and I would be sending the money to a wrong address. If I get it from the Namecoin database, I can be certain that it's yours (unless you got your private key stolen though).
Incidentally, this is very useful for domain names as well. So with the current specification, you can fill in the data to link a name to an Internet IP, a tor hidden service, etc. and let the resolver decide which one to resolve to. It fixes the unrecognizable domain name issues of tor, i2p and the like in a very secure manner.

As others have said, this doesn't mean there is no VAT when buying with Bitcoin. The notion is absurd.
However, Bitcoin is accepted exactly as any other currency now (as opposed to commodities, however exempt some of them may be). This should, for instance, mean that you can sell physical Bitcoin loaded items without having to pay full VAT on the value of Bitcoin.
Add to this that, in some European companies (including Germany), you don't pay capital gains tax on Bitcoin if you are not an active currency trader (e.g. you hold it for more than a year before selling), and it looks like a pretty favorable situation.

There is no ban against Bitcoin either, but banking and payment institutions are trying to distance themselves from it all the same.

I had come up with a deniable wallet idea, but seems no one has implemented it yet.
Basically, we modify Electrum so that it never saves the wallet file, or only saves an encrypted version of the seed. You have to enter the seed (or the password) each time you launch it. You can always enter the fake seed/password that generates a completely different and valid wallet and send a few coins to those addresses.
A more advanced version would save the predetermined "fake" addresses in the wallet file, and never save the addresses generated with any other seed. Then the "fake" wallet can in fact be your hot wallet, and the others could be your savings wallets.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but does it matter if it's a live OS if it's not write protected? I would go with the installed system if not.
However, I highly recommend write protected media for the OS. You never know what gets written in there, especially with these fancy operating systems. The only medium that gets written in should be the transaction stick (which can be wiped after transaction), and the encrypted wallet stick.
As a side note, I haven't used Armory much, but old versions of armory should be able to sign transactions of the newer versions, and I think it's wise to delay updating the signing client (as long as there are no discovered security bugs) to avoid newly introduced bugs.
I have no opinion about putting Armory together with the wallet. It makes total sense for a write protected (e.g. optical) live OS, and it won't increase the size requirements that much. Paranoid advice: Just make sure not to decrypt the wallet stick on an online computer in order to update Armory.

I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with the basic idea of adjusting the currency to achieve some economic objective. A currency that is agnostic to real world parameters, such as Bitcoin, has its own problems.
If there were some transparent immutable algorithm that adjusted the currency, and the use of that currency was completely voluntary, then I think it would be fair game.
The problem with the central authorities is the lack of transparency, predictability and clarity, and often the coercive nature of their policies.

I think naturally, their rate of getting lost depends on the distribution. Therefore, assuming the distribution is homogeneous enough, lost coins should be a proportion of the totality of usable coins. For instance, you lose half of them the first year, half of the remaining next hear and so on. You will never lose all of them.
Besides, while also being related to the distribution, it's still necessary to point out that the exchange value of coins drastically affect the chances they get lost. So much so that I imagine a negligible amount is getting lost recently.

He might not directly get it, but it might convince him that this is not a scam.
In my experience, smart people who yet haven't met the concept of public key cryptography usually think in terms of central mechanisms/authorities that deal with information flow. This leads them to think that there is some obfuscation that can ultimately be manipulated. Think of a nuclear weapon that needs two distinct keys to be placed in two distinct holes to get armed. Ultimately, under the panel, you can imagine that there is a wire that arms the bomb. Bitcoin isn't built on this sort of obfuscation. There is no secret that the "creators" know and you don't.

Maybe not all problems, but this is the one most obvious development that was apparent, probably even before Satoshi began working on the client. Your second paragraph could look witty, if only it was sarcasm.
We certainly don't know how the system can handle a few thousand or even hundred transactions per second. But to call it untenable, you need to have a fundamental reason why it can't.
You seem to think that storage will be the bottleneck, which is quite odd. For instance, with a mere 50 Terabytes a year, you can handle thousands of transactions per second. I would rather focus on other potential bottlenecks, like bandwidth, signature verification (CPU) or seek times (RAM).

I think it still depends. If you are operating out of a well known hotel with security cameras, in a country where prostitution is perfectly legal, you are far more safe than, say, a taxi driver. I'm not saying you are perfectly safe, but having some piece of unverifiable personal information won't add much, if any, to what you already have.

It's already suggested, but I'll emphasize anyway.
* Download Electrum: 
* Create a wallet and copy your "wallet seed" in somewhere safe and secure.
* Encrypt your wallet with a good password and back it up anyway, in case you lose your seed.
Additional tips:
* Electrum uses a deterministic wallet, which means, even if you lose all your wallet backups or forget your password, you can re-generate it from the seed. However, this also means you need to keep your seed out of reach, which should be easy to do since it's just a small piece of data.
* You can use the same electrum wallet from multiple locations. This is one advantage over bitcoin-qt.
* If you are backing up to a remote location, it's wise to use a secondary encryption. Literally anything really, 7zip, gpg, truecrypt, etc., since this is just to be on the safe side.
* It is wise to create a second savings wallet the same way described above and keep the bulk of your money there. Keep it away from the computer you use to enter your passwords, and make some backups just in case. It is also possible to make off-line transactions from your savings wallet if you get truly paranoid at some point.

This is one of the better ideas. Please add a **tl;dr** at the top of your post.
1 bitcoin == 1 million bits.
The word "coin" evoking a gold coin may work for the perception of "something of value", cancelling out the psychological effect you've mentioned about having micro-something.
It will also work well with satoshis in the future, since people are already used to two decimal points for currency.

I considered selling some of my coins during the bubble, and looking at the financial markets of today and the banking system, I've realized that keeping my wealth in Bitcoin is a sane choice, if not THE sane choice. If I were a speculator, I would be crying right now, but I'm not.
Trusting Bitcoin as a viable store of value does not have to correspond to violently trying to buy it during every bubble. I prefer being paid with Bitcoin, and except terms of volatility it's not bad at all. If I'm buying something online, I spend those coins, otherwise load my Bitcurex card to do local grocery shopping.
I think a lot of investors believe the "criticism" of Bitcoin regarding deflation. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you don't believe that it will make you rich, you'll be just fine. Even exchanges in times of volatility cancel each other out in the long run.

The whole deal with Bitcoin is that it doesn't need a central authority. If you have trusted authority, proposing to use a crypto-currency setup is just mind bogglingly stupid.
The whole effort do prevent double spending is completely unnecessary, since you could authenticate transactions centrally anyway. Transaction delays are completely unnecessary, since you could provide instant transactions with a centralized system. If you have trust, you can even do all this with decentralized trust. Hell, you could actually make it untraceable on demand (e.g. secret government expenditures) with blind signatures.

* Anyone can mine bitcoins. You yourself can become a Bitcoin node and optionally start mining on it. Although, since it's too hard to solve a block all by yourself, miners get together and pour their processing power into "mining pool"s. These pool servers are operated by various people worldwide and they are very accessible. You can also start your own pool, there are no restrictions for that, or authorities to get permission from. If it's a good one, people will come and mine there.
* Bitcoin's rules are enforced by Bitcoin nodes, only some of which are also miners. Unless most nodes AND most mining power agree on some change, your "reduced difficulty" blocks will be rejected by the network immediately.
* There is only one equation, which was created when the network started: "the SHA-256 hash of a block's header must be lower than or equal to the target". You can think of the block header as [a number gathered from all the current transactions and some additional data]( The target is a number the network agrees on by consensus, which defines difficulty.

What I do is, use a live linux CD with no networking capability on a computer without a hard drive and carry the data using a usb stick. I use Electrum because it's light and gets the job done.
Remember to check the transaction details both before signing on the offline machine and before transmitting on the online one.
*(If you don't want to memorize the wallet seed and use a wallet file instead, make sure to use an encrypted drive for your wallet as an extra precaution and ONLY access (i.e. decrypt/mount) the drive on the offline computer. That means creating the drive and the wallet on the offline computer as well, in order not to ever enter your password on a networked computer. You can back up the encrypted drive as is however. Using a smallish encrypted file as your drive makes backups easier. However, memorizing the seed is even more convenient (as long as you don't advertise that you are keeping a shitload of money in your brain).)*
If you are using a decent live CD which is created with security in mind, you don't actually have to use a laptop with no hard drive or no networking. Just be careful not to enable these during and after the process until shutdown.
I imagine a Raspberry Pi without WiFi functionality can be used with a write protected memory card to make things easier. Electrum also supports transmission of the data through QR codes, so you can even get this automated. An old N900 phone should also work but I'm pretty sure that getting the QR code working will be hard.

Selling them is a much better idea. You need to really calculate the expected difficulty curve, the cost of initial production, costs involved with production and mining and finally the consequences of attempting to do it. What if Bitcoin's value plummets and you go bankrupt? What if competition overpowers you (which has by the way already happened)? Would it really be worth the risk? Looking back, it sure wasn't. ASICMINER+Avalon units will probably dominate the network before BFL even has a working product.
Hardware developer and investment expert are different categories of expertise. Assuming both risks is not a better choice, IMHO. Also, it's not unlikely to expect that the total sold mining hardware will have more value than actual mined coins. It's possible that this happened with GPGPU's in the last two years. Imagine the exchange rate stayed around 5$, then those will be a loss by an extremely wide margin. This can easily happen now.
If you are really convinced that self-mining is a better idea, why not go buy some shares of ASICMINER, which is exactly doing what you suggest. They designed and produced the chips themselves and currently paying hefty dividends.

Think of this from the perspective of a sensible outsider. Any veteran finance person's immediate reaction to crypto-currencies is "then anyone can start their own".


You could always come up with some hash function (even tune-up scrypt) to make a coin "GPU-resistant", just as Litecoin did, to avoid competing for the same hardware. However, I don't think competing for mining hardware is the key to begin with.


Agreed, but my point is, if any alt-coin can gain mainstream acceptance without any innovation, it makes a case against crypto-currencies. It really doesn't matter whether that will happen all the time, a proof-of-concept situation is enough.

If there really is a criminal issue involved with the deposits (it doesn't seem like it, but we can't be sure yet), it may be legally impossible to send people more money than they've deposited.

Obfuscation and full drive encryption won't help with physical access or online penetration when the device is up and running.
Making offline transactions from a clean booted machine (e.g. live read-only CD) should help, if you are positive that there aren't any physical keyloggers or cameras around.
As an experiment, I recently created an Electrum wallet, which I only access through a clean boot using a live CD distro that doesn't include network drivers. I keep the wallet in an encrypted usb stick, but it works just fine when I type the seed from memory.
I then copied the master public key to my everyday PC, so I have live access to what's in the wallet, can generate new addresses and send coins to them, but I have to make an offline transaction whenever I need to send funds, which is relatively easy.
This is of course for a saving wallet I don't frequently spend from. Haven't tested the QR feature of Electrum yet, which should make this strategy convenient for everyday use.

The Bitcoin protocol has been implemented from the ground up by several individuals and groups till now. So if there is a backdoor, it has to be concealed in the principles. NSA may have unprecedented engineering skills and manpower, but that sort of ingenuity has a value that even NSA would not afford.

1. Bitcoin is an open protocol, and all known and widely used Bitcoin software is open source. This means, there is nothing a Bitcoin node does that is not fully transparent or fully accessible to the node operator. Of course, there could be a flaw in Bitcoin, but the creators are not in a better position to exploit it than any other developer. It's a multi-billion dollar currency as of now, and most people and entities who are interested and capable of finding such flaws are already working on it for years. There is no component of the Bitcoin network that these entities cannot access but creators/developers can.
2. Ripple is different from Bitcoin clones, since it is mostly designed as a transaction protocol for different currencies. Its main weakness compared to Bitcoin (and its clones) is that it works on immediate trust, but it can be used to "transfer" any currency, assuming the trusted paths work. Most clones of Bitcoin tweak a few parameters of the protocol (like Litecoin), change some underlying technology (like Peercoin) or specialize in a specific use (like Namecoin). Whether these are decent alternatives are a matter of debate. Almost all technology the clones use can (and probably should) be adopted by Bitcoin if they are proven to result in a better network, so in my humble opinion these networks are useful in testing features, but should not be regarded as alternatives to Bitcoin as a currency from a development standpoint. This of course excludes Namecoin or similar networks that focus on matters other than currency.
3. I would use the exchange that is easiest to access for both buyers and sellers "directly" as a benchmark. Currently, that seems to be Bitstamp. Reddit is good for getting news, since there is a lot more people who are interested in Bitcoin without going neck-deep, but bitcointalk.org is where you will get real criticism for your ideas (along with even more tiresome trolling).

You said:


To your defense, you weren't necessarily talking about *your* financial investment. Also, I'm not sure I can say Bitcoin was developed as a tool to specifically deter taxation.
One thing though; you must also consider that even if everyone here pays their taxes perfectly, this won't change the politicians' rhetoric against Bitcoin one bit.
As per my view, I would be glad to work for things that I feel valuable. This is not financing an army or a war on personal freedoms (like the war on drugs, most of the customs controls, immigration controls, etc.). I don't believe in nations and safeguarding a nation's values, lifestyle, etc. I don't believe that the neighboring nations are waiting to invade us and rape our children (they would probably invade with no rape involved, which I'm fine with).
I would pay the same amount of tax for the things I would support. I would be glad to pay for the improvement of infrastructure, or helping the poor. But I'm not given this option.
I can't say that I don't pay taxes though. My household pays an above average income tax, plus VAT and a tens of other fees. I pay them because I'm forced to. I agree with your post regarding the fact that Bitcoin doesn't make you immune from taxation.
However, I still won't pay taxes if I can reasonably avoid them. I think this doesn't conflict with your post either. It potentially doesn't even conflict with the law sometimes, because it's completely unclear where and how I need to be taxed for some transactions I make with Bitcoin.

WebMoney supports Bitcoin with the symbol WMX. Apparently you need to convert it to one of WMZ (USD), WME (EUR) or WMR (RUB) to load these cards. I don't know how mature WebMoney's Bitcoin exchange is, but it was a completely separate exchange last time I checked.

You are talking about two separate things.
Regarding the bank, I think it's obvious that introducing an alternative to something the customer already doesn't know much about and has little reason to trust is a guaranteed way to lose business. We might have to agree to disagree there, since it's a complicated matter about how humans work. I'm arguing from common sense here, so I concede that I may very well be wrong.
Your point about diversity applies in general though, and I agree. However, we must take care not to project a superficial understanding of competition into this space. I think it's optimal to have crypto-currencies and alternative free payment systems that are as diverse as possible, without making things that should be the subject of an engineering debate the business of natural selection. If this was an optimal way to innovate, AI based on genetic programming would have taken over human intelligence by now.
Litecoin is a good example of this, because it's not exactly the same as Bitcoin, while it is also not different enough to justify itself as an essential competition. For instance, Litecoin advocates argue that diverse hashing algorithms would increase the resilience of crypto-currencies. However, the first problem we are facing now is the signature algorithm, not the hashing algorithm at all, which should have been obvious anyway. If we agree with the advocates' premise, it's clear that we need also to advocate this sort of random diversification and should consider all the combinations of all the variables, which leads us to an immense number of currencies, which we can't test properly without all of them achieving massive trade volume. I humbly suggest that this is not even close to being efficient.
On the other hand, there are other blockchain based systems that introduce changes which can not be integrated into Bitcoin at all. There are also different approaches than using a blockchain. I wish people paid more attention to this sort of innovation.


Maybe. I'm not saying that Litecoin won't succeed. I rather think that this approach will lead us to getting stuck in a *local* maximum. This happens all the time in technology, and I think it hinders the efficiency of human society.

Yes, I had to defend myself in writing and verbally several times. Had to give names of the people I've worked with without their consent. Had to give details of my daily life, my work, my history, and all sorts of justifications.


I don't mind ball ache in general, and understand that "what I do with my money is my business" is not a good enough argument. However, since I am far from being convinced that any of these regulations are helpful to any higher goal I can agree with, I view them as a completely unnecessary burden. Having to dance around naked can be considered a matter of dignity when you don't believe it will change the weather.
Also, if you aren't convincing enough, you *are* guilty until proven innocent, so I can't agree with you there. I've seen people suffer for things that some other people who know or are otherwise integrated with the system get away with easily.

Well, after the confusion is over, the curve becomes realistic and the potential profits stop being extraordinary, retail price of ASIC mining machines might not be much higher than what these cooperatives can get them for. Taxation is also a bigger burden for larger farms than the hobbyist, and electricity isn't necessarily cheaper. Large operations would still be more profitable on average, but mining might not be too forbidding for the casual hobbyist, so it isn't extreme to assume that all hobbyists combined will have a higher rate than a few cooperatives combined. They won't likely be the majority though.
Add to this, that there is no incentive for cooperatives to collude. So it's not a large vulnerability.

I have a considerable amount there as well.
If people sent stolen money to btc-24 and successfully traded it and withdrew BTC, I don't know how it can be solved. Especially for people who have deposited and sold BTC. It can even get worse than losing the money, but I don't want to think about it right now.
If people sent stolen money, but they never did get blended with the exchange, or did so only for a small amount, it could probably be worked out.
Before committing to anything, I would like to know which.

However, the points made in the article are either discussed at length throughout the years already, or are mere assertions. Also some, if not most, people here seem to be justifying their response to the article with an explanation. I think this is adequate.

I keep my Electrum saving wallet in an obfuscated encrypted volume in a micro-SD card in a hidden compartment in my physical wallet. As much as I enjoyed doing this, memorizing the 12 words took almost no effort, so it seems I never actually access the card. Just boot a live CD without network connection, launch Electrum, enter the seed, sign the transaction. You could create multiple such wallets by altering a few words in the seed. Could be useful if you brag about having a brain wallet and subsequently get tortured.

Important PSA, but most of the items you've listed can be faked easily, there are plenty of legit sites that fit into multiple of these categories and scam sites that don't fit any. This sort of list might make it harder to find customers for legitimate businesses while providing a false sense of trust to scammy services, especially long cons.
I would rather recommend people to use community vetted sites, and ask directly and openly to the wider community when they encounter a non-reviewed site.
Also, this shows that we lack a decent review site we can refer people to, although there are more serious directories like usebitcoins.info which should show up on a google search.
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:29:56
Well, you can't set things in Bitcoin to begin with, so it will not be how it "takes off" and how we break the chain. It is too optimistic to expect whole sectors to take the risk, so it will be an uphill battle for Bitcoin, from the other direction. The exchange value will have to become less volatile, which requires a very liquid market. In essence, it will have to have already taken off in another sense.
So, it depends on whether you believe that Bitcoin can establish itself without Bitcoin based economies existing. I think it can happen.
International remittance is a good example. Speculative markets is another, so is Bitcoin being used as an unorthodox store of value and usage in black/gray markets. Spending Bitcoin on stuff you need is becoming very easy, so more people might prefer using Bitcoin for transacting with international friends and family. It's easier for freelancers to work internationally for Bitcoin, especially from economically less developed regions of the world. So on and so forth...
What I mean is, aside from specific obstacles, there isn't a generic mechanism (as you suggest?) that works against such a gradual process. Bitcoin may gain a wider user base through these scenarios, or may fail to do so. If it gets more established, more people will earn their wages in Bitcoin, even though they will still evaluate it based on their local exchange rate. Instead of seeing complete production chains implemented in Bitcoin, you will see it become one of the currencies used during these processes. After that, it will depend on whether Bitcoin can become dominant in any mainstream economic sector, but I doubt it. If we are drawing the limits of Bitcoin there, I'm already satisfied.
As a side note, I don't subscribe to labour theories of value, because labour is always ill defined.

Most people won't check signatures, so best way to avoid this could be to direct users through bitcoin.org.
I'm also curious to see if a bank will allow clients to create Bitcoin accounts in the following years. They have the infrastructure ready to implement this service as they already maintain different methods of storage and transfer for different currencies and assets. People have gotten used to the online banking security model, so as a naive assumption, it could be a win-win. If Bitcoin is really a threat, some banks might see adapting as the better strategy.

I don't consider myself an early adopter, but I bought them first at about $0.29 a piece, more than a few thousand I guess. I still have coins, but they are all earned or otherwise purchased at a much higher price. I almost never sell them, usually spend whenever I find something I want for bitcoins, which is often, and I spent much much more than I had bought at that price. I don't wish I had kept them, because otherwise the economy would never grow. I wasn't very optimistic about Bitcoin, but I figured it was somewhat a duty to be using it. I'm still not convinced about its bright future. I wish I got involved earlier, though I don't think I would have more coins than I have now.

The problem with Harris and the some of the other "new atheist"s is that while they support scientific method, they present no scientific studies to back up their claims about religion. None whatsoever. They of course cite scientific studies, but their main theory is not backed by science. Furthermore, none of them seem to have a background in, or a deep enough grasp of anthropology.
As an atheist, I find this sort of bigotry very dangerous. They are injecting the antagonistic religious traditions into atheists.
As for whether they are essentially racist, I don't know. Sam Harris particularly stands out. If he is sincere that he isn't, he probably should shut up for a decade or so and study anthropology.

I guess someone is imagining they can use it at dropbox. What's wrong with that?


I don't have USD. I have bitcoins and Euro. Paying with Euro over Paypal is an unnecessary additional expense. Add to that, if I can pay more things with BTC, I am more motivated to accept BTC for my work.
tl;dr What you are suggesting is what you are objecting to.
ETA: Also, it is getting more and more possible to do without a bank account. That would cut more of my personal expenses. If I am using dropbox, and it only accepts USD, I will either have to have a bank account or I will use an alternative.

Your conclusion is already the proposal. If they are willing to innovate and enter new markets, they can offer the same service they are offering for fiat, for Bitcoin.
They could either hold Bitcoin and transfer it to the seller once the purchase is cleared or convert it to fiat on arrival and hold that (in which case charge-backs would be in fiat). I don't think adjustable partial conversions will be very convenient because the customer needs to know what they will get back if the trade falls through.

They don't. Hardware wallets are like very good safes that contain cash. You can be coerced to open them.
Not having the wallet accessible at all times would be a good way of dealing with such problems. If you are worried about this particular problem, keep the bulk of your wealth away.
Another way of dealing with it could be using multiple signatures and having to go through some sort of clearance for the transfer. The clearing party could have some predefined limit to allow small and infrequent transactions only with electronic 2FA.

Of course. That part of Bitcoin is based on common consent. You can create more money, or roll back transactions, etc. if you have majority vote. I use the word "vote" here as a metaphor though, because you both need the majority hashing power and consent of users, i.e. users who agree to and react the change will create a fork, so you can easily end up with the majority hashing power and no users.
However, reaching to such a point, I think, is practically impossible, or at least far more unlikely than a secondary chain getting more popular. A conspiracy of miners to change the rules will definitely result in a new and largely unpopular chain.
Even if the idea that you can solve depression by printing money had merit, printing new bitcoins by changing the rules is at least as hard as (if not harder than) creating a new currency that has different rules and having people accept it.

The most generic definition would be anything that doesn't exist (e.g. exists only in "imagination"), so I've already made the definition (from the point of view of analytic philosophy) in my above comment. Existence is not a property, so something not existing means that its concept doesn't have any instances.
Concepts are instances of concepts, so all concepts exist. It's not that hard to understand really.
A few days ago, I had the same problem with my 4 year old. He was talking about a drawing he made and he said it didn't exist. We had to go through a list of abstractions to ascertain what does and doesn't exist. In that case, the drawing did certainly exist, but the thing that it's a drawing of, didn't.
In the case of the claim of Bitcoin being an imaginary currency, what is meant is, it's not an instance of currency. So the debate should focus on whether it fits the criteria of currency. Just because something is digital doesn't mean that it only exists in people's imagination.

Of course I do, but is it what you are really doing when buying a house? From a different perspective, you are merely exchanging investment vehicles, so it would depend on when and where you think the capital gain arises. If you are a citizen of Russia living in Egypt and buy a house in South Africa as an investment with Bitcoins, which one of those would you want to feed with your capital gains first? Also, keep in mind that USA is the only country in the world who tries to tax its citizens wherever they reside. For everyone else, it's rather vague.
As I said before, if you consider Bitcoin a currency, and assuming you don't actively trade it, and you are not domiciled where I live, you don't need to pay for the gain here. It's remotely possible that it is taxable in the country I have citizenship, but since it has pardoned all taxes arising from income generated abroad, I'll be fine anyway.
I'd like to emphasize here that avoiding unnecessary taxes and tax evasion are different things. Also, I would not count on the fact that Bitcoin will be classified as a foreign currency for tax purposes.

Define valid transaction and define the block chain. Are you going to write "block chain" in the law?
"Bitcoin" doesn't have a concrete mathematical definition. You can change all parts of it yet it may remain as it is. There are already talks about replacing signature and proof-of-work algorithms. Trying to specifically target the current system legally would be bureaucratic suicide.
What you need to do is implement a law that says all tokens of trade shall be whitelisted. And it's still not easy to pull off. None of the precedents of such an action look politically defensible.

There is a theory that Bitcoin can succeed as a store of value without being an active trading vehicle. I don't think this can happen. Holding is pretty much neutral, it doesn't help, nor harm (though it may be helping with the awareness). It is there to be held for any amount of time anyway.
Apart from being exchanged for goods and services, used for international remittance and so on, Bitcoin can also be used for investments. I wish more people were interested in Bitcoin because it enables doing interesting things.

None of which explains why prostitution should be shameful. I'm asking a normative question, but you are giving a descriptive response.
I could only detect "because it's dangerous" as a proper reason. However, there are many professions that are dangerous and not shameful.
Even if we were to accept "it is X because people think it's X" as a code of life, you are betraying that argument here:


So, in this case, if you are doing in this "nameless, faceless forums", the act itself has no reason to be shameful.
I have a daughter, and while I agree that I wouldn't encourage her to become a camwhore, I also wouldn't encourage her to become a sales person or a masseuse or a thousand other things. My biggest concern would be the dangers of being a prostitute (besides the "she can do better" part), and it has nothing to do with being shameful.

Laundering 1000 EUR at a time? You can even buy anonymous prepaid debit cards with a larger balance than that.
I think the real reason is, the banks are unable and unwilling to think about anything unconventional. Overwhelming regulation and monopolistic nature of the entities they deal with prevent the ability and the need of the banks to change, let alone innovate. Good for us, bad for them I suppose.

I still don't get the relevance. Someone could just have infected the food you bought from the supermarket, or maybe sprayed chemicals all over your mailbox. This stuff can be done mostly anonymously, or in a perfectly deniable fashion. How often does this happen?
Apparently sadists don't care enough about this sorts of attacks, or the world would be a much different place. Maybe sadism is not what you think it is.
Someone doing this on Silk Road will have to work a lot more than the supermarket attacker to build reputation, and likely affect less people. You really need to find some sort of motive specific to SR. Competitors don't work, since it will repel everyone away from the concept altogether. I can't imagine law enforcement risking to kill random innocents for an insignificant gain on the drug enforcement front.


This is akin to false security in computers. There are real dangers out there, but you won't help yourself by focusing on statistically insignificant threats.
The problem is, even though one of those statistically insignificant threats will inevitably happen (and someone will be "right all along"), because there are a lot of them, focusing on a single one will not make you less vulnerable.

Some quick notes:
* (Re. banking and PayPal) The problems are very practical to those who are having them. I don't think it's dramatic enough to care though.
* (Re. Africa) Yes, we are talking about the same thing, but I wanted to focus on things people can contribute remotely, for obvious reasons. Since we already have the Internet, a ubiquitous way to transact money internationally without censorship, intermediaries or cost would go a long way.
* Bitcoin is a good candidate for the above, and if you are looking for a better solution, I don't think you can get rid of volatility AND trusted intermediaries at the same time.
* I don't have any beef with inflation as a concept (in other words, if you can freely opt out). I'm rather worried about how it is (and other policies are) being used. Many societies have been ruined by inflation, and if you aren't one of them, you are possibly actively sucking the blood out of some other society.
* Other than international politics, I agree that inflation is very effective against cash holders, who are mostly the people who don't have access to better investments. Inflation forces less wealthy people towards mortgage deals, etc., which may not be the best thing for them.

Technically no, she says she never touched fiat, which is true.


Never used Gyft before, but I've used a pre-paid card and it didn't have any fees, so at least I know that your assumption isn't always true. I would guess that accepting gift cards are more advantageous for the merchants than credit cards, so there is money to be made by Gyft from that side.
USD/BTC exchange rate itself however, may be a concern, but there is so much gap between different Bitcoin exchanges that it's almost impossible to measure recently.


Or people who receive Bitcoin for their services and investments, which is what Bitcoin is really for.
Which is where you are missing the point actually. Spending Bitcoin within the limits of retail shops will not be automatically more convenient than other payment mechanisms that are invented for this purpose. The whole deal is making it convenient to hold Bitcoin, so that it will be an easier decision for people to earn Bitcoin.
I can now pay for a lot of stuff I need directly or indirectly with Bitcoin (in Europe). It's still in early stages, but it seems to be gaining wider acceptance. Which is diminishing the difference between earning in EUR and earning in BTC. There is of course a huge difference between these currencies, but now I don't care as much about how and when to exchange which to which (until I accumulate either of them too much, in which case I would convert it to durable commodities or real estate), and can focus on finding jobs for BTC.

This is being discussed now and again, and in fact this "news" isn't actually news.
If PayPal sees Bitcoin as dangerous competition, one of the best strategies would be adopting it as a payment option. The Bitcoin market is in desperate need of a functioning escrow system, and PayPal can provide it. In turn, they would benefit from Bitcoin's low transaction fees and enjoy at least some freedom from the banking system. It's a win-win case.
Of course this doesn't work if they don't consider Bitcoin a potential competitor.

What ASIC's do isn't so different from mining kernels for GPU's. In the end, if you can find the nonce, you can submit the block to the Namecoin network, and since it explicitly supports merged mining, it will accept it. Both chains have to use the same algorithm though, and at least one has to support merged mining with the other one.

Bitcoin-qt (and bitcoind) is for those who would want to run a "full node". We need full nodes so that the network always knows all transaction history. This is, and will remain to be, important.
Think of running bitcoin-qt 24/7 as supporting the network. You should not run it intermittently as it actually does more harm than good. So if you just want a wallet, or can't run the bitcoin-qt/bitcoind all the time, use a lighter client.
Multibit is a so-called SPV client, which connects to the network but doesn't download all the data. Electrum is an even lighter thin-client who connects to singular servers. If you are serious about privacy, Multibit seems to be the way to go. I use Electrum, since it's lighter and more portable (at least for my use cases), along with mobile wallets.
Don't forget to keep secure back-ups of all your wallets.

Yes, it can be considered an alt-coin. Technically you wouldn't call it a double spend, since they are already two distinct currencies beginning at the fork, that share the same initial database.

I don't think it's relevant. Bitcoin's value optimally scales with economic growth. Without the illusion of never ending growth, you don't need never ending resources to process transactions. In fact, the resource cost of transaction processing can steadily decrease when there is little or no growth, as we have witnessed when the Bitcoin economy was stagnating.

There is already rhetoric about Bitcoin being used for things that go far beyond drugs, with no proof at all. You can engineer proof of these "shady" markets at will anyway. So, it really doesn't matter that SR exists for propaganda. Actually, the fact that it is there for everyone to see might be reducing the effectiveness of the propaganda.
Also, we are observing rapid growth in all sorts of markets. Online stores are of course one thing, but what will hold Bitcoin together and make it stable are the gray markets. Not drugs or guns, but ordinary people trading ordinarily and globally. Bitcoin is most useful when you adapt your lifestyle to it and begin doing things that were hard to do without it.

They don't like cash, but people like cash, so they can't attack it head on. Regardless, there are regulations about how much you can carry through borders. There isn't any brilliant reason for that regulation, it's just because they can do it, because people can't think straight about border issues. I don't know about USA, but some countries have strict regulations about how cash can be used. For instance, if my tenant pays me in cash and not through a bank transfer, we'd be doing something illegal. There are even regulations saying that, outside defined limits, contracts aren't enforceable if the money isn't transferred through a bank. Luckily, this sort of regulations give rise to gray markets and therefore don't benefit the "system" at all. Basically you stop reporting trade and paying taxes when most of what you want to do becomes illegal.
So in summary, it's smart not to attack cash but try to "phase it out" slowly. Bitcoin is the worst sort of development that could happen. They are now trying to predict the amount of backlash of different actions they can take. They might even decide to let it flourish, like they did with the Internet.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:04:18

Not in this case, no. If users switch to a different hashing algorithm, there is no power left. It basically boils down to the consensus of nodes, not hashrate.

They successfully convinced people that there are evil terrorists around the world that are after them and that they need to be stopped at all cost.
Then they used this excuse to attack countries that are completely unrelated even with the fantasy world they have created. They killed countless innocents and deprived whole countries of their national will. They manufactured additional justifications to suggest that the peoples of these countries actually wanted it.
They then convinced people that there are measures that can be taken to further prevent terrorism, with necessary restrictions on their financial freedom.
They forced banks around the world to sign agreements so that they won't be able to function without honouring the fantasy.
Now, you are guilty until you can prove yourself to be innocent. If you can't give an account of every bit of property you have, they can be taken away and you can be prosecuted further.
They convinced people that they aren't responsible enough to be given freedom to consume whatever plant they please. Which created a massive black market of drugs, which in turn gave them the excuse to restrict freedoms of the rest of the populace who wouldn't use drugs anyway. 
Through endless indoctrination, they made most of this reality. The contemporary human being indeed isn't responsible enough to be given these freedoms. He believes that, if you he has nothing to hide, he has no reason to fear the State. Since he is mostly clueless about what he isn't allowed to do, he lives a life based on the directions given through his education. But he is happy.

Asking for ID however, makes sense in my opinion. That way, the parties are risking something if they are caught lying.

Yes, you are downloading all the transactions that has ever happened since the beginning of Bitcoin.
If you aren't going to run your node most of the time, you could consider using the Electrum client instead, which launches instantly and doesn't keep a copy of the data. Multibit is a balanced client, which downloads only relevant transactions from the network. Another solution is blockchain.info/wallet, which keeps your wallet online in an encrypted form (i.e. the site owners can't access it).
Having said that, running a full node is a good way to help the network.

Well, that's the gist of the problem isn't it? Otherwise it would be superior to gold in every way.


It depends whether it's "good enough" (we won't really know that for years, maybe decades), and whether there will ever be a critical mass of people who are aware of the problem and make the right call. It's a big "if", but still far from impossible.
You see, any fiat currency we are using, including USD, is forkable by nature.
USD is backed by the determination and power of one nation. From another nation's perspective, it is no different in essence than many other forks, if not all. Even though you know they can toy with it however they please, the necessary incentives are in place for you to prefer using it as the reserve currency.
Same can happen for Bitcoin with the determination and power of a big enough user base.
Of course, Bitcoin can be forked all day long, but I sincerely believe that unless there isn't a fundamental reason for the fork, it will not survive. Also, it should be impossible to integrate that fundamental into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:41:39
The problem is, if you want to get rid of all these real-world issues, you need to create an ideal currency-realm and operate on it. It is impossible of course, so you try to create the minimal connection with reality, which Bitcoin is attempting to do. Ripple is trying to accomplish this without creating a currency, but it has its own weaknesses because it's more exposed to social vulnerabilities.
We need to accept that we need our own currency to be able to function without third party restrictions (which is the definition of freedom in my book). That in turn means we need to endure the problems a currency gives rise to.

If you can prove that you contribute no negative effects to the environment by picking your nose, it can be argued that there is no base for it to be immoral.
The reason it is visually offensive is because it's disgusting, which in turn is because we learn that it isn't hygienic. You could argue that it is in fact hygienic, or that such behavior is not harmful to the shared environment. If you are right, then my learned reaction should not impose on you.
Of course it can still be considered immoral.
Same goes for "prostitution". I think I can safely argue that it isn't harmful to anyone. All problems associated with it are external to the act itself. If the whole society suddenly decided to punch themselves in the face when they see yellow, wearing yellow would be considered immoral by you as well.
So to answer your original question, any new thing (technology, idea, etc.) that allows people to act in a completely new way, almost by definition moves people against what is considered moral. Put cameras on people's phones, and they will send naked pictures of themselves to each other. Neither the phone will disappear, nor the act of sending naked pictures will stay immoral forever.

No regulation doesn't mean no responsibility or no consequences. Those events can be dealt with in an anarchistic society, depending on the model and social conditions.
I'm not an authority in anarcho-capitalism, but everything that is dangerous or morally wrong still applies. Why would the haulage firm take that enormous risk? Even if the scheme can go on without damaging the firm's property or causing harm to others that the firm would have to compensate, the public outrage would still affect the firm's profitability.
I think people who don't look up to an authority to solve their problems and seize control of their lives tend to be more vigilant. Responsible and rational consumers will come up with methods to vet companies. This is currently something we don't really have, and requires a different mindset. If you think this is also regulation, so be it.
The difference is, the hauling firm and trucker both can take the risk and fail miserably. Since we can't measure how much harm has been done by regulation, we see this risk and want to be protected against it. This is understandable, but IMHO it is unwise to compare something you can imagine and something you don't know.

I think we will have several alternative crypto-currencies in the end. They won't be separated by their technical merits but their nature as currencies. Freicoin fits this, though as you say, it's designed for the incentive to get rid of it, so no one will get it in the first place.

Though, you can't get big enough without getting in bed with them, so in the end you are right about the end result I suppose.
I know a lot of people who would complain because they were supposed to get a job after school, they were supposed to be paid a decent salary, etc., and when they don't get it, they speak of some injustice. After their thirties, they start to become bitter. Some of these people, who actually accumulate enough money to open their own business are often than not shitty towards their employees. Ah, and their verbal contracts are never binding.
I personally don't think I have this right, and always felt perfectly fine about what I deserved. I don't think it has anything to do with being rich, it's just a perspective. I don't think I'm a libertarian, at least in the American meaning, but even American libertarians don't strike me as poor dreamers or rich bastards. Theirs is a mostly healthy attitude, which I share.
Bitcoin is not a silver bullet that will remove cartels and monopolies, thereby resulting in an economy with perfectly equal opportunity, making people rich depending on their attitude and not heritage. But it's a good component for such a system.

I don't think it's merely about aspirations.
Currently, states around the world cannot put too much distance between their own position on freedoms and USA's (or the West in general) for economical, political and social reasons. It's as if we are all hanging down from that branch with an elastic cord.

This is the only thing I would be worried about. However, it also incentivizes ordinary people to have plausible deniability at all times.


Bitcoin should allow us to deal with this at the protocol level. We still need private trusted entities to sort out disputes though.
Actually, I don't know why we still don't have a pseudonymous but trusted network of individuals that provide this service. While I think the web of trust scheme isn't successful at vetting individuals, it could work very well for weighted judgments. Maybe this sort of smart dispute resolution could even get integrated with the protocol at some point.

The usual workaround is declaring it as having a lower value (e.g. without appreciation, which also works well for the seller). As long as you believe that you can find a buyer for it in the future which will do the same, that is, or you aren't planning on selling it at all. This is easier to do in countries where a central registry isn't very developed.
Most registries however now send an expert to evaluate the property. I gave land as an example, because of this solution the State came up with. What I'm interested in is, how the State might extend this if people really begin to trade with Bitcoin or similar and only occasionally convert it to fiat.

I wouldn't say inadequate knowledge, but that reasoning is still not very easy to justify.
There have been vehicles that are less inflationary than the economic growth throughout ages. Bitcoin is just one of them. I find that it is similar to land or gold. As people don't keep their whole wealth in these vehicles and refrain from spending money, we already know that the idea doesn't hold in reality. Saving is good, but most people don't do it at the expense of their own standard of living.
However, most Bitcoin owners may be making that simplistic assumption too, and there is no simple way of knowing that. If so, it hinders the growth of Bitcoin economy. Even if that is true though, it will continue to make little sense, and I'm hoping in time people will be more inclined to spend their coins.
I spend coins to buy goods whenever I find something I need, but I tend to spend more when the exchange rate is on the rise and exchange fiat for Bitcoin whenever it's on decline. I think people like me help with volatility, and believe that it also serves my best interest, so it's a win-win.

Bitcoins aren't minted through the exchanges. Bitcoin protocol doesn't know anything about exchanges. Selling bread for bitcoins or selling Euro for bitcoins is the same thing. Developers don't have direct control of minting either.
The transaction processors of Bitcoin we call "miners" earn coins through validating blocks. Part of what they earn comes from transaction fees, but currently the majority is awarded by the network to them "out of thin air". This is how bitcoins are issued; as a reward for processing transactions.
Anyone is free to join in and start mining, and gets rewarded proportional to their computing power. Nowadays though, the increased interest in mining increased the total power so high that you would need a specific mining device to do the processing.
Finally, you could ask whether developers could change the algorithms so that more coins are issued. Briefly, the fact that all prominent Bitcoin node software is open source prevents this sort of abuse.

Well, I'm nowhere near either, but where I live (let's say the Moon for a disclaimer), if I buy some currency and then exchange it back to my local currency, the money I make is not taxable. That is very good for successful long term investors wanting to sell coins, "in theory".
However, since it's kinda vague whether Bitcoin would really count as a currency in the eyes of the tax office, and practically not feasible to prove that you didn't actively trade it online (which then would be taxable), I wouldn't dare do it like that.
However, if you convert Bitcoin directly to an different kind of investment, like a house, then things get easier (or so my adviser says). Of course, the seller would need to pay the capital gains and fees on the converted amount, so no tax advantage there.

Bureaucracy and politics. There are many countries that PayPal can't give service to, being a U.S. entity, access in some countries is limited and there are also limitations by who you are. Massive banking regulations means high fees and sometimes intermittent access (e.g. blocking of account/funds by PayPal for extensive periods). All this is actually dwarfed by the fact that most people of the world don't even have access to bank accounts.
Compared to this, a random guy from Iran, regardless of age/gender/occupation can get a Bitcoin address with a few clicks (or an SMS) and will be able to spend coins sent by me in 10 minutes. I've recently sent a Bitcoin tip to someone in Zimbabwe from this very forum, who didn't even have a Bitcoin wallet at that point. Compare to [this random article I found](


Ah, I was talking about the business side of things (regarding language barrier). You can't have someone work for you without being able to communicate. I think there is huge untapped creativity out there who don't have access to global markets.


There are at least 30-40 exchanges worldwide, some of which allow person to person exchanges, so if you also count people buying/selling without an intermediary for a living, it's in the hundreds. I don't know how it relates to fraud though. You can trade bitcoins like any other currency or commodity. There are a few hedge funds in this space, too.




Because sellers and buyers would flock to these independent traders. In general, the more regulation you apply to exchanges, the higher unregulated traders will ask for commission.
You can observe this in places where people don't have access to Bitcoin exchanges. People pay a very steep markup while buying.
It's remotely similar to how regular foreign exchange rates get worse outside banking hours.


Yes. But I don't think regulation is a silver bullet that solves all these problems. Central banks can at most print more money (i.e. rob everyone) and lend it to "unfortunate" people through "fortunate" intermediaries, or else borrow money from other central banks. I won't go into detail about what eventually happens to countries who don't have the power of intimidation U.S. has.


Yes it is, but Bitcoin's rate increased 500 times since I first got one (no I didn't keep them). A mere 10x increase doesn't look too dramatic to me.

Certainly not ALL currencies escape your demagogy, especially if you include commodity money in the list of currencies, obviously by definition. Gold is very physical. However, "physical dollar" (a phrase you used above to admit a distinguishing feature of other currencies from Bitcoin) certainly is no different than Bitcoin. So, while I accept that some money do fit your criterion, the currencies we use in our daily lives certainly are more similar to Bitcoin in this aspect.

Hold on there. I'm not saying he is unreasonably hostile, let alone crazy. I'm merely saying that he has criticized Bitcoin, and that I don't agree with his points. His criticism of the mining process was wrong, because his understanding of it was very superficial. I'm sure he wouldn't pursue that line if he got it. There is no dishonesty here, but maybe too eager dismissal, which shows bias. This isn't intellectually unacceptable.


He clearly says that Bitcoin doesn't bring anything new to the table as a currency. That, I cannot agree with. The rest is an analogy to goldbug rhetoric, which after discarding Bitcoin's value as a currency, reduces the movement itself to something that it isn't. Maybe you are right about this last point, in that his purpose could be purely going after a social issue.

"Sign message" tools are the right way to do this.


You can sign any text. Just take care so that the meaning of the text is not ambiguous. Signing vague messages could make it possible for someone to pretend to be you!
If you really really want to sign a specific document file or image, just get the hash of the said file (sha256sum should be fine) and sign it, optionally along with some additional text to clarify the purpose.
I often use bitcoin-qt's signing tool. If you are worried about incompatibilities, don't forget to tell the receiver which tool you have used to sign the message.

I wish we could distinguish between investing in and using. Since there is no way to casually exchange fiat to BTC in your neighborhood echange, this is not very clear cut for now. Newbies are almost always immersed in a currency trading atmosphere.
I suspect there are a lot of clueless people who bought coins and keep them on the internet exchanges, with the sole intention of waiting for the moment to cash out. I think excluding them would affect neither the currency, nor those people's savings badly.

Turkey's economy seems to be booming recently, so there should be enough wealth in the middle-class to risk a few percent in Bitcoin as an insurance. Besides, it will allow them to pay for services (including VPN's besides other potentially gray market stuff) without leaving financial trace. It will allow them to trade among themselves without government knowing, which can become necessary. It will allow them to receive money from the outside without anyone knowing.
Not to mention that cash gets worthless pretty quickly in a time of crisis. Turkish government has banned foreign money in the past, and if gold is also banned, trading with it to circumvent the State is a fantasy. You will just get robbed by the police on your way to the market, or worse if the seller is an undercover cop.
By the way, if all goes south, in a city like Istanbul, creating a mesh-net should be relatively painless. I don't know much about the other parts of the country though.
All in all, I don't think Turks in general are looking to invest in something right now. However, awareness of Bitcoin would help tremendously in the long run.

1. Bitcoin is like gold from the storage aspect. Online wallets with insurance would be like insured gold represented by paper. The current user base doesn't have a need for it, since it's what Bitcoin is an alternative for. That being said, online wallets with two factor authentication (e.g. SMS) exist and they are pretty much secure. We will probably have online deposit accounts that are guaranteed to a certain limit soon, and cold storage systems with guarantee. It's a chicken-and-egg problem though, since to me they are both useless, and it's still far from certain whether people like you will really use those services.
2. Discounts make sense. Also, you can use Bitcoin to pay for services of random people on Earth, which you can't do with your credit card.
3. Yep. SirDinosaur's recommendations should work fine though.
4. Use an idiot proof wallet, problem solved. We can't fix this within the community. There are already idiot proof wallets. People need to start using them and they should naturally survive the test. Since idiots are intimidated by the current complexity, we have the chicken-and-egg problem free endeavors (e.g. OSS) usually have.
The way I see it, proper Bitcoin adoption will take years, since humanity doesn't know what will work for humanity. All these problems might not have clever solutions. The user has to pass some threshold to benefit from the system. If the system tries to satisfy the user, which is mentally disciplined by the former system, it will become more like the former system.

Any sort of risky investment requires resilient nerves and a healthy mind. So I would first try to get in that mindset before doing anything drastic.

Sympathy, no. Justice, yes. Just because they were gravely wrong doesn't mean that we shouldn't support their cause.
I hope some of the money gets returned, if only to see how the pass-throughs will behave. Identities of some are already public, so they would be in a very difficult situation. Those who are not public will be known to the SEC if they claim, so they will put themselves in a more difficult position if they attempt to pay back to the investors. Though I guess all will be forgotten by the time the money is returned, if it even does.

As yotta put it, it would even be 2^159 "on average" I guess. My knowledge of ECDSA seems to have rusted, so I can't figure if knowing the public key makes a difference.

Yes, of course, but its purpose is preventing transaction spam.
As such, even if it weren't centrally issued, it would still have to be inflationary, it "should" never be more valuable then its purpose dictates. Just like NMC.

I think Bitcoin owners worldwide should focus on building relationships and working with people in other countries in ways that weren't possible before. By creating equal opportunity, you are helping with income disparity between regions/nations.
The biggest of the remaining problems is the language barrier, though I think technology can fix that, such as services that makes it easier to communicate work in a formalized manner.

As far as I can understand, gains that result from exchanging currency are not taxable for non-domiciled persons here. They should be taxable somewhere else (no one cares really, but you are right in theory), and are certainly taxable here for citizens (which is probably what you have in mind). However, that doesn't cover all sorts of assets. All in all, since my lawyer says I don't need to pay it, I don't think I need to pay it; unless you are talking about an ethical obligation.
As for the practicalities of taxing citizens regardless of where they are, you must understand that not many countries can ever have that reach. USA can do it, not because of some technical competence, but purely because it can bully any institution into singing agreements with it.
I think suggesting it should be adopted as the international model is just funny. It would be interesting to see what states would resort to to get the best share of the plunder. Since tax havens wouldn't be possible, there would be an incentive to tax foreign investment at the rate of the originating jurisdiction. So the amount of tax, say USA, would get from its citizens and investments in foreign lands would depend on how much political power it has over the region (same as now I suppose). Of course, no other nation would be able get any tax out of their citizens living in USA. This should also explain why there is no incentive to implement this for the majority to begin with.
If you are really into this tax thing and want fairness, you could divide the tax income equally among humanity. Also, make it easier to switch citizenship, so that advocating against jurisdiction hopping doesn't sound hypocritical. I don't want to sound bitter here, just a few thoughts I had.

I think I did when I said the targeted group is already annoyed with the finance industry. Believe it or not, this *is* finance industry.
The goal is providing the customers with a full reserve depositing service and flexible remittance mechanism without them having to think about or learn the details of underlying mechanisms.
This service will accept the deposits in EUR, and peg the deposit to EUR, even though it will be kept as BTC internally. All this is to avoid scaring people with new concepts. Where do you think Litecoin fits in this picture?
In other words, if it wasn't contrary to the goal, this institution would not need to exist in the first place. Just tell people to install a Bitcoin wallet, and done.

This happened in the Namecoin network years ago, and it almost killed the network. Finally, merged mining was implemented, which removed the problem altogether. The implications of the same happening for Bitcoin was thoroughly discussed, which you can find in the bitcointalk forums and I suppose relevant IRC archives.
I don't think you are wrong, but given that the possibility of numbers being in the extreme is low, I don't think any change will be made to the protocol based on this speculation. It would have been good to have it, but implementing it now introduces a new risk. Don't fix if not broken and all that. Submitting a patch and testing it on a testnet would go a long way I suppose. I don't know if anyone already did it for the Bitcoin network, but such changes are widely available for alts.
At the time Namecoin was failing, what I thought was that the distributed notary will have various uses other than only supporting the currency. Actually, we only need one stream of work, and with merged mining and protocols implemented on top of Bitcoin, the dedicated hashpower will have many other benefits, which will prevent rapid declines. For instance, even if Bitcoin mining became unprofitable, people would continue to produce work for the Bitcoin network to get Namecoin, and vice versa. This sounds less promising recently though.

I think completely incompatible new approaches are worthy of autonomy, regardless of merit. The different approaches can be the foci, and all resources can be pooled towards the advancement of one or many of these. I don't know what the idea of "a secondary currency" should mean. We don't need a secondary currency, if it's purely for the reason of having a secondary currency.
We need good currencies, one or many. Granted, that means competition. But that doesn't have to mean different currencies. If we are to have a good crypto-currency, we can have competing features, competing developers, in the form of testing networks, which I think alt-coins serve as. We also have competing currencies (that aren't necessarily crypto-currencies) or features that can never be merged into Bitcoin. I think we should pursue these as well.

There are two points in your post I want to focus on.


It might not be that easy. Since Bitcoin isn't a legal entity, banning it specifically would require a definition of its nature. What are you going to ban? The resulting generalization would cover a very large area, probably every token of exchange. It's hard to make people accept it, and even harder to enforce. However, if they dare to go ahead with it anyway;


The nature of "shady things" might change in the future. Many things that are illegal now weren't just a century ago. Bitcoin isn't illegal now, and let's assume it will be. It's not the only thing that threatens institutions with power. If the current trend continues, the "shady" kind of trade might come to include a lot of things we are doing now.
All in all, I don't think they will directly confront Bitcoin with specific legislation. It's more likely that they will play it dirty.

First off, "accumulated incoming BTC's" doesn't represent holding of that amount. Whoever reads it like that is perfectly clueless of the techniques used in that paper. This makes most of the claims in your post factually wrong. However, I will respond to your concerns.


Taking the risk to give someone a potential upper hand in exchange for an estimated long term benefit is enslavement now?
Bitcoin is a system, it's not "the system". It's a currency. For instance, even if it were the world's only currency, being the person who owns most coins wouldn't mean that you are the richest man on Earth. Actually, there is no reason to think that Bitcoin would have any effect on wealth distribution.


If there really are massive hoarders, they benefit from it only by reducing their pile of coins. The distribution can only get more homogeneous in time.

I think your point (1) is an argument from lack of imagination. Of course, if the State you submit to, or all States magically disappeared, the world would turn into a hellhole.
But why is assigning such a condition to the absence of government necessary? You could imagine a world where all fathers disappeared. You could also imagine a world where fathers didn't exist in the first place; in which case all norms that come with that condition would have to be assumed. Arguments based on normativity may not be as easy as you think.
About your second point: why do you think it is the case? I have never seen such an argument from the government side. The obstacles have mostly been about money laundering, which has nothing to do with the economy.
Also, I don't think OP's audience is mom and pop.
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:01:14


I hear this uttered very frequently, and don't know what to make of it. It's obvious that there aren't better alternatives, all the world is occupied by States that are different in name but similar in nature. And it's also obvious that they aren't waiting for you with open arms. The arguer knows both these facts. While you are constrained by the will of others, it's not assumed "being forced" in the conventional sense. But does it really matter?
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:42:22


I don't understand your argument. We are assuming the users decided to switch to the new algorithm, so they will be the ones who accept it. As I said, hashrate is not relevant, user consensus is. By users I mean merchants, exchanges, consumers, etc.


Hard forks are not hashrate dependent.


That, I agree with (though I don't think what Satoshi says would matter). The hash function won't change unless there is a serious flaw within itself, or we abandon PoW altogether.

It's not difficult at all (assuming MtGox is online, which is currently not the case). Just get an address from your Electrum wallet and enter that address in your Bitcoin withdrawal screen on MtGox. 
If you are doing it the first time, you can test it by transferring a very small amount of BTC. You should instantly see it in your Electrum client. Make larger transfers when you are confident in your knowledge about how the system works.

That wasn't the analogy. What is your claim then, "historical evidence can only be used to prove claims about career choices"? Your proof methods only apply when they are convenient for you?


There are plenty of women who sit around being beautiful for a living and live comfortable lives. If what you say is the entire reason, they are even lower than prostitutes. Am I right?
Ah, sorry, "it's not a career choice". My bad.


This conclusively proves that you know nothing about the subject.
Besides, it really is a circular argument:
10 *Normal* people don't do it because it's shameful.
20 Therefore people who do it have little competition and don't have to have any sort of skills or qualifications.
30 Therefore it's shameful.
40 GOTO 10
Anyway though, you think being a prostitute is so despicable that your mind created a picture where it brings people who dare to do it incredible advantages (Maybe your own repressed urges are responsible?).
In reality, it is a dog eat dog business where skill, connections and a loyal client base is important, depending on services provided and where. Just like any other service really.
Maybe if you are in a highly regulated area with an abundant source of sexually deprived men, then I suppose you may be right. Then again, that brings about other aspects of the business that makes it hard to conduct, which still require skills.
And, as unfortunate as it is, beauty is a qualification in any type of career.


Read the last sentence of my previous comment.
I understand that you think that thinking like others makes you right. In reality, it doesn't justify anything. I don't think you are necessarily a weak person, but obviously you've never given yourself a chance to prove otherwise.
I'm not saying this because you don't agree with me, but because you think you don't have a need for an honest defense for things you believe in.

It increases resilience, since newer versions are less tested/audited. For instance, if 0.8 had a major bug and all the network switched to it as soon as it was announced, we would be screwed. This argument is invalidated as soon as a known bug is discovered in the older version though.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:19:59
Do you think Bitcoin is too secure right now, or are you talking about the danger of it becoming so?
If the idea is securing it against deep entities within nation states, IMHO we are slowly approaching a satisfactory level of processing power. If not, we are going nuts. Or else, if we want to be protected against a transparent attack by nation states, it probably will never be possible.
It really isn't easy to guess. I guess Satoshi could have picked a steeper distribution curve, which would result in fees replacing block reward sooner. Then again, we might not have had enough ASIC's deployed and could be vulnerable.
**tl;dr** If *that* is his point, I don't think it's as obvious as he makes it seem.
@_date: 2013-06-05 12:35:15
(1) Can happen, but not very likely.
Competition is good, but I think Bitcoin, even including the network and the currency, resembles an open source project more than a company product or stock.
Technical features of Bitcoin (e.g. confirmation times, proof of work, etc.) can be changed relatively easy when there is available technology and consensus. Such proven, successful features of alternative crypto-currencies can be absorbed by Bitcoin.
Socio-economical features are probably here to stay, so there may be some serious competition on that front.
I think, rather than many alternatives competing for the same thing, the scene will evolve to produce many complementing systems, which may be currencies with different economical features, or payment systems that work in parallel with or on top of Bitcoin.
(2) If I knew, I'd be implementing it. Matter transmission maybe?
(3) The reason is, Bitcoin is an open protocol which doesn't require centralized development, and there is all incentives in place for its investors (be it time or money or pure risk) to cooperate and make it better.
Some people say Bitcoin is like TCP/IP. While it's not the best analogy in the world, it has some merit when taken as an argument. We need just a good enough platform to build on, and Bitcoin provides that.
@_date: 2013-09-11 08:36:44
I think they are mutually exclusive. Either it is instant over an exchange, or it's slow if you make the transfer over the network. I'd take most/all my transfers "slow", but "fast" exchanges would be necessary to establish a price.

You can't prevent insider trading, you can only make it less accessible for people with fewer connections. Bitcoin by itself doesn't change much, though by allowing less regulated companies to flourish, it lowers the barrier considerably. While this is a bad thing if you don't like insider trading, I don't think the situation is too different from the regulated markets.
However, why focus on this, instead of changing the paradigm?
We can instead concentrate on making markets and companies more transparent, which, as a side effect, would reduce the efficacy of insider trading. Hell, we should probably challenge the conventional concept of a company, create entities that are completely managed transparently by stakeholders. On top of this, we could build systems that can pay contributors in dividends, creating "open source" companies which can distribute donations to right people. Possibilities are endless.
Bitcoin removed the necessity of an authority in financial transactions, but this is just a beginning. Instead of trying to bring in the old methods that have resulted in the corrupt system we have now to the Bitcoin movement, we should come up with new systems that are resistant to corruption. It is perfectly attainable.

Both sides are too eager to make a bold conclusion. We don't know whether these brands are just waiting for more clarification or decided to completely distance themselves from Bitcoin. We don't know whether it will have any chance of adoption by more informal businesses, or direct exports where RMB is not used anyway. We don't know if there is a place for it in China as a financial instrument (store of value, speculation, mining, etc.). Things might turn out very bad eventually, but I suspect that even the policy makers themselves are planning to wait and see for the time being.

No, you're mostly right. If none of the addresses involved are public (such the "static" donation addresses some organizations use), it is not easy to tell, and sometimes practically impossible. You can also make theoretically untraceable transactions using Bitcoin, but it currently isn't part of the protocol, so it requires some effort on the users' side.

If that were the meaning of the term, money laundering with cash would be meaningless because it can't remain dirty more than a few moments after transaction anyway.
Tracking everyone's transactions because some people might steal some money is identical to placing cameras in anywhere and everywhere possible to maybe increase the possibility of catching purse snatchers sometimes.
May I remind you that none of the AML laws were pushed because of problems with stolen money or anything remotely similar. They were pushed because of "national security" reasons. Now that people got used to these restrictions, they will continue to be enforced, and defended by whatever rhetoric necessary (e.g. "think of the children").
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:58:13
As for your first two paragraphs, I agree. I don't crave for Bitcoin becoming a reserve currency or claim it will ever be. But that is the topic.
I don't think your scenario of nations adopting en masse is what I had in mind. If ever, Bitcoin would crawl slowly into all markets, and if/once it proves that this "substitutability" is not a real concern, it can actually assume a dominant position.

Encapsulating your wallet under a second layer of encryption is a good idea for backups. You could use asymmetric encryption to automate the process.
Imagine you discover a keylogger on your computer, accidentally type your wallet passphrase on a chat screen or realize that you have used the same password on a web site. Whatever the reason, you will change your wallet password. However, this will not change the passwords on your many backups, so actually what you'll have to do is move all the money to an address that wasn't stored in your backup wallets.
If you make sure your backups are encrypted with a second password (e.g. with GPG), it will make you sleep easier. On the other hand, it's an additional password to remember, so there is that increased risk.

Think of it as a binary number with 256 digits instead of a string of letters. Even better, think of it as something like this:  . You just want to get a number lower than the target number. "n leading zeroes" is a way of saying the same, but only in binary.

I think what you are describing is still why it will be regulated, not why it needs to be. By itself, Bitcoin is merely a public database of integer numbers and nothing more. You don't naturally need anyone else's permission to submit changes in a public database of integers. Nor you need permission to ascribe meanings to series of integers. No law dictates that. If left alone, there is nothing saying that people can't trade over such a system. There are countless organizations that accept Bitcoin donations right now. I don't see why the numbers would not grow if it is just left alone.
So, I still don't understand where the "should" is coming from.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:47:22

Most of the cases are better understood when you give up the usual expectations, which you'd have for commercially developed technologies. Bitcoin did not exist 4 years ago, was born in an alien space and is completely free and independent. I think it very much resembles Linux, and till now it had a better adoption curve.


The choice of setting 1 "bitcoin" as 10^8 units was completely arbitrary, so that is a completely psychological effect. At any rate, I'd wish the XBT standard could have been set at microbits to cancel it.


Going from zero, it's gaining acceptance at a very good rate. It's not a commercial or legal thing, so the adoption pattern would be very different.


The idea is to be able to use Bitcoin mostly directly. Until we get there, it will involve some effort and some risk for the users. That's why early adopters are important. No silver bullets there.


True. It's extremely more liquid than a year ago, and there wasn't even a market just a few years ago, so the trend is to the better.


I think this will come later than merchant adoption and liquidity. Some people earn in Bitcoin right now (e.g. me), but it has to do with wanting to earn in Bitcoin rather than having more jobs available that pays in Bitcoin. Merchants that can save profits as Bitcoin (even though they may use a payment processor like BitPay) might give an option to their employees. I know a lot of people who would love to get at least 5% of their salaries in Bitcoin. Everything needs a start.


At this phase, you could want to preserve some of your wealth as Bitcoin, and there is nothing wrong with spending it in the meantime. If you are buying for the sole reason of spending immediately, it seems a bit redundant.


Maybe yes, maybe no. Price usually overshoots.


It's pseudonymous. The idea is to put the control in your hands. After that, it's up to you to achieve reasonable anonymity, which you can.


Depends on what you compare it with. Bitcoin transactions are more like SWIFT transactions in nature, and those aren't nearly instant nor easy. Third party services are expected to offer better usability for non-tech people in the short term.


Dollars don't have consumer protection either. As users demand these, more companies will provide the service. However, currently there is a lack of escrow usage and proper arbitrage throughout the community.


Goods/services trading activity would be lower than other financial activities, but I imagine that is also the case for other currencies.


I don't think it is even comparable to legacy banking.

Here, SEPA transfers still take a few days. Maybe, if you have what you are looking for locally (e.g. Bitcoin exchange), it would be convenient. It's not so future tech though, you already have the same rules for all financial institutions, so implementing instant transfers between local banks should be very straightforward.
@_date: 2013-01-15 13:52:20


Technically, this is untrue. The reward is halved roughly every four years (at once, not gradually). Difficulty is not affected directly, but indirectly through the behavior of miners. Once the reward is halved, everything remaining the same, you could expect half the miners to leave and difficulty to reduce. However, it doesn't work that way in practice because of friction and feedback.
Actually, you don't have to think about reward halving for at least 3 years now, so you should focus on how the total hashrate will evolve with the introduction of ASICs.
@_date: 2013-08-28 01:32:11


Not all updates need to be backed by hashing power. And the pools are in turn powered by individuals anyway, so it all boils down to whether the majority of Bitcoin users support the update or not. Miners, Bitcoin node operators, exchanges, merchants and ultimately all users have a stake in this, so it's impossible for the foundation to be sneaky about the protocol.
They could, in theory, influence the user base in order to make it more likely for them to accept an innocent looking update, but that's always the case where there is a core development team. I think we are at a point where we would almost instantly have a completely new de-facto leading team if we lose trust to the current one, so I don't worry.
So, they mainly affect the regulations by interfacing with agencies.

Assuming there will have to be some sort of weak user consensus at least a year before this happens (because it's completely insane to do it otherwise), the switch should be relatively painless.

There are other ways to remain invulnerable to QC attacks, like not using the same address twice (i.e. only the hash of the public key - not itself - is exposed until you use the transaction as input). Automating that would be moderately easy.
Also, SHA1 is almost 20 years old, and still doesn't look *that* bad. :)
However though, I don't like that sort of "infographic"s more than you do, because they could be very misleading to the very same people they are written for.

We'd want miners and especially ASIC manufacturers on board, because we don't want to be vulnerable to malicious entities who can develop ASIC's before we do. They don't have more of a say on the matter than the ordinary user however.
Besides, in a year or so, current ASIC hardware will begin to be considered obsolete. You can announce the change a couple of years in advance, which will give plenty of time to test/switch. We could also use multiple algorithms (and difficulties) in parallel to help with such transitions.
I don't advocate a change in algorithm, as I don't see anything wrong with it, but there will never be a mass migration to a different crypto-currency purely because of the hashing algorithm.

For an extremely light client, use Electrum. Check out Multibit if you want to connect peer-to-peer, but with a light protocol. Blockchain.info is useful if you want to use the same wallet both on a PC and devices that don't support Java or Python.
I find that using same wallet on multiple devices isn't as necessary as I had imagined when I first started using Bitcoin. When I'm going on a long trip, I load up a mobile wallet (or blockchain.info if my mobile doesn't support Android Wallet). Otherwise, Electrum is good enough for all sorts of use cases.

One could think that cash is much better than Bitcoin in the case of prostitution. You meet face to face anyway, and cash is pretty much untraceable.
However, I think Bitcoin makes the whole thing more convenient, maybe together with anonymous e-mail (and one may even imagine Bitmessage).
For instance, Italian escorts usually identify and authenticate clients using cell phone, which practically destroys anonymity and defeats the purpose of using cash. They can't just take an advance deposit from clients instead (which is much more effective) for obvious reasons. With Bitcoin, respectable escorts and escorts services (where it's legal) could ask for collateral in advance, and identify clients through Bitcoin (though I think message signing is too advanced for this stuff, they would likely use the knowledge of payment addresses instead, which should be enough).
**tl;dr** Remote pseudonymous payments can be a big deal for independent sex workers.

Keep in mind that n double spends directed at the same vulnerability may be as easy as 1, so individual values of transactions may not be as important as the total volume depending on the nature of your service. mybitcoin.com was supposedly robbed using a 1-confirmation exploit. If you don't have any control over the volume of requests and don't have a complete grasp of the transaction mechanism, I would suggest at least 2 confirmations. You could do with more, or less, but it depends on what you are doing.

You can invest in the future of this currency. You can buy some, earn some, invest your time and mind on how it works, how it can be made better, etc. This is the sort of investing that you can do.
I don't understand why people, especially those who already know about it, are suddenly more interested when the exchange rate is skyrocketing. The fact that more people are investing in it doesn't change the nature of this stuff. If it wasn't worth your money then, why is it now? It feels like herd mentality.
The same sort of effect on the way down as well.

Yes, I agree that the argument applies to gold. In fact, that's one of the reasons that makes Bitcoin better as a currency.
Bitcoin is 100% digital issued. The so called "miners" issue the currency to themselves. They get the right to issue by generating blocks, and generating blocks is a necessity regardless of issuing.
Why does the difficulty change:
We want blocks to be generated roughly every 10 minutes. Satoshi came up with this requirement to keep the network stable. When the computing power donated to the network increases, blocks are generated more rapidly. Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty of generating a block is adjusted so that the current computing power generates one every 10 minutes.
**The difficulty doesn't always increase.** It has substantially decreased at times: 
Basically what drives computing power is the exchange rate and technological advances. This in turn drives the difficulty.


Yes and probably not. The coins "minted" will halve roughly every four years and approaches to 0. However, the minted portion will become slowly irrelevant as most of the mining income will be from transaction fees. Fees will eventually replace the mint as the biggest incentive to generate blocks. That's when the word "mining" becomes even less appropriate than it is now.
EDIT: wording

Well, it's at least a better solution than a full-fledged payment processor like VISA, because it doesn't require an expense on neither side.

You need to at least describe the system roughly if you are asking for useful criticism.
I think Bitcoin itself, with URI's and QR codes allow micropayments globally already. Obviously we need to figure out a way to do that without polluting the block chain too much, so there is a lot of room to grow. Whether it can be done through the Bitcoin or some other distributed protocol (e.g. Ripple) remains to be seen, so a centralized solution can still be useful in the meantime.

It knows when you decrypt it. :) That's also true for Ripple.
The difference is, you decrypt it in order to access your public key, so it knows your password for the whole session. Besides, AFAIK it automatically downloads your wallet from the cloud, so it better be encrypted. Maybe different clients could use different strategies in the future.

The purpose of WoT is exactly to counter that possibility, be it centralized or not. You are a node on the web, and view the world from your own perspective. The idea is, you assign more weight to opinions of people or entities you trust, then in turn they give weight on opinions of entities they trust and so on. This sort of system is very good at eliminating bad seeds. You will likely boot it by trusting some knowledgeable entity, which gives you the exact result of a centralized WoT. You can then fine tune however you like.

Yes, they likely stole your files. If your wallet passwords were weak they might not have needed a keylogger at all.
By the way, did you have any remote backups? They might have stolen those long ago and could just have found the passphrase.


If your laptop has had any connection to the Internet, I would label it as an "online" computer. My offline wallets stay on a computer that doesn't have any means to get online.


Rather than formatting everything and changing your OS (which you might want to do anyway), I suggest you really switch to an offline wallet.
If you don't have a second computer which you can boot with a clean live OS, you could use your main computer to sign offline transactions (edit: obviously after booting with a live CD) when your online (or "hot") wallet gets empty. Here's a tutorial on how to do it with Electrum wallet:
([Offline PC] means a computer that will have no Internet connection "from now on", since an infected offline PC can record the data and send it whenever it gets online. Easiest is to boot with a live Linux CD and shut it down when done.)
You probably would still want to keep some money in a wallet you can access instantly, so the offline method is for the bulk of your coins. Based on what I have read in this thread, you might want to consider using an Android wallet for this.

Refunds are a problem. It would be easier for them to accept Bitcoin but store it as fiat by instant conversion, but nobody really needs that.

That would mean a lot of functional changes to how PayPal works.

I don't know how he is still of the same mind after so many people commented on this specific mistake. The proof-of-work regime is not there for people to mint coins. Minting by mining is just a clever way to distribute initial coins. The coins could have been distributed in a completely different manner, but the processing power requirement would still be there. It would be less incentivized, and the network would be less secure.
It is unbecoming for a professor to ignore criticism of his own ideas, even if he made a mistake initially.

What I mean is something like  or bitcoin.de, or the late bitmarket.eu. In the latter cases, the exchange itself operates as an escrow, the transfers are made through individuals' bank accounts. The escrow only holds BTC for the interval of the exchange. In theory, the coins can always be stored off-site (though bitcoin.de has a hot wallet), and the database can have multiple synced copies to continue operation in case of intervention.
Another alternative is Ripple, where you can implement multiple different approaches, but the safest would still be the ones where people send fiat directly between proper bank accounts.

Completely circumstantial. If we had the ability to beam precious metals from anywhere to anywhere instantly, we would have a currency with value without enforcement. There is no natural mechanism to back up your claim; you are just preaching me the status quo.


Where there is law, stealing dollars or milk shakes don't make any difference. Law enforcement will get involved if your Bitcoins get stolen. It may be harder to catch the criminal, but it really has nothing to do with "because it's not government money". Ask Trendon.
Now, Bitcoin has come a long way, despite all you describe, hasn't it? It is because most resourceful people has a sense of dignity. I'm pretty sure you don't agree with that sort of outlook, and would prefer top-down enforced consequences for immoral behavior that others have already decided for you. When confronted by a space (be it drugs, free commerce, pure currencies, whatever) where such constraints aren't enforceable, such people either immediately reject the viability of any sort of structure within that space, or see it as a place where they can act completely immorally.

I don't get what you are trying to say here. Paypal is a third party service as well. Paypal could very well accept Bitcoin in the future, which would make your argument even weirder.


If that's not the argument being made, then the one making the argument is being silly. There is also a chance that your perception of the argument is wrong. If someone is trying to convince merchants to accept Bitcoin, they can use "no chargebacks" as a positive feature. I don't think that equates to what you are saying.
Either way, Bitcoin is better, because it allows both.


Sorry, but your perspective is skewed. Bitcoin is not an alternative to credit cards or PayPal. When I send money to someone, I want the ability to assure the recepient that I won't reverse the transaction. **I need this ability as the sender.**


And chargebacks are a feature of USD?
Look, you have obviously debated with some idiot who made silly claims. Things aren't as complicated as you think. Bitcoin, like USD, is a currency. It's also a payment network, which imitates direct commodity exchange but non-local. On top of this, you can implement as many buyer protection layers as you like.
Think about this: If you want both direct transactions, and the ability of chargebacks, the lowest level network need to be built with direct and final transactions. You can't implement it the other way round.

It is most definitely not banned for trade purposes. However, the main concern is exchanges, since most businesses, at least for the foreseeable future, need to be able to instantly convert the major part of their income to fiat in order to pay their costs. Without this, the growth of the Bitcoin economy will slow down immensely, which could be bad, at least in the short run.

Don't you agree that it is exactly because of how some societies perceive prostitution and push it to the underground? Pretty much like drugs.


What does it have to do with anything? Ah, yes, I guess those are below your level as well. :) Good point.
I'm half joking of course, but the topic we are discussing is prostitution as a career choice. Slavery is one of the ugliest realities of humanity, but they are victims. It's the opposite of being shameful.


Sort of yes, if you removed the fictional part where my daughter the prostitute were working together with sex slaves that get handcuffed and beaten by pimps. All that interaction would result in would be a lot of people going to jail.
There seems to be regular "I'm a prostitute" AMA's by people who are doing this job legally. It's easy to ask them what would happen if they encountered such conditions.

There is a criticism about Bitcoin, that it is a poor choice of currency because it's dependent on computers and the Internet. These events show that Bitcoin isn't worse on that front. People get carried away when critics are wrong. This is a Bitcoin forum after all...


It's not a poor argument at all. Bitcoin is a currency which you can directly transfer anywhere. There is no mechanism that stops you from implementing buyer protection on top of it. In fact, there are many entrepreneurs working on that (EDIT: check out bitmit.net), their main problems being regulation. Bitcoin is better, because you have the option to transact directly without the fear of chargebacks, which is essential for many scenarios.

Not sure here either. Do those miners convert to USD to realize their profits, or to "strictly" buy local grocery food and pay taxes immediately? I suspect not.
If all your income is through mining though, and you have nothing to spare, then I agree with you. Otherwise I'm sure you would prefer to spend your coins on services rather than converting to fiat, **if those services were available for Bitcoin**.

My humble observation says, no it isn't. I've been hearing such criticisms for the last decade, mainly in discussions involving geeky programmers wondering why women aren't more into their field. People's attitudes have changed. So much so that gender related jokes, no matter how innocent, are nonexistent now. Even that sort of unreasonable political correctness didn't change the demographics however.
Real interest is between the person and the subject matter. Maybe it's just me but I find the thought of women being unable to handle mild jokes about flowers and glitter, by itself stereotypical anyway.


I'm afraid there is no generic solution to that within the scope of Bitcoin.  Some people will just not join the early movement. I don't see how a change in attitude could help, or what a social bridge or "dialogue" would look like. As developers try to reduce technological barriers, I'm sure entrepreneurs will target specific audiences, which is the only way I can see it working.

If for savings only, a technical solution could be found. Off the top of my head, the savings type accounts can be kept in 2-of-3 multisig addresses, where the client and an independent foreign arbiter holds keys in addition to the bank. The foreign arbiter (e.g. a law firm) can approve a transfer in cases where the client has lost the key or the bank proves that they are deceased, etc.
The client's key can be user friendly, like an 8-12 character string. It would be used in addition to all the already existing security and its sole purpose is to act as a measure against direct access to the bank's internal accounts. If the bank fails completely, the client can go to the arbiter and ask for their key and access their savings accounts that way.

Bitcoin is neutral, as you say. I'd call it drastically neutral. It is designed to be against tempering, so it by itself is against those who want to control currency. Think about it this way... If all the internals of Bitcoin that have been developed for a purpose (e.g. pseudonymity) worked perfectly, it would inevitably drive out other currencies.
Nothing is perfect, but it should be obvious that Bitcoin shares the same space with fiat, and it is purposefully designed to compete against the thing that makes fiat.

Brainwallets are generic things, they are not tied to any specific service. They can be used without any third party service. Actually, that's part of the idea.
PSA: Even if you are using a long phrase to create a brain wallet, if the phrase is not generated by some random process (this usually isn't the case, even if you think you come up with it yourself), insert some sort of personal information to make it unique. It's not a bad idea to actually memorize a fully random phrase or a combination of symbols and append it to every brain wallet you generate.
Though, instead of single key brainwallets, I personally prefer Electrum wallets. It's not *that* hard to memorize 12 random words, and you get an infinite number of addresses you can generate without even revealing the secret phrase.

We clearly have a problem with communication. I mentioned AML in a completely different context.
Let me rephrase. If AML regulations are not completely misguided, and assuming that my perception is correct (i.e. they can't help with specific attacks, but only work against designated foreign political groups), how does Bitcoin currently help with this situation practically? For instance, has it replaced Hawala somehow? To what extent?


You said it's an untraceable way to exchange money. But terrorist groups already have trust networks, so it's mostly irrelevant. Or isn't it? I wouldn't be asking these questions if you could share your insight into how it is currently being used.

You are misusing the word centralized authority here, or at least it's not clear.
By centralized authority, we usually mean something that has some power to enforce.
For instance, if some very respectable scientist goes on TV and tells you that you shouldn't eat white sugar, and most people think it makes sense and do it, that's not centralized authority.
If the same scientist advises the government to put taxes on sugar or some rules on food labeling, and it happens, that *is* centralized authority.
Bitcoin's situation is the former one. No one really decided on the network's behalf to switch to 0.7. A bunch of developers, some of which might not even know others' faces, decided as a group that it would be best to ask miners to switch to 0.7. Miners also decided that it makes a whole lot of sense and downgraded. If they didn't think it was a good idea, they wouldn't.

People are more practical than you think. All it would take for me to get Bitcoin accepted in a barter in Syria would be a random friend of a friend of the trader who knows about someone who trades in Bitcoin in a different city. I'm sure I'd have to pay serious markup though, and would have to use some SMS service if there is no Internet.
When push comes to shove, things with inherent value would work best. Unlike what you believe, that is food, clothes, water, etc. Gold is something that would work when you are stranded somewhere with a functional society (e.g. Syria). You'd do fine with cash in popular currencies. I imagine Bitcoin would be on par with unknown currencies (e.g. East Caribbean dollar).
Anyway though. So you will be automatically convinced if Bitcoin becomes well known as a currency? That's what the community is working for, so I don't think there is a conflict here.
We want a currency with some attributes. There is none, so it will have to be created from scratch. Bitcoin appears to have those attributes, but of course it is not known, because it didn't exist till now. Some people will need to pioneer. All this is obvious.
Not accepting Bitcoin is completely fine by the way. I just don't understand spending your to be actively against it if your only concern is its reputation. It appears tautological.

All companies need to begin tracking their own shares until a distributed trading mechanism is available. This was what I expected to happen after the GLBSE affair, but I guess central services are just too convenient.
Still, it isn't too hard to get some central escrow into the equation and allow real time trade while keeping the live database yourself. This (and some parties that offer auditing an vetting) would be similar in function to the current exchanges, with the additional benefit of avoiding any damage caused by closing exchanges, as switching escrows would be almost seamless.

I've spent more than ten thousand coins in total since I've started using Bitcoin on things, some of which are worth almost a hundred times less now, and I'm left with very little compared to the total number I coins I've purchased/mined/earned. I would never regret spending them, because it doesn't make any sense. I could have easily replaced them. I do regret that I didn't earn more though.
I particularly dislike the "Bitcoin is savings, fiat is checking" analogy. Bitcoin is easier to spend actually; if you need a checking account, you can convert some of the fiat in your current reserves and still spend it as Bitcoin, it doesn't make much difference, especially if the exchange rate is rising (i.e. X USD -&gt; Y BTC -&gt; Y+t BTC -&gt; more stuff). If the price is rising, the real regret would be keeping the fiat, and for what? To not be tempted not to buy? I think it's a psychological fallacy.
If I'm looking for something I need to buy, I would first check if I can buy it with bitcoins. Also, please consider that if early adopters had decided not to spend, Bitcoin would not be where it is right now.

I know of no mobile Bitcoin client that acts as a full node. There are SPV clients, which only store data that is relevant to your wallet, and thin clients which don't actually need to store anything other than your wallet. Either way, they consume very little space. SPV clients may require some bandwidth, but way lower than a full node, thanks to the filtering technique implemented in Bitcoin. I would go with a thin client for non-mission-critical non-paranoid use.

If you can do without it, don't deliver valuables without seeing a confirmation. You can accept the order right away, but check if it's confirmed before delivering the good/service.
It is very different for face to face transactions. For instance, you can't be shopping in many different stores as many different people simultaneously all day long. You risk confrontation if detected. You potentially need an accomplice. You may be recognized if you are local. There could even be a criminal investigation if your face gets recorded.
Most purchases involving considerable amounts requires you to give some ID, wait for loading, etc. anyway. There are exceptions like a jeweler's store though.
Regarding SatoshiDice, I don't think Finney attack is very practical. People seem to be using chains of unconfirmed transactions, or double spending losses with a higher fee. Even if these could be countered, it will continue to be a huge risk.
One setup where accepting 0-confirmation transactions makes sense is where you have control of the service you are providing for long enough, and automatically cancel fraudulent purchases after the transaction.

I was under the impression that what's being proposed is storing wealth as Bitcoin in the first place. You can then spend it as you like. For instance CHF-&gt;BTC-&gt;Gold would work perfectly.
Bitcoin's exchange value is too volatile, and the exchange market is too centralized for the moment for this to work for everyone, but at least we are going in the right direction. For the time being, Bitcoin can be a part of a bigger portfolio.


You will still have to declare if their value increased slightly, won't you?
Moving large amounts of money between countries is not an everyday problem, but it gets really depressing when you face it personally. There is a perceived risk when you declare the amounts, as you are considered guilty until proven innocent. In such circumstances, I don't really care how baseless my concerns are (no one can know anyway); being at the mercy of random bureaucrats is a good enough blow to my personal dignity.

In theory, you can generate an offline transaction and give it to them somehow, so that they can broadcast it to the network. I don't think there is a streamlined solution to that at this point.

* If you try to ban Bitcoin in the West, and it permeates global markets anyway (Russia and China are already in the wagon and potentially will be leading soon), you'll be effectively screwing yourself. Western countries, especially USA, became what it is by specifically **not** behaving that way.
* I have sent coins to someone I don't know who lives in Zimbabwe through this forum, and it took me 2 seconds.
* The only point of Bitcoin, and why it is called a "techno tour de force" is that you can't (neither the creators, nor its current developers) change the rules without overwhelming consensus. There isn't a lot of easy to comprehend articles about the system around, but it's not hard to grasp the concept if you have time. (I see that someone already recommended the Khan Academy.)
* The cap can't increase, but if push comes to shove, the divisibility can be increased by a minor protocol tweak. Such "hard fork"s are possible if enough users agree with them, so obviously beneficial changes like this are easily accepted, while a cap change would never be. Again, no one can make a change that isn't in the users' best interest.
* No record in the financial system has physical presence. 500 years ago, you could lose all records due to fire. Your bank has more redundancy than that, so that you don't have to worry about losing your bank balance due to a single failure. Bitcoin has unprecedented redundancy, as a single one of the tens of thousands of nodes globally would be enough to recover the network fully. Trust in these records is almost never an issue, because of how authenticity is established (i.e. via proof of work).

I wonder what the problem is with your combination. It should be possible to fix, though I haven't used Armory enough to make a guess.
I've only used Arch Linux with raspberry, and both bfgminer and Electrum pretty much worked out of the box. Electrum uses python2, so any Linux distro with python2 should do (arch may be challenging if you aren't used to the command line). If you want to use a GUI, you'll also need xorg and qt, which most distros would already have.
Also, it should be possible to use a card with write protection, but you might have to mangle with fstab, so it's up to you as a further improvement.

Nonsense. If it comes down to ASIC miners not wanting to switch, users will do regardless. Miners can continue hashing away on the legacy network nobody uses.
There can only be a problem if considerable number of users don't want to switch. I doubt that the reason of conflict would be mining profit.

ASIC miners will have new hardware available by the time the switch happens.

Simple: Spend cash on Bitcoin, then spend Bitcoin on goods. If we are to assume that Bitcoin rises in value all the time, you can convert cash into Bitcoin whenever you get it, and when the time to spend comes, pay less for goods than you would pay if you had kept your wealth as cash.
However, this doesn't work in reality, because there is nothing that says that Bitcoin's value will always increase. Either this is true, and the "why spend" argument is crap, or the above paragraph is true and it's crap.
@_date: 2013-06-05 06:05:06
Well, FWIW, I tend to spend more when Bitcoin's exchange rate increases. And the general Bitcoin economy seems to support this fact. Also, I am spending more in general, more than I was doing before Bitcoin, simply because I'm more wealthy now.
One counter-argument to this could be that, because there is no guarantee that the exchange rate will continue to rise, it makes spending a safer choice. Then again, I question whether there will ever be any guarantees.

He thinks mining is about increasing money supply. The reality is, its just a clever way to distribute the money supply to people who help the network by verifying blocks. The money could have been distributed in a completely different way, but the blocks would still need verification.
In essence, somebody needs to tell the guy that "mining" is not a proper analogy. Mining isn't about getting the money out of thin air, it's about ensuring that the transactions are unique using proof of work. The same proof of work pool can even be used for other such notarizing networks using merged mining.
Even when the money supply reaches its limit, blocks will still be "mined", and by then the term will become completely inappropriate. This is happening gradually.

That's completely psychological.
If you are sure that Bitcoin's value will go up, there is no reason to keep spending in fiat. It would be better to keep the money you will likely spend in Bitcoin and spend as you need. The opposite would be irrational.
Of course, no one can be sure that Bitcoin's value will increase. Then again, why not spend? If you are hoping an imminent increase, it still makes sense not to; but other than that, I don't think it's "obviously" rational.
I don't know how this isn't clear enough. If anyone thinks I'm wrong, please convince me to not spend my coins while the price is rising.

If that fact is hindering permeation, Bitcoin will not get widespread and hence the value per coin will not increase beyond a certain limit, which in turn makes it easier for the "rest" of the population to attain some more coins, increasing permeation. The only problem I see here is the speed of this process.
You might think that if this is true, the market will know it and it will prevent the exchange value from decreasing. However, that by itself invalidates the statement, so it has almost no effect. In practice, unrealistic expectations fade over time and crashes happen.
A couple of years ago, "early adopter unfairness" was the big problem sitting in the throne of "volatility" problem we have now. What happened is, Bitcoin's exchange value crashed to 2.5 USD a piece. Everyone who was interested in having coins got plenty.
This cycle will continue until everyone who is interested in having it, has it.
Of course this is the ideal case. Who knows what will happen...

James is the worst sort of thing that happens in the Bitcoin community. He appeared to be both trustworthy and competent, while actually being neither. If he was set out as a scammer, we'd all call him one, take the hit and move on. But there is no lesson to learn in his case. He is the sort of person who doesn't mind causing people great harm for a minuscule benefit on his side. You can check out the bitcointalk forums to see how many times he has lied. He also basically gave all sorts of scammers on his exchange a free pass, and they ran off with our money almost solely because of him.
Actually I never thought he would show his face around the community again.

Webmoney and OKPay. Bitcurex has "me love Bitcoin" cards out in the wild, but they don't have any left in stock. It's a pity, because they don't charge you any fees (exactly zero fee, not 0%+x), whereas the others are pretty expensive per payment AND for exchange of BTC to fiat.
I've been using Bitcurex for some time now. Only recently, I paid for my son's emergency treatment, a couple of meals in nice restaurants, some birthday gifts and two times at the supermarket. It was a life saver because my bank account was in negative for a week or so and I did live off my bitcoins. :)

I agree with the risks you've stated, but I think there may still be some inaccuracies in your perspective.


I don't understand why this is relevant. Pre-ordering from BFL seem to fit more to this criterion, whereas you always have the option to invest in AM and buy hardware in parallel. AM seems to merely help with diversification.


Of course it could be any other manufacturer, but who would you bet on?


Since the IPO of last year, AM share price went up 2500%, while Bitcoin's exchange rate to dollar went up roughly 1500%. That's 375x on your dollar, excluding dividends up to now. That's something I've never heard of in my life.
Now, of course that doesn't tell us anything about what will happen next. But then, any sort of efficient valuation will get you to a point where you won't get spectacular returns for your investment. That's why I think your above statement is a bit redundant. Whatever the return, ASICMINER (or any stock really) won't be able to do anything amazing, since the share price would have reflected the situation anyway.

Well, the interesting thing is, people are not necessarily unhappy when they are not free. I won't make an analogy to ant colonies or such, since the ants themselves surely share the same goals as the colony, and therefore free. It's rather humans are easily fooled into believing that certain random actions will lead to what they already desire. The idea of democracy as we know it is built around this condition. Thus, it keeps people content and productive, which leads to superficial prosperity that makes people even more content. Also, it's not that easy for a faction to derail the system into a state of lower prosperity, so essentially no one really gets what they want, other than more food and docile entertainment.

There is a lot of profit motive, there is currently an immense amount of wealth accumulated in the hands of current ASIC manufacturers and there are investors out there who can fund very expensive processes compared to what we had a year ago. So even if there is a potential to introduce a mere 5x efficiency, we can't count on a speculation that it won't happen. AFAICT, even though beginning the production would be extremely expensive, devices would still be affordable when in mass production, so the potential efficiency could be a lot higher. It's all speculation though.
Besides, it seems to me that the network would be extremely more vulnerable to botnet attacks in the case of algorithms that are resistant to specialized hardware.
I think in a year or so, we will see difficulties so high that no single manufacturer will be able to easily attack the network, so this will become a non-issue.

Nope. m-of-n transactions require any m of n total keys. In my example, the ordinary use case is where the user authorizes transactions in his savings account. The bank has a key, the user provides his/her key (probably through a javascript utility, which admittedly may not be safe), which are enough to sign the transaction. The bank can't initiate a transaction by itself, and neither the client nor the arbiter. To initiate a transfer, you need at least two of the three keys. To lose the money, you need to lose at least two of the three keys.
Of course, there may be other transaction types that might be more useful for this specific case.

We can't have a new crypto-currency for every technological improvement. It defeats the whole purpose of currency. If it's proven to be interesting, Bitcoin should absorb it.

Well, with "mailto" or "http" for that matter, the path is unique by itself within that scheme. If you had a uniform address format for all payment methods, your idea could work. However as it currently stands, you can only make it work through workarounds, which is a lot less nice than specifying different schemes for different payment networks.
For instance, if you want to use "payto" for both PayPal and Bitcoin, you will need almost entirely different parameter schemes for each network. That is actually what the "scheme name" is for.
One solution would be to group all Bitcoin clones and create a scheme that is applicable for that category. I find the notion mostly redundant though.

No contemporary entity has the right to ban the use of Bitcoin, but I'm more interested in how it would be done if they so decided.
Bitcoin is not very easy to define. Most critics who think Bitcoin can easily be banned think in terms of legal personalities or in the context of centralized technologies. Even as a P2P technology, it is as easy to target as file sharing protocols.
In contrast, the data here by itself has no meaning, and transaction of said data can always be done using different means to circumvent any law targeted against some format or protocol. You could graffiti a transaction on a wall, someone could post it to an image board and it would still go through.
Other than whitelisting all internet communication, or at least all digital signing technology, legal entities could also focus on creating more strict monetary policies as a measure against the use of digital currencies. Whitelisting all commodities that can be used for barter and all currencies that can be used other than the ones defined in legal tender laws could be effective. It is a bit over the top though, I'm not sure people would just sit idle and watch it happen.

Okay, so if we're on the same page, I hope you accept that Bitcoin is better than credit cards because there is no inherent chargeback mechanism. This makes it possible to make transfers with no chargeback threat, while allowing for an optional buyer protection layer.

Every 256-bit private key corresponds to a correct address, so that part should be fine. You will need to generate the addresses and scan the chain on every run, you can't preserve addresses, transactions or labels inside the wallet with this kind of scheme. You could have the client download them however.
It's hard to explain why you are using a different kind of encryption, but it will still give you plausible deniability. If, however, the client you are using makes this scheme its default, it could increase plausibility.

When the things are at a level where the State can go after people just for connecting to the Bitcoin network, you will probably already be screwed from a multitude of other directions.
Luckily, unlike many other stuff, you actually can do something about it with Bitcoin. First off, Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous and you don't need to connect to the Bitcoin network directly to control your coins. Depending on the expected level of threat, measures against it can be as simple as using a thin wallet software and using separate wallets for separate purposes, to the "extreme security" I mentioned above. People here and on the forums are usually very helpful to newbies who have real questions. Either way, I would suggest learning how to use TOR and maybe Linux (and GPG), regardless of whether you use Bitcoin.
Regarding your mental situation, I think it's good to listen to your paranoid side. It is also a lot of fun to learn about privacy stuff. However I wouldn't worry about this at all unless you are really involved in something the government is likely to spend resources to care.

Maybe not overnight, but the increased advantages of offering services for Bitcoin could spark a rapid growth of the Bitcoin market there.

By the way, the community seems to be fond of tools like BitcoinWatch and they seem to gather some ad revenue. If you can find enough innovative material to display, you could too. The advantage is, you don't have to deal with suppliers or customers, nor promote yourself as a developer.

You are right, in that, if there is only a single transaction between wallets, and you never make a spend with the first identity from the second wallet, and you always conceal your location while using it (including checking your balance, etc.), they won't be able to "directly" connect it to your first identity.
They can, however, try other means to make the connection. For instance, if you make a purchase with your second identity from a honeypot service and send it to your vicinity, the money trail makes it very plausible that it is indeed you. However, if you lose, or obfuscate the blockchain connection, it could be anyone from that vicinity.

Yes, Ripple is made for this kind of stuff. They can do the transfers over Ripple. They can make use of a Ripple directory layer (piece of cake to do with Namecoin id records) to make it user friendly (e.g. jav sends to rddt both knowing nothing about Coinbase's and Bitspend's Ripple addresses). There will still be a small fee of course.
One way to reduce fees is to accumulate micro-transactions to the same address and send them all at once. Would only work for static donation addresses, so it's a limited use case. Ripple seems to be completely static, so it would work there.

The payment appears on the receiving side in a couple of seconds. After that, it's up to the receiver to decide whether they need confirmation or not.
Confirmation should take less than 10 minutes on average, but it depends on pure luck, the amount of fees paid, and whether the next generated block will include your transaction.
In a face to face setting, unless I'm receiving a decent car's worth of money, and there is enough fee attached to the transaction, I wouldn't care about a confirmation.

I might not be able to come up with it, but it still may be possible.
My point was, as long as use of their currency is voluntary, this is their problem, not yours or mine. 


If we are talking about all sorts of central planning, I think the real problem is that there is no such thing as representation. One may imagine bureaucrats as extensions to their (or the nation's) will, but the fact is, one can take any action based on any lingual expression of goal. Language is not a program, and decision processes are extremely complicated. Regardless of the "system" you've put in place, bureaucrats are the sole deciders of what is fit for you.

Historical backups protect me from bit rot. They are all local (optical media), but bit rot isn't a huge concern anyway.

Has it appeared yet? First thing I would check is the address I received the money, see if it is still there. If the transaction isn't broadcast, it should still be there.
If this is the case, change the server you connect to and restart Electrum. If this doesn't work (AFAIK it should though), after backing up your Electrum wallet, you can regenerate it, which should reset the wallet to to its previous state.

This has been discussed ad nauseam since Bitcoin's exchange rate was 0.
Basically, this is not a problem. With all due respect, I will respond more thoroughly if you have an interesting explanation. Otherwise we will repeat any of those hundreds of debates with the topic of Bitcoin never ever taking off. They ended up being absolutely wrong each and every time in their predictions.


Bitcoin didn't evolve from being a currency to being a volatile commodity. It's pretty much on its way from an exact zero to a being an excellent currency. **This may never happen.** However, volatility ultimately "destroying" its practical use isn't a very strong argument, since **volatility has always been there while the practical use kept growing**.
It isn't possible to have low volatility while booting a currency from nothing. No one is ruining anything. I don't see anything macro that could have ended up in a better situation. All the hypes, bubbles, crashes, etc. are expected from the beginning. How could it be any different?
Actually, his example is very much relevant. No one is objecting to the fact that volatility is diminishing Bitcoin's viability as a currency. All "despite the volatility" examples are important.
The only thing we currently need is liquidity. I'm assuming you agree, but feel free to give a different answer. Bitcoin's liquidity is increasing, albeit more slowly than we could have hoped for.


You have the right to be suspicious, because no one is actually earning bitcoins, right? Idiot.
EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to address the below.


This is all true. But you are forgetting to take people who think exactly like you into your equation. Do you think Bitcoin is getting easier to manipulate? I don't think so. All that's been happening is, the selection of people who are interested in manipulating Bitcoin are changing to more powerful types. There is a higher limit to that, and if you aren't going to claim Illuminati, etc. I'll remain convinced that *if* more wealth flows into Bitcoin, it will get less volatile *eventually*.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:38:00
Now, I'm ready to be corrected as well, but AFAIK orphans *are* being saved on the nodes that receive them before becoming orphaned. The blocks are saved and indexed in the order they are received and these files are never modified later. You don't know whether a block will be orphaned beforehand. Also in theory, one could build on these to make a longer chain and take over.

I imagine it went like this: Some strong figure in the foundation says it's a scam and declines accepting it, probably making fun, etc. Now, it's socially hard to backpedal within the group. They could have just pasted a Bitcoin address there within minutes of first hearing a demand, and the donations would now have become enough to support the foundation for a long time.
For the sake of remaining neutral, Wikipedia should have embraced Bitcoin before everyone else did. I still have a lot of respect for the people behind it, but it's obvious that such an endeavor cannot stay neutral and centralized. I think we are advanced enough to create decentralized architectures for this kind of projects.

I don't get the logic behind this:


It's not that I don't accept it as an opinion, I can't grasp the line of thought itself.

Within the context of Bitcoin (in other words, outside the third party services), the word account doesn't have a meaning. You have addresses. If there is a collection of addresses, we call it a wallet.
Bitcointip automatically created you a Bitcoin address, from which you can spend. You don't really have to sign up, just accepting the tip is enough.
It is different from the (more secure) wallet on your own computer, because the key to this address is kept by the bitcointip bot, and not you. This is evident from the fact that the bot can send the money on your behalf. In this sense, I think you could call this an account as well. :-)
You can have as many wallets as you like, and as many addresses within them, with Bitcoin. However, to keep things sane and secure, it's recommended to keep most of your Bitcoin wealth in a place you have full control of. This could be an offline wallet file, a paper wallet, a secure computer (assuming you know what you are doing) or soon a hardware wallet. Of course this assumes you have enough to care about.
Securing them and backing them up isn't as hard as it may seem, but there are a lot of options, which may be overwhelming at first. It all depends on what you feel comfortable with. For instance, most people prefer paper wallets as a convenient method of cold storage, whereas I find paper too fragile and prefer encrypted files.

It's hard to be smarter than the market, and the market would be having a crash now if it thought it would have a crash in the future. No one knows.
So, you need to make a decision based on your personal wealth management strategy, assuming it could go either way. If you are interested in Bitcoin, and won't cry if you lose the value you put in it, then buy at the market price. If you are only mildly interested and won't cry if you lose the opportunity to get in the market, then wait for a better price. However, keep in mind that, during a crash you will think it is likely going down forever and will not want to buy.

Depends on the sort of technology. In this case, Bitcoin is not only a technology, but also a currency. So scarcity is a requirement. If there is something wrong with Bitcoin, the best approach would be to try and fix it instead of switching to the first alternative. Either that, or the idea of an independent currency is hopeless anyway. Of course, there can be some improvement that can't be implemented in or can't work together with Bitcoin, which can bring about serious competition, which is good.

If it were France, Sweden, Iran, Turkey or Syria, it would be just the same. The patriots of everywhere I've lived walk and talk just the same. And you are the overwhelming majority, so we are thoroughly educated about how you think.
EDIT: Sorry, I might have been too harsh. If your understanding of patriotism does not extend to destroying people who just don't like your country's regime, I don't want to include you in this criticism. Regardless, while people here are often freely supporting bringing down regimes using lethal force, I don't think a talk about a peaceful collapse of the American regime deserves a cruise missile threat.

Certainly not true. Most alts have come to be through discussions about how to make Bitcoin better. Hell, Namecoin programmers were funded by Bitcoin donations.


We all know that this is the weakness of a currency that is agnostic to the real world. That is why Bitcoin (or whatever is deemed better) adoption has to have a superrational aspect to it. We all want a similar result; value transaction without intermediaries, reasonable privacy, low barriers of entry to the economy, etc. Inflation of cryptocurrencies that share the exact same nature hinders this. Invention of new sorts of cryptocurrencies and competition between them would help us achieve a better result. That's why supporting Litecoin doesn't make any sense, but that might not be the case for a different system.

I *have* used scrypt before, and I think it has its uses. However, we can't guarantee that custom hardware will remain costly, just like we can't guarantee that SHA-2 cannot be broken. What we know is that SHA-2 is far less sophisticated and is more widespread (i.e. better tested). Do the benefits outweigh the risk?
What is the perceived risk associated with ASICs? What are the disadvantages? For reasons I stated in my previous post, I'd very much prefer to remain on SHA-2 as long as there isn't a real potential threat.

As others have said, Bitcoin is a currency. Most of us here think that it's the best form of currency there is on the planet and for good reason.
However, it's not an investment vehicle. Its exchange rate may or may not increase in the short term, and may very well decline in the long term. Again, most of us think it will go up, since it's extremely useful and scarce, but it doesn't have anything to do with its functionality, which is what Bitcoin is all about.
Since the topic is investment, I would recommend investing $1K in it if it's only a minor part of your portfolio. What is good about investing in Bitcoin is, what you do with it has an affect on your future return. Spending Bitcoin or accepting Bitcoin payments works towards the currency's adoption, which in turn has a positive effect on the exchange rate.

Keep in mind that the difficulty to solve the block is not affected by how many transactions there are. It is directly determined by the network-wide "target" number. The lower the target, the higher the difficulty.
As far as I can recall, difficulty remained at 1 (i.e. minimum) for about a year initially, and even then the blocks weren't being generated as fast as they should. So, "easy" isn't the right word. The network is a billion times faster now, but creates blocks more quickly.
Including transactions in a block is optional, and a miner can decide not to include any. However, the block reward the miner gets for solving a block is itself a transactions, so no block is completely empty. It has no effect on difficulty either way.

* The person who does the mixing knows who gets which coin (in other words, incoming transactions can be linked to outgoing transactions). Reputation isn't helpful here.
* They can steal the coins. Reputation can fix this.
If you implement [blind signatures]( on top of your solution, even the mixer won't know which coin goes where. If you have enough volume and do some obfuscation to prevent traffic analysis, this does away with the first problem.
For the second problem, you need something like ZeroCoin, though I don't think it's a big deal.

Yes, there is that versus the potential orphan rate because of problems with propagation.

Maybe Von NotHaus was convicted, but was anyone who used or accepted LD? Bitcoin completely consists of users, so you'd require to pass new laws to ban its use.
Also, there are a couple of problems with the idea of "outlawing" Bitcoin.
How do you formulate the law itself? What exactly will they outlaw? It's not clear at all if you think about it. It borders on outlawing voluntary exchange completely.
Also, why would a state have an incentive to outlaw Bitcoin? Since it's a worldwide currency, and since trying to ban it proves that it's effective, countries that allow its use would rather benefit from it. If Americans who want to purchase Bitcoin need to go to a Polish exchange, it's good for Polish businesses, and bad for American, don't you think?
So I think a functional worldwide ban on Bitcoin would require a massive blow to individual rights. I don't think they can make Bitcoin look bad enough to let people give away those. We'll see though, maybe I'm still too trusting to people's capability of judgment.

You don't need to convert all your fiat to BTC.
Let's assume that, among all your expenditures, 5% can be purchased by Bitcoin with the convenience you like. Instead of converting X amount if fiat to Bitcoin, you could have converted (X*1.05). And that 5% would have appreciated in value until you need to spend it.
This is regardless of how hard it is to exchange fiat to coins, but assumes that you are doing it at least once anyway.
As you can see, it is, at least "mostly", psychological. For instance, if you are operating with a very tight margin and you have to have a certain amount of fiat at a certain time, then yes (to account for uncertainties). But otherwise, I still don't think it's rational to keep the money you will likely spend in fiat, that you can keep in Bitcoin instead, *if you are sure that Bitcoin's value will go up*.

I wrote a wall of text describing how my country is utilizing the taxes I pay to kill its own citizens and how I don't get any benefits for the taxes I pay where I live, but since you sincerely believe that you have power to affect anything through the "right" channels that are made available to you, I'm afraid you will only think I'm manufacturing excuses to avoid "doing my part".

ASICMINER isn't selling hardware and it will be a mining-only operation for a while, just as you say. No one had predicted them to be the first to produce chips, so self-mining was the best option to compete. The next step will probably be producing hardware that is suitable for the consumer. This is also a better path for developing a better product for an inexperienced start-up.
Actually, selling hardware is a much better approach than mining from the manufacturer's point of view. You get fast money inflow with almost no risk. Keep in mind that you have to invest a lot of money just to begin producing the chips and your priority is to get it back as soon as you can. The buyers are taking the risk instead. I think such distribution of risk is better for the market as well.

As a general principle, governance should avoid becoming dependent on private solutions, which creates cartels/monopolies and symbiotic relationships that undermine democratic rule.
However, such dependency issues already exist, so, for instance, adoption of free software in governance has been very slow. I don't think you would face the same issues, but there will be many obstacles.
As a start, accepting remote payments with Bitcoin could be a good idea (even if you use a private intermediary, Bitcoin's nature prevents cartels, at least in this area). Changing already implemented systems would be problematic, but accepting Bitcoin for newly developed automated public machines could be neat. However, none of these bring enormous benefit, aside from a few percent in savings.
I think Bitcoin, as a solution, could shine when you get into smart property (e.g. automated sharing of publicly owned property), developing cryptographic solutions in public registries, or publicly auditable ledgers. These are very generic ideas, so I can't tell where they may apply in your case without getting into specifics and brainstorming. It's certainly easy to talk about these in the context of self driving public transport and such, but using them to optimize how we currently live would require a pioneering effort.

Since transaction data itself is supposed to be unique, its hash is also unique and can be used as an identifier, even before it gets into the chain.
[It's explained here in more detail.](
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:56:20
Copying from how I described above, the block is considered solved when the answer is found to the problem unique to the block data. The problem, or puzzle as some people call it, is derived from the list of transactions and some other relevant data.
It is actually more boring than it sounds. By using a technique called a "hash tree", you achieve a number that is unique to the list of transactions that will be included in the block. Take this number and [some other relevant numbers]( to create what we call a *block header*. This header is not only specific to the list of transactions, it also includes the identifier of the previous block and therefore determines the current block's position in the blockchain.
Now, there is a function called a hash function (in this case, SHA-256) that you can apply to this block header to achieve a final number, or *hash*. What we want is, for this hash to be lower than a *target* number. So, as a miner, we modify the block header slightly (by changing one of the numbers there, which is called a *nonce*) and apply the hash function again and again until we find a hash that is lower than the target.
The target number is known network-wide and is a part of the block header. It determines the difficulty of solving a block. It is re-adjusted by the network every 2016 blocks, depending on how much time it took to solve all those blocks. Difficulty can go up or down to calibrate the block solving time to be 10 minutes on average.

If there is a fatal flaw, and users want to switch, the network will switch. Existing miners don't have any fundamental control of the hashing algorithm. Of course, you would want the industry to support it with hashpower, so you'd want their consent in practice, but it's not essential.
However, these changes will likely be agreed on and announced years in advanced, which is enough time for the hardware to get obsolete anyway.

Ripple is not a currency, and the idea is much much older than Bitcoin. I've been following it for the last 7 years.

If it works, it can certainly replace Bitcoin in the struggle to become the de facto world currency.

I was talking about the "building on what we have" approach. I made a [comment]( about it a few days ago, comparing to "best one shall survive". I think it's more useful to discuss the philosophy first, but I'll respond to the items to make my perspective clearer.
1. I don't think decreasing the block generation rate without changing the chain scheme itself would solve that many problems. You would never be able to make it low enough for face to face transactions. Besides that, even if you get a little more security per hash when you decrease the generation rate, you still need to count more blocks to achieve the same level of security at the same hash rate. Assuming we stay on the blockchain scheme, we could arguably reduce the average confirmation time a bit without introducing propagation problems, but thinking in seconds is overly optimistic (i.e. the chain would almost always be inconsistent, and payments would disappear and reappear randomly). Nevertheless, unless one can come up with a revolutionary new approach, the Bitcoin network can and should adjust the generation rate, if and when we are all confident that a shorter interval will not create scaling problems.
2. Earliest Bitcoin network was not secure in any sense of the word. We are approaching true security, but still not there. It's not about the number of transactions really, it's about the resources of the adversary. When we have enough processing power on our side, you can scale the network up without having to increase the energy spent on mining. I think this will naturally happen because of the decreasing reward, as fees are a better way to balance spent energy with required security. Or else, we need to find a better method than proof-of-work. I would expect Bitcoin to replace PoW if a drop-in-replacement is invented. Otherwise, another network would be necessary. Either way, I'm pretty sure that using proof-of-work for this will look very primitive and silly looking back from the future.
3. This can't be reconciled, so yes, that approach requires a completely new currency. Check out Freicoin. This sort of currency could also be implemented on Bitcoin (a la MasterCoin), or can make use of Bitcoin's already established mining power via merged mining (a la Namecoin).
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:35:16
Bitcoin being used as an investment vehicle is perfectly reasonable because of its current and potential future function as a means of exchange. Or are you of the opinion that it's merely a playground for speculators to play a zero sum gamble?
Quite contrary to demonstrating your claim, I already responded to what you are saying. His greater criticism does cover Bitcoin, does it not? Is Bitcoin, as a currency, somehow excluded? Or do you already agree that he doesn't like it, as a currency, so much?
Also, from [Adam Smith Hates Bitcoin](


And isn't this comment just rubbish? The reason and purpose of Bitcoin mining has nothing to do with creating scarcity. Wealth distribution and scarcity is cleverly implemented on top of the block generation idea. Satoshi could have picked a different way to distribute the coins (e.g. a la OpenCoin), but mining would still have to be done. You could say that if he was more informed, he wouldn't make this criticism, but it is a bit of a stretch to say that Krugman hasn't criticized it.

First of all, shamelessly gathering from Marx:
1. Value exists
2. The knowledge of value isn't directly accessible to mortals
3. You can only infer value during exchange
So, there is only and always the exchange value to talk about. Use value also exists, but it is also a factor in exchange value.


Without any underlying currency, prices would be established in bitcoins, so it's not a meaningful hypothetical. Is there a reason this won't be possible? Currency is a human invention. There may be some confusion at first, but people need bread, and there is always some amount of coins I would exchange for bread. Everyone has these needs (including the bread maker), so exchange value is organically and spontaneously established. Wherever there isn't price controls for a specific good, this happens regardless of what currency is being used, since humans invented the concept.


Yes, this was the guru's point, and it is in fact true. His argument boils down to dominance by network effects. What he fails to discuss though is all the factors that are claimed to make Bitcoin superior, so he doesn't make a case for Bitcoin's future inability to disrupt dominant regime. To be fair, I would also be quite skeptical if I heard about Bitcoin through mainstream finance and haven't looked into the system.

Can you at least give me some names and/or keywords so I can look them up? Otherwise, you know, paranormal activity is also well studied and nothing new.
As I said, what I see is people's "hitherto unknown" fundamental personality attributes becoming visible. It has been suggested that there aren't actually such personality attributes at all, and human action is dominated by situation rather than character. Are you of this opinion?

Those who think it's a scam don't get seriously upset, and they are easy to discuss this topic with. I guess people who have been scammed before could be more emotional, but it's usually the Bitcoin enthusiast who gets emotional in these cases.
Out of all the people I've spoken to about Bitcoin, those who got upset or insta-smug were *intellectually* invested in the status quo. All bankers and finance people I've discussed Bitcoin with were very positive about the idea, for instance. Professional economists and engineers, not so much. Some people just don't want their theories to crumble.
It's not limited to people who are obsessed with a theory of economics, but rather the idea that bottom-to-top revolutions can't work. They have this nice view of how things work in the world. I'm not saying Bitcoin is disruptive to "how things work". It's just an ongoing example demonstrating that things actually don't work that way.

No, the person who puchased the Bitcoin from an exchange in these countries would already have paid VAT on it. You would only charge the VAT for the product.
Then again, no one in their right mind would purchase Bitcoin from an exchange in these countries. In turn, I imagine, a resident would have to pay VAT when they "import" Bitcoin, which again, no one would really do.
Essentially, a ton of completely useless effort for no real gain.

No one really can say definitively that it's incorrect.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is not an investment scheme. It is supposed to be a revolution. A few years ago, talking about Bitcoin meant you would most likely be ignored as a freak even in the geek community. It didn't last long. Now everyone who wants to make a quick buck is looking to invest in Bitcoin. This will not last either.
In the long run, the people who will benefit from it on average will be the people who use it to their advantage. Entrepreneurs who have interesting ideas that weren't possible before Bitcoin, expats who want to send back money to their loved ones, freelancers who can now find work from any part of the world, etc.
So if you want to benefit from it, I would suggest you to begin using it. Try to figure out in which ways it can lead to betterment of the life around you.
The only people who should look into it as an investment are the people who already have a bunch of money they don't know where to put. You might find this silly, but there really aren't very many places you can park your money easily and privately. Bitcoin is indeed like a personal Swiss bank.

The argument is, an ASIC manufacturer can come in and produce immense amount of hashpower. Or one that already has the capability can be coerced into attacking the network. 
If you have many competing manufacturers, your vulnerability to the latter case ceases to exist. Also, devices become cheaper and therefore better distributed. Which means it will be much harder for the former case to happen.
Before ASICs, any attacker could just produce their very own ASICs and attack the network at a very low cost. It's much harder now. When we have a market where all ASIC producers and miners have to operate in a very tight margin, we will have minimized the probability of this happening.

Actually, there is no conundrum.
Say, you have 100 dollars. You want to invest in BTC, since it's soo deflationary. You also need a headphone. What do you do? You buy 1 BTC for 50 dollars, and buy one headphone with the remaining 50 dollars. This is how you do it.
Now, let's assume that you somehow bought 2 BTC with your 100 dollars, and then the need for a headphone arose. Why not buy the headphone for 1 BTC this time? It's exactly identical to the previous situation.
I think it makes a lot of sense to buy some to invest and some to spend.

Keeping people's funds is risky.
For Bitcoin, I think the best approach is p2p exchanges. They are almost impossible to censor, and as secure as the escrow holding the funds for a very limited duration. They can be operated in a more resilient manner (in theory at least) and cheaply, as the amount of traffic is considerably low.
ETA: Yeah, I don't know of any opensource p2p exchange software.

Transactions usually appear instantly everywhere, and can be observed using a tool like blockchain.info using the transaction ID, even without any confirmations. If you don't see it, then there may be a problem.
After the first confirmation (being picked up and included by the miner that generates the most recent block), it will most definitely show up everywhere. If it doesn't, it means the miner either didn't see the transaction or didn't want to include it for some reason. For instance, if you don't include a fee with your transaction, it may take some time for it to be confirmed.

What do *you* use to store your wealth? What is the *smart* way to do it?
I actually don't use gold that much, because I don't stay in the same place too long, and I don't want to shove it in my cavities while moving through borders. However I indirectly invest in gold through e.g. my retirement fund. Whenever I can, I buy land, but that has its own disadvantages. For instance, if you want to diversify, you need to invest in different political regions, and that comes with its own risks.
I'm also constantly pushed to investing in physical gold or vehicles just as volatile, because of the intricate tax schemes I am subjected to. So the negative interest rates my banks give me for my fiat isn't the only thing that puts me off.
Having said all this and exposed myself to a great extent for your pleasure, I wouldn't want anyone to see Bitcoin as a sure thing. The "BUY BUY BUY" mania is just as damaging as the "SELL SELL SELL" mania. I just think that Bitcoin will serve me well as both a store of value and a currency in the long run, and it actually has till now. Bubbles are unfortunate, but I guess we have to live with them...

In my setting, the government can't render it completely unusable because you can still go to the foreign arbiter and ask for the coins to be released to you (they still need you to digitally sign of course). I'm using foreign to mean an external jurisdiction that the State can not reach.
I think the assumption is, average person doesn't want to care about security. This sort of client shouldn't have the ability to spend their coins on their own at all. So in the ordinary scenario, client doesn't have clear access to the coins. With multisig, the bank doesn't have access by itself as well.

What I think you are missing is, Bitcoin didn't just appear from thin air. It has been progressing for a long time. Some part of the answer is already covered by the observable fact that it's still alive. So, it's not surprising that you only get partial responses.
Why will it die now because of manipulation, when it didn't when it was far weaker?


I've said it in response to your deflation argument. It's not an easy topic to discuss. People who choose to use Bitcoin instead of, say, USD, will tend to save more. It doesn't mean they won't spend it on anything. I can detail the reasons if you want?

The answer depends on where you are located, what payment tools you have access to and the amount you are planning to exchange.
For big enough amounts, just transfer the money from your bank to one of the exchanges, buy coins and transfer them to your wallet. You can check the current asking price on various exchanges through bitcoinwatch.com. This also works for small amounts if you are in the SEPA zone (EU) or have a local exchange in your country.
However buying smaller amounts in other countries is trickier. I'd check local sellers via channels like localbitcoins.com or bitcoin-otc first. If you are in TR, apparently you can buy [CashU]( cards and then convert them to Bitcoin on [one of the exchanges that accept it](

Yes, if all Bitcoin users are maniacal pyramid schemers and Bitcoin will inevitably and provably burst, then you are right.
However, note that you already assumed that it's a pyramid scheme, and then used that information to prove it is so.
Bitcoin is actually a very useful tool for trade. For instance "it is only good for drugs and porn and money laundering" accusation directly conflicts with your "it is a pyramid scheme" accusation.
Also, even though I'm sure we have plenty of people who try to have others "buy into" Bitcoin, we also have plenty of people who warn people not to invest money in it, especially more than they can afford to lose.
You should notice that one of the more widespread suggestions to acquire Bitcoin is to provide services in exchange for it. However, you could say, it's an elaborate scheme to make people have to buy bitcoins in order to spend them, thus making it more valuable. There, infinitely growing pyramid scheme! Of course, this makes a lot of structures pyramid schemes, doesn't it?

Best way to learn it is to actually use it.
First off, as others have suggested, use a lighter wallet than bitcoin-qt unless you want to dedicate disk space and bandwidth to support the network (which is a good thing in itself, but may be cumbersome while trying to get a hang of the currency). I suggest installing Electrum and immediately saving the wallet seed in a safe location (basides backing up the wallet file).
Second, get some coins. One way of acquiring is actually buying them either online from one of the countless exchanges, or locally (e.g. localbitcoins.com). Another way is earning them by offering goods and services. You can even get tipped for your comments here in reddit.
Third, go and find something you need for Bitcoin. While you can find conventional stuff for BTC, it's best to come up with something that can give you a feel of the advantages of Bitcoin, like having someone on the other side of the globe do something for you.
Finally, newbie questions are welcome in the community, so if you are stuck at something or looking for an idea, go ahead and ask away. :)

As pardax said. AFAIK Electrum can even transact the unsigned and signed data using QR-codes, but using a usb stick is pretty easy anyway.
The good thing is, you can actually export your master public key (e.g. from Electrum) and have a live "seedless" copy of the wallet on your online system that doesn't have access to private keys. You can generate as many new addresses from this live wallet, etc. and you will be able to spend from these addresses as long as you remember the seed (or have a copy of the actual wallet).

First and foremost, disregard all financial advice you get here and ignore "to the moon" and "this is a scam" posts.
Second, get some bitcoins. Easiest way to get some is either to buy them from someone local (e.g. localbitcoins.com) or earn them (you can find tasks or jobs in a multitude of forums and websites; e.g. try for serious stuff).
In the meantime, learn how to secure your wallet. Separate your savings wallet, which you access less and keep more secure, and your current wallet, like one you install on your smartphone. Learn how to back them up. Might not look like too much fun, but it's worth it. Once you are confident about it, they will give you a more refreshing feeling and ease of use than bank accounts.
After all this, you may want to go out and discover things you can do with Bitcoin that you don't normally do with your money. Financially interact with people with whom you ordinarily don't, or never thought of.

Agreed. Need to check out the final specs, but I would likely supplement it with a green salad with nuts and some fruit.


Good for you. I consider myself educated on nutrition as well, and had long intervals of sustained self discipline to try it on myself and see that it really works. That doesn't solve my problem, however.
I think your concern is that this product, like most other nutritional fads, will be advertised as a solution to problems that it definitely is not a solution to, and will only blur the root cause further. And even though these guys seem to be trying to make it as anti-charismatic as possible (allusions like "everything the body needs", "Soylent"), I agree that it will come to that if it gets popular.
That really isn't a good criticism of this product by itself, however. Better focus on its advertising, and educate people about what it is. At its current state, I don't think it is advertised as something that will make you healthier than a good diet. Also, junk food people will likely not go for it because they are mostly focused on cravings, which Soylent can't provide.

Why? Everyone who is eager to buy the story are apparently easily convinced by such loose connections.


Isn't that kind of information kept highly classified? Do you really think that everyone who is locked away and tortured, even at this moment, can be proven to be terrorists if we had access to the data?
Now and again, you'll see some crimes that were historically pinned on terrorists turn out to be covert operations by the State decades later (not talking specifically about U.S. though, they are far too careful). I'm nowhere near convinced that all people who are accused of being terrorists actually are in the business of terrorism. In fact, I strongly believe that most of that bullshit is used to justify sanctions and direct military action. And I think it makes a lot of sense when you consider cui bono.
Of course I may be wrong; however as you say, any sort of proof that might convince me is conveniently hidden, and the justification of their classified status is classified as well.

It smells like market failure. It was rational for GPGPU miners to switch to LTC mining (which was supposed to be GPU resistant, but anyway), it is rational for these miners to press exchanges to support Litecoin to increase the exchange value of their stash, and it is rational for MtGox to conform with its customers' wishes.
If Litecoin succeeds at becoming a competitor to Bitcoin, it only proves the arguments of the earliest of Bitcoin critics. Anyone can create a crypto-currency with little effort and compete successfully with other crypto-currencies, so none of them can function as a store of value. If they can't become a store of value, they will only be a decentralized transaction mechanism between exchanges, which Ripple accomplishes much better already.
I have worked on and contributed to alternatives to Bitcoin. I think competition between different takes on the problem to generate the best solution is a worthwhile effort. I just don't know what we can gain from a Bitcoin that competes with itself.
I'm not sure how we can solve this though. Maybe, if Litecoin definitively proves that a shorter block generation interval is better, Bitcoin can adopt it.

The local news in my language don't speak about the libertarian perspective when they publish something about Bitcoin. The reason is, that perspective is mostly alien. Of course, the elementary traits are there, since Bitcoin directly serves that purpose after all. The gist of the matter is, less dominant nations of the world want more control. If our governments could embrace Bitcoin, it would benefit us more than it would benefit the first world nations. However, they won't do it, because of the ordinary reasons they aren't dominant in the first place; there is a leash around their necks. It's a chicken and egg problem. This is the perspective I'm looking at, which makes your arguments appear childish to me.

Nope. Same production process, same competitive elements.


I personally know that Bitfountain doesn't. Some may be doing it, I don't know. It doesn't matter, the more you keep the hardware, the more sales price declines.


I was talking about "purposefully controlling the availability of hardware", i.e. cartels. If you read my first comment, I didn't propose a strict opinion on "mining beforehand", since I don't think it has any importance.


You are talking about pre-order scams. They are scams, clear and simple. Two different topics.
If you are proposing that mining with the hardware before putting them on the market is beneficial, you need to show me the numbers. If you are proposing that it's beneficial to mine with the hardware other people have already paid for, well, duh...


Your argument is backwards. You don't have to "wait" for anything. You can immediately release them at a higher price. Waiting is a complete and net loss in the current market, because buyers are very eager. I don't know how this is a question.


Do you have the slightest proof for this, other than the items are delayed? And you don't count the already shipping current generation hardware, and the already shipping usb miners. You are ambitiously waiting for the nextgen, and because you can't get it, there is a collusion?


Oh, really? I thought they were giving away free money. /s


Wrong. They will ship them out at a higher price. The profit margins will always be at the lowest.
Look, the market is chaotic, and there are a lot of bad players out there. I was simply answering to the question, that is, whether they are purposefully controlling the availability of the hardware. The answer is, controlling availability is a bad strategy and can only work in conjunction with a scam. The other question was whether they are capitalizing on the initial surge. Again, this is a bad strategy because people are already eager to pay the amount that you would hope to get by mining in the optimal case. It also can only work in conjunction with a scam.
Bottom line, don't give in to your ambitions and get in a pre-order scheme, even if it looks legit.

Since Bitcoin payments are irreversible, I don't see PayPal giving a full blown wallet service, especially in this legal atmosphere.

Well, it's not that simple really, because people suck on different stuff. This fits in as "not so shitty" food for lazy people.
I have every kind of food available to me, I am pretty much self-educated about nutrition and have decent culinary skills. However, because of my shitty dietary habits (or depression, not sure), I keep myself in an awful shape. I can restrict my diet to whatever sort of ready food there is at home, often biscuits or crackers for weeks on end and get terribly weak and sickly in the end. And I'm not a generally irresponsible person, I strive to keep my children on a nutritional diet. I just don't want to care for myself in a primitive level I suppose.
Above paragraph demonstrates just one sort of lazy person that would benefit from such a product. There is also the "end world hunger" aspect. If this sort of balanced, easy to prepare/store/transport food gets widely accepted as a filler in our diet, we can produce enough, cheaply, and distribute it everywhere.

I had the problem a few years back while trying to buy a plane ticket.
I was in a foreign country, and my bank said they can't "turn it off" anyway. I hadn't assigned that secondary password, and after the bank trying to set it over the phone for more than an hour, they told me it can't be done over the phone because the joint account was in my wife's name. OK.
I had to use my wife's credit card to purchase the ticket. At the end of the purchase, the airline's web page tells me that if you buy with someone else's credit card, they have to be present at the check-in. Great, but my wife is abroad.
I spend another hour to attain the knowledge that it can be removed through a local representative. Luckily it was in the neighborhood and they removed the requirement of card owner being present (without asking for either the card or an ID, mind you).

If you were buying or selling coins with fiat through these exchanges, all this information was already given away. You give too much credit to the effectiveness of KYC policies; they don't change much, especially when you can only make transfers through domestic banks. The State already knew the players.
The only people this sort of policy has affected would be miners who trade on these exchanges, with the hope of eventually taking coins out.
Also as a side note, if you know how Bitcoin works, you'd know that the phrase "authenticated bitcoin" can't work without a globally established taint protocol that everyone abides by.

What I would do is, create an Electrum wallet on an offline computer, enter a good password to encrypt the wallet and try to memorize the 12 word seed just in case^* .
After copying the wallet to a few safe locations (e.g. an encrypted file written on a USB stick and CD-R), get the master public key. You can use this key on an online computer with Electrum to view the contents of your wallet, watch transactions and even generate new addresses. However, you won't be able to spend the money.
When you need access to the coins, you can either create an off-line transaction using the online read-only wallet and an off-line computer combination, or just plug the wallet to an online computer that you think is safe.
(*) As an optional measure, divide the seed words in separate pieces of paper and store in different locations. What I did was, mail one piece to a relative abroad (who knows he's not supposed to open it), and put the second piece in a safety deposit box. I will never need them because I already memorized the seed, but my wife can get them if something happens to me.

I normally suggest people not to transfer coins directly between wallets you don't personally control. I used to do that, and it is scary even if you know it worked the last 10 times. If something happens, it will be hard for you to prove that you own the receiving and sending addresses, so you will need to involve extra parties into the dispute. So, just transfer back to home base first.

Will AM returns increase 10-fold? Certainly not. Will AM hashrate increase 10-fold? Almost certainly. Which do you think applies to this case?
Take into account that the 10x you are talking about won't be the case when BFL finishes shipping. Chances are that even when your jalapeno has approached near zero return, AM will continue to deliver with more efficient devices and hundreds of times more hashrate.
Returns of ASICMINER will gradually reduce, and shareholders are already taking this into account while making the valuation. If the returns were expected to continue as it is, a share price of 2.5 BTC would be extremely low.
Now, with your own mining device, you can manage the risk slightly more easily. With a stock, there are more uncertainties. I think there might be an argument there. I'm sure we can all come up with scenarios where AM stocks fail spectacularly. Otherwise, pure hashrate comparisons tend to favor AM share ownership.

I think it's almost established that Bitcoin needs to be supported by a functioning market before it can become a long term store of value. If all exchanges are forcefully shut down and people are intimidated enough to prevent p2p exchange, the only market left will be the black market (p2p BTC exchange would be defined as black market, so it's almost by definition anyway). If it can flourish there though, this can still be enough to keep it alive and repeatedly take a shot at wider acceptance after every abuse by State using fiat money, which happens quite frequently.

To me, the fact that you think there will be a plateau completely undermines your initial reasoning.
Do you think that there really is a singularity where the an immense incentive to hoard instantly disappears?
I'm sure you will agree with me that the prices never do instantly plateau, by definition of a plateau. How long do you think it will take the market to decide whether it's conclusive? Days? Months? Years?
When you have a reasonably stable exchange rate, all the concerns you've stated lose ground. You could of course speculate, but I would expect it to be a more complex argument. "People cash out because price isn't rising" doesn't work well in the face of non-linearity.
Furthermore, I tend to spend more bitcoins when the price is rising. Care to explain to me why I shouldn't? Is there a guarantee that the price will be higher next week? Who guarantees that? If there is such a guarantee, why isn't the price higher today?

From Electrum features list:


So Electrum actually requires zero trust, and is sufficiently decentralized. One disadvantage over full SPV clients (MultiBit, Android Wallet, etc.) seem to be that the server you connect to can discover the relation between your addresses, am I right?
Using different wallets for different identities is a good idea anyway, so I don't see any problem with this. It's easier to connect through TOR with Electrum, which IMO cancels out the disadvantage.
On the other hand, if there will ever be an alternative default client, it probably should be fully p2p.

Well, to be honest, I don't think it's PayPal's fault that they suck. They had to be an extension of the system, and in the end they made it more efficient. Paypal payments, at least sometimes, suck less than, say, wire transfers or credit card payments.
PayPal could use Bitcoin as a bargaining chip to negotiate for better deals with the banking system. There are many advantages for PayPal in operating on Bitcoin directly, instead of competing with it. They can provide all services that at least currently require a trusted party (instant payments, escrow, reconciliation, credit, etc.).

No, since there are many competitors. Also, mining with hardware before selling doesn't answer the question, since the price declines rapidly in time. Except for pre-order scamminess (BFL, etc.) mining with sold hardware can't happen either.
The answer to your initial question is, reducing risk and guaranteed income. Since there are buyers that are happy to get the hardware even at the cost of optimistic projected returns, it makes quite a lot of sense.


next round of hardware?
This also happened, but not purposefully. You have to keep in mind that you can ask extreme amounts for the hardware during the initial surge, so it's still a win.

One minor misconception you might be having is, that individual bitcoins, or units similar to it, exist as distinct things. They don't.
Bitcoin is a distributed ledger for transactions. It only keeps track of transactions. "Transactions of what?" you might ask. Nothing really. What creates the quantity of coins is the numbers within the transactions. There really is nothing being moved from the sender to the receiver. A transaction consists only of the transaction data entering the ledger.
To reward miners for creating a block, a transaction from nowhere to the miner's wallet is gets included in the block, among other transaction. That's how the abstract stuff we call bitcoins come to exist.
Anyway, the miner receives all the transaction fees paid for the transactions that are included in the block, in addition to the newly minted coins awarded for creating the block.
Since there are no real individual units in Bitcoin, once the transaction is over, the abstract idea of coins loses meaning.
I'm quite rusty on the escrows however, sorry.

Short answer: Many people are working on these issues, and hopefully we'll have better exchanges soon. In the meantime, trade with people directly instead of using exchanges.
To elaborate; creating a Bitcoin exchange is "technically" fairly easy and cheap, now that we have ready to use products out there for people who want to run an exchange. There is just about enough vigilance in the community to try out exchanges and expose bad ones to prevent massive fraud. There is also enough buying potential to justify investment on Bitcoin ATM's, so that there would be at least one in every major city. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase one of those machines and install them locally, if it weren't for the regulatory tension.
My personal take on the issue is, the real struggle for regulatory clarifications started just a few months ago, so entrepreneurs currently don't know how to proceed. Banks aren't being cooperative, both because they are wary of regulatory pressure themselves and because they don't want disruption in this area. Not related do Bitcoin, but I personally know banking staff who got jailed for signing the wrong document and unknowingly allowing transactions that don't comply with money laundering laws (not money laundering itself, since it's not the ultimate crime anymore). So unless Bitcoin is accepted from high above, or unless some sort of legal clearance is attained from the State, all sorts of foot dragging is expected from the banks.
So what now? We'll just have to wait and see if robust exchanges will be allowed to flourish. In the meantime, just find someone who wants to sell Bitcoin and buy from them directly (through localbitcoins.com, bitcoin.de and many others out there). There is no law against trading Bitcoin, and it seems that it will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

I used to use bitcoin-qt wallets for long term storage, but they aren't very practical. You should not need to decrypt your wallet until the moment you want to spend your coins. As others have said, I would recommend you to look into Electrum.
Electrum is much *much* easier to run on a clean optical live OS, which adds to security in moderately hostile environments. It supports off-line transactions (higher security) and watch-only wallets (no need to restore the real wallet in order to generate addresses, etc., which also increases security).
Otherwise, your security is good enough and should work as intended. Do a test run before you send a considerable amount of money in there.

I see your point. The centralized service being compromised and some sellers being undercover law enforcement are two separate things, but I agree that we shouldn't exaggerate the relative safety of a decentralized system. If the user takes upon himself to decouple coin mixing from the system and uses PGP for all communication, the compromised service would only enable basic traffic analysis, which could still be the case with a poorly designed decentralized system.
