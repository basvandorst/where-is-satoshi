I think Op means that those days are profitable if you bought then and sold today. He’s not meaning buying at the start of the day and selling at the end for a profit, I interpreted it the same way as you.

He is clearly implying that you should have made a more conscious decision on your bank, when you spent the time setting it up. A decision you made before slating the whole process and saying that BTC is better because it has function that has been around with banks forever.
It’s like recommending Tesla’s because they have cruise control and your old junker didn’t so therefore electric cars are better. They aren’t mutually exclusive traits and just because one happens to apply to the other, it doesn’t making it an exclusive feature.

Pretty much any bank in the UK. It’s seems you guys are still using some really dated technology in the US.
Surely there must be banks in the US that you can do this too?

That is ignorant. In your world, everyone knows what crypto is, but that's an observational bias on your part because you deliberately surround yourself with the information and like-minded people. I have plenty of friends who still don't understand it, but they would be more than willing to have a chat about it to learn more and have their opinion changed if someone could articulate it in a way they could understand.   
The ignorance of the community believing that everyone knows all there is to know will hold back mass adoption. There are millions of people with a negative views on the idea because they have been persuaded by mass-media. Because of that, it takes more time, intelligence and persuasion to educate these people on the truth. It doesn't mean they are a lost cause for all of eternity. 
You have a preconceived notion that everyone with that view is going to stick with it and if everyone with the knowledge thought that way, it will be the loss of the crypto currency movement, and it will be your titties that are tough.

Almost everything is better than selling to buy back at a higher price. Also, if you’re in bitcoin for the fiat gains, you’re probably better of learning stocks. This is a currency, not a share.
