Inductive fallacy
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:19:03
No, I spelled "inductive fallacy" correctly because Reddit User Liber-TEA was making an inductive fallacy.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:05:46
Yeah, next time someone asks me to substantiate my extraordinary claims I'll just tell them to Google it. Surely that's not disingenuous bullshit!?!?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:56:14
Haha heal the world through bitcoin, of all the pompous nonsense...
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:05:15
Care enough to what? Prove a cliched, fallacious anarcho-libertarian's point for him?
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:58:49
Spoken like a true believer.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:31:34
Look at this intellectually lazy bullshit. Just look at it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:30:33
It's almost as if it ought to be regulated...
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:50:30
So, vague references to obscure concepts in informatics and economics. Surely this will inspire people to watch some guy's youtube channel???
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:36:51
He's pretty far from a joke you frothing weirdo.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:17:15
It's a drop in the bucket of his total donations. But let's not allow reality to prick our bubble of ideology here!
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:49:12
Ignoring the fact that you're making grandiose claims without offering any evidence to support them, his implication that this will always be the case with governments is an inductive fallacy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:32:20
That doesn't make stealing bitcoin illegal. Precedent =! law.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:57:39
do you even burden of proof bro???
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:22:32
You've got the same frothing devotion to an obviously fraught system, critics are vilified and demonized, you've even got people at the top getting extremely wealthy off it even while many lose substantial amounts of money...looks a lot like scientology brah. Sorry you can't deal with it :(
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:42:53
They gave him $30k. Calm down.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:47:33
Thanks for proving his point!
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:49:09
Which laws?
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:00:10
So, vague platitudes?
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:52:32
I think I'd be a little more accepting of bitcoin if the culture surrounding it weren't so cultish. You guys look like the scientology of economic movements.
