The ideea is if you have say 4 versions of bitcoin each with different code and a bug is introduced in one of them then since the other 3 versions  don't have the bug the network will go on doing it's thing unhindered.
This works for bitcoin because we only need &gt;50% of miners to behave properly for the system to work. In the plane with 4 engines example if one of the engines fail the plane crashes so that's a misleading analogy.

Mining empty blocks (SVP mining) has no ill effect on the network because they only mine empty blocks while validating a new block so their hashing power is not wasted during that time.
If they would not mine empty blocks then those blocks would not exist but there would not be full blocks replacing them.

Look 4MB today are not going to raise node costs too much but it would make bitcoin cheap to use for all transaction users and give it space to grow until we have the other scaling solutions in place. I do not opose segwit but I want to see it along with at least 4MB blocks to buy time for the rest of the upgrades.
What the core developers fear is if they allow 4MB then people will see it's safe to hardfork and push for more once we hit the limit. But by that time so much could change (like lightning being available for use and probably cheaper bandwidth/storage allowing for the blocksize to be even bigger). 
The way I see it it's hard to pintpoint an ideal blocksize, it's easy to agrue why 1MB is too small, it's hard to argue why 4MB is too big from a node cost point of view.
Any small group of people should not be able to have so much control over this parameter.

Here is Roger explaining his position in depth to the bitcoin uncensored guys: 
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:59:32
Problem is when there is a backlog of transactions there will always be transactions that don't get confirmed for days and those users won't stick around if they are new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:31:43
I think they might accept segwit more readily if it came with a hard fork and **non-witness data** block size increase.
There better?
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:30:08


No it wouldn't, allowing for a hard fork to raise the blocksize to reasnoble limit won't hurt node count and could even boost node count (more people that use bitcoin now, more nodes now). Besides if goverments start showing force against bitcoin then the node count will shoot through the roof even if it takes larger hard drives which are cheap and a non dial up internet connection.

Bitcoin is not working great. The current state of the system is driving users and companies away.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:45:18
Or or maybe just maybe high fees kills organic growth in it's tracks.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:33:37
Well I still believe that **we don't need to cripple the network now with high fees until better options like lightning network are available**. I'm a programmer, I read a lot about the technical concerns of small blockers, spent time in the core slack channel debating and I see that there is no technical argument for keeping the blocksize lower than 4MB today but we can easily go higher without crippling decentralization. It's all political (if we raise it now we can't stop it from being raised in the future which is also bullshit).
Don't assume that the only reasons someone can disagree with you is stupidity, ignorance or nativity.
Beyond the technical concerns of small blockers being bullshit, I'm also in favor of not letting a small group of developers which have proven to be hostile to anyone who has differing opinions dictate what the economical parameters of the system should be.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:11:14
So you think everyone should hold bitcoin on exchanges to be ready to sell at a moments notice?
@_date: 2016-11-26 04:53:54
Yes, before you run into the limit you have potential for growth, equilibrium means stagnation.
@_date: 2016-12-04 09:16:28
Well the availability of spv wallets meant that people could choose convenience over security which is fine. Now that the people who run nodes are not forced to do so to use bitcoin I'm quite sure more users will equal more people who are willing to run nodes.
And there's my second point which you haven't addressed that should there be a need for more nodes then more nodes will pop up.
@_date: 2016-12-17 12:35:03
Seller does not have any control over the fee once the money is inside the bitsquare wallet, it's hardcoded to 0.0001 btc which is too small if there's a backlog of transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:30:31
I remember when the majority of people were in favor of rasing the blocksize limit before being pushed out of here by banning and removing posts. I'm one of those people. Still am in favor of not creating a fee market before other scaling solutions are available. 
This was also around the time Adam black proposed his 2-4-8 MB limit because it looked like 20MB was going to happen, then Theymos decided to take matters into his own power hungry tiny fingered little hands. I also rembered when he said that if 99% of people disagreed with him then 99% should leave.
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:29:18
No matter how high the fees go block will still contain a limited number of transactions. If everyone bumps up their fees some will still be left out if the demand for transactions is greater than the transaction limit.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:36:11
I get paid in btc and use bitsquare to sell for euros when I need too. I really like it, also because I can wait a few days for a sell I get to ask for a 1.5% premium on my btc.
How it works is I create a sell order and put my btc in escrow, buyer sends euros to my bank account, when the euros arrive in my bank account (usually takes about a day or two) I confirm payment and release the btc to the buyer.

@_date: 2016-12-19 10:16:06
That problem has an easy solution. Since processing power increases exponentially with transaction size not block size, just limit the transaction size to 1MB and increase the blocksize. In fact the other bitcoin client (that I won't mention to avoid the automod hiding my comment) has that limit in place.
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:17:13
This does not address the concerns of OP. 
Will it be possible with 21% of hashpower to lower the hard blocksize limit? 
Not to stop change but to change the blocksize to a lower value.
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:05:24
I'm all for this but I don't see the point of keeping the 32MB limit. This proposal already makes it very hard to ~~raise~~ change the blocksize limit.
The 32MB limit will just mean another hardfork will be required at some point in the future and I would prefer that this exhausting  debate never happen again.

But the bocksize limit does nothing to limit the number of transactions your node receives. 
I said the block propagation is fixed by thin blocks. Bandwidth is not an issue even without thin blocks unless you are on dial-up.
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:58:59
The current nodes will not accept blocks larger than 1MB so it's already not backwards compatible once the blocksize is raised. 
The 32MB limit will just lead to a repeat of this debate at some point in the future

**EDIT: Gavin made [a post to r/btc]( implying he was not hacked. Color me surprised.**

He was under the impression that CW would just post the simple proof he was shown. He was obviously wrong and admitted it was a mistake to publish his article before CW did.

There are losses on currency conversion but not sure how much, PayPal converts to euro when sending to my bank then my bank converts to ron. There is also a $2.5 fee for every time I take out $500 out of PayPal (max amount per day)

You know all commits can be easily reverted and all code is peer reviewed, right?

My question is who choose electrum as the verification software? 
My guess is that the electrum version was modified to show any signiture as valid if it ended with '', CSW'' since Gavin said it failed until he added that part.

Coins should have already been in cold storage, what appears in your account is just what is in their internal ledger. It makes no sense to change their internal ledger just because your coins are now in a cold storage address on the blockchain. 
**tl;dr** it's ether a very stupid lie or they have very bad security

But if the spent coins are blacklisted then miners can still censor them if they can detect that they are spent.

how is it better if other miners don't allow RBF? If another miner adds the lower fee seen first transaction into their block you can't mine the higher fee transaction anymore.
So the only advantage of full RBF is miners get to make a bit more in fees at the cost of breaking 0-conf. First-seen-safe RBF would be way better.

There used to be a romanian exchange but they shut down, planning on using btc-e, mycelium and local bitcoins

If there is no way of knowing if a transaction is in the last 6 block then I as miner can't prevent double spends or simply reincuding the same transaction in my block.

The miners are and always have been the ultimate decision makers. It only takes 50% to hard fork to anything they want.

Here's what got me to understand bitcoin and to look into it further

It was agreed that segwit would be delivered in april and 2mb hardfork code available in july. Also luke-jk made it quite clear that he dosen't have the same understanding of the agreement.

It's a small company so there is one guy handling payroll for everyone. Don't think there is any payment processor involved

Why is discussion of the fork allowed now and not yesterday? I did not see a single post here mentioning the fork yesterday, I tried to make one of my own but it was of course automoderated and never became visible.

How would you prevent people from selling the same stuff back and forth just for the easy money? 
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:45:07
Oh yes it is, especially since other scaling methods are no where near completion. If lightning network was ready and wallets implemented it in a usable intuitive way (which will be a great challenge and take a lot of time) then it would not be.

Miners have invested large amounts of money in hardware, they care about users because users drive the price up.

A DDoS attack is a distributed denial of service attack, sending garbage data to flood a network is just one form of it not the only one possible.

Core devs don't care about the will of bitcoin holders, they are in their ivory tower.
