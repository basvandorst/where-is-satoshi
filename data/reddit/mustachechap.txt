Thanks!  Yeah, I figured this applies to most, just wanted to confirm the US, since that's where I live.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:24:42
I am totally having trouble understanding, so thanks for being patient and taking the time to explain.
First off, my understand of today's events is, there are a handful of individuals that own enough bitcoin to severely impact its price.  They all coordinated and decided to 'dump' a bunch of bitcoin which drove down the price.  I guess my ELI5 version of how I understand all of this is imagine the bitcoin market cap is a body of water and the amount of bitcoin being dumped is a rock.  Right now, the bitcoin market cap is a puddle, so you throw a rock in it and it has a huge impact on the entire body of water.  Twenty years from now, bitcoin could be an ocean and you throw that same rock in it, and it's just a small blip on the radar.  Assuming bitcoin is a success, then hundreds of thousands of people will be involved in bitcoin and using it day to day, so I feel like the more people and more money that are involved in bitcoin, the less power these 'whales' have.  Like I said though, I'm completely stupid when it comes to this stuff, so I'm guessing I have this completely wrong, but at least you can kinda see where my logic is coming from.

Is it possible to get a Bitcoin Debit card (spend my bitcoin wherever Debit cards are accepted) in the US?  I've checked a few sites, but none of them seem to allow US citizens to obtain a card.  I believe Shift is the only one I have found that makes it possible, but they ask for SSN, which I would prefer not to give.

I just sent some BTC from my wallet to Coinbase (I know, shame on me), yesterday, and the transaction is still pending.  It's almost been 24 hours, is that expected?
On my Trezor wallet, I have a "Legacy account" and a regular account, and all my funds are on the legacy account, so I assume that would make things slower with higher fees, correct?  I don't mind the extra time, but I didn't expect it to take this long.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:56:32
Thanks!  I've considered a paper wallet, I was just wondering if there was a more 'presentable' option.  Something that would look nice as a gift.

While true, wouldn't insider trading be much less effective if/when bitcoin hits a much larger market cap?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:36
Thanks.  Yes, I agree insider trading will always happen, but if it doesn't drastically change the price of bitcoin, I don' care too much.  I know this is one of the negative side effects of having an unregulated coin, and I'm okay with that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:33
Well done.  I, too, have the same goal of buying a property one day with my bitcoin, but I still have a ways to go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:48:21
Right.  Yeah, I was focusing more on the (negative) effects of insider trading, not the act of insider trading itself.  So basically what you said is true, that insider trading is possible at any price level.  In addition, what I said is also true in that, should insider trading occur at a higher market cap, those insider traders would have less of an impact on the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:29
No doubt it's not perfect, but I'm still pro-crypto.  Isn't stuff like this only possible because market share is still relatively small?  It's much easier to manipulate a much smaller market, I'd imagine. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:20:07
I realize my mistake after initiating the transaction..lol.  My question is, is the 24 hour wait time a concern?  On coinbase, I do see my transaction as 'pending', so it is documented that it is being sent to the correct destination.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:43
I made that mistake at 10K.  I didn't 'sell', I just traded it for other alt coins.  So far, that has been a bad decision, but I'm still hopeful.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:55:28
Wow, nice job!  Like you said, even if $11,800 is not the bottom, that's a damn good steal.  HODL, my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:11:41
Apples and Oranges, tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:28
So a whale cashing out when bitcoin is in its infancy (low market cap) would have the same effect as a whale cashing out 20 years from now when (let's assume for arguments sake) bitcoin is mainstream and is used worldwide with a much larger market cap?  I'm genuinely curious because this doesn't exactly make sense to me.  I think I need an ELI5..haha.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:44
So, if you're in the US, it is more favorable to hold for more than a year?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:30:20
Yes, as a result of the crypto market being relatively small.  If bitcoin ever goes mainstream, then it would be much harder for this small number to own a large majority.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:54:16
The sale is ending soon, it seems.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:45
Okay, that's fine with me.  Thanks for reassuring me!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:08:56
Wouldn't it take more money to do so at a higher price/market cap?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:52:17
Thanks for the explanation.  Turns out, I understood all of this correctly all along, I guess I just wasn't clear as to what my argument was.  When I said 'stuff like this' wasn't possible, I was mostly referring to the after effects we are seeing as a result of insider trading.  We saw a decent sized drop within a matter of hours, and, that sort of drop is something I don't expect to see in the future if bitcoin goes mainstream.  But yes, insider trading will always happen.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:07:50
Damn, good catch everyone.  I actually fell for it initially.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:58:15
That would be a shame if the episode shed bitcoin in a negative light.  But, this will still expose a lot of people to bitcoin and make it more mainstream.  Even if they say negative stuff, people will know about bitcoin, and, if they see it doing well next year, maybe the negative stuff won't matter in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:01:29
The easiest/quickest method would be to use Coinbase.  Coinbase is extremely user-friendly, and you simply just sign up for an account, enter your banking information to fund the account, and start buying bitcoin.
If you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me.  There are other websites out to get bitcoin which have pros and cons, but, for someone is completely new to bitcoin, I'd say Coinbase is the most user-friendly.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:31:27
..buy one hundredth of one?
@_date: 2019-02-07 04:28:30
Yes, my Dad actually said this to me yesterday.  I very quickly set the record straight and he admitted to not knowing precisely what he read, but he basically saw a headline, and that was his takeaway from it, until I cleared things up for him.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:23:41
I agree.  I first got into bitcoin in 2014 and things looked pretty grim for a time (I originally bought at $800, watched it go to $1000+, and then drop all the way down to $200, where it stayed for a while).  I think some people forget the journey bitcoin has gone through to get to this point.
So, who knows, maybe ETH is just going through a similar period, and it could be a different story in 3 years.
I believe bitcoin becoming mainstream will help other cryptos as well.  I believe there is room for multiple cryptos to become successful, and, once bitcoin is mainstream, there will be enough room for several to be a success.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:29:24
It's also important to note that you can buy fractions of a bitcoin and aren't forced to just buy one whole bitcoin.  $9000 for one BTC is extremely steep, but you can get in with as little as $1's worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-03 19:16:23
This is epic.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:37:20
That's a good and bad idea.  Good because it makes bitcoin appear more 'affordable' for people, but bad because it'll cause a lot of confusion.  For people who don't understand that you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, that group of people probably will just be more confused with the introduction of Bit and Satoshi.
Bit and Satoshi make perfect sense to people like you and I who have some sort of grasp of bitcoin, but to the person who is already intimidated by bitcoin, this would likely only make things more complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:58:04
Buying a fraction of a bitcoin is the same as buying a whole bitcoin.  Just use your preferred bitcoin exchange and specify (in either dollars or bitcoins) how much you would like to buy.
@_date: 2019-01-31 23:18:29
Can someone please ELI5 what tokenizing means?
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:06:42
You're definitely right, but I don't really care.  What I care more about is that bitcoins reputation will be restored after people read this.
Not that bitcoins reputation was forever tarnished because of one CEO, but he certainly did have an impact on some people.  Hopefully those people see articles like this, and end up changing their mind about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:31:00
Good news, but, I'm honestly not surprised.  I figured it was only a matter of time before the price recovers.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:00:51
It would have been better if they could have found the same news outlet contradicting themselves.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:22:53
Who knows.  Only invest what you're willing to lose, and you should be okay whether it eventually hits $0 or moons.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:26:11
How do I access my coins on the other fork.  I was not aware of this, but I suppose that means I probably have some bitcoin cash too?
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:17:11
Congrats!  That's a nice milestone to hit, now join the HODL club!
