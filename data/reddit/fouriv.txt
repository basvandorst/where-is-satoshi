There is nothing violent or non-voluntary about capitalism, it's just the free exchange of goods and services though.
But a democratic government (meaning, non-voluntary) is just mob rule

I wish. If the government was a business i could choose not to associate with them, and they would charge money for a good or service, vs. stealing money with guns and threats.

I'm just going to bow out of this, i think we're talking each-other in circles and don't have much of a success criteria.

No. Value is the relative worth of a good or service, more specifically a good or service has value if it is desired by another person, the more the desire for the good or service, the more value that good or service has.
Yes, you can stay away from capitalism, choosing not to exchange goods &amp; services with other people. I don't see the point though.

You want to live? Breath, Eat, Drink 
People use money because its a convenient tool to transfer wealth (more mobile, etc) It was a big advancement when money came around, i suppose there are places where you can still barter for goods / services, or even just live off the land / grow your own food etc. .  it just kinda sucks, i imagine that's why people don't do it.
I'm getting that Anarcho-Socialist vibe, which means odds are we have completely different definitions of coercion and property rights.

I think the government would be close to a mafia than a business, both the mafia and government steal money and impose their will using force on people in a geographic area.
A business rather just involves the exchange of goods &amp; services voluntarily between two entities.

He's saying this because a Democratic Government (taxation etc) is a less than zero sum transaction, so it's obviously pretty shitty, you're never likely to get more out of the system than you put in, which is why he says it runs on debt.

You're describing a business, not a government. 
In Democracy, the majority imposes it's will on the minority, unless the democratic entity is voluntary (like a club or something) at which point you can choose not to associate with the entity.

Money is just a representation of value, you need some sort of value in order to receive something of value from another party.
You have to somehow earn the food / drink, be it with money, some sort of bartering, or just producing it yourself.
