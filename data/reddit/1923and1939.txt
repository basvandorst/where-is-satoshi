You know, I thought of putting that on one or two of them!

It was truly awesome! I got my tia to sign up on Coinbase, as well as four of my friends. And then all heck broke loose with the weekend market insanity! It was so much fun. What's super cool is that I talked a bunch of my friends and relatives who make silver jewelry in a coop to accept Bitcoin, and I'm going to help them get that going. Thanks so much for checking back with me.

Okay, added a Merry Bitmas one for you! :)

There are many ways to sell items and receive Bitcoins in exchange. It depends on what you are selling. You can set up a shop that uses the Shopify system. You can use BitPay at your website. Or, like me, you can set up a shop (Etsy in my case) and note that you accept Bitcoins. I have made several sales now, and all I do is give my customers my Bitcoin address, and they send me the appropriate amount, and voila! Happy me, happy customer!
Good luck!

So awesome! I love Ortega's! I will drop by this week and use my bitcoins. :)

Hi sock,
Thanks SO MUCH for your template - this is super helpful. I'm working up a version that will work (I hope, fingers crossed) for my sisters, none of whom is technically oriented. I will post it here when I finish it.

Oh gosh, I am frugal because I have to be. I work full time at a minimum wage job and also started school a year ago at the age of 46. I'm majoring in criminal justice and hope to work as a victim's advocate when I graduate. I have a little internet business that accepts bitcoins, and I am excited about my future! I'm a single mom whose children are grown, we'll one in high school yet. So yeah, I go out to eat once a month as a treat. Nothing wrong with that!

I live in Albuquerque, and here in New Mexico there are more and more folks accepting Bitcoins! It's so exciting. I've been making sure that I spend Bitcoins when I can. I just found out (here at Reddit) that a local Mexican restaurant is now accepting Bitcoins, so for my once-a-month dinner out, I will make sure that I patronize their business.

I'm a woman, and I own - and actually use - bitcoins. I accept bitcoins in my little online store, and I buy items I like with bitcoins. I also have a little stash I'm saving for my future. I don't have a man, but if I did, I would share this with him. The future of bitcoin is in sharing the information, spreading the knowledge, passing power on to others.

Great post. I am in the true believer camp, even though I am probably older than most folks here, a woman, and have invested what I can (very small amount compared to numbers I see tossed around here, as I am also a single mom with one teenager left at home) with the understanding that I may lose it all. 
One thing I would like to add is that it is important to use Bitcoins in addition to holding Bitcoins. The more robust the actual trade in products and services for Bitcoins becomes, the stronger Bitcoins become as a real and valued currency. 
So, do print off that cold storage wallet and know that you are participating in a revolution. But, please keep a small amount of liquid Bitcoins that you spend on services and products.

I agree that a personal introduction is best. :) Two of my sisters will be celebrating Christmas at my place, so I can do this with them. The other two live far away, so perhaps I should do a telephone kind of introduction. My sisters, to date, have expressed very mild interest when I've mentioned Bitcoins, but I think having their own wallet will make it much more interesting to them. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:48:23
Yup, my sisters will definitely (initially) be in the Magic Internet Money camp, but I'm hoping that at least a couple of them may want to learn more and get involved.

Thanks for the kind comment and the cake day wishes, marfalump. 
If I were the OP's wife, and he told me today what he held, I would be thrilled. I know, though, that not every person - man or woman - would be. I would choose the kind of partnership where these things could be revealed and discussed and acted upon together, but not every couple has or even desires that kind of relationship. 
My advice to OP is to disclose. He is obviously torn; he won't be entirely happy keeping it a secret. The thing about being an adult is that one can say what one really desires, wants, is, thinks, feels. He can tell his wife that he has this resource, and that he would like to do A, B, and C with it. He could then ask her opinion, and go from there. Even if his wife wants to sell it all today, they can discuss and come to a compromise - perhaps sell some, keep some, etc. And if they can't reach a compromise, then it wasn't a partnership after all. 
Take care

Greetings to you, too! San Diego is a place I've always wanted to see. Living in the desert makes one think about the ocean. Glad to hear Bitcoin is growing there!

Oh my gosh thank you! That was so sweet! My first tip! I will be sure to pay it forward. Much love to you this Holiday season!

Those are great, skidvis! Very cool design.

I bought a beautiful bracelet on Etsy, two gyft cards, and a jar of honey. I made a commitment to myself to use bitcoins for all of my holiday gifting this year.

On one of the pueblos in New Mexico. I invited my family and a bunch of my childhood friends and hope to show them how they can start to build a new kind of financial future. No one I invited had even heard about Bitcoin, but everyone is pretty excited to learn about it.
