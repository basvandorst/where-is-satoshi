The difference is banks are regulated by governments, which implies things are going on which are not voluntary.
If your worldview casts banks as the bad guys but doesn't cast governments as bad guys then it is inconsistent ;)

You are correct. I got my explanation from the [Freedom to Tinker]( blog: "The critical details about payment—who is paying how much, and to whom—can’t be changed, but certain peripheral information can be modified in a way that causes the transaction ID to change."

Ah, now I get you, you are talking about minimum opportunity cost to obtain item, not some sort of labour theory of value. I'm not sure how useful it is to know the minimum opportunity cost, though.
To be honest, this is one of those discussions that boil down to semantics. There are all kinds of numbers: cost to obtain thing today; cost to obtain it tomorrow in some other place; price most recently paid for thing; minimum cost of thing anywhere, assuming I could get there; amount I could sell thing for; amount I could sell thing for if I combined it with other thing...and so on.
I think the trick is to be aware of all these different numbers and to check what someone means when they say "value".

I don't think this works, because people who are exchanging their bitcoins for goods clearly want to reduce the amount of bitcoins they hold, and increase the amount of goods they hold.
If they can't get what they want from a merchant directly in BTC, they can convert to USD themselves on an exchange first. The same amount of selling BTC for USD is going to happen in both cases.

Consider a politician who has been voted in after promising to make it easier to use cryptocurrencies in business.
Corporation A is a Bitcoin payment processor that bribes the politician to support legislation that would exempt it from certain taxes and make Bitcoin payments cheaper, and increase A's profits.
Corporation B is a credit card company that bribes the politician to support legislation that would put an extra tax on Bitcoin payments that would result in more credit card payments, protecting B's profits.
If the politician takes bribe A, he keeps all his promises and the voters benefit. Corporation A has kept its promise to its shareholders to increase profits. You could argue that bribery is bad just because, and both the politician and A are evil, but by what measure, since everyone is keeping their promises?
If the politician takes bribe B, he breakes his promises to voters and they lose. Corporation B has kept its promise to its shareholders to increase profits. You could argue that B should have known this would involve making the politician dishonest and not offer the bribe, but that would require the coroporation to make the politician's ethical judgements for him.

But the expectation that it can be exchanged tomorrow for some amount of goods and services is reasonable. Yes, the expectation might turn out to be wrong, but it is unlikely on any given day.

Have you read Paper Money Collapse by Detlev Schlicter, by any chance?

"you could have 100 nodes that are just infected PCs, that don't store any information"
This is possible if the network stores the same information on multiple nodes.
What if the stripes were staggered such that no two nodes store the same information? Every node would need to produce a different checksum.
Still, you could calculate the checksum and then discard the data. So I am not sure how to solve that.

Possibly. But if anything, government supports oligopolies.
If you have ever worked for a large organisation you will have noticed how inefficient it is, in certain ways. Small start-ups should regularly be able to out-innovate incumbent dinosaurs. One thing that stops this is regulatory capture by the dinosaurs who use regulations to increase barriers to entry. Big companies are able to lobby for regulations to keep things expensive for small companies. They can afford the HR, finance and legal departments to manage a complicated regulatory environment.

Thought : isn't it incredibly wasteful to run an electric heater when you could use the same amount of energy to do computations *and* get the same amount of heat? Bitcoin mining or folding at home, might as well do something useful on the way to heating your home.

Indeed. I suspect that we will end up with something almost identical to Visa but for Bitcoin, and it will be just as expensive. But it will be optional. And on top of that we won't have the state involved in money. I fail to see anything wrong with this result. No cognitive disonance needed.

The above comment was sarcasm. The serious answer is that MK seems to believe that transaction malleability is a bug in the protocol, while everyone else thinks it is a quirk that can only cause you problems if you fail to take care.
Specifically, the care you need to take is to look at the whole transaction when processing it, not just the ID, because it is possible to make two different transactions with the same ID. EDIT: as jcoinner points out below, it's actually two similar transactions with different IDs.

I think it might well be a bubble. It seems to be driven by a news cycle of "ooh Bitcoin has reached record highs" -&gt; more people get excited about Bitcoin and buy.
OTOH, to answer the question: What are you buying when you buy Bitcoin? The exclusive right to add certain kinds of data to a ledger. It's not much, but maybe $10,000 is not so expensive for something that there will only be 21 million of, ever. Globally for all time, that's quite an exclusive club.
And as a hedge against fiat inflation, it makes a certain kind of sense. The more people want to hedge against fiat inflation, the more people will want some of that 21 million.
Edit:  &lt;- there are 223,300 tonnes (1 tonne=1000kg) = 223,300,000kg of Gold (above ground + still to be mined). 1/21millionth of that is 11kg. 1kg of gold = $41,700 on Bullionvault. So people are prepared to pay $458,700 for 1 21millionth of the world's gold. Sure it looks pretty and you can gold plate stuff but the stuff in Bullionvault's vaults is never going to be used for that.

Actually the only thing fiat has going for it is that it can be used to *pay* taxes, to stop the government throwing you in jail. Which is quite a useful thing, I guess.
