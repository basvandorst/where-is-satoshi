So Bitstamp is running low on coins yet idiots are still panic selling?  They are LOW on coins.  When something is scarce what happens to the price? The answer is stop fucking panic selling you stupid noobs.

This made me think of that scene from Zoolander where Hansel smashed the iMac to try and "release" the files that were stored in it.  I can just picture someone trying to smash this ATM to get the Bitcoins.

Someone needs to get Bitcoin gift cards into grocery stores and CVS's.   They would be in US denominations.  So if you bought a $100 Bitcoin gift card, you would be able to go to Bitpay or Coinbase or Blockchain and enter your code and redeem that amount of Bitcoins, then you could instantly send them to your wallet.  Of course the cards would have to be activated on purchase just like prepaid VISA cards.
Do they have this already?

Buy gold from coinabul.com then go to a pawnshop and sell the gold for cash.  There are also vendors on Silk Road that will send cash to you in the mail for your BTC.  It would be less fees to use Silk Road.

Semi large (200Th - 1Ph) miners are fucking dumping their coins on the market to pay power and other expenses.  Hey fuckshits, sell your fucking coin on localbitcoins or through ATM's and stop selling your coins on the open fucking market to pay your fucking expenses.  You dumbasses are fucking shit up.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:57:59
I do the same thing.  I sell Bitcoin via ATM's and I talk to very excited people on a daily basis that are buying their first coin.  It just pisses me off to watch these bears dump 5000 BTC on a market order just so they can induce some panic and buy back a couple of dollars lower.  The more volatile that Bitcoin is, the more people will hesitate to buy coin.  If these bears would just give it a rest for a little while the price will slowly go up and when the price starts showing some stability there will be greater adoption.

So when a trader puts up a wall like that he is trying to force everyone that wants to sell coins to have to sell them under $21?  How does this keep the price down?  Is he trying to make sellers think, "Holy crap look at all those coins for sale!  I better sell mine on  a market order quick!"?  I still don't get it.  Explain it to me like you would a 5 year old.

I guarantee you that your energy bills will not be included once you use $1500 a month in electricity like I do.  I had to hire an electrician to come out and install thicker cable and 12 220V outlets so I can run 77 5870's and 42 BFL Singles.  In the summertime that goes up as well for cooling.

Call your bank and have it reversed.  If you used a credit card call your credit card company and have it reversed.  You also need to file a police report for theft.

The best thing about porn sites accepting bitcoin is they cannot re-charge your credit card every month for a subscription.  I like the control of being able to decide when I pay for a service.
