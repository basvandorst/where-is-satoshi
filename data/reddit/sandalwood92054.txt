Hey! You should start your own non profit and grow it. Clearly you want to create positive change, and there are so many fake non profits wasting so much money. If you have any desire to, I'd love to help. I have a decent resume in the field and currently work as a project manager for one of the worlds largest contractors. Either way, thanks for what you're doing!

Wall Street in notorious for shaking out weak hands, so I wouldn't be surprised to see $5k or even $2k from them shorting it....then they'll jump long. On the flip side, the market cap of Bitcoin is a fraction of the market cap of gold, so the price could jump up a ton if Wall Street doesn't push it down. I'm going to keep my BTC and buy a put option.

I can't wait to eat your money when it crashes to $2000������ Hope to god the peak is soon. The coins bought at $10/coin are locked in a password protected RAR so my pockets are empty.

Consider how much power and resources are wasted by our current banking and money transfer systems. Bitcoin is incredibly eco friendly.

Better or worse, it’s worth 0.002% of what it was when the federal reserve started printing.

Stay in dollars then. Over the last 105 years they’ve lost 99.8% of their purchasing power.

“Faith” in the stability of the US economy.  The USD is not backed by anything but faith in its acceptance. Just like bitcoin. But there will be printing presses running till the end of time creating more dollars. There will only be 21 mil but coin.

10% and growing as the monetary base continues to expand

On a basic level, a lot of our income tax goes to pay the interest on the loan to borrow baseless paper from a private central bank.   
...but they’re already starting to accept BTC for state income tax payments.

So my $100 in invested in BTC at $10 was an unintelligent investment vs the $100k I invested in gold at $825/ounce? If I was dumber and invested the $100k in BTC instead of gold, I’d be much better off.

In the last 100 years the USD lost 99.8% of its value.  Holding that in a drawer is like giving it away to someone. Like the person who breaks into your house and steals your money. Or the fire that burns it up. 
Watch money masters and we can talk.

Imagine what happens when they realize the dollars in their bank account are only paper printed by a private company backed by nothing ��

What’s your idea of a safe investment then? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:44:32
Like in Bitcoin, cuz the baseless currency and Keynesian experiment we’re running can’t last another 50 years.

What if I was from Venezuela?
