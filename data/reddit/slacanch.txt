in the case of nexus you are correct, it would be "nexi", because the root of the word is "nex". 
in the case of "radius" however, the root is "radi" (Radi-us), so the plural would indeed be "Radii" with two "I"s. the suffixes -us or -i get added to the root of the word so nex-us -&gt; nex-i but radi-us -&gt; radi-i

the plural is in fact not Nexii but Nexus.
Nexus follows the 4th latin declination, for which both singular and plural nominative cases end in -us.
only nouns following the second and third declination have their plural ending in -i.

well your teacher is not technically wrong. 
there are in fact 2 different words "nexus" in latin. one meaning "connection" which follows the 4th declination (plural in -us) and another meaning "debt-slave" or "someone that gives himself up as slave as guarantee for a debt he cannot repay" which indeed follows the second declination and has its plural ending in -i.
so it really depends on which of the two meaning you want to choose

oh, sorry i must have misunderstood. yes you are completely correct :D
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:29:30
Thank you :D
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:13:50
cool! thanks for your answers, i really need to dig a bit deeper on the math side of the thing.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:13:31
no need to be rude
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:11:27
i will, thanks :)

i agree, although privacy is potentially a problem. in line of principle i'm fine with public transactions, but nowadays there are very powerful tools to associate nameless addresses with names and faces. privacy is definitely an issue to be addressed in the future.

well if the bitcoin network is the most powerful AND is compromised, all other crypto networks are consequently compromisable as well. plus it would severely undermine the trust in cryptocurrency as a whole.

i think coins are still exchanged. i just saw my bitcoin balance rise so i suppose something is still moving.

what do you mean by "diversified"? a business which is no longer profitable is not going to go very far.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:09:13
fair enough :)
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:43:58
AH! proof of work! you sneaky pun person.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:34:32
this is incredible, how can i learn more about this?
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:01:25
thanks for the very detailed reponse!
as i stated in other comments, the divisibility thing pretty much takes care of destroyed coins. 
i wasn't aware of the fact that the overall value of the bitcoin hashing network was so low. at these levels, what prevents an unscrupulous russian oil magnate from fucking up the whole thing (while making a profit)? would there be a way to detect such double spendings? how much time does bitcoin have before this sort of attacks become inevitable? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:16:30
i understand, the thing is that none of those things are predictable. my question was about how you make sure that mining will still be substantial as to ensure network safety. you cannot make long term planning on the security of the network by making assumptions on how much the exchange rate will be

yeah, these days i read some of the early 2009 discussions from satoshi and he brilliantly explains that once you have that amount of computational power, it becomes more convenient to become a good guy than to try and tamper the network.

Thanks for your answer, the divisibility thing makes very much sense. isn't there a minimum transaction fee though? i performed a trial transaction sending 0.0001 bitcoins to a secondary wallet of mine. that took 0.0001 bitcoins as transaction fee, with the result that my 0.0001 bitcoins are now stuck on my secondary wallet XD
are fees variable? thanks

at the current state of things i agree completely, i'm thinking years into the future, when the bounty for a block will be less than 4 btc.
