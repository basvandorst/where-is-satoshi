It's up to you mate, personally I'd split 50/50 and HODL.

It was a scam. You invest for example 1000usd and you get 1% or something every day, lol.

Binance, Bitfinex? I'm not guaranteed that the registration is open, but you might want to find out.

Yeah, we got rid of weak hands, that's the best part of it :-)

This is my exact thought. I think the whales are holding the prices, also buying BTC OTC and preparing for the final SEC decision. The volatility is really low compared to previous months, this might be done on purpose, because a stable currency is more likely to get an approval from SEC. I mean wtf, all those great news that popped up recently and the price of BTC hasn't moved a bit, this doesn't seem natural.

Yeah, and I doubt we are breaking out of this descending triangle before the SEC news, this last quarter of 2018 should be interesting.
I wonder how this will play out:

Not today.
