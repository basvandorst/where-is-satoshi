No. I am amazed how a little drop like this can freak some people out.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:46:06
What would happen if Bitcoin increased the blocksize like BCH? Wouldn’t the price skyrocket?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:08:23
Crypto ban won’t happen. Blame yourself if you miss out. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:06:25
It’s becoming mainstream I tell ya.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:52
Dip is over??
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:58:37
I work at an office in Japan. Listening to my coworkers, my section of ca. 20 people owns around 50 BTC. And Monacoin. Lots of Monacoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:48
I think its stupid  to sell all bitcoin (never sell everything) but a little diversification isn’t bad.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:44:06
OP also doesn’t he just doesn’t want to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:53
Are you scared? Did you sell? Weak hands gtfo.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:38
Paid for your panic. We all do it once. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:47
More than once.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:39:13
So did you buy Mona and enjoyed the over 100% rise last 24 hours??
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:14:16
Remember the Vegeta memes??
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:38:59
Wow!!! This is **BIG**
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:34:35
4k is nothing. If this technology becomes mainstream we will be talking 400k. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:00:24
Yeah but you can still easily double or triple your money in 1 year or so. 
Show me another asset class that can do this. Stock? Maaaybe.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:00:52
This is so true. Forbes is much lower quality than perceived by many.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:12:00
Dude, your friend is just broke and can't invest anyway. Feel for him.
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:17:51
Hmm, I use Bitflyer and it's not 0 fee. I pay something like between 0.006 and 0.0001 BTC per transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:42:38
Yeah, I just thought about all the work that goes into building a nuclear power plant, and then to use it to mine bitcoin. Amazing.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:07:08
It means there will be no inflation like in fiat when governments just print more of it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:13:52
Well, my opinion is that Bitcoin is massively undervalued and the "correction" upwards is happening right now. I think and this is just my opinion that coins are cheap as fuck right now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:49:07
Humans using nuclear power plants to mine crypto? What a strange century we live in.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:38:08
Imagine you are a Russian. If the government just prints it to pay back their perpetual debt, something that Japan is trying to do in the long term, your money would lose value. Not so with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:50:09
Poor you. That was the dip.
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:12:17
We are already over the crucial 1,000,000 Yen here in Japan ;) since today
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:36:35
You want  to be a day trader? Possible to make money but it takes a lot of work. If you don’t know technical analysis then I’d recommend to stick to dollar cost averaging.  I got a full time job, so I just buy bitcoin every day, no matter the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:35:51
Go big. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:12
Bad news for you: There is more demand than supply.

He was drunk or stoned. I hope.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:01:40
Price might go down in short term. Nobody knows. But if you believe in Bitcoin, buy a small portion every week and you’ll even out the price while making a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:28:03
It’s a forum to discuss things like this.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:56:11
Honestly. I also buy all the time I have some fiat to spare.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:49:45
Should I now bet on Bitcoins? And then some major questions: is it possible to invest with less than 10,000 usd? Is it safe? .... 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:45:17
No bro. Market is hungry. Demand is high.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:48:41
Bitcoin is still massively undervalued. I don’t think there will be a dip below 6,000. It’s more likely we will reach 100,000.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:34:16
Good for you. But. Trying to time the market will not go well in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:51:35
Go ahead. Time the market.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:46:08
800,000 yen here in Japan
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:03:39
Yeah, but it’s coming. One year ago you would have thought “how many even KNOW about bitcoin?” 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:13:58
I’m pumped to watch it!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:37:59
Why the hell would you short a major bull? I mean go ahead, but don’t be surprised if you lose half your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:26:41
Nobody knows. If you believe in the long term, just buy all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:47:18
Just buy already.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:09:25
It’s over ninethousAAAAAAAAAND!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:20:47
Buy a small amount every day or week.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:58:25
If you ask me today, which asset is the most grotesquely undervalued, I’ll tell you Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:29:19
Why would you sell in a bull market????? You want to try to time the market? Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:08:55
On Bitflyer, I can buy Amazon Japan coupons which are basically Amazon points which I can use to buy anything on Amazon. I am already buying most of my day to day stuff (except food) with Bitcoin on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:17:38
You too? I increased both, my BTC and BCH. Today was great. That big move just now though. lol.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:23:24
Our company sells real estate to people with Bitcoin already. What do you mean nobody uses it? YOU just don't.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:19:10
Full Steam Ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:37:56
Whenever I spend something, I buy a similar amount of BTC. It’s the same, but I get the feeling that I contribute to the growth of the system.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:32:19
It’s over ninethousAAAAAND!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:24:14
I think we are at the stage of mass adoption and that this is just a small bump compared to things to come. Therefore I think the dip will be much smaller than what others might think. Soon we will hit 14,000. But that’s just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:02:07
Thanks for this. Now I understand a lot more. But that’s a big “BUT”, there isn’t it?? Are you confident that’s it going to happen that way?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:13:20
it’s over ninethous**AAAAAAND**
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:12:53
I bought my first bunch of bitcoins at 600usd. Now Bitcoin is at the verge of going mainstream. I just don’t see it dipping too steep with all the people lining up to buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:54:17
Numbers, numbers out of your ass!!!!

@_date: 2017-11-23 01:32:48
I’m here to remind you, I doubled my money with btc.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:05:39
You are so yesterday. I use Bitflyer, and changing your btc back to fiat is very easy. Also I can buy almost everything using Amazon giftcards which I can buy with btc. Bic Camera, one of the biggest electro outlets also accepts bitcoin. It’s coming. Wake  up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:11:30
Anyway, lots of people became dollar/yen/euro rich with bitcoin already. It already happened. It’s only your fault if you missed out.
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:09:58
Forbes fucking sucks!!!!!!! I have some knowledge in a certain frontier market and Forbes gets its "facts" so wrong, it is often the opposite!

@_date: 2017-09-29 23:54:43
Yes you can. But it's a lot more work than you'd think.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:19:37
So much this! Anyone who invested in assets in multiple countries, like real estate knows how great crypto is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:59:40
Why? Cause Bitcoin will never be worth 5000 USD anymore? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:49:51
All right, bitcoin might not be the one cryptocurrency to survive  but there is tremendous use to crypto currency to normal people.  In my case I have family and assets in multiple countries in Asia and Europe and higher amount fiat transfer through the banks is always a pain in the ass and also expensive. For example imagine I want to send 200,000 usd to Europe from Japan. I have to explain where the money comes from and prove with paper that taxes are already paid. otherwise I pay taxes again. I pay 50% taxes on my income already. The future appeal of cryptocurrencies lies in the ultimate control over your own money, with fast and secure global transactions with low fees compared to fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:07:04
Actually you can buy Amazon giftcards in Japan via Bitflyer.  Those gift cards you can use to buy online on Amazon (by inputting the card code on the back) so I can already today buy everything on Amazon Japan with bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:11:59
Learn more about the tech behind bitcoin.  Don't give a fuck about what your friends do.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:20:15
So with 6 you are already talking about a yacht???
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:37:56
Ya, I looked at BCH and personally I don't understand the hate it gets on this sub. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:30:38
Nah, you just don’t get what he’s trying to say. He is talking about people who think it’s too late to enter the game. I’m sure OP has more than 1 btc because he said he’s settled with btc.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:09:37
I understand what you say and you are right.
But I interpreted OP's comment as that 1 BTC is still "only" 5500 usd which is a small sum for a lot of people. He suggests to newcomers to just buy 1 (because it feels good) and leave it there. If you did that, you'd still not miss the train.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:48:12
Yeah no thanks, I panic sold once. Still regret it. My focus is on accumulating as much coins as possible until 2020 or later. I'll continue to buy a small portion every day.  Makes me BTC richer every day and it feels good.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:21:47
I think Chinese who had to get their shit out real quick did so.  Now it's back to normal.

@_date: 2017-10-21 05:10:06
But what id Bitcoin is going to stay king?
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:23:15
It's less about balls and more about believing in the tech. If you believe it, it ain't scary.
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:32:10
HIS is the biggest in Japan. They are now bigger than JTB.
If not, then they are a very close Nr. 2.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:13:58
That's why I have buy orders every at every 50 bucks all the way down to 1900. I 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:49:29
It's coming! Japan's biggest travel agency H.I.S. is accepting bitcoin now too. Right now I pay about 20-30% of my expenses with Bitcoin already. 
We have to use Bitcoin in order to make it grow!
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:58:47
Source? That sounds ridiculously high.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:48:15
Yeah the 20m users number is also off. Because many many people only hold btc on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:59:03
Well he said the price is going to 1/5th at some point. If that’s teue, it sure will go below 5500.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:25:41
Why lose tust because of a fork? What’s the rationale behind that?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:22:24
I buy on Bitflyer. Sometimes no fees, sometimes very low fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:13:18
Yeah, exactly my point. You have no way of knowing. Yet OP claims it like it is a fact that there will be a 1/3 1/5 correction. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:21:24
Today, I feel euphoric.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:53:21
It's craaaaashing. But that's when you're supposed to buy, right?
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:50:44
Yes, and I said, if it really IS going to 100k, then now saying that "all this euphoria is ridiculous" (direct quote of OP of this branch in the thread) is ridiculous by itself. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:41:35
And that's when I buy more and finally will get to 100btc!
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:03:16
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:56:49
Living in Tokyo, working in finance. Almost everyone I know owns Bitcoin. It is difficult to get an objective picture but after some research I came to the conclusion that around 10% of the working population 20-65 year olds might already own Bitcoin. Research meaning looking at the number of accounts at Bitflyer etc.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:15:24
That’s just wrong. If you live here for 5 years and behave well, you can get the nationality. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:12:41
If you are so sure about it, sell now and buy the dip. Right?
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:08:13
“You just Doubled the supply of 1 currency” is not correct. You only have one btc.after the fork. The new coin is another currency which will have significantly less value than btc and eventually become insignificant (or, less likely, will become the new mainstream currency if the tech/utility is better than btc) Anyway the marketcap will not simply double because of a fork so your comparison is quite flawed. I think nobody who owns btc for a longer period is scared by this forks. The best coin will survive. We get all for free. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:47:43
Buy small amounts every day if you believe in this invention.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:51:00
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:46:01
Again, if you are so sure... Then sell now. Buy back when the correction is unfolding.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:42:03
In Japanese Yen its an ATH since like 2 days ago :)
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:34:14
There will always be dips.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:31:01
What? I am buying lots of stuff with Bitcoin already. Maybe not where you live but in Japan I can buy quite everyhing I want with Bitcoin including real estate.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:34:07
I buy every fucking day.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:59:40
Why? Cause Bitcoin will never be worth 5000 USD anymore? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:24:33
What is bad about BCH? Honest question.

Let’s hope for a panic sell. Imma buy like crazy.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:37:03
That's a statement I can agree with. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:29:32
I get that. But if THAT is going to be the case, then OPs comment that "all this euphoria is ridiculous." is kinda ridiculous. Because in that case euphiroa would be justified. 
I understand what OP wants to say, I just think that THERE IS GOING TO BE AN EPIC CORRECTION AND ITS GOING TO 1/5TH OF THE PRICE!!! is just too much panic mongering.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:39:53
On a long enough timeline...
