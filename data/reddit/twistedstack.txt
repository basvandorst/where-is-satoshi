This is a good point. The counter-argument would be we're not just talking about the US economy here but also the global economy. We also have to account for lost coins. In any case, we shall see in the next few years.

Over here, our smallest unit is 0.05 PHP which is equivalent to 0.001 USD. I think 0.05 PHP and 0.10 PHP coins are pretty much useless. I'd say the smallest practical unit is 0.25 PHP. 0.01 USD is equivalent to 0.51 PHP. Let's round that down to 0.50 PHP for convenience. Given that 0.25 PHP is still usable here, I don't think we can really get rid of having the equivalent of a penny in BTC.

Water in a plastic bag I guess. Maybe even ice pops.
The bigger reason why I think it's still useful is because for the poor, they really count each peso (2 US cents). It can be the difference between whether they eat or not, whether they have a ride home or not, etc. If all the stuff they buy at the grocery store increases in price by 0.25 PHP, it will add up quickly to the point where it could have already been 6.40 PHP which is the minimum fare for students, senior citizens, and PWD.

The problem is 1M is parity with USD where 100 satoshis == 1.00 USD. Beyond 1M, we may start having trouble with not having enough digits unless there's a hard fork to increase the number of digits.

Run in xterm, tweak font size to your heart's content.


User-friendliness is relative.

Quickest solution, add the following entry to the user's crontab:
     ${HOME}/bin/bitcoind; # Path is only an example.
If you want to get fancier than that, write a script that loops until it sees that bitcoind is running and use that instead in crontab. If you really want to get fancy, use [daemontools](

Something like [this]( Drive A on top, Drive B at bottom.

That was my drive A and B.

I had a thought about hardware wallets the other day. What if you have a card that can generate new keys every time you pay via induction power from the payment terminal? Outside of the engineering problems, the user will have to trust the silicon of course but the majority of the people already seem to trust contactless cards anyway.

Don't forget to have a shielded off-grid power supply (preferably entirely inside said Faraday cage) as well.

I agree with It's not saving that drives an economy, it's spending. If everybody holds on to currency, the trade of goods and services go down leading to stagnation. If there is no trade between the currency and goods and services, what good is the currency?
