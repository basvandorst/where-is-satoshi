I was thinking just the same myself. I appreciate the OP is probably trying to settle people and give them a bit of positivity but it's disingenuous to pretend that 2014 never happened.

Ditto - sold 0.3 at €12,500 when I saw it pushing €12.7k. Setup some limit orders to buy back in if it dropped to the 11k region, went to sleep happy that I was probably being sensible. Wake up it's €13.0k. Go for a shower and make a coffee it's pushing €14.5k o_O  Still can't believe how far it's come since even just November.

The nice thing with bitcoin is being able to buy fractional amounts down to any amount you please. You could buy a dollar's worth if you really want to. I had a stocks and shares ISA and I think after 4 years it made a pittance - and every time I wanted to buy any shares it was £15 in fees - fuck that anymore for a game of soldiers.

Just to be "that guy" - you haven't made anything until you've cashed it out or used it. Don't fall into the trap of looking at current "profits" as locked. I am on team HODL too, but I do the same thing and then it causes me no end of panic/depression.

Yep, I get your reasoning (had a look at some of the comments on other subs) and can understand it. I've posted above why for me this would probably increase my anxiety and have me opening CMC up _more_ than I would normally. 
I have it installed and will keep checking and as soon as that currency update lands will update play review to 5 :) Thanks for releasing this.

I don't know about anyone else but seeing the market cap figure doesn't really tell me much. This would be much more useful if it could display the current price (of $btc as a start, though would be even nicer if configurable). 
Definitely appreciate the lack of permissions and minimal functionality though and liked the approach of having it pinned in notifications.
