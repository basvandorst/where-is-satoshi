How would the segwit chain compare in hashrate? And are we sure this is what the majority of the users want or just what the users on reddit want?

One more Q: whats stopping me from buying from somewhere low and selling somewhere high?
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:59:17
Then sure, keep your monetas in an online wallet

Depends who you trust more. Other people, or yourself.

@_date: 2017-05-27 20:19:48
Hahaha, good prediction dude, look at the price
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:39:53
But if it was possible would it not be stabilized due to many people doing it?
