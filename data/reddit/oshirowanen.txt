Patiently waiting for paper cash options, i.e. pay seller by post, pay seller by hand, physical cash deposit into sellers account.  All these options are available on LocalBitcoins.  Unfortunately, LocalBitcoins is centralized, and unfortunately, it's still my ownly option as BitSquare doesn't have these options yet.  Hopefully when v1 is released, it will.  Also, any work being done on integrated and decentralised reputation system in BitSquare?

As far as I understand, this is very possible.  Once you have the bot on 75% of the nodes, i'd say it's extremely easy to get them to perform a task at exactly the same time...

**Question 1**: bitcoin-core full nodes allow anyone with enough bandwidth and storage space to become a node if they so wish to do so.  The only benefit they get is knowing they are part of something big.  Can I become an LN node the same way?  
**Question 2**: Will I be rewarded the same way?  As in, me knowing that I am part of something big?  Or are LN nodes rewarded in a different way?
**Question 3**: How do I become an LN node?
**Question 4**: Does this mean there will be 2 types of nodes?  LN nodes AND bitcoin-core nodes?
**Question 5**:  How do I test LN on the testnet, so I can try to become a value sender, a value receiver, and also an LN node, so I can see for myself how it works via real experience?  Just as I did in the early days of bitcoin-core when I used to mess around with bitcoin-codes scripting language just to see how it works in the background.

Conclusion, reddit.comis pro bch, the ticker for bitcoin-cash is bch, yet they call their sub-reddit btc.  Basically, they are attempting to confuse/trick people.  If I have got the wrong end of the stick, let me know.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:28:08
You are right, which is why I r/btc should be changed to r/bch because the official ticker for bitcoin-cash is bch.  And r/btc should become the sub reddit for bitcoin-code as btc is the ticker for bitcoin-core.  Why should they?  To basically avoid confusion as at the moment, it seems they are using confusion to try to make bitcoin-cash btc...  Maybe the word "deception" is more fitting?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:34:04


Yes, they can see how much bitcoin **IT** has, not how many bitcoins **YOU** have


That is anonymous, if you have your own public address, instead of using a centralized exchange like coinbase, no one will know who that public key belongs to, so it's anonymous.


That doesn't really make a difference, if you own 1 or all of the public keys, instead of having them on a centralized exchange, no one will know who they belong to, so it's anonymous.

1. Lend $1 to a friend, take $1.10 back (this is usury)
2. Buy $1 shares in a friends company, if company makes a profit, you as the $1 share holder are now entitled to some profit (not considered usury)
AFAIK,  is called usury according to muslims and  is not considered usury because no matter what happens to the debtor in  the debtor still has to give $1.10 back to the lender, which is considered unfair according to muslims. But in the shares example, the share owner shares the risk, so if the company loses profit, the share holder loses money, if the company profits, the share holder gets profits. This is considered fair according to muslims.

Why do I think capturing camera light is more secure than optical cable, because the optical cable is connected until plugged in, which is plenty of time to leave malware on the cold computer.  However, I doubt a camera on a hot computer can install anything on a cold computer simply by scanning an image generated on a cold computer...

It seems inflation isn't an exception for muslims.  If blossom's structure does not share the profits and the loses, that would apparently be an issue for muslims.

It's not a technology issue, it's a lack-of-knowledge issue on the users part.  I mean, if someone doesn't have enough knowledge on how to safe-guard bank notes, and just leaves their bank notes on their car's dash board, that car is going to get broken into and the bank notes will get stolen...  In such a case, is it an issue with the bank notes, or did those bank notes get stolen due to a persons lack-of-knowledge?  I'm hoping you're thinking "It's because of lack-of-knowledge".  Bitcoin is no different.  Emails are no different for that matter.

The fact that it's open source means that hundreds or thousands of people can check and do check the software.  Such checks are not possible with closed sourced software at all.
So if someone does try to add back doors to open source software, it won't take long before it's discovered and removed or re-branched.  Again, this is not possible with closed source software.
But you're right, the only way to be 100% sure is to do all the checking yourself.  Failing that, your second best open is to rely on the thousands of open source developers to do the checking.  The worst case option, which shouldn't even be an option, is Windows.

If apple wants to live in the past, let them be!

The average joe pays.  The difference is that the average joe doesn't pay the Internet Service Provider, the average joe pays other average joe's for setting up nodes to allow such a network to work.  In this case, to setup a node, you just boot into a livecd/usb and you have a node up and running...  The idea is absolutely beautiful IMO.  It also removes the ISP monopoly.

The problem with BitLocker is that it's closed source.  So if it had back doors coded into it, no one would know.  Also, if that was the case, if Microsoft fired an employee who wanted to get back at Microsoft (for whatever reason), what would stop him/her from exploiting that back door?  This, of-course assumes that back doors exist in Microsoft's stuff which no one knows.  And that's IS the main issue, BitLocker is closed source, so no one can know for sure, if it has back doors or not...
For security purposes, you should stay away from ALL closed source solutions.
How about using dm-crypt as it's FSF compliant?  Also, FSF were not happy with truecrypt's license, so truecrypt was never fully FSF compliant anyway.

Can this physical connection be removed and replaced with qr code and camera?  Where the cold computers camera scans in a hot qr code to sign, signs it, then returns another qr code so the hot computer can scan in the signed qr code to send off the transaction?
If this is possible, you've removed the physical connection altogether between the hot and cold computers, and as far as I know, hackers can't access a cold computer if their only route is a camera from a hot computer which scans a qr code.
To be honest, I think all that is needed is a cold computer with a camera and a screen, which scans in an unsigned qr code, signs it, and returns a signed qr code allowing any device with a camera to send off the transaction!!!

The media ultimately holds the power to force feed people ideas of what they should and shouldn't think.  So whoever controls the media are the ones with the power.  Which is why I have said many times, that decentralized media is more important than anything else decentralized.

My point was that, people believe what they see on TV.  IMO, TV influences what people think and feel.  So if the people who control TV want votes to go in a certain direction, voting systems, even decentralized voting systems are useless, as the result will still go in the direction the government wants, which it can easily achieve via the media, i.e. influence people via the media, then those people will vote how the government wants them to vote.

For example, if the following are in a decentralized type of database/blockchain: user adverts, user requests to buy/sell, user reputation, coin escrow, notifications of coin escrow funds, then when the user is ready to buy, s/he can meet face to face and do the transaction, or something else like do a wired bank transfer.

People just don't get it do they.  Decentralization is epic and it's the way forward.  
So basically if all internet users assigned 1GB to Storj, the combined storage would be about 2 EB (Exabytes), 2000 PB, 2,000,000 TB...

With such technology, it's possible to pay in real time based on the amount  of KB the average Joe is using.  That's if such technology decides to go that route.


If incentivized, then yes, if average Joe didn't pay, what is the incentive of setting up a node?  Nodes need hardware and cost electricity.  Without nodes, the network does not work.  However, at the moment, it's free, but nodes are few and far between, meaning that's most people can't use it yet.

This is almost perfect.  As always, the only thing which concerns me is the physical connection between the hot and cold computers, allowing hackers to access the cold computer via the hot computer.  I think this could be overcome by removing the connection between the 2 computers, and connecting them only via a camera to scan qr codes.  I think it is impossible to hack a cold computer if the only connection is a qr code read by a camera.
Personally, I would like to see such a device, which has no physical connection between the 2, and does not send emails out which contain the encrypted key.

Yes, you can use localbitcoin.com without leaving your house, or you can chose to leave your house too, up to you.  You can use many online payment methods to get bitcoins, i.e. you can wire transfer funds to someones account for example, and then localbitcoin releases bitcoin from their escrow.  The whole process takes about 5 minutes start to finish, i.e. logging in to localbitcoin.com, and receiving the bitcoins in your wallet, 5 minutes usually.

To have to go through 1000 of your bedroom nodes would be very un-optimized as a solution to the destination.  Such networks are normally able to find the route which involves the least amount of nodes.  So your idea of 1000 nodes in your bedroom wouldn't work to your advantage if the project is setup correctly.  i.e. to use the most optimum route with the least amount of nodes to connect through.


As a user of the system, you would pay (I would assume) the fees for sending the money.

The only true democracy is if the majority of media is decentralized and controlled by no one.  When such media exists, then a decentralized voting system would make sense.  But as long as the media is controlled by powerful organisations to advertise what they want people to think, all this is a waste of time IMO.
Modern day rulers are the people who control the media to influence the views of the masses.  Modern day slaves are the people who watch the media and are influenced by the media.

I'm hoping your private key was encrypted before it got to the mega servers?  Just because mega says they encrypt data, doesn't mean you should trust them.  Even if it wasn't them, and you didn't encrypt your private key before sending it to mega, it may have been intercepted on it's way to mega.

I just thought that there may be some advanced form of malware, spyware, virus which can reside in the ram even if the computer is rebooted into a livecd/usb.  Hence the removal of the battery and power cable at the start.  I don't know if such malware, spyware, viruses actually exist though.
However, even if such software existed, the computer would be offline, and the memory would be cleared when the process is near the end before the computer goes online, so I guess you're right, 3, 5, 6 may be over kill.

Out of about 7 or 8 billion people on the planet, at most only 21 million can possibly have a whole bitcoin.  Which I think means (if my calculations are correct), at minimum, 99.7%'ish of the planets human population will not be able to have 1 whole bitcoin.  Most people will be lucky to get 3000 satoshi's each.
Meaning that the future millionaire equivalent people may be the people who have 1 bitcoin or more...

Point 1 is still an obstacle/annoyance for me.  Instead of a work around such as borrow bitcoin from someone, or buy bitcoin first from somewhere else, the requirement for having bitcoin first needs to be removed and replaced with a better solution.  To be honest, I don't see why this requirement is needed when multisig technology exists and an arbitrator with good reputation can be used instead (a bit like how OpenBazaar does it), which in IMO is a far better way.  BitSquare has a long way to go before it becomes usable.

As in, create a side chain, and make use of bitcoins massive user-base to your own benefit.  Side chains allow you to freely move coins between the main-chain and your side-chain.
That means that you could create an entirely new block-chain and side-chain it to the bitcoin block-chain easily.  You would gain the security benefits of bitcoins proof-of-work, so you wouldn't need to bootstrap your own mining network.  You would also get people already invested in bitcoin as a base of potential users in your side chain, because they could just use the coins they already have.  Also, you would be able to send coins between the two chains without conversion necessary.

For anonymity, you can't use any centralized organisation, coinbase is a centralized organisation.  So more or less every exchange is out of the question if you want anonymity.  The only way I think anonymity can be achieved with bitcoin is if you buy/sell via P2P methods.  Face to face would be the most straight forward example.

Or you could buy P2P, instead of buying from a bitcoin exchange company.  That way you can ask the person you are buying bitcoin from to not mention bitcoin anywhere in the bank transfer.  Assuming you decide to buy P2P online where bank details are exchanged.

Any idea when the EFT will be available for all?
@_date: 2016-06-02 07:47:08
Point is, 2 scenarios:
1. Seller is happy to accept paper money deposited into his bank account.  Buyer is also happy with this because he does not have to give any bank details or ID.
2. Seller wants wired transfer into bank account, which means both sets of bank detail details are needed
IMO, the first method is 50% safer as a whole.  One less bank account detail means one less record to hack.  Now spread this across 2 billion people and the first method means 1 billion people do not have to reveal their bank account details and method 2 means 2 billion people have to reveal their bank details.  IMO, 1 billion bank account details not revealed is better.
If an odd person does tamper with a receipt, it will be just the odd person, instead of having an extra billion records to hack into.

My HODL'ings are up by 115%, so seems like an "investment" to me...
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:54:02
I agree with this 100%.
1. Rule number 1 for investments, only invest what you can afford to lose, i.e. if bitcoin was worthless tomorrow (which I highly doubt, this is just an example) and your dad says "never-mind son, here's another $10,000, learn from your previous mistakes and try again", then yes, invest in bitcoin.
2. Diversify,  ideally invest in an additional 3 different things outside of crypto-currencies, so I assume this means you will have another $30,000 to invest in other things to diversify your portfolio.  If not, then I would personally split the $10,000 into 4 different investments, to spread the risk.  In the past, no one ever imagined houses would collapse, but they did, and those with 100% invested in houses, were hit hard!
3. Read the book "The Richest Man in Babylon" before investing in anything.

I wanted to stay away from hardware wallets for 2 reasons, 1. the cost, and 2, i doubt the cheap ones are good at protection against unlikely solar-flairs and/or emp's.  Plus I don't think cheap hardware wallets are fire proof and water proof too.  Plus even with hardware wallets, I need to store the passphrase in multiple locations anyway most likely in paper form, which why not use paper form instead of a hardware wallet and a piece of paper in 3 locations?
In terms of the situation, I want to slowly by surely, transfer a large portion of my wealth to bitcoin for long term storage, with the hope of it being inherited in a will or for college in about 10 years for my child.  
I have a completely separate stash of bitcoin addresses for travelling purposes and day to day use, which I don't need to secure so much.

Okay, how about, I didn't lose 115% value by moving the value out of goat shit into bitcoin?  Is that more palatable for you?  And even if fiat is the equivalent of goat shit, goat shit is not worthless, goat shit has value, and even fiat has value, if it was worthless, I would not be able to buy anything with fiat.  So I agree that fiat and goat shit have similarities in terms of value, but I disagree that goat shit and fiat are worthless.  Chances in my view are high that goat shit will have more value that fiat eventually, but for now, fiat does have value.  I mean, your argument is so illogical, that if it was true, I would not be able to buy bitcoin with fiat, if fiat with worthless.  So for now, fiat has value.  The day when I am no longer able to buy bitcoin or anything else with fiat, I will agree with you and I will say, yes, fiat is worthless.

I'm as sure as I can be that it's a valid address.  The only thing is that it's an address to a fresh cold wallet.  So the change address does not exist on the hot wallet I am using, which is probably why it shows the warning next to the change address in screenshot 1.  The warning is understandable, but the change not getting sent to the cold wallet is confusing me.
I've not tested the same scenario with a custom change address being imported into the hot wallet before hand yet.

Another reason why I think it's good is because bitcoin is decentralized, and centralized exchanges add a centralized element to the ecosystem which can be controlled such as bans.  If China want to shoot themselves in the foot, best thing they can do is ban centralized exchanges.  Banning centralized exchanges will force bitcoin users to start using decentralized exchanges like bitsquare, mycelium, even openbazaar could be used as an exchange..  
I feel centralized exchanges are a major hindrance for bitcoin's true nature.  Also, centralized exchanges are about the only thing which can be banned.  So take them out of the equation, and there is not much left to ban in the bitcoin ecosystem.

This is because I am storing most of my bitcoin as long term storage, so I have no benefit to gain by using a hardware wallet.

I've been using Linux for 10 years, Linux driver issues have been rare, and usually fixable very quickly.  I guess others mileage varies, but its not been an issue for me.
Plus, yes I have used Windows 7 and Windows 10 and updates are horrifying compared to Linux updates which just work so beautifully and painlessly.  For me anyway.  I mean, as I don't play games, I can do everything on Linux, so no need for me to use less secure OS like Windows.
Main issue for me with Windows is the closed source.  So you as the user have no idea how secure or unsecure the OS is.  Especially if you're trying to generate secure bitcoin addresses.

What if Microsoft switched to a pay as you go license, so each day a tiny amount of bitcoin is taken from the person who uses their product?
That should nicely increase Microsoft's income instead of charging a 1 off fee for Microsoft Office for example.
No funds in your bitcoin address, no access to the software.  Top up your bitcoin address, and access the software....
Added benefit, the user does not have to fork out a large sum just to get started.  Also, in the long run, Microsoft will make more money...

Is that video telling the truth, that the "open" blockchain can do 7 transactions per second, which is over 600,000 transactions per day?
According to blockchain.info, it seems the open blockchain almost reached 280,000 transactions per day not too long ago, so it shouldn't run out of steam until that number is doubled.
If that is the case, why did the network slow down a few weeks/months ago?
I'm sure when the lightning network and segwit have been implemented, the number of transactions per second will increase, but aside from that, if that video is telling the truth and the open blockchain's maximum transactions per second is 7, which makes the daily limit 600,000+, what caused the slowdown in the past?

How?  If I am buying bitcoin, and the seller wants cash deposit.  I as the buyer take my physical paper notes to the bank, the bank does not ask me who I am, I ask the bank to deposit this money into the sellers account.  How can this possibly be reversed when the bank does not know who I am and I used physical paper notes?
You may be referring to a wire transfer?  When I said cash deposit, I meant physical paper money transfer, which is know as cash deposit where I live.  As in, hand to bank, not bank to bank.
@_date: 2016-05-26 08:06:27
Point taken, so the seller is not 100% protected, but paying by cash as the buyer, I feel the buyer is safe, as he is not known in a cash transaction (hand to bank), his bank account is not known, bitcoin can't be reversed without multisig etc, so at least this way the buyer is safe, even if the seller is not 100% safe.

The electrum application is software you have installed on your computer.  This means that you have full access to your bitcoin value directly on your own computer.
So, if the electrum guys disappear 1 day, you still have your bitcoin value on your computer, and you will be free to move your bitcoin value to another decentralized wallet such as bitcoin core.
This is because electrum is a decentralized wallet.  If it was a centralised wallet [which it is not], then you would have to worry about electrum "shutting down".  If you use centralized wallets such as circle.com, coinbase.com etc, then you would have to worry about your bitcoin value disappearing because with centralized companies shutting down, you can lose your bitcoin value.
As you are not using a centralized wallet to store your bitcoin value, you do not have to worry about electrum going " bankrupt".
Instead, you have to worry about keeping good backups in case your computer dies, which is not to difficult to do, and you have to worry about hackers/malware etc stealing your private key, which is a bit more complex.

Just because humans senses are limited, giving us the ability to see only a small percentage of what is out there, it's no surprise that human limited knowledge thinks "light" is the fastest thing.

Probably because of PayPal being forced to stop doing business with Mega.  Then Mega go and make a tweet about it saying "Let's give bitcoin a boost".

No it means you should not keep bitcoin on exchanges.  I normally remove my bitcoin from exchanges within 10 minutes.  If you do lots of trading on exchanges, then you should only keep small amounts there.
As soon as bitsquare get better buy options which do not involve banks, I will then have no need for centralized exchanges at all at that point.
@_date: 2016-05-19 09:35:17
I want to know this too.  At the moment, the only way I can check is `getnetworkinfo`, but that doesn't show me the flow of traffic in real time.  So unfortunately, I have to take `getnetworkinfo`'s word for it.  Unfortunately, I'm not the type who likes taking someone's or something's word for it.  I guess I have trust issues...  LONG LIVE `TRUSTLESS` TECHNOLOGY!
I have installed `iftop`, but I'm not sure how to tell if I am only using the `.onion` network when it comes to the `node`.

* Would this make Bitcoin worthless or more of an underground currency? Would be interested to hear your thoughts.
Worthless, I doubt it because the bank of England economists said it best, what makes bitcoin so special is that it is decentralized.  Banks and governments don't have a chance.  Anything the government tries to create will be a centralised currency which can't compete.
However, any attempts they make could make it more underground which is even more of a danger to the existence of government and banks.

Looks good as always, but how do you prevent a mcgox happening with this with your gold, as it's a centralized service?  Even if the multi-sigs are stored in different locations, that doesn't prevent a mcgox happening on the gold itself.

How will bitmesh prevent you from getting into a situation when someone has been allowing others to share your internet connection, where those people go to dodgy web sites like illegal drugs or child porn for example?
Police will think its you, I.e. the person who is providing their internet connection to be shared.

That analogy is not true at all.  I feel my analogy was much closer to reality.  If you don't believe me, just tell us your IP address, which is the equivalent of telling someone that you have fiat on your drive way, and the firewall can be the little white picket fence around your house, which really doesn't do much for security. ;)

Oh but it does effect you via inflation.  The more the bank loses, the more they need to create, the weaker the currency gets.  So not only do you lose out, 2 billion people using the banking system lose out...

Unfortunately, that is a downfall.  An exchange type of app (i.e. bitsquare) without a reputation system is bound to have problems attracting users.

Easily done, the majority of bitcoin users will use centralised exchanges which will allow a database to be built.  Not many bitcoin users understand how to remain anonymous and most can't be bothered.

Take your money out of that bank account and move to another bank account which doesn't have an issue with bitcoin.  Or, start using localbitcoin instead to buy your bitcoin.
That way, you get the satisfaction of telling the bank that you no longer need their crapoy service, instead of getting into a situation where your account has been blocked.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:07:29
It's possibly going to be very good.  But I assume it's extremely early stages as it has no reputation system and no cash in hand/mail/deposit options.  As soon as these options are implemented along with a decentralised reputation system, it could be amazing!  Until then, LocalBazaar is my only option.

I have no choice but to use localbitcoin until bitsquare implements options for cash in hand, cash by mail, and cash deposit options where you don't have to give your bank details. :)
Each time a new version of bitsquare is released, I check the release notes to see if those options have been added.  If I can't see the options in the release notes, I install it to double check, just incase the developers forgot to update the release notes!  So far, those options are not available.
