1. Dude - first and foremost... Wtf? How can you possibly believe that? 
2. Who are you to decide what is legitimate for the protocol's use and what is not? A transaction is a transaction is a transaction, pure and simple. Someone recently told me I shouldn't be using the blockchain to buy coffees and lunches because those are "Trash transactions."  No, that's not how it works. Everyone is equally free to participate. Full stop.

because they've painted themselves into a corner by opposing a scaling solution with a kitchen sink approach, which includes manufactured disaster around a hardfork. So if they forked for the things they want, but a fork was dangerous for the things they didn't want, the hypocrisy would be too apparent.
However, the element of "requiring consensus" to make scale, and then unilaterally implementing these changes...

Correct, with the grey area being the expected value of future spot price. So price may increase day over day as an effect of the halving simply because effect x likelihood of effect is increasing. Also, the cost of buying and holding now experiences more cost relative to buying in the future. 
So classic normal backwardation. I'm sure you're on the same page, but a lot of people here think that correlation is causation.

You're right on the general risk assessment, but this is absolutely chicken little:


Systems are dynamic; markets are dynamic. I'm all for increasing the blocksize, but the people who want to keep it at 1MB intend to do so as a settlement layer; i.e. it isn't supposed to keep up with every single transaction, and more layers are built over that.

That's true. And core will be routed around. That's the beauty of btc. But it's obstructionary and painful for the market. 
As for other parameters - it's a disingenuous question. I'd hope we don't need to address money supply, and the market can certainly determine the remainder of those parameters. However, the market has overwhelming consensus on all those topics. The only area where consensus does not exist is in the limit to the blocksize debate. However, as you said, the overwhelming majority does agree and will fork around core in this regard, either with bitcoin unlimited or something else

Because that's monetary base. A lot of the money has basically sat in banks, or it has unevenly inflated the equity markets. While obviously related and causal in the long term, money supply does not equal inflation.
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:34:04
Money supply is inflating money value is deflating. Economic professionals typically refer to money changes in terms of volume or supply, which is discrete and usually measurable. It's done of course to calculate what matters, money value. But that is a derivative value and conversations surrounding monetary behavior revolve around inflating supply

1. I've been reading for 3 years dude, way longer than i was even a redditor. In fact, it's why i got on reddit. Does that make me an "other?" did i become an "other?"
2. To that point, it hasn't been coopted by "others" - and how would you define others? New bitcoiners? Bitcoiners with opnions different than yours? Any definition you provide is going to be rife with subjective judgement and fuel censorship and corruption. A person is a person, no matter how small. 
2. How would you define propaganda? Same conversation as above. I suppose my words are propaganda as defined by 3. "an opinion backed with evidence is worth more." Of course, all would agree! That's why people don't respect another person that says dumb shit, like anti-vaccers and the like. Your very point that i quoted is what drives a meritocracy - people with convincing opinions and supportive evidence develop more support. Each vote is worth one vote, and those votes agglomerate to the most convincing position. That IS meritocracy. I can't even believe I'm having an argument about whether 1 vote should really be worth 1 vote in a democratic context. It's making my head spin.
4. The irony on brigading - many users (over 100 regarding have voiced support for a particular position. The thread was then "brigaded," internally, however you'd like to call it - a group of people who run banded together to shut down the dialog and make sure that only their position was visible. Call it whatever you like, but the claim that the thread has been "brigaded" is absurd until mods "brigaded" it.  
5. It is beyond your, or mine, or anyone else's position to censor dialog here. More importantly, it is a basic tenent of productive dialog, otherwise the dialog becomes worthless. Garbage in, garbage out. 
5. You miss the entire point that this censorship is counterproductive to the very mission that has come to espouse. If mods want to push a particular agenda (which i think is wrong), they would be better served by having an open discussion, being transparent, and respecting the people involved in the conversation. The current approach mods are taking to push their position is just hurting them.

Yup, that's the ultimate solution. Bip 101 just kicks the can down the road (although it does solve the problem for a while, and has been very successful in bringing the issue to light in the community).
Bitcoin unlimited, which is another implementation like QT and XT, was just released today: 
I asked where it stood in terms of testing and analysis, and here is what I got:




Analysis: I will post a white paper analysing the current bitcoin network's transaction throughput and projecting it into larger blocks soon. Meanwhile Peter_R's fee market paper also addresses the topic.
So there absolutely are people out there working to solve the problem, and to do it in a scaleable, dynamic way. I'd link you to the subreddit, but this bitcoin sub bans people for discussing or linking them (which is why they exist)

**"Big changes" according to lawsky**
1. No prior approval for non-material changes necessary. However, if a firm is licensed as a wallet service and begins to operate as an exchange service for example, that constitutes a material change.
2. No regulation of software developers; regulation will only apply to entities holding assets. 
3. No requirement for duplicative applications for a bitlicense and money transmitter license. Firms will have access to a one-stop-shop submission of information.
4. Companies that already file suspicious activity reports with entities like FINCEN do not need to duplicate reports, as DFS already has access to those reports. 
5. Companies do not need approval to raise money for a new round of funding unless they are acting as a "control person," i.e. an activist board member or investor. 
**Q&amp;A Period with Lawsky**
Q: "Do you think AML/KYC are hurting underserved customers?" 
A: "IDK. We need to have AML/KYC. We just do. But we don't want to see people de-risking in a way that restricts access to the most impoverished and underserved consumers. I don't have an answer. It's really hard."
Q: "What metrics will the DFS use to consider regulatory effectiveness? What studies are planned?" 
A: "I'm leaving so I don't know. We don't have any metrics or studies planned. We're going to see who comes in to get the bitlicense and how well they perform. If companies come in and thrive, and are safe, that means we've done our job. And that is our job - to keep these companies safe." (I vomited at this part)
Q: "Is the idea that a charter would allow people to operate nationwide, and the license approves NY state operation?" A: "Yes, unless another state has a problem with that. We are going to coordinate with other states and already have. Our plan is that other states will want to feel comfortable allowing entities to operate if they have a bitlicense."

Yeah man. Your opinion is no more or less valid than anyone else's. Open source, decentralization, equality, consensus, all those values are the antithesis of management of dialog here.
The most insulting element is that these things are done without transparency, although i suppose it's to be expected. 
I think the most important note that mods and supporters of censorship on should take away from these experiences is that their work is counterproductive. The actions they take alienate people who want to learn, and create antagonism against the very specific elements of the platform they argue for.
On a higher level, there is only so much that you can do as the leader of an group. I was the exec operator on a ~60 person organization for about 2 years a while ago, and I had my own grand plans for a vision and path to execute on it. However, it ultimately wasn't up to me - it was up to the entire organization. Things didn't go exactly the way i wanted, but making things go the way I wanted wasn't my job. Managing the organization was my job. I couldn't use my position of power to push people - first, because it was counterproductive, and secondly, i found it morally repugnant. 
As a leader, all you can do to advance your mission is to garner the trust and respect of the people who surround you. It is then up to you, as a leader, to make your arguments for your own opinion, and respect the democratic process and the sovereignty of each individual, as any individual person, even you yourself as the director, is only worth a single vote. In maintaining your credibility, your opinion will naturally be more heavily weighted by the remainder of the group. It's just basic leadership practice and human interaction 101
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:43:33

A handful of people will tell you that it increases centralization of mining. Many people would tell you that's it's because certain private startups providing sidechain solutions, which have hired bitcoin core devs, would lose their business model.

Well, in general, small blocks are bad for miner business. But you're right, there is a game theory element and whether they are acting in their interest of short vs. long term profits. In terms of revenues today, miners benefit from increased TX fees. In aggregate and over time though, their profits depend on transaction volume for 2 reasons:
1. tx fees: 0.1% net TX fees on 50,000 users is still more money than 3% fee market on 1,000. Regardless of where the equilibrium point is, there's still money to be made from scale, but the far more important point is...
2. Block reward: Block rewards will remain low if BTC value remains low. BTC value will only rise as its utility does, and a for a plethora of obvious reasons, limiting both the userbase and monetary velocity of a currency is a serious blow to the value of bitcoin. Small blocks are essentially creating a race to the bottom to squeeze out miners. 
Miners want big blocks for these reasons. So if everyone is just acting to squeeze out more money in the next hour, I'd agree with you. But I'd bet that they make longer term decisions to operate for the long term.

0.1% TX fees for 50,000 users is more money than 3% fees for 1,000 users.
From another perspective, artificially limiting currency velocity has just never been done before, and absolutely doesn't work in a fixed money supply environment. MV = PQ where v is capped and m is growing at a declining rate.  
The math and economics indicate bigger blocks, the miners want bigger blocks, the users want big blocks, and the non-users who will never have a chance to adopt without bigger blocks want them too. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:41:00
I mean we're really in uncharted territory here. The point you make is certainly a good one, but it's foolish to be dogmatic about it.
You can just as easily think about bitcoin's blockchain value as the demand by a market for a decentralized software product, i.e. a tech company. 
At the end of the day, everything (including money) is just a product. Money isn't special - it's just a tech product that happens to be monopolized in large part by the government. Whether those products are centralized or decentralized does not affect their value. It's up to us to find appropriate and prudent metrics to make those comparisons apples to apples
@_date: 2015-12-29 04:02:50
It's not as bad as you might think. There are other venues which i won't link to for fear of being banned, but a /r/ - followed by a common abbreviation of bitcoin is a very popular one now.
As for decentralization, the best you can do is to run a node. Participate and pick one up - unlimited, QT, XT, whatever. Just pick an implementation of bitcoin that you like and run it.

Bingo - you've nailed it. The block size should be as large as the technology allows, not as large as an arbitrary, artificial limit that was set years ago as a temporary stopgap, which has been perpetuated to drive the business models of off-chain service providers.

I wonder what the percentage of bitcoin users who entered since the last bubble is. 
From my perspective, this is just another readjustment. Anyone that bought in during the bubble is just in the wrong. Excusably so, but that's not my problem. I'm like 3+ years in now and certainly have not experienced a negative savings rate. It's all perspective.
But my point is, if you're hoping that central banks won't devalue your currency, you are 100% wrong. BTC has ups and downs, but mostly ups.

@_date: 2015-12-26 14:09:33
- would you be open to add a note about how bitcoin is a protocol, and multiple teams have developed many implementations of that protocol? Then you could get into specifics about those implementations. Nothing technical, but a basic market overview. Percentages of node share and miner user etc. could be good too, i.e. QT is like 95% of nodes, XT has a few, unlimited has a handful. 
The way this reads right now is that bitcoin is a monolithic entity, but Peter Todd made an interesting comment the other day that he wanted to see more work from multiple teams offering varying implementations to decentralized development.

i also disagree with myself. They do have a lot of cash on hand because that's how the economy works - the greeks have stacks of bills. They're just limited in their withdrawals currently. The immediate fear is a bank run.
The longer term fear is capital devaluation, which is why you also can't take cash out of the country.
@_date: 2015-12-25 03:56:24
Wait for the irony.... 
A market solution! Allow the market to determine what an efficient block size is based on available bandwidth to the network, and demand for space in blocks. We can all agree that markets are more efficient than central planning (which is why we're here and not using fiat), and the same rules apply. 
A market solution to the blocksize debate is better than an oligarchal politburo selecting it. For even IF there was no principal agent conflict and core devs were acting in good faith, they simply are not able to retain and process all the information available to an entire market. That's efficient markets 101.
So the answer is bitcoin unlimited - an implementation of dynamic block sizes based on demand and supply.  
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:48:04
your latter point is correct. They intend for it to be a settlement layer over xyz transaction layers; assuming that "big banks" would remain the only players and that the competitive landscape would not change is likely not correct. BTC would be a root layer that a processor may update once a day, or something like that over transaction protocols. 
Again, I don't think it's a good idea from my informed but non-technical perspective. I'm just explaining that it's not insane. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:24:20
Why should banks be mining though? They don't mine gold. They don't build cars. Banks are capital and market intelligence specialists; they apply capital to assets. They don't make the shit, they buy it and sell it.
Unless banks have a significant comp advantage to mine (i wouldn't consider scale a comp advantage), why would they? More to the point, why would they bother from an operational perspective? This just seems hyperbolic and therefore annoying
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:21:38
i'm not sure if you fully realize how insane this is, but banks haven't printed their own money for over 100 years, and if they did so it would have had disastrous consequences.

Bitcoin QT devs don't support this use or functionality of the blockchain - I'm sure they can swing my and offer more commentary. I believe Greg maxwell recently said that they do not support any data application of bitcoin. Short of being able to actually block these transactions (because a transaction is a transaction), they are just keeping blocksize low to prevent people from using it.

1. stable is a relative concept. Bitcoin is unstable relative to the USD. It is stable relative to many 3rd world currencies. And that is appreciation-agnostic. Most people won't be complaining when 
2. Their currency tends to appreciate, even when they do need to compensate for volatility. So if your choices are [the kenyan shilling]( and bitcoin, then volatility is equal and you may want to pick the one headed up

Oh wow that's dope. Sorry i was talking US. Banks printed money from 1836(?) to 1864, then on a more regulated basis until 1913. 
All banks don't create money out of thin air though. Fractional reserve banking isn't creating new money, it's just fractional reserves. That's like saying I "created money" because i bought BTC on margin. I can assure you my margin debt is still very real.
Unless you want to say that creating value is creating money, but i would not want to say that

Sure, that's why i said opaque. but regardless of whether BTC are bought and sold OTC or publicly, it affects the other side. 
Coins that are processed by bitpay, for example, could be sold on markets, driving down the public market price and increasing the OTC rate. Arbitrage would then occur. What happens currently, processors sell OTC, driving down the OTC rate and restraining public market supply.

He and Donald trump are essentially the same candidate. Both are achieving success by delivering populist, totalitarian solutions to oversimplified problems. They reach people who are tired of the status quo and nepotism. They have succeeded in the world of social media and reality TV, whereas traditional candidates are stuck to traditional media outlet. The soundbites are easy to understand for their masses (occupy Wallstreet millenials and xenophobic blue collar workers respectively) without letting facts get in the way. In reality, the solutions are ham fisted and uneducated, but that is exactly what appeals to their supporters for their simplicity and clarity.

First of all, that's completely wrong. It's now sort by new.
Secondly, it's an entirely different context.
There's basically one thread in BTC markets every day that gets any action, and that's the daily thread. There are usually about 200 - 1000 comments on the daily thread depending on the volatility of the day, and everyone is posting pictures of their charts every 3 seconds.
 
There was a period of days or weeks where people would bitch about scrolling through posts when it was "sorted by best". Then mods changed it to "sort by new," and people were disappointed that really good posts were not given priority. Then one day they said fuck it, and tried "controversial," which nobody liked. So they went back to "New" and have stuck with it. 
But the point was that it was just to deal with a shit ton of post volume in a single thread every day. Not to censor a particular viewpoint.

MV = MC
marginal value = marginal cost
What you said is just wrong. There is no supply side or demand side economics. It's just both. Demand and supply both affect price. 
If someone comes out with a new mining tech innovation that reduces mining costs, gold or bitcoin, price will fall, **even while supply is fixed. This is why MV = MC.** The current cost of mining is around $590. If someone created a new rig that allows the user to mine for $200/coin, then they can undercut and flood the market at $400/coin and still make a massive profit. Supply is the same, demand is the same, and prices fell.
There are millions of other mining dynamics out there, but at the end of the day,
MR = MV = MC

Seriously dude - VCs and PE and techies are on it. That's where 95% of the money and probably 80% of the dev is. Bear in mind too, a lot of the dev that indie players do is basically just filler fluff that will be superceded by real products build in VCs and incubators. the average person on r/bitcoin can't differentiate between a bit from a byte.
r/bitcoin is hardly a bastion of bitcoin warrior missionaries and most people have nothing to contribute. OPs advice is good - let the engines of industry build the market and everyone else just needs to chill out.

Probably not, if anything it will drive up price. Mining cost will increase, while demand remains stable, meaning that price goes up.

Fair enough, but a supply of a competing source of value would decrease demand for bitcoin... I understand why ethereum, ripple, etc. can be attractive because they build off the basic BTC foundation... but so do BTC-lite alternatives like zerocoin and peercoin. At some point, consumers will substitute these products for BTC, driving down BTC price. Correct me if i'm wrong?

1. 7% over 3 days, not a year. That's extremely severe 
2. I bear the BTC volatility in exchange for its value growth and accept it. People hold dollars and rubles for low growth / high stability

you know that shit accumulates right? The dollar has lost 98% of its value in 100 years. If you just kept your money in a bank account it would have figuratively turned to dust.
In 2025, at mild 2% inflation, 20% of your money will magically disappear if left in a bank account. Odds are that 2% grows. 2% is also what's reported by the government. If i was skimming off the top where i worked, would i put it in the 10k?

I agree - I think the the progress of BTC adoption (obviously with overlap) is as follows:
1. Exotic Investment
2. Remittance
3. Institutional Investment
4. Retail Financial Investment
5. Currency
You're the ones that are making progress happen! Right now, BTC is a poor short-term currency, and institutional (and therefore retail) investors can't access the market. Remittances are where BTC's greatest comp. advantages lie, i believe

A few people who know I have btc enjoy sending me the "worst investment of 2014" articles. I just laugh with them and agree that it has been a rough year for price. These people aren't going to change their minds, they're looking for bias confirmation. They don't care that btc was way over inflated in the first place, that there was only a week or 2 at those prices, that the DOW crashed 55% in 09, that btc fell 90% in 11, or the amount of infrastructure development in the past year. 
They just want to feel safe in the old ways at your expense. The joke is on them, whether it's in a few months or 2 years. Just be patient. Let your bank account do the talking.

I don't know if that number is true or not, but it doesn't matter. It's about the capabilities, not the current structure. At one point the internet was run on 6 computers - are you saying that increased centralization of knowledge?


False. Most of the world has cell phone access at this point. The homeless in america have it. Kenya has one of the highest rates of phone ownership and telecom infrastructure in the world. People DO have access to telephones and information - they don't have access to banking infrastructure, so they have to pay a premium to manage their money. Bitcoin fixes this with existing infrastructure.


true, but the point is that it shifts wealth toward the poor by cutting out margin to now unnecessary services (banks) and frees them from government theft (inflation)

TL;DR: chinese like BTC technology, fast follower innovation, and investment opportunity. However, BTC allows nationals to move money out of the country, which the chinese government hates. It's nothing specific against BTC, it's any tech that disintermediates the govt. 
China supports innovation and liquid international tech markets based on the labor market's comparative advantages. It's easy for them to copy competing products with a (relatively) highly skilled workforce and make improvements from there. For example, the chinese exchanges are 0% fees with a withdrawal charge, whereas other exchanges have trade fees. 
There are also some hardware features that make china attractive, like cheap electronics and cheap electricity to make mining in china attractive.
In short, the chinese labor market is all about jumping onto stuff like bitcoin, and the political sphere is more than happy to encourage that.
However, bitcoin is also risky because it creates a method of capital flight out of China. The country strictly controls the transfer of money out of the country and makes an effort to prevent it. One of the old-school ways was to take your millions to macau, buy some chips, then cash out for USD. Bitcoin changes all that and allows the flood of renminbi out of the country.
So you have this wobbling effect; the govt. wants to prevent capital flight and will crush bitcoin in the process simply because they don't care. But the gov't also doesn't fundamentally dislike BTC either. They just don't want citizens using it to take money out of the country.

Not really. Bankers don't take it seriously, by and large. A few fringes see its potential and its threat, but most bankers feel comfortable in their position and will still laugh a  your " bs monopoly money."
Remember that banks are run by 40-50 year olds and 22 year old analysts, all of whom are about as creative and forward thinking a  an old shoe. Most found success by conforming and working long hours for years with their heads down. A few prop traders and adventurous analysts have probably gotten into it, but there's nothing institutional. Banks are a place where sticking your out is inventing a chopping block. It may be bandied about by remittance guys and a few strategists, but it's not going to hold water with most partners or end up affecting broader operation.
I don't disagree with your fundamentals, but the day your average analyst/associate/vp takes bitcoin seriously, let alone perceive it as a threat, is not here yet.
Edit: I think the point you raise about IT is key. Finance and tech are increasingly inseparable, ans banks have avoided IT infrastructure investment for years, to say nothing of security. It's all about patching together to pump the next  quarter, not running a good company. Short $4k goals are easier and hey, all those people will be somewhere else in 3 years anyway so fuck the long term. Banks follow the old paradigm, and no one at a bank found success  any other way.

The idea is that there is a risk-reward curve. If you're a long term, young investor, you're best off with a high risk portfolio because you earn more for the volatility. As you get older, you shift toward lower but more stable earnings, like fixed income.

Thank you. So then....  Mv=pq holds according to you.  It's just another currency. It's better, but I'm not spouting off about discovering a new life form like It's the same thing and economic fundamentals still apply. 
You're also off on a few points. 
1. As you said, m is still inflating at a fixed rate, so it can't be a constant. the derivative is fixed, but not M. 
2. Regarding the velocity of money, hypotheticals are irrelevant. V defines how quickly one unit moves from one individual to the next. Infinity certainly isn't a constant, that obviously also fucks up the entire equation. Bitcoins are transferred at some average rate, defining velocity. I shouldn't have to tell you that bitcoins don't instantly all transfer to new people instantly constantly.
So it's still mv=pq.

I had a thought as i was falling asleep last night - imagine politicians treated their job as a job, not an eating contest.
Politicians are always busy, but rarely working. Going to fundraisers, rallies, town hall meetings and industry associations to show face time and make connections. They spend all their time campaigning, and then what happens when they get elected? They don't know jack shit about 90% of the things that they vote on. They vote based on political allegiance and assumed knowledge of the subject matter regardless of reality. 
Imagine if they worked like we did. Imagine a rep or a senator said, "i'm going to be elected on my performance. I'm not going to waste time campaigning. My job is to vote, and I must be educated to vote. I'm going to work 8-10 hours per day, and I will run my job like a job. I have a team of 20 people working for me. We will read and parse through every inch of text that we vote on. We will bring in specialists to cover various industries. If i am voting on environmental legislation, I will commission an independent environmental report on XYZ. If i am voting on the frank-dodd act, I will pour over financial service practices, revenue generation, go to market strategies, and what exactly caused the breakdown. Not just voting along the issues that CNN and MSNBC report. My job is to be educated about the material on which i vote."
From there, politicians would become manager-academics. Whoever can understand the material best and represent their populace would remain in. It's just a pipe dream.

It's hardly draconian... I'm as strong a believer in efficient markets as you'll find, but be pragmatic. The reality is that the *perception* of sufficient regulation is absolutely necessary to accomplish 2 goals:
1. Institutional adoption: Any sort of fucking rules so that all companies reduce risk, both compliance and competitively. Do I think it's the best thing in the world for innovation? and growth? Of course not, but it's hardly restricting either. 
2. Consumer adoption: The perception that btc is now a legitimate financial asset. Ask a typical person, and they will still tell you btc is for criminals, as insane as that is. It doesn't fucking matter if the license is just a gold sticker (which is what most of them are anyway), people trust that.

@_date: 2014-05-16 13:24:15
Basically what i'm hearing is that institutional finance remains drearily uneducated about bitcoin.
A few things:
1. Yes, agreed. I also hate the word optics. But yes, the unit of account does need to change, and it also will. probably to mBTC or something smaller. It's a framing/behavioral thing, and would probably do a lot to increase money velocity as well. It idicates a bigger problem though that people have no idea how this stuff works; 80% of my friends that ask me about buying BTC say, "yeah, but i don't wanna spend $450!" People seem to have no idea that it's divisible. So while I agree with you, there are bigger issues. Not sure how to deal with it.
2. Sounds like you're new, maybe first started seriously learning about this stuff around nov. or december or even later. Volume isn't declining, it's growing. Sure volume is declining following a period of high volume and high volatility, but fama/french demonstrate that happens in every market. Volume and price have been falling over the past 6 months in a bear market. You should be smart enough to recognize that, but this is just another indicator that inst finance is woefully uneducated about this stuff. Link here to volume over past 2 years. 
3. Again, sounds like you spent about 5 seconds thinking about this shit. Use your brain. First, ecommerce is taking share from brick and mortar retail. I'm not sure on this but i believe that brick and mortar has thinner margins relative to most ecommerce, so they're actually MORE attracted to eliminating transaction fees. Having said that, transaction fees might be a larger overall percentage of ecommerce costs. Anyway, my point is, btc is attractive to both market segments, and having some stupid pissing argument about which arbitrary segment will adopt first is useless.
4. Yes correct, and all early stage assets are highly volatile and offer high ROI. That's just science. Speaking fundamentally, as the market develops, capitalization grows, so single actors are less able to drive price volatility. More financial products will be available, so as trading desks and funds fit BTC into long and short positions in their portfolios, putting money on both sides. In addition, derivatives will add liquidity and make the market more efficient by adding opportunities for arbitrage. 
5. you sound like a non-quant nerd that didn't study econ, but ended up in finance from a large and probably well respected, but not top tier school. This is just a shot in the dark.  
6. Your point 6 is entirely true, and there's nothing wrong with that. Banks are rent seeking, just like all of us, but BTC forces them to be more competitive by reducing barriers to entry. On the other hand, PE are are always the grenadiers that are the first to blast their way in. Banks are slow moving bureaucracies and VC just doesn't generate *that much* investment. PE has the least restrictions and will always be able to pour their assets into high expected value enterprises surrounding BTC.

These companies are all one trick ponies - offer lower fees by bundling charges. ITunes has been doing it for years. 
Except it doesn't usually end up working that way. Margins are razor-thin (1%) and struggle to support the company's capital structure. 
Then the company provides various fee structures to the merchant that may look good, but aren't. 
I know that Levelup, in boston, is being dropped by merchants because they experience higher fees when they expected lower ones.

i love btc, but it can't be better than venmo. Venmo allows you to charge or pay friends, and it's all 100% free as long as you use a bank account.
Basically, you carry an account. Venmo manages accounts between friends and never actually transfers the money unless you request to withdraw (which is free at any time, or 3% with a cc or debit card). 
This is where bitcoin has the advantage (in credit card fees), but the structure for splitting bills is already much more developed outside the BTC ecosystem

here's a followup quote from some posts that popped up about it. I think you're getting lost in the technical weeds and may not have a totally clear understanding of the economic and structural fundamentals of money and of BTC
"So, to be abundantly and perhaps pedantically clear, Nasdaq’s platform will trade shares by trading bitcoins. This is not blockchain-technology standing alone, this is Bitcoin being used by Wall Street. It is technically impossible to use Bitcoin’s blockchain without holding and transacting in bitcoins. In this case, Nasdaq is using Bitcoin’s blockchain, so they are using Bitcoin, not just “the technology behind Bitcoin.”

Look at this [snake oil]( The market crashed 55% in a year. This isn't a natural business cycle where assets are over or under investment as a result of inefficient capital allocation. 
No, this is a signal that past results represent future returns. The dow crashed 55% in 2008, I can only assume that it's continued on that trajectory based on that information. Equity markets are a sham. Corporate equity is a meaningless commodity that holds no value. 
The worst thing you could do is invest in an asset following a crash. In the most recent index peg, the market only rose 3x and grew well beyond its post bubble peak. Why would anyone want to take advantage of an oversold asset and generate massive profit?

But I dont think it was ever meant to go that high. Karpeles made a couple bots called the willy bot and something else. those bought and sold bitcoins, he lost control of them and they artificially jacked up the price on Mt. Gox.
With Mt. Gox being the biggest exchange, it artificially drove up the demand on other exchanges. Mt. Gox was always about $100 or more above everyone else. And I bet greedy investors were sending money out of the other exchanges and sending them to mt. gox trying to profit off that arbitrage.
Well, we all know the meaning behind, "don't get gox'd"
So its my theory that bitcoin was never supposed to climb that high, that fast. And the price probably should of just stayed around 200-250 for the last year or so. And it might finally be reaching equilibrium with supply and demand.
When the halving happens and continents like south America, Africa and asia wake up to this technology. Expect big things to happen with the price. Until then, expect a drop as low as $190 and hodl tight.](

I completely agree. What i wonder is, can bitcoin stay ahead of these comps by incorporating the same changes? It's like IBM acting as a fast second to all competitors. BTC incorporates the same benefits and also maintains the greater network value, so BTC evolves and retains value.
I'm wondering if that is reasonable, or another coin will overcome the network effect (theoretically new development &gt;_ network effect, with high velocity)

Remember that things we/I take for granted as part of the financial system are actually brand new innovations.
1. ETFs: While i scratch my head as to why everyone doesn't park in ETFs, I fail to remember that ETFs didn't even exist until 1990. 
2. Interest Rate Swaps: didn't exist until 1982ish, leading me to 
3. Credit-default swaps: WTF? These things didn't exist until the mid 2000's? What were people doing before then? Just not selling debt like chumps? Might as well deposit it in a savings account, that's worthless. 
4. Black-Scholes model didn't even EXIST until 1973. Imagine relying on candles and whale blubber until the lightbulb was invented - that was what the black scholes model did.
Anyway, all this shit that was really revolutionary at the time is quickly commoditized and executed against. Bitcoin won't be recognizeable in a few years

While i don't own 3,000+ BTC, i am quite knowledgeable about the ecosystem. I'm not sure why you would restrain yourself to something that sounds like a vanilla btc hedge fund when the entire point of BTC is its disruptive ability. 
If you are restraining yourself to wealth management services, the number one product in demand right now is a crypto-ETF. I could care less about the Winklevoss ETF or any other bitcoin ETFs. Subdividing and providing certificates may or may not add value, but it's definitely one of the worst ways to do so.
You're clearly a smart guy who doesn't need a lecture from someone younger than you on sales. However, just think to yourself, how do i hedge out BTC risk? What are the primary risk factors? 
1. A similar cryptocurrency supercedes BTC. It's inevitable, but a little bit more difficult to model because the value is 100% network-effect based. Regardless, the point is that you're not using altavista anymore even though it was once dominant. I'm manually hedging by buying all these cryptos that i think are attractive (there are a few) for the added functionality and diversification they offer. Make a product that I can buy that does this automatically. Just as I can log onto fidelity and choose from different ETFs with different risk exposures, so too could people do that with cryptos, especially given how hot managed ETFs have become in the past couple years. Happy to talk more in depth if you'd like.
2. Government seizure (including taxes). No good solutions here yet.
Obviously financial products and derivatives will be extremely valuable, not to mention beneficial in the long-term by making the market more efficient. It sounds like you're onto that trail.

Great article. I see 2 things happening: 
1. Current volumes cannot accommodate institutional investors on a large basis
2. Slow moving culture - A) associates "have to" criticize BTC because they're fully invested in the existing infrastructure. There is some cognitive dissonance unless they shut out BTC because they just slaved away for 2-3 years as an analyst at the bank. B) That culture moves upward and only becomes more entrenched. You see that VP comment or whomever saying that he's "not ready to have that conversation with the board yet."
There are a few comments i don't get, like inability to leverage. What? Every business has a revolver - it's not like you need that much money to move the BTC market or that a bank would allow much to be allocated in the first place. You can construct your own leverage easily. Plus exchanges do offer some margin. I think a lot of the hesitancy is compliance-related, which the author doesn't mention.
BTC cap is too small to be useful to most institutional investors, and most don't take it seriously. This isn't concerning in my perspective - it's a network, and the more market cap grows, the faster it grows. Remittances and traders will take off, and the rest of the money will follow.

Leave the regulation and just subsidize "block chain technology" so the licensing is free. Cali government might as well blow a couple hundred thousand for a huge early investment boom. The state wins and looks friendly to tech and benefits from the Commerce. The startups win with a bit of a better deal. The public wins.

Nah ok it's honestly really simple - you're making this into some complex dynamic when it's not. The colored coins sit atop the blockchain. Nasdaq uses btc as far as we're concerned. It's just like the COIN ETF or coinbase expanding service to the uk: it increases the size of the btc economy. 
For an ELI 15 answer, there's a really formative econ equation, MV=PQ. M is the money supply, v is the velocity at which money changes hands, p is price, and q is the quantity value of all transactions served by the money. Q is increasing by colored coin adoption. Each bitcoin is now serving a much larger pie because they're being used for more and more things. Either they will have to fly around faster (increase velocity) or price will rise. 
I'm not sure what most of your post is about. Bitcoin was used as an investment tool and as a remittance tool, now it is also being used as an accounting tool. 
Regardless of how bitcoins are used, the mining dynamics are stable.

Sweet thanks for explaining that. Basically it's just a bureaucracy, and inefficiency swells with size.
I still wouldn't be surprised if there are some innovative 3rd party outsourced solutions in the future. Companies can pay external service providers to mine data on on the blockchain and prepare it, which wouldn't violate privacy because it's all anonymous. The banks can then match those red flags of wallet numbers with users etc. These 3rd party providers benefit from scale, but otherwise homogenous competition (everyone can access the blockchain). 
I'm just spitballing, but I don't think that old compliance procedures need to be applied to new protocol.

Agreed entirely, but these assets should eventually substitute for classical BTC. I hold BTC and at some point, colored coins (just like people pay to hold licenses today) and evolutions of the protocol will create better currency units than bitcoin. At that point, price declines as does my ROI. I don't disagree with you at all except that bitcoin will eventually disappear in your example, even if it just gradually fades away. 
The alternative is that these changes are made in the actual BTC ecosystem, so that increased value is priced into BTC holdings.

You know it's not binary though right? 1st world investors (who hold the vast majority of wealth) will have a larger impact on BTC when they have access to tools like ETFs where they can allocate their funds. These are the people who hold most of the world's money, and BTC market cap growth will come from their investment.
Then there is the entire payment / remittance solution, which works equally well in developed and developing countries.
Then the developing world specifically: it provides access to financial infrastructure where none existed previously. The point you make is a good one too; it provides access to a stable* asset where none existed previously.
BTC provides many solutions to many people. The developing world will be a great moral victory and long-term growth driver. But in the next 5 years, growth will be driven by the US, not the developing world. While the developing world will demonstrate a much higher growth rate, it will not provide much net BTC growth in the near term.

@_date: 2014-09-15 10:35:21
I had the same thought.
1. you need to conform to succeed (pulling you toward the existing system and away from bitcoin)
2. Cognitive dissonance - when i've burned 2, 5, 10 years of my life in a shallow grave that is working at a bank, i need to justify or rationalize that. From that perspective, BTC is a threat to my job and renders those wasted years meaningless. I need my banking job to mean something.
Obviously i don't think those two points are "correct," just how people think about them. There's plenty of space for banks to adopt BTC and coexist very happily, and dare i say bring a lot more profitability as well through remittances and trading.

@_date: 2015-01-09 15:45:25
right. disclaimer - $12MM / BTC is retarded. but fundamentally,
Market penetration: % of market that uses the good (binary). 
Market share: average of % use of each good in the market.
Take coffee for example. Market penetration in the US is probably 95% (the number of people that have consumed coffee this year, ever, etc.). Market share is much lower; it depends how you're defining the market, but some people are heavy coffee drinkers; when the whole US is aggregated, coffee may be 30% of all non alcoholic drinks by volume, even though 95% of the market drinks it.
So my point is: you could take the numbers above and change it from coffee to BTC in the currency market. Maybe everyone will start using it in a minority of cases, but it's not saturated from a market perspective, because market share can still grow.

Volatility doesn't matter for investment or remittances, it does for currency. Volatility only declines once there are more $ in the btc ecosystem via demand, raising market cap. This creates liquidity. Only then will volatility decline and btc can be used for currency.

He answer is a clear, unequivocal "No." They continue to exist  in stasis on both chains because they last moved pre-fork. Think of a half zipped zipper. You're on the zipped part. There's nothing to worry about. 
Now if you want to use them after the fork, you of course will need to choose one. That's sort of the physics of how the protocol works. 
If you're worried, just leave them there until the dust settles. You'll be unaffected

Core will never "take control back." The fact that this concept of control over bitcoin even exists is dangerous and why people are forking away from core in the first place. Yes, this is a debate about the protocol code, but more importantly it is a debate about the governance of that code. 
Bitcoin was never meant to be owned by a monastic order of high programmers who know the Holy Code that the sorry people of bitcoin are not allowed to understand. This is a protestant reformation - bitcoin is an open source, decentralized market economy. 
Developers from Qt will be free to contribute in the future, but the very reason for the fork is to eliminate the idea of "control" that you describe. No one is ever coming back to Qt.

As far as i know, you don't work at coinbase. They have their own operations and risk analysis management protocol; Likely the EV of the cost of these events does not warrant preventing them. It's simply a cost-benefit analysis. They're free to operate their business how they want, and if that is the business decision to accept zero-conf transactions and manage the minimal consequences from there, that's their decision.

Pseudoanonimity is not and has not been a major advantage of BTC for quite a while. Comparative advantage in remittance and inflation rates are. While i don't like the regs either, the regs don't do too much to damage those.

Nah dude. Essentially there are 2 groups:
1. Not able to purchase BTC. There may be corporate regulations, or capital controls. For example, I have an IRA. I can't go buy bitcoins with my money in that IRA, but I did buy GBTC. I also own bitcoin.
2. Not interested in managing the assets, or interested in financial infrastructure integration. There are certainly many people that want to be able to manage all their assets through their brokerage, or want the regulatory structure associated with something like an ETF. I'm not saying it's right or wrong - but that's the reality of the market.

$300MM valuation is a joke bro - making nasdaq small cap isn't exactly bigtime
but to your point, valuations have doubled in the past half year and will continue to do so along with the growth of the BTC ecosystem. Coinbase is worth at least $2bn or my name is mud. For context, AAPL is largest on the NASDAQ at $631bn.
Assuming a generous valuation of $2bn for Coinbase, that means AAPL is projected to generate 31,000% more value than Coinbase based on capitalization. If this were a trade pair, which would you short and long?

Hard forks are a clean break - you implement the new version, and move on. Soft forks are very messy as everyone runs different versions of software - those who don't want the new code are exposed to attack vectors, and those who do upgrade can't use those features with old code. 
Hard forks are opt-in and democratic - the community says, "this is good code. I want to go get it." Soft forks are a way of forcing code upon users who don't want it (like replace-by-fee), and forcing them to jump through hoops to avoid it. 
Most simply, hard forks are clean upgrades require market consensus to adopt. Soft forks are very messy experiences that force themselves upon you, whether you want it or not.

Edit: first and foremost before you read my post - no theoretical econ, just math - can you answer the question? Because you just completely ignored it. 
Lol dog. I have an advanced degree in economics and focused on econometrics in undergrad. As i've said a few times, I'm one of the few people that didn't stumble upon bitcoin, but actually went looking for it.
In fact, my focus was on macroeconomics. However, macroeconomics is certainly not just keynesian bullshit. It is also RBC, a wide variety of DSGE modelling ranging from the believable to the obscene, and a whole host of other diverse subdivisions of the sub-field of economics itself.
That is to say nothing of basically everything else in economics - microecon, which is  bottom-up and based on market clearing, competitive markets, and not central planning that causes DWL generated by subsidies and essentially a &lt; 1.0 spending multiplier.
Being utterly dismissive of such a critical field because a small number of of people in one particular subsegment of the field engage in a school of thought that you don't agree with is certainly ridiculous. More to the point, there is very active debate about monetary policy. But please, do lecture me on the economics of BTC and the acumen of the greater community. I would honestly be delighted.
For more meta-academic discourse and perhaps one you would like to lead would be, if we don't use econometrics to answer basic questions like the one i posed, how do you suggest we go about answering them?

My goodness. Allow me to introduce you to our friend economics,
When V is fixed, M grows at a decreasing rate, and Q grows at the rate of inflation.... I truly can't even anticipate what sort of mental gymnastics we can expect from your response. Maybe you will say that growth in goods exchanged on the blockchain will increase.... because users can't adopt it?
Edit: for a bonus challenge on how "increasing fees will lead to higher-value transactions placed on the blockchain," that can be modeled as the point at which transaction fees as a % of value to the transaction are better served by alternative venues (opportunity cost). 
So bringing fees up from 0.5cents or 2cents to 5cents or 10cents will essentially rule out all transactions below $1-$3, as they are not cost-effective to execute on the block chain. Oh, look, it's blocking "spam," not that I believe that to be acceptable when not market-driven.
The average bitcoin value moved in a transaction right now is hovering right around average price at $382, so for fees would need to increase at least by a log magnitude ($1 per transaction) in order to place upward pressure on average value of a typical transaction, which is what you're getting at. I'm sure everyone will be excited to use PayPal 2.0.

No, the point is that NASA / Qt was trying to get a complex and overengineered solution with many avenues to catastrophic failure (frequent spaaaaaace shuttle disasters, nasty soft-forks to LN and segwit), and it replaced with a smoother, simpler, more cost-effective solution that didn't destroy itself (rockets and hard-fork, respectively).
There will be a time for shuttles and a hard fork for segwit / LN, but today we need a simple, effective rocket.

Not really true. Bitcoin unlimited is an implementation that allows users to set their own blocksize settings. This allows people to essentially model any other sort of implementation they want - unlimited allows users to copy QT functionality or XT functionality. 
The point is, it's a market solution and gives everyone freedom to do anything, and equilibria will emerge through efficient market consensus instead of a tiny little team of a few fallible humans trying to implement worldwide changes. 
So agreed - it is time to raise blocks and non-QT implementations are over 12.6% of nodes now. An interesting number for those who follow the 90 - 9 - 1 rule of market share.
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:08:22
I have 5 comfortable decimal points in BTC. I don't really care if i lose it, because i never considered that i "had" it in the first place. Gains aren't realized until transacted. I am also not losing much in terms of investment - I bought in with a few thousand since 2011. 
That's a bit of a different situation than the user, but I'm making $XX,XXX per year, so my holdings are about 15% of my wealth over the past 3 years, and my investment is only about 1% of my total wealth. So it's pretty easy to not care.

I'm a bit of a rare case in that I didn't stumble across bitcoin, I actually went looking for it. I'm a macro specialist (which does not mean keynesian), and I was engaged in some long term work on competitive bill issuance, the Swedish free banking Era etc. I went looking for modern implementations and found btc. 
And I am absolutely appalled by the Qt team. It's like allowing Dennis to run all of jurassic park. They have no idea what they're doing for the majority of decisions that they're making, but the culture or programming hubris is just too much for them. They think they know all, and no one else does. They need to be sequestered away to sprite code and cryptography. 
In a typical management environment, they would be kept contained on a tech team well the remainder of the company decided what they should be doing. We don't have that, but we do have something better - the market. So the management team of bitcoin (you, me, miners, node operators, wallets, exchanges, etc.) will switch to another code base.

Your point is a good one, but there is more at stake than the code. There is governance of the code. The core team has demonstrated repeatedly that they are an oligarchical monolith that has no interest in representing the needs of the userbase - Peter Todd has essentially said, "let the peasants eat cake."
So i do not want to see core survive. All individuals will be free to contribute to the next bitcoin client implementation, but the autocracy is over. Development will be decentralized and community-driven moving forward. This is the protestant reformation of the corrupted status quo.
The problem with core is much more severe than the code, it is the matter of governance concerning how the code came to be.

Oh we know the answer to this one! It turns out, it wasn't for "all time." [Here is his plan for removing it]
"It  (removal of 1MB limit) can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete. When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:06:31
That's true. But certainly not all! In fact, I think a sizeable number recognize the value in btc. While your traditional macro policy expert and mainline bankers / pe guys are accustomed to the status quo and rely of equity pumps from the Fed, there are many people out there that also recognize that the Fed is an ass backwards centrally planned nightmare that basically just further enriches asset holders to the detriment of future returns to most of the population.

You can define your market in any way you want. If you're a currency trader, then you should compare it to an index of currencies. Personally I think the biggest basket possible would be better, simply because it's more reflective of the complete opportunity cost that is investing in btc vs. another asset. You should also include groups like private equity and commodities, and weight appropriately. 
So you have your risk free rate, the expected value, volatility, and now a market index. So yes you can certainly do this! I would bet a lot of institutional buyers are doing this, only in much better modelling detail.

1. VC is drying up in general due to where we are in the business cycle. Yes, VC funding is drying up in bitcoinland, but that is also true across the board. One would need to benchmark bitcoin VC vs. all VC to pull out a trend, and even then, one would expect bitcoin to be more volatile relative to a basket of VC, due to both general lack of diversity and likely greater perceived return volatility.
2. I strongly believe there's ecosystem concern regarding the scaling debate

1. That is nominally in BTC. In USD it was much less. You are being deliberately misleading. And absolutely ridiculous to try to manipulate to "newbies" pretending to be helpful like you're some kind of pied piper. 
2. In addition, you're not standardizing for transaction volume. That period you refer to (and others) was during extreme volatility and trading activity. Fees now are in a run-of-the-mill, low volatility and transaction volume environment. Just imagine the mempool backlog and fee size when we reach a comparable bubble / volatility period. 
I've been actively engaged in BTC for 4 or 5 years, so that is how I know exactly that the fee environment is ridiculous. You should be embarrassed for slinging snake oil to unsuspecting new bitcoiners on reddit.

It sounds like you're not familiar with the unlimited implementation. You're absolutely right in that software is bounded by constraints, but the unlimited constraints are user-determined and reach market equilibrium. this is from (who wrote unlimited):












So it's a governance solution to blocksize, and also pushes the economy-maximizing equilibrium for the entire network. Something that a market will always accomplish more effectively than a team of 5 or 10 or 30 people making their best guess. No matter how smart a few people are, no one can retain and process as much information as a dynamic market. It's why dynamic markets always reach more efficient outcomes than central planning.

It's a battle of centralized control (Core)  vs. the decentralized control of a community (classic). Classic is not a monolithic entity - it's a community dev environment, not Peter Todd making decrees from high atop a mountain. 
First, there's the issue of representation of users, and the answer to that us clear. The next question of "what is best for bitcoin" is also clear. Economics has empirically and theoretically demonstrated and decentralized markets with liquid flow of information lead to better outcomes than central planning and command economies. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 16:42:19
It seems like a lot of bitcoin users don't understand the difference between fungibility (liquidity related to specific unit of asset) and regulatory compliance (liquidity related to specific users).
This does not reduce the fungibility of bitcoins. Do I like it? No, but it's a reality, and fungibility is unaffected.
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:10:01
*You win a 50mb mempool backlog!*
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:14:13
Dude - no. Because once the units leave the "restricted party's" hands, the unit is equal in value and available to as many buyers to any other unit. That is to say, liquidity is unchanged. There is absolutely no loss of fungibility. 
Throwing a dictionary definition at someone doesn't benefit your argument. You could call it "point fungibility" or something when a consumer is forbidden from transacting, but you're just creating a semantic argument rather than addressing true fungibility as the world of finance and economics uses it.

People probably won't like my opinion on this, but i don't have a particularly high opinion of devs like most people do (both technical and non-technical). 
Coding is a language and a methodology of manipulating information. But just like someone majoring in french, journalism, or spanish, you don't actually learn anything about the **content**, you learn about how to encode and manipulate content. I learned russian, but i learned zero content. I now have the ability to communicate in russian, but it didn't give me anything to communicate *about*.
I am fundamentally a finance person and exited into the programming world for the past 6 months, and i'm doing a coding bootcamp now. Am i the best programmer in my bootcamp? No way. But if you have a real skill, like engineering, econ, bio, math, etc. Then you're light years ahead of devs that can write great code but can't run a business, let alone draw any sort of insightful, helpful conclusion about the *content* of the world. I just see devs as necessary translators that i ignore for the annoying bridge of implementation, between the innovative phase of strategy and innovation for the idea / product, and the real-world execution of a business plan. 
I don't see devs as anything greater than a glorified google translate. That's no fault of their own - many are brilliant, but most don't know anything.

Right, that's why i said mined coins and not trade volume. A few things -
1. Miners do sell almost all their coins. Mining is close to a perfectly competitive market and miners fight to break even. The ones with hashing power right now may be retaining some, but certainly it's not large part of the supply.
2. As for miners retaining coins and not selling, they are in fact purchasing the coins by assuming the opportunity cost of selling. Those coins are going into their records and that will show up in their accounting records. Operations aren't just conducted willy nilly. So that "transaction" can be identified in profitability records.
3. So mined coins per day * market price

I think he's right in that it's urgent. It's not like the system breaks; it works just fine with a fee structure.
But it currently isn't scaleable and rapidly loses it's comparative advantage in transactional and operational efficiency in *some* markets, obviously like micropayments and low-value remittances. The currency is still fine for something like large remittances.
But the block limit is just a barrier: a barrier to development of other products around the blockchain, a barrier to scaleability and improved liquidity, a barrier to efficient network operation.
Yes it's urgent. The world isn't ending, but it is in fact urgent. The stress tests demonstrated that the network's capacity is humorously incapable of scaling.

This isn't an opinion - it's a fact: currency is defined as meeting the ability to act as a unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange. Being forced to accept something in exchange for a good or service, or the ability to use it to pay taxes, are not part of the definition of a currency.

Yeah that's the issue. I finished college in '12, i worked 80 - 100 hour weeks for 3 years. I quit a few weeks ago. 
Was it miserable? yeah. Did i know what i was getting into? Yeah. It was good for my career (if costly in other ways). Fact of the matter is, you gotta grind.
You have 2 choices:
1. Increase your volume of labor.
2. Increase the value of your labor.
As for 1) - There are 100 hours in a week minus sleep (more if you fuck your sleep schedule, but do not do that). How much do you work a week? Sounds like you're working about 20 hours a week at your job. Then I'm guessing you spend 6 hours x 5 days on school (liberally), which is 30 hours. Plus your commute, cooking, cleaning, random shit. We'll call that 60 hours for an average week. You're left with 40 hours! It may not seem like you have a lot of spare time, but you do. You will need to make some sacrifices. Do you like to exercise and spend time doing that? Well you need to decide if you want to be in shape for the next 6 months or invest $1,000 into BTC in the next 6 months. Personally, I don't like this option very much. College is for banging broads and boozing face, not working. 
Option 2) Increase your hourly wage. Find another job. You're young, probably smart enough, work your networks HARD. be a part time office admin. Do you have any skills that you can do remotely? Start doing coding / project work if you can do that. If not, be creative. Talk to anyone and everyone that would hire you. Friends of friends (and even strangers) are willing to help out a young, motivated kid by paying them more than they're worth. I guarantee that you can find a part-time job / internship / whatever for $12 or $15 per hour.
In reality, it's going to be some combination of these things. Life sucks, sort of. But it gets better.

inflation from 1995 to now spans 20 fucking years, which compounds. Even if it was a measly 1% CAGR, that's still a 20% haircut.
In reality, purchasing power fell 56% since 1995.

Well that's just not true.
Our money is simply a debt instrument, created by the central bank and used to purchase government bonds. These bonds are subject future repayment in the form of tax dollars. 
If you're not familiar with open market operations, just look around the world. Can the chinese pay taxes with dollars? Cubans? Russians? Why do they all value it then? It's because its fundamental monetary traits (store of value, ability to transact value, and measure value) are all one of the best in the world. It has nothing to do with taxes.

Like i get why people think that a bitcoin-stylized blockchain is better. in fact, i agree. But you have to recognize that certain entities, governments, for example, and likely many corporate interests, that will not want a bitcoin structured blockchain.
Perhaps they will want to be able to retroactively change data - from our perspective, that's insane. But from an organization that wants to hide its fuckups (or just correct previous fuckups in data retroactively), maybe they don't want it to be immutable.
Maybe they don't want to rely on decentralization. Again, i get the value there. But perhaps a government would rather retain centralized control (how shocking this would be!) even if it increases their error and failure rates. 
etc. etc. etc.
People need to recognize that there is more than one way to skin a cat, and effectively argue why bitcoin is the best. If you just don't accept that there are other answers, you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

Regarding 's post, yes, the bondholders are entitled to repayment contractually. But they also took on the risk of default by doing so. Obviously there has to be conflict between the debtors and the debt holders. It's not pretty but it just has to happen and needs to be resolved.

what you're describing is a positive x-axis intercept on a chart of financial compensation to user engagement. It exists in every behavior and is correct, but pointless to mention in regards to incentivizing user behavior:
[Look carefully at this image]( which depicts the compensation for a donated kidney and the quantity of kidneys donated.
1. at Q1, the price for an organ is $0. Yet people are donating - why? Because they generate profit from doing so, even if it is non-monetary. Maybe they're saving their brother who lost both his kidneys. Maybe they're just a crazy good samaritan. Maybe there's some other reason. But as you note, people will donate (i.e. run a node) for non-monetary reasons.
2. That does not mean the supply curve is not upward sloping. As we've seen in all markets, relying on the goodwill and slim (non-monetary) profits of running a node or donating a kidney provides a minimal supply. By creating financial incentives, node supply will scale with demand. Node supply will not scale with fixed (i.e. non-monetary) incentive.

We never print money. It's all just debt that's credited or debited to accounts. That's all OMO is. When people say "printing money," I really hope no one actually thinks were really printing money at the Fed and delivering it in little trucks. But functionally it is an increase in the money supply. 
Now you'd be right if you mentioned the interest rate manipulation at the zero bound (operation twist) where the Fed moved between bond expiration dates, but you didn't. That's about the only scenario in which the Fed doesn't increase the money supply. 
The money supply absolutely does increase in QE - now whether the velocity of that money increases and enters circulation, or is held by banks and enters the market as liquidity (which is what happened and why inflation hasn't been significant), it's always an increase in the money supply.

The keys to why this is a great proposal:
1. It's a dynamic hard fork - it's not a one-time fix. 
2. It still allows for alteration. My big concern with a dynamic growth rate is that it can get really out of market equilibrium over time. This can be tended to.
3. A potential alteration would be a soft fork, not a hard fork.

Money is already digital and has been for a while. That's why it's dumb calling BTC digital money
Edit: These downotes are ridiculous! Can anyone here describe how open market operations actually work? Do you really think the fed printed $2 Trillion and shipped them in little trucks to the banks? It's all digital - banks communicate with each other and debit or credit their internal ledgers in their databases. It's all digital. When you get paid by your employer with a bank transfer, The bank is just debiting your account and some counterparty through a messy web is crediting your employer somewhere else.
Now, can you store USD in a brainwallet? Do a million other things that BTC can do with USD? No, of course not. That's because the a permissionless, trustless blockchain (like BTC) is much more powerful than a basic digital database, which is the USD. But to claim that the USD is not digital is just wrong. It just happens to have a minor physical element.

government is already redundant - it'll never go away because inequality will always exist (human, social, and asset-structured capital are fungible and inequal), so people with more capital will always use it to gain more capital.
Some popele make money and reinvest it in the equities markets. Other people are clever or born with money, and reinvest it in their political career, and the purpose is regulatory capture or favorable laws to benefit themselves and their constituents. 
As long as one person has more power over another, people will moralize coercion as a necessary government structure.

Central banks != banks.
Banks make loans and investments, which will continue just fine with a stable inflationary currency. The united states did not switch to fiat until 1913 - banking existed long before then. Not to say that banks do not benefit from fiat, but that they can operate with any asset type.
Central banks make money, and the US central bank was most recently established in 1913.

I think the entire network exists because miners have an incentive to support the system, not destroy it. Even if there is incentive for cheating. as to your point about BIP 100 - what did from the block spam episode? They began filtering transactions efficiently. An argument can also be made that those blocks will be most fungible, but thats talk for another day. Transactions fees *can* rise, the network will operate just fine, perhaps at a slightly higher net network cost basis, and there will be no problems. 
An attacker will face enormous cost to interfere with spam, and that's the point of the crypto structure itself. So why deal with the hassle? Leave it up to the miners as we've seen there is a net incentive to cooperate

There are absolutely exceptions, and it gets blurry when your entire product is, say, building a SaaS product that links servers in some creative way. Everyone is still making something, just like a skillful russian - english translation of dostoyevsky stands on its own as a product.
But for the most part, a mathmetician or an engineer could be writing algorithms, and they just need to be implemented correctly in code. I've done a lot of work with middle market companies, and the market for flow meters is massive and lucrative. Engineers are designing different ultrasonic and infrared methods for more accurately metering water and airflow throughout a building, and then communicating that information with the other meters and central control through a network to improve efficiency, pricing, and identifying negative heat delta. 
The least interesting part of those examples, to me, is the implementation. Someone had a great idea, bizdev guys analyzed the market demand, elasticity of demand, product positioning, and the tech and market guys put together a great product. Then you go get your little software scribe who had nothing to do with anything - he's just there to translate your product into code. 
Back to my initial example of SaaS linked servers - say you have a slightly better idea as a software engineer, like mesh networks. What the fuck do you know about the mesh network market? what do they know about the incumbent products, supply structure, go to market strategies, or sales process? Do they know anything about consumer adoption rates for similar products and what the inflection point is across consumer groups? Most importantly, how the fuck is this thing gonna make money in a sustainable way so that it continues to operate? Straight dev guys might be smart and know a lot of about software engineering, but they don't have any content in their head to take an idea from "a mesh network is a cool idea" to "this is how we build mesh networks." My examples are mostly on the finance side cuz that's what i know most about.
My point is that devs are just little translators, like the union guys working the line at an auto manufacturing plant. They didn't do anything interesting, they're just building the shit. The only reason that they generate such high incomes (relatively) is because the demand for their services is far outstripping supply. However, that's quickly going to reach an equilibrium as:
1. code becomes easier and easier to write and perhaps automatically generated (labor supply rises), 
2. markets become more accessible and trade increases (outsourcing to foreign countries) and 
3. emerging markets increase their own supply of devs, synergistically with

haha nah dog. The userbase network effect on value is obviously tied to users. That's tautological.

The network is more secure at a higher price, regardless of the number of users. The difference is subtle but distinct.

I think it's a good question and one we need to be cognizant of. While it would be disappointing for holders exposed to BTC, ultimately the meaning and purpose behind decentralized networks would be maintained, and that's really why we're in the game, right?
BTC Advantages: Network effect is obvious; transactions are the most secure of any network. Sidechains may work and provide infrastructure to continue transacting on the BTC main chain. Whether it's unfortunate or just inevitable, I think that BTC will inevitably become a settlement layer, sort of like TCP/IP. 
BTC disadvantages: it may not be the best at executing smart contracts and IoT products. Sidechains may not be effective. Network effect isn't everything - indeed, the market for commercial blockchain tech is still essentially nonexistent. 
I think that BTC will lose market share in the future. That's not necessarily a bad thing - there isn't just one OS or car manufacturer in the word. 
BTC does more than one thing, as we all know: it remits, serves as a payment network (splitting these up is splitting hairs, but they're different market segments), stores data on the blockchain, and acts as a store of value. I would expect that BTC never becomes a dominant payment network, but it may rise as a master settlement network. l don't exepct that it becomes the leading blockchain database for information, either.
I think its main value will be as a store of value, like gold, and its value will be held as a settlement layer for all the infrastructure of sidechains and related protocols that rest upon it.

Sometimes I think about "the next bubble" or where bitcoin will be in a year or two. Posts like this make me realize that when we guess about prices at $500 or $1,261 or $5,000, it's all pretty ridiculous.
The market cap of bitcoin relative to value created in the world is still infinitesimally small. Bitcoin can conceivably touch every aspect of money transmission and record keeping. If or when bitcoin takes market share from gold as a store of value, takes market share from currencies and succeeds payment and remittance providers like Visa, western union, and paypal (or is coopted by them), and the vast growth in human productivity and value through the development of the IoT, a couple thousand dollars is a joke.
It's not guaranteed to happen, and it wouldn't be immediate, but trying to guess the value that BTC will accumulate and its applications is like trying to describe an alien race or the economic value in the discovery of commercial electricity. It will be more incredible than anything we could imagine.

Were talking about 2 different layers here. 
"Elections" are democratic - anyone can vote for their candidate "client" of their choosing. 
However, operation is centralized and dictatorial. It's like we happily voted for a tyrant or a theocracy.

I sent them the following email to their donation address, i'll update if i get a response: 
Good morning,
I know you all accept bitcoin and have for about a year. I am always willing to contribute to Wiki - i use it all the time. But i'm not interested in clicking through my paypal or dealing with a credit card. Here is an image of what i see for your donor request - if you accept BTC, why isn't it on there? 
edit: Here's the response i got

Sure, so this is what i responded with: 
For sure - thank you so much for the fast response. I know I can donate through this method - I have before. 
But as you note, you need to hunt out bitcoin donation location, and it isn't listed as a payment method (in the image, credit card, amazon, and paypal are the only options). So that sort of defeats the point of having an additional payment method if it's not an option for payment unless you actively seek it out. It doesn't seem like it would be hard to add a GUI for BTC along with your other 3 options because you already have the functionality.

It would be undervalued, but the existing relationship was premised on further growth. Block sizes may not grow, which meant that the time-series lag from block size growth to increased utility and value for consumers will be capped, so there is no longer a premium on buying now with a likelihood of more value later. I.e. Value won't grow, so price won't grow, so current price fell in the relationship.

Exactly. Germany loves this shit for two reasons:
1. German banks make a shit ton of money by financing Greece at high interest rates and enormous loans.
2. German manufacturing exists because they use the Euro. If germany was on its own currency, its exchange rate would be way too high to be competitive. However, their monetary calculus is spread over the remainder of the EU so they functionally have an exchange rate lower than it otherwise would be, boosting their manufacturing and exports. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:01:39
It would. you're right, the fundamental problems are their public and bureacratic bloat. The drachma would help address that problem.
The euro and EU loans would stop floating them. The drachma would plummet in value, exports would become competitive, the greeks would begin to provide services and products, and the economy would recover in a several years (assuming the greeks are forced to cut public employment and maintain some not entirely ridiculous monetary policy of their own).

@_date: 2016-02-22 22:40:43
Blocks are full
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:24:15
First of all, everyone and their mother has seen the quote from Satoshi about raising the block size when necessary and how easy it would be. Citation not needed. Obviously there are plenty of other comments as well. 
Also, you say it's "immoral"? This isn't Iran's religious police, we don't monitor thought crimes or morality. You cannot rule on the basis of a subjective term of morality, particularly such a vacuously meaningless phrase such as "It's immoral to change the rules for a system of money." 
In the event you would like to go down that road, taking no action to increase the block size limit and introducing RBF is a fundamental change to the rules of a system of money, moving into a space of bitcoin where, for the first time ever, there is more demand for block space than supply. That is a monumental change. 
So by your own morality argument, you're in the wrong here. But I'm content with having an objective discussion about how ridiculous it is

@_date: 2015-07-02 15:18:48
It's nothing so simple as, "equities go down, people become poorer, people can't afford to buy stuff." frankly, that's ridiculous.
Value is dynamic and based on demand. If your rationale was correct, then all assets should be positively correlated, which is clearly not the case. 
For example, when equities tank, bonds typically perform well. So people are "poorer" but have increased demand which more than compensates for the wealth effect, driving up bond prices.
Same with gold. Same with the complex interactions of any basket of assets, commodities, derivatives, or anything. This is a dumb conversation

100% agreed and thank you. So why is the argument seemingly restrained to static limits, or discrete steps which raise the block size periodically? The former clearly isn't long term and the second poses too many unknowns. What about a dynamic block size formula based on the size of the blocks? Maybe you can even weight it with an EMA to provide some constancy

@_date: 2015-07-13 03:07:34
dude this is the definition of a straw man argument, come on now. A bitcoin isn't a train. They just have a similarity in market adoption and linguistical impact. That's all. It's an analogy not a verbal star trek replicator. 
Not to even suggest that making a ridiculous extension of the analogy is worth addressing, but when you say: 


Doctors were literally telling people that trains would kill them via asphyxiation among many other issues. Have you ever seen a person from a small village try to navigate a train station (or anyone)? People just deal with any change in the infrastructure of their life and figure out what is dangerous and what is not. Whereas taking a train was once a novelty, it becomes routine. Perhaps so too with bitcoin. Providers making more and more grandma-proof services and public education increases.
So i don't agree with your argument such that it would ever be relevant outside of a ridiculous argument. Humans no longer use denarii or deutschemarks as a measure of value in common conversation, but they were nonetheless relevant at a particular point in time. Right now, we use dollars.
All that aside though, the entire point of my post was that bitcoin's value, while seemingly massive to us as a number in the unit of currency of your choice, has not even started to reach its potential. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:33:19
Does anyone know if this will work on the Qt implementation, or just classic? 
Or rather, I understand that it would work on any client, but has anyone done an analysis to see at what point microtransactions are economically unfeasible in Qt's implementation due to prohibitive fees? 
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:33:30
That's sort of like saying, "lol hammurabi posted his laws but no one could READ! Who cares." 
That's missing the point of accessibility and transparency to the public. Sure, At this (and hammurabi's) particular inflection point in history, simple availability does not mean 100% engagement. 
The point is that the governance has opened its rules to the people who choose to engage with the resources. The barrier to understanding is no longer a structural barrier out of your control, but a technical barrier within your control. And just like hammurabi, I expect coding and this sort of technical knowledge to become far more commonplace (though perhaps not universal) like reading as more and more documents important to the wellbeing of the average person becom  available.

Oh my. Capitalism is simply a force of nature - money (energy) is allocated efficiently to move assets (matter). 
You can call it entropy, brownian motion, conservation of energy / mass, or natural evolution. Everything in the physical world works the same, whether that is biology, economics, physics, or chemistry. Materials interact with other materials through the most efficient form of energy transfer.
Political ideologies create structures within this existential energy protocol of the universe that adjust the routes that that energy / money flows into mass / species / assets, determining whether they live or die. 
Capitalism is the fundamental force of communism, socialism, democracy, anarchy, plutocracy, and monarchy.

I don't agree. The devaluation itself will hurt. A shit ton - agreed there. But the point is that the currency needs to reach a competitive equilibrium - right now it is artificially inflated by weighting monetary policy across other countries.
It's out of equilibrium and needs to get back to one. Obviously you're right, it's not that simple - as i said in my original post, they still need to reform their bureaucracy, privatize, and engage in their own secure monetary policy. But step 1 is decoupling from the euro.

Blockstream is a 3rd party layer that manufactures sidechains. Basically, when bitcoin needs to scale beyond technical protocol capabilities, we can use sidechains to bundle transactions and place them on the bitcoin blockchain, for a fee. It'll be cool. 
Here's the rub -  blockstream IS a competitor to bigger blocks, which has scale perfectly fine currently. However, blockstream won't make money if we aren't forced to use sidechains, so they have captured the bitcoin Qt implementation dev team (they now call themselves "Core") to manipulate the dev of bitcoin to suit their own interests. That's why we're seeing this resistance to scaling now. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:29:11

Segwit will be included in classic. The whole point of classic is to move immediately to 2MB block limits to solve the immediate emergency, then work with stakeholders to implement segwit and develop long-term scaling solutions. But segwit as a soft-fork is an absolute clusterfuck - it requires a hard fork and a bit more planning, not just jamming it through in some BS update.
There hasn't been any long-term planning because it requires people in the community to actually come together and contribute on the project - that is the whole point and value prop of classic. Unlike bitcoin Qt, where a distant oligarchy lords over the sorry peasants of bitcoinland

This is a turnkey, self-sufficient solution into the future (or at least into the era where 128gb is sufficient)

thought provoking, but can't be right. The euro is fundamentally flawed because supranational policies are being applied within national frameworks. If you're going to run a traditional monetary policy, it needs to be deployed on a national level. Monetary groups do not work, regardless of friction reduction.
Because different countries experience different economic environments, there's no good decision for the euro. If the euro is inflated to boost Spain and Portugal, Germany is pissed. If inflation is controlled, Spain and Portugal are wailing for help. 
If anything, the opposite of charlie songhurst's prediction will come true. Countries that previously pegged to the dollar or piggybacked off another currency will be able to use their own. This will offer better outcomes.
Much like the music industry, democratization of access and reduced costs will eliminate the advantage of scale. There will no longer be 3 big record (currency) groups - everyone will be able to occupy a niche. The currency market will fragment, not consolidate.

first of all, there are no angels and morality is subjective, so fuck your judgement.
Secondly, have you studied any economics at all? Do you have a degree? Efficient capital allocation (and its results, like accurate pricing and ability for the economy to function) is one of the most important things that happens in a market economy. Determining that the tesla has value and shake shack doesn't is one of the core values of a hedge fund and any other institutional investment.
Thirdly, and again on the creating value front, these guys are generating returns on investment. They quite literally are GIVING money to companies that they like (see previous point), the good companies make more good stuff, and expand to help them make more good stuff. Otherwise they'd need to take out debt. 
Fourthly, if anything, these guys trade on fundamental value and deep market analysis. What bitcoin traders and other day traders do is typically trading on hype - that's the bullshit. The good part is - if you trade on hype you won't make money. If you trade on a fundamental value (and you're right), then that adds value. You can't be paid millions without adding value. 
Caveat: If you want to get mad at anyone, get mad at the fed. You may have looked at that last point and thought, "wait a minute! These equity values are bullshit and rising for no reason! Fuck these hedge fund guys, they're not adding value!" Well, you'd be sort of right. Are hedge funds really adding value to the eonomy by piling into equities right now (hype as you describe)? Sort of, sort of not. It's all based on BS, but that's just the world we live in (that includes the hedge funds), and the fed has created it with QE. Cheap credit creates a flight to risk to generate profitable returns, and the hedge funds are as much a victim of this BS as you and me are. The fed is the one that is "creating no real value."

Your whole argument is that uneducated = stupid. So what if they're "uneducated?" They're still clever and get by. If they see something useful, they'll use it, regardless of if they're educated.

Dude cut that shit out, get your life savings out of bitcoin. I don't know if you're a troll or just overenthusiastic.

yeah.... gold is 4.6T right now. However: 
1. compound world value growth: assuming 3% net growth, the 2027 world GDP will be about $101T, from the current $78T. I'm assuming their model assumes that gold and BTC will join proportionally.
2. I'd guess that this isn't just "currency" value in bitcoin as we understand. Obviously, a bitcoin is a bitcoin, and whether it's being used for blockchain functionality vs. traditional payment / investing, the net value doesn't matter. However, I think they assume a lot of value growth in BTC will come from blockchain applications that don't currently exist. It's the concept of innovation and total factor productivity in the solow growth model

1. Bitcoin has a lot of great stuff going for it. I think that low operational costs (transactions), store of value and IoT will drive it's value. Pseudanonymity is also a great advantage, but it is absolutely not the "killer app." TXs can still be tracked, first of all. Secondly, the opportunity to circumvent capital controls is mostly in china right now, and this is being served by the grey market remittance, and that market is a fraction of the size of the others I just mentioned. More generally, no one gives a shit about privacy. Look at our political landscape in the US, look at our privacy laws, heck look at Tor. Tor could not be easier to use, yet it is a very niche share of Web browsing, which is legit one of the most common activities is the US. I'm not saying that's right or wrong, just how the cookie crumbles. 


2. You do realize that coinbase is just a company, right? Coinbase is not bitcoin. You can still use bitcoin exactly how you describe. This is like saying Comcast and the Internet are the same thing.

Supply has been growing at about 10% per year. That's staggering. China's whole economy grew at about 7% per year, and most countries are around 3%. Normally when a currency inflates by 10% per annum, that is considered intolerable inflation for the reasons you describe - the currency struggles to hold its purchasing power. 
So supply has been outstripping demand. You're right, demand has increased, but slower than supply. The halving will reduce supply growth.

As fatoshi pointed out, the use case is migrant workers sending money home. The UN reports that ~3% of the world population is employed as migrant workers, so 
0.03 * 8 billion = 240 million people.
You take a very paternalistic view of innovation; that only cloistered  technologists can drive it. In reality, those ventures typically just succeed in sucking up money. A substantial amount of technical innovation is driven by *need*, where people like the unbanked adapt existing solutions in extraordinarily clever ways, e.g. M-Pesa. 
If you're not convinced by the rapidly growing market that already serves the unbanked, then I think you've already decided that you will not be convinced, and no future advancements will change that. 
I'd encourage you to simply sit back and watch in comfort as other people create solutions and contribute to their fellow man.

It's not the last auction - it's the last US Marshals auction. Australia still has like 17k coins and i'm sure others do as well. There will be more confiscations in the future. 
This auction is already priced into the market, and regardless of the selling price, each auction adds information symmetry to the market. So the effects of each auction are positive regardless of the "selling pressure" boogeyman. 
No one is reporting it because:
1. The btc community doesn't care. Auctions aren't going to have some explicit impact on the market beyond what I already described. 
2. The first one was novel and sold stories for the news outlets. It was sort of an interesting precedent and situation to handle.  Now we're on the 3rd or 4th one and the stor6's been told to death

The issue isn't that XT "won't be a thing." That's fine, I'm not even a huge fan of it. 
What IS an issue is shutting down relevant discussion of bitcoin to push an agenda. First because it's morally repugnant, but more importantly and pertinently because eliminating dialog is counterproductive to bitcoin development.

there's no such thing as speculation. People buy shit they thing is valuable, for whatever reason. You can't ascribe external segmentation to fluid concepts like store of value vs. a medium of payment, and one would obviously be useless without the other.

Dude all I'm saying is that the cost of running the check network is undeniably more expensive the bitcoin network, not even counting all the labor and operational costs that the banks also incur. That is true both independently, on a cost per transaction basis, as well as at scale. 
Bitcoin is applicable to the entire check network value alone, and that is a mere fraction of the global economy. Users will inevitably be coming on line for decades as non users die and children get their first phones to spend on crypto rails

Opinion alert to avoid getting banned: The core devs won't make necessary changes to bitcoin because it benefits the companies that they work for in the space. Blockstream is one of these - essentially, many core devs want to keep BTC as backbone rails for settlement, which would force consumers to use another layer to transact, like Blockstream. If bitcoin is fixed, then their startups go up in smoke. Initially, the blocksize limit didn't exist, then it was created as a temporary stop gap to prevent spam with the intention of removing it later, and now it's a permanent "feature not a bug." Gavin was hosed and exiled for pointing this out.
We've hit the blocksize limit before, and a transaction system must be optimized to serve maximum volume - not mean or median volume. Think of Amazons servers - they have untold server space, basically just for Christmas shopping volumes. Visa and Amex are capable of handling maximum transaction volumes. So the claim that the "average block size" isn't big enough yet is just a non sequitur. It's already too late when average blocks are large, and they may never even fill up - there is an opportunity cost of making a choice, which is any other choice. Blocks may well never fill up because people are too hesitant to place any more load on the network and seek out a better solution. 
Here's the part about Kim dot com. Poduct developers are accounting for the world in future years, not where we currently are. They're not going to hamstring themselves to an artificially generated blocksize limit - if what they need doesn't exist, they'll make it. This is the future hypothetical conclusion of current events where bitcoin becomes irrelevant because a handful of people wanted to make a few measly million dollars. 
Anyway, much consternation has struck up about this debate. The mod here, theymos, started banning anyone that takes my sort of opinion. Many mental gymnastics were had to justify the bans, and a shit ton of people were kicked out by the thought police.

Yeah this is some huge shit. Bitcoin visibility is high right now and i would love to see main stream media pick it up. We've just seen some of the great material coming out of the [economist]( and [Bloomberg]( and industry incumbents are saying [shit like this]( where the Moneygram strategist goes through hilarious mental gymnastics to suggest that that bitcoin won't work as a payment rail. I can't wait for that guy to go onto CNBC and watch him try to make heads or tails of how bitcoin actually works with [these people]( It'll set a great juxtaposition to competent comments on the market by people like Jeremy Allaire. 
This is why i laugh when claim that bitcoin's price shouldn't be any higher, "this price appreciation will tank right back to the $250s, there's been no growth in fundamentals!" That's true I'd agree, but that's just a widely used proxy for user base. Data networks aren't additive - you either have the last 4 feet of telcom wire or you don't. True, there is retail and a bit of commercial use, but you're not going to get big commercial traffic. Like commercial investors will use OK Pay wires to china, or try to get convince their bosses to let them trade on ItBit or somehow foresighted some dude in operations decided you needed an exotic asset, so you can have a wallet). Ultimately the issues is getting money (users) onto the network. Fundamentals are just the closest proxy.
A few final lines of code in the bitcoin network - this payment standard, coinbase, electronic wallet usage on phones, financial instruments like GBTC, winklevoss instruments, and prop trading platforms, christ it's sitting on bloomberg right now. Those few final tracks will line up and then the cash can flow. So the argument about fundamentals is just a semantic one. 
A lot of bitcoin's fight is in perception - and it's winning. The ability for people to use it is obviously necessary, but then they have to decide to use it. That visibility is what's happening now, and increasingly so with each bubble.
So will bitcoin's price come down at some point? For sure. But it's value is so much higher than now I would just be joking to speculate what that is, but I'll probably need to use a log scale to make any sense of the data.

The argument is: "we are scared that people do not have the bandwidth necessary to handle bigger blocks.  Bitcoin will centralize and fail. We need to keep blocks small to prevent this failure." 
In reality, there is no growth issue with bandwidth, just as there was no growth issue with processing power in the past 50 years (although Moores law is under scrutiny now, no exactly relevant). Ipso facto, no problem with larger blocks. 
So continues the argument 
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:40:34
common misconception. "Legal tender" does not guarantee or affect fungibility. 
1. Traditionally, "legal tender" meant that a dollar was convertible for gold at a known and legislated rate. That's now meaningless given that there is no gold.
2. Cash, aka Federal Reserve Notes, are "legal tender" in that they are officially sanctioned and managed currency. In essence, the assignment of "legal tender" simply sets a jurisdiction for federal reserve activity. 
None of this has anything to do with fungibility - businesses are absolutely free to deny service. That's why a retailer can tell you to fuck right off if you try to pay with 10 lbs. of pennies or a $100 dollar bill.

Yep this couldn't be more wrong. Economic growth has always been exponential with a small blip in the middle ages when growth was linear. 
Furthermore, all assets in fact lead to decreasing marginal returns - not increasing marginal returns. The exception to that is TFP, or total factor productivity, which is the concept of innovation.

Well, transaction volume isn't going to be great as you said - i don't believe spam is an issue and Chinese exchanges are accused of "faking" trades. I don't believe that necessarily, but they do have a zero fee trading model. The marginal cost of transaction volume is nearly nil. So it's not that the volume is fake, just that it doesn't mean much. 
It's like using the US stock market performance as an indicator of economic performance. That makes sense.... until money is free at zero interest rates. Then you can essentially borrow for free and inflate equity values without creating any real value. It doesn't mean those equity values (like transaction volumes) aren't real, just that they don't mean much. Anyway, just an analogy. 
Honestly I wasn't sure what you meant by total volume - i was guessing an average of all exchanges, which makes more sense. The winkdex does that, and in general transaction volume of an exchange with fees will be a better metric. To account for changing market shares over the years, I think a weighted average like the winkdex is good. 
However, a lot of volume is still generated by traders. That's why both of those metrics aren't great - you and I could trade coins back and forth forever, make a lot of volume, but it would really only be us. That's why bitcoin days destroyed exists.

I don't give a shit if xt is adopted or not, I just want BTC to continue improving. And for all the censorship efforts by the no-change QT community like theymos, it really just turned a lot of people off from that nasty political attempt to manipulate bitcoin.

Think of it like the walled gardens of the early internet era. The private blockchains are certainly useful and an improvement over reconciling seperate databases and hoping the other bank is telling the truth. They make the operator feel safe from outside prying eyes as they are not public - whether the operator is a government, a bank, or some other institution. 
But over a period of decades, open source platforms using blockchain systems (bitcoin) will generate network effects and open innovation relative to the AOLs and compuservs. Walled gardens that restrict access ultimately restrict both innovation and network effects, which are really the two driving factors of growth. As a market space, private blockchains are DOA, but they will have a rip roaring decade or two.

1. I do use it for payment and autorepurchase 
2. Even when I don't use it to buy stuff, I am still using it as a store of value. There is an opportunity cost to the use of money - in this case, my cost would be returns to gold or dollars or whatever. I am getting value from bitcoin and adding value to it by holding it, so you're wrong to say that "bitcoin will go nowhere"

Yeah all those are good points. 


But I've never been a bitcoin or crypto dev and am not active in the spaaaaaace. I can barely make a crud app. I'm a transactions consultant. Core dev work is still open for discussion - it doesn't matter if I have another line of work. I'm certainly not suggesting that bitcoin core devs aren't involved, but I wonder how much is really testing and developing, and how much is IRC chats. When someone is employed at 4 or 5 places... you can see how it might be difficult to make a substantive contribution to some of those commitments. Even more important is conflicts of interest, which appear to be rife in core, on both sides of the blocksize debate.


Absolutely agreed! The point of the topic is **governance**. Similar to running nodes, how can we incentivize code development? We can't rely on charitable giving to fund full time devs, any funding sources would likely generate a conflict of interest, and the only semi-rational idea is to simply "horse" devs who signed on to buy bitcoins to incentivize bitcoin development. Which is obviously a horrible idea. 
We've reached a point where bitcoin has essentially automated the manual operations of monetary policy, which is fabulous, but the "governance problem" of monetary policy is unsolved. The bitcoin dev team is analogous to the federal reserve, but even less efficient in that respect. Essentially, bitcoin ha automated the taylor rule - that's great. But we've made no progress on how those rules are actually made. The similarities are concerning. 
The US fed has a "dual mandate," that is, to manage both employment and inflation of the US. However, other models exist - the ECB is only mandated to manage inflation. This is quite comparable to the payment vs. settlement layer currently happening in bitcoin - what is the actual purpose of the dollar? **How do we decide** what the actual purpose of bitcoin, and the euro, and sidechains, and monero etc. is, which guides their development? It's a political issue.
TL;DR: who decides what bitcoin's mandate is? This is a governance issue. I have no answer - I am inclined to think it would be one of decentralization - certainly centralization and politics is not the answer.
@_date: 2015-10-07 02:12:43

@_date: 2015-10-07 02:21:32
Nah. I don't even understand where your question is coming from - you said it yourself. If you can take it anywhere and exchange it for anything, why peg it to anything? 
The only notable reasons currency pegs exist is to manipulate trade balances or prevent inflation 
@_date: 2015-11-10 13:09:13
Because certain core devs work for certain companies that produce side chain products to increase the real transaction limit, using bitcoin and a backbone settlement layer. If bitcoin just scales like it's supposed to, then these side chain companies will lose value. Rather than continuing to innovate, it's easier to just tie down bitcoin and force users into these proprietary solutions.

...... the highway system is a product, not a market. More to the point, in the market for transportation and logistics, if you have any experience with municipal, state, or federal procurement, you know two things:
1. How inefficient and lumpy and ill planned it is, with drastic impacts on the distribution of labor and resources in the construction market
2. How corrupt the government is - lots of funds go missing
So it clearly affects the market. Obviously the highways are great - what you're ignoring is opportunity cost. How much more wonderful they would be if they were built by private (or at least more decentralized) interests when it is cost-effective to do so

I kid i kid. But actually, because market paradigms shift. In a world dominated by google, you would shoot yourself in the foot to hide your website behind a paywall - youd be invisible on google and you would never do it. But perhaps some day, search engines will compete to pay YOU for content to provide better searches for users, and therefore will generate more micropayments over 402 searches. Perhaps they will compete to have more up-to-date searches, and will pay you the same fee more frequently. Perhaps not.
The point is, don't assume that the norm now will be the norm in 20 years.

2. Blockchain is way larger than money. I assume you know this. Money is an infinitely tiny part of the blockchain pie
3. Straw man argument isn't effective. I do a lot of analysis of industrial and commercial work, blockchain tech has implications everywhere. From flow meters in air ducts taking a certain action if scenario x occurs, to Health IT providers like EPIC implementing it for medical records management, to logistics companies managing data for each box to automate delivery confirmation steps and CRM activity when a package reaches its next stage of delivery. If they wanna use ethereum, go for it. 
This isn't a binary us vs. them scenario. New products mean that the market size stays the same and competitors fight for share, or the market size grows without affecting competition. It's clearly the part of the latter.

And you are deliberately twisting a data point. I regularly segmented share of wallet data by category at my old job,  and would have been vivisected if I somehow thought that segmenting share of wallet by # of transactions would be a good idea. 
The appropriate metric is share of value, not share of transactions. In fact, your entire linked article is pretty much reporting that cash behavior is limited to small transactions. 
Cash is the smallest at 14% of transaction value. Credit is the largest at 40% of transaction value, and by far the largest category.

It's a good point and i'm not sure why you're being knocked for it. Yes, bitcoin will be fine, but the investment space (and likely dev) will suffer. 
Super brief background: 
Economy is at zero interest rates - safe bonds yield no return, equity growth is stagnant, so it's hard to make money. This causes a flight to risk, as riskier investments (all else held equal) generate higher returns to compensate for that cost (risk) you're carrying. 
Zero interest rates also mean that money is "cheap." You can borrow it for free, basically. So people are borrowing  a fuck ton of money, taking highly leveraged positions, and investing in risky markets to try to make a buck. This causes localized bubbles, of which 3 major ones are tech, PE, and real estate (varying by geography). I'm sure there are more, biotech is a good guess, but I don't know that space. 
Anyway, bitcoin companies are probably the biggest sub market in that tech space. VC money is booming for bitcoin. So what happens when the economy finally enters a recession again and risk appetite dries up? For one, investment in the space will dry up, so dev and products will too. Secondly, bitcoin's price performance during a recession is untested. On one hand, you may see a flight away from it (as it's volatile and risky). Oversimplifies, the wealth effect argues that when you lose wealth, you dump your risky assets. Bitcoin is the first asset to be sold off to make money to secure positions in remaining assets. It's a demands side spiral. 
On the other hand, bitcoin looks more and more similar to gold. It may actually draw investment - and if that's the case, the market for its derived products (the bitcoin startups and backing vc firms) will remain secure, using bitcoin to anchor the storm and generate growth. This doesn't event address remittance and blockchain use, which can cut operating costs in difficult times. So a recession might be the best thing to happen to the btc market, in the long run. 
One thing is for sure - it will be very scary and very volatile. It's a good question and one that the bitcoin community has wrestled with for a long time.

Lagging, pretty well confirmed and researched at this point
Edit: Lots of convos and price analysis, here's a good bit of data surrounding it in formal analysis - page 3. There is a feedback loop, but primarily the process is Price rise - search - new users, leading to price rise - search - new users. That's slightly different from a direct feedback loop, or search volume fundamentally driving price

Well that's really the issue isn't it? It's not a code issue, it's a governance issue. And bitcoin dev has devolved into petty feifdoms of control and competition rather than collaboration. It seems that people are very focused on the blocksize debate, but really the issue isn't the code, but how the code came to be. The issue is governance of development decisions, not the decisions themselves. Instead of having lots of little dev kingdoms of merge rights, how can we decentralize development?
Bitcoin has innovated far beyond the federal reserve's capabilities, automating the decisions about money supply that were the Fed makes manually. Consider the Fed: the Fed chairmen sit around, deciding how to adjust interest rates to balance money supply to fit the Taylor rule. But no matter how smart they are, these are just a few people trying to capture and process literally a planet of information, and then process it all. To say nothing of their own motives, and the methodological challenge of even acquiring accurate data to make decisions. For the same reason that markets are more efficient than central planning, bitcoin's rule-based mathematical automation will always be more efficient than the human errors in monetary policy decisions of the Fed.
So now we've found a currency with superior rules to fiat currencies. But a layer above that - the governance - is still the same. A few people sitting around with merge rights for each respective currency's decisions. The process about making and improving bitcoin's rules is still centralized, structured in a top-down bottleneck that restricts the flow of information and ideas. Not due to some nefarious intent, but simply due to the imperfection of any one meat-filled skin bag - decentralization and markets are simply more efficient at capturing and processing information than command-based economies.
Bitcoin is obviously more than a currency, but the governance issues are the same. While the solution that bitcoin has provided is better than competing technologies, the governance of bitcoin is still as antiquated as its competitors.
I would like to see the community step back from the code for a minute, and focus on how to improve governance to better acquire data and information in a more efficient manner.

Basically inelastic goods are purchases with little respect to price, I.e. People will still buy everything they need or actually want, just not BS consumer goods that contribute to GDP estimates without adding value.

People make a big deal over its name. People get riled up with "virtual" because BTC actually exists. "Digital" doesn't really mean anything because the USD is primarily digital too, and BTC can be put on paper. 
Why not just call it "currency?" that's what it is. And it would take a step to eliminate the dichotomy between crypto issued and centrally issued. Short of that, why not go with cryptocurrency?

Economist loss for people who got their savings toasted, while regrettable, is not due to financial "speculation" in the market, but due to misaligned credit management on a macro scale. They made an investment in a house and got a negative return. They fundamentally engaged in "speculation" when they buy a house - they wouldn't have been damaged by the credit crisis if they weren't "speculating" in the real estate market by owning a home; i.e. being exposed to the asset. You literally make my point.


Yes, agreed, although there is such a thing as expected value, fundamental analysis, regression modeling, confidence intervals, etc. etc. So picking $1MM is sort of just a straw man effort to make me look foolish


Well sure. Does anyone use gold as a currency? Even less so than bitcoin (but they both do). The idea that bitcoin isn't used as a currency (or that gold isn't used as a currency) is ridiculous - both gold and bitcoin transact millions or billions in $ every day. 
But even more so, I maintain my exposure to btc while i use it as a payment rail by autorepurchasing, so the entire thought process you outlined above is directionless. 
Even MORE so, you should familiarize yourself with MV = PQ instead of making generalist blanket statements about behavior effects. The only speculation i've seen is in your posts.

I'm basically describing the same thing 3 ways - there is a lot more activity, so there is much faster price discovery and arbitrage through more "tools". There are also a lot more positions open on either side of the order book, which increases liquidity. Finally, volatility is tempered as people bite into any significant price action through shorts, longs, hedges, and swaps. 
All this makes BTC more useful

As someone pointed out in another thread, after you stop thinking about it in terms of compliance and regulatory limits, bitcoin as a product fucking sucks in the eyes of the average person. Cancelled transactions make it clunky and unreliable as hell, but worse is that it's "risky." in reality, what's the most any of you lost with coinbase? But that's not how people react. Bitcoin different and scary, which,  understandably from that point of view, is the last place you want your money. 
It is awesome for people who can use it, and that number is growing large very rapidly (with excellent growth projected but digressing). The average person can't even figure out how to use bitcoin, and the concept is teetering on the brink of "gun smuggling Internet network" status in the minds of half their friends, people just don't wanna fucking use it. They just won't buy into it and avoid it entirely. "why would I put my money in there?" Coinbase and others like circle are going to cancel transactions - the KYC laws are just too difficult to work with given btc's nature. 
I would hope Coinbase is doing 2 things:
1. Lobbying the shit out of politicians because like it or not that's just how shit happens 
2. Do something smart. How many people actually are criminals when they are caught by KYC/AML laws? Coinbase needs to front them the money while you get everything straightened out in terms compliance! Sure they'll lose margin but that's breakage to get to the status of a major on-ramp. Circle, all these guys could be the next Google if they just don't fuck up 
Assuming coinbase will lose money to fraud and otherwise stupid customers, they need to have outstanding BI to identify terminals that fraudulent transfers are coming from. I am willing to bet coinbase is taking a safer dragnet approach. 
They could even do something really cool with derivatives on their own debt. Securitie the debt coinbase will hold for fronting customers and allow it to trade on a BTC swap market. There you have lots more liquidity in the market as people can use it to trade as an indicator in the health of the exchange itself. It would act like a BTC market vix and bounce off the exchange activity for a new layer of integrated market transparency. 
And it would probably be cool to trade. Or maybe you end up losing a bunch of money in the enron of our age. Either way cool story

I feel like this can't end well for the BTC / ecuadorian digipeso dynamic.
You introduce this state run thing, drive people to learn about digital currencies, suddenly the threat of people switching to BTC moves from nonexistence to a serious threat. People suddenly learn about BTC when they wouldn't have before, and the state is training them to use it. Isn't this great marketing for BTC, and painting BTC as the "better alternative" because Ecuador banned it?
Plus, is there anything about the virtual peso thing that makes it easier to exchange for BTC than existing systems?
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:28:57
1. I really can't figure out what you're trying to say in either post. Your last post seems to reflect exactly what you shit on for.
2.  I just wanted to point out that utility doesn't necessarily equal price appreciation. Each node added and each additional user in the network makes the network marginally more useful than the previous unit did. However, non-network factors like monetary base inflation and changes in monetary velocity also affect the price of BTC, and likely moreso at this point. 
3. It would be more productive if you tried to have a conversation instead of calling people trolls.

No, just that you don't need to expose yourself to BTC volatility to use BTC.

I've been thinking about this for a while as a way to hedge risk but maintain exposure in the crypto space. It gets asked every few weeks, but I'm not sure how many good answers there are.
Here's the last time i asked:

Can you do this in country GDP instead of area? That would be a true expression of the value of the land

I would love to hear you define one type of derivative. Bonus points if you can describe how futures destroy an economy.

Who the fuck says "frigging" 
@_date: 2015-02-07 12:25:47
Is this fucking normal? Does a typical 32 year old have 50k in savings? Or 100k? If so, what has the average dude been doing for the past 15 years? Literally pissing money out of his ass? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:42:07
Yes, about half the volatility caused by a drunk guy with a smartphone in the crude market

Yeah fasho, I'm just saying don't be duped into feeling that they "lightened up" 
I'd love to see NJ and NH give NY the finger with really accommodating regs in response. But fuck knows right? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:19:28
hoarding is a subjecting term. Try "saving." Savings = investment = growth. inflation artificially manipulates behavior to an inefficient consumption point leading to DWL across the economy.
Any other scary boogeyman deflation fears of your "hoarding" are perfectly addressed by interest rates and inelastic demand. Keep downvoting me though - it means you're right!

Can anyone explain the ether / Bitcoin interaction? Is it one vs. the other, or can ether operate as a side chain? 
I am cognizant of the potential for an Open Transactions or Ether taking the place of BTC, though I recognize of course that BTC can be forked to its benefit and holds strong network effects. 
But if BTC is just a decentralized ledger with known inflation, what is preventing these solutions from taking its place? 
I'm long btc and very bullish as well, so don't give me shit for my circumspection. I just want maintain a healthy knowledge of the competitive landscape and general crypto Ecosystem.

interest rates can increase because there is zero yield anywhere else, and people will jump at the opportunity to generate returns.
Job growth as is manipulated by accounting for many unemployed workers as not being counted in the workforce.
I'm not a doom and gloomer - the US will probably do well the next few years simply because it's the highest ground in the flood, swampy as it is. Having said that, the US is going to need to decrease labor market friction at some point, and we'll get there kicking and screaming.

A huge block chain service is replacing notaries with coins demonstrating proof of ownership, transaction, whatever, on a public ledger. It already exists. But good thinking!

This is the whole point - this is how negotiating works. 
Propose something no one would ever go for, then look reasonable when you soften the BS slightly. At least one person called this move months ago

Just pointing out that the Fed and fiat is actually the exception to the rule rather than the norm.

deflation isn't bad. It's only bad in our current financial regimen. You can experience economic inflation and price deflation, which makes perfect sense. Goods get better and cheaper (televisions). The difference in a fixed monetary base, price truly goes down, while the nominal cost may be nominally higher, though not when adjusted for monetary inflation.

it's always going to be easier to drive adoption with patches to existing technology / infrastructure and familiar service provider relationships than innovative technology.

It's tough to answer that question because the USD went through several different iterations and central banks, if you will, including a ~50 year period of "free banking," though it was still highly regulated, where banks issued notes. Most data will be from 1913 onward.

I understand of course that btc has both transactionary and investment value, combining to generate demand. However, both benefit from network effects. 
Transactional network effects are too obvious to discuss. I assume investment-related network effects still exist in the form of functionality and liquidity, correct? So both elements of demand should exhibit parabolic demand growth.
I understand that there are many macro determinants (and I disagree, I think they are the easiest to predict long-term because of how inefficient the BTC market is). I also recognize  the ability  to size market capitalization based on gained market share through western union, PayPal, etc.
My question is (are) trend related,
1) please clarify, because  btc is fundamentally transactional whether they are used as an exchange for goods or an exchange for future assets (investment), all demand is fundamentally parabolic?
2) I'm a bit confused by your function there. Can you explain it a bit more? AS I understand, the marginal network effect is the newcomers "saved" fees related to overall network size. This doesn't sound right for a few reasons. Most obviously, the function appears to indicate decreasing marginal returns which is antithetical to the concept of network effects. Secondly, transactional savings alone do not account for added network effects of exchangability. 
3) the crux of the matter, is there a way to regress out the organic parabolic growth due to network effects vs. Irregular bubble-forming investments?
