I think you will find that the US weekend is pretty universal ;) Even here in backwards Europe we have the same :)
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:46:34
oh, as an aside, your English is really really bad. "I'm going to make point to tell". Do you mean "I'm going to make a point of telling", also "there's" I assume is "theirs", hmmm, usually "old school" = good school and you obviously did not go there...

Well, if it was ghee I am glad. A few days ago I looked at the daily discussion and it appeared like about 50% of the posts were him/her. So tedious to plough through I gave up after 1 minute, that is serious trolling. I note that your comments are also long and frequent today. If you have something to say, couldn't you just say it once?
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:14:59
no idea, not normal to see a substantial pump at the weekend
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:04:10
I see you won your bet - at 16 sats now? And he won't pay up?
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:21:30
Thanks for the info, I didn't know about that. Makes me feel good that I bought some in the dip
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:39:18
If you had read some other posts, it would appear that Goldman Sachs had a lot to do with what is probably a temporary fall. I made an initial purchase May 6th, I am still in the black despite the price being maybe 30% lower now. Doesn't matter to me one whit if you quit or not, but on balance I give your post a 10 out of 10 for whining, 0 out of 10 for informing other people.

Bitcoin charts are like traffic lights - always too long at red and not long enough at green :)
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:36:45
Sad :( A real sh*t then
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:25:39
Shame :(  My start point was a little above that, but am in the black now....
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:26:02
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:00:42
Why not both then? 7100 and if it goes up, again at 7300? btw I don't short, can't anyway.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:31:42
yeah, if you are 105 I guess
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:03:04
You can buy another 100? Wow, for sure I can't!
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:43:22
The reality is that for domestic, local purchases it is unlikely to happen. After all, the cashier who sells sth to you is paid in fiat, the goods are paid for in fiat etc. The real market appears to me to be international. I read just yesterday of a fine arts house in London which accepts bitcoin. Suppose an item is sold by a european (Eurozone), sold in London for GBP, bought by an American.  Say the sale price is 1 million, I would guess the transfers/ fees of $ to GBP to Euro would be 3-4% of the transaction amount. If the buyer can use BTC, and especially if the seller accepts BTC then it makes sense all round.
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:37:36
I had a thought recently, that although bitcoin investment can feel a bit SM at times, it is actually more like S &amp; L (snakes and ladders). Apologies to all who didn't play it as a kid.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:21:49
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:33:58
Well, I have diversified. I bought bitcoin, I bought an apartment in Pattaya (for rent). Most of my unit trust holdings are overseas. We shall see...
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:56:33
Really? You mean people actually act on what they see here? That is crazy.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:49:18
Because he/she accepts the amount of BTC that they are happy with which will obviously exceed by a small margin the amount that they would get in fiat
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:24:45


In the Eurozone actually - the UK makes it the 4th in the EU.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:23:43
I think it unlikely you haven't dropped in value. I have substantial equity investments, I am down around 0.8% from when I last looked (1-2 days).
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:08:33
Good, I wasn't sure as it is subscription-only. Another 1,000 or 100,000 like her would help adoption :)
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:45:26
I dunno if you guys can see this: 
Otherwise I can show it here:
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:57:06
and around 1% is me (and I am dong about nothing)

Best comment I've seen here for a while :)
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:12:44
tbh, I haven't a clue. Volume is non-existent, I am sitting it out, I'll buy on a drop &amp; sell a bit if it goes up, BUT it is boring as hell right now
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:22:05
she? We have gender issues here?
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:32:45
A link might help perhaps?
@_date: 2018-07-09 12:52:45
Not even close atm...
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:11:22
If I am researching a subject (of any kind) then I make myself familiar with the basic terminology before I start asking questions. Yes, in general I would not not make a comment, BUT when you say you are researching a particular subject, then an error like that is beyond the pale.
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:34:27
yeah, my bad. I meant Coinfloor
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:27:42
which means?
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:08:22
Of course I would regret it to an extent, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. I still have a few, will wait to see what happens.
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:42:45
I don't know where it is going, but I am quite happy today. I have reduced my average cost (from 7850 GBP first purchase on March 6th) to under 5k, am a little in profit but only buying if it goes down;)
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:45:13
I placed those orders because I hoped the price would rise. I did not expect it, but hoped. I started investing in bitcoin recently, march 08 was my first purchase at 7850. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:26:26
WOW! last time I looked the price was around 5000 (GBP) and I put in a few sell orders not expecting them to be filled. Now I only have a couple of bitcoin left. Should I hodl or sell?
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:53:46
Thanks but not really, I want updates in code somehow
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:39:12
Also depends on the availability of exchanges.I am a Brit living in Romania, it was bloody hard to get a GDAX account. Also there is the issue of currencies, GDAX/Coinbase don't deal in GBP, if/when I want to convert then I have to go via Coinfloor.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:04:56
"Set for life" ... I guess that depends on your perspective and age. I am too old (58) and have enough money that it really won't make any difference to me. It will make a difference only to my heirs. But it has given me an interest of some kind this year.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:36:20
I am too timid, so I pass on that one.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:53:31
From your English, I would suggest giving up research altogether. I assume you mean "as a means of payment" or something similar. A remittance is what has been paid/sent already fyi.
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:27:08
Well, to reply to your question which was only raised in your reply to me, is that bitcoin is likely to be better in most foreign transactions. I have some experience of Western Union and have sent money on behalf of others (UK bank-to-bank transfers are free and I took money in Romanian Lei to send to daughters in the UK). All depends on the cost of depositing/ receiving money and the available price.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:33:19
lol, so no idea or just different ideas;) Me, I reckon I'm buying into the next dip now.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:52:28
I think he means that most stocks are broadly correlated - Nikkei falls, the Dow falls, FTSE falls, although there is variation that is a broad tendency - this is statistical correlation. The gold price and individual currencies have a lower correlation. In terms of an individual or corporate portfolio having a basket of largely non-correlated assets tends to provide stability to that portfolio (i.e. one does well, 2 do badly 3 are ok).
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:34:49
Maybe someone can help me. I have tried to connect to the GDAX ticker feed, using winsock/VB6 but failed miserably. I would really appreciate any help..
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:12:54
I'm a Brit, I have a GDAX account - hard to get as I was not in the UK at the time, but it works fine. Only problem is getting money in/out. I used Coinfloor to buy BTC &amp; transferred across to sell some. When I exit the market I'll do the reverse if coinbase still don't take / send in GBP. Note: I read in the papers that coinbase would but that was back in FEb I think and they still don't.
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:51:47
Interesting, thanks
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:11:30
hmm, I thought that was a few days ago, I guess a while away. But then I know little about it
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:01:37
I would kind of expect a correction, of my "bitcoin money" I am only 20-25% in atm, waiting for another dip.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:09:34
May I assume that 'foh' is rude? I rather think it is, there is no need for that in this forum. As BC... says, you clearly do not have a good grasp of the English language. I am not being rude, it is very probably not your first language so one makes allowances.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:01:18
I would add that the plural of index is 'indices'.
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:40:04
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:35:52
We seem to have reached another plateau. Anyone with some ideas which way it moves from here?
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:56:57
It depends where you are. If (like me) you are GBP based it is difficult. When I take some out, the only way I see that working is sending BTC GDAX to coinbase, then sell &amp; withdraw from there
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:45:58
I would say in terms of investment advice here, only listen to "buy the dips" and DCA (in my case Pound Cost Averaging). The first has an implied corollary, which is to sell into the spikes so you have cash available to buy the dips. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:29:44
hmm, what happened to shortythebear? Has been quiet recently
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:14:26
I said 6 days because the 1k spike is more than 6 days ago. I follow in GBP and there has been little more than 100 either way since then.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:49:06
gotta call it right every time ;)
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:33:30
39 times must be understating it, surely? Yes, hurting me too, I am down about 8% - but is only on around 10% of my investments.
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:11:36
Maybe your price was as high, or higher, than existing sell orders?
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:14:17
Maybe I am thick, but what does that mean? You have 39 bitcoin and no cash?
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:50:06
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:20:23
some are!
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:19:20
And when will you come back in?
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:46:01
yep, roller-coasters are FUN
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:47:47
I forgot to add that Romania is also an "unsupported country"

atm looks uppish but who knows
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:23:12
Good comment. I guessed about the same turn point as you - but I couldn't resist selling a bit in the range 6,400 to 6450 (in GBP). Now buying back into the dip .... About 1 Bitcoin re-bought so far!
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:07:52
We shall see
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:45:01
Yes you can - it is based on your login and not on your IP location. I am currently in Romania and have no problems (though GDAX had to change my location to the UK in order to get verified!). So that was a hassle, but no problems now based on location.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:49:49
lol, thx for the smile you put on my face
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:16:09
You must be a Yank;) I read Maths at Balliol (at school double Maths, Physics &amp; Chemistry A-levels)
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:06:13
Just ask Mr Pui (= chicken in Romanian btw) if you want to know where the price is going. He claims to know all of his trades for the whole year so he must know what the price will be at any point. I do not.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:26:17
Just relax - buy more in the dips and you should make money. Been a crazy day with + 100, -100 in the same minute. Kept me busy;)
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:36:31
HA HA. It's called a 401 scam.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:58:04
And which way will it go?
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:42:17
Really? Hardly any movement in the last 6 days. Looks pretty stable atm, just trading in a small range.

Wales is a country, whales are mammals
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:53:25
It appears to be 12:52 ET. Is that correct?
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:43:56
Why is it the right direction? Just asking, I am uncertain how things will go, so I am about 60% of "bitcoin money" in cash.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:02:39
Indeed. Perhaps Andrix was thinking about leeks - one of the symbols of Wales?
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:19:29
Tough call, I empathise. Don't take advice from anyone, do what you want. But for sure I am buying on a fall, dunno about a rise.
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:52:06
Today? No way, Jose
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:09:44
If it doesn't move up again next hour or two, think you are right. Dunno what volumes are like, but seems to be quite volatile in a narrow range atm.
