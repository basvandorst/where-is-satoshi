We will be releasing details on our methodology for settling balances when we bring the site back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:07:47
We're updating the page now, you should be good to go in a second. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:12:31
We will have another announcement today UTC time. I understand the gravity of the situation and I'm doing everything I can to keep people up to date. As soon as I have information I can share I will be sure to do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:42:54
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:05:45
May i ask where this 6:00 UTC number is coming from? Positions that were directly affected will be settled using the price as of 18:00 UTC, positions that were not directly affected will remain unchanged upon relaunch. At least this is my understanding at this time, our plans for what we do upon relaunch are not yet solidified so i can't say concretely one way or the other, but i will continue to post updates on this as they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:04:15
No USD was stolen in the theft, we'll be announcing our plans in relation to settling balances as soon as we can. We hope to have something up shortly. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:18:36
Thank you for the support, i appreciate it. I'll try as hard as I can to keep everyone updated with straight up answers. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:20:59
There were a number of security practices that were in place to make this the most secure, yet transparent way of securing funds and we used the company that prides itself and specializes in bitcoin storage. How these practices were bypassed, we're still investigating.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:24:37
We can't bring the site up for withdrawals until we are wholly confident that that the site is secure. We're taking every precaution  we need to prevent anything from happening upon relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:10:40
Yes, many users have posted the addresses that their bitcoin was withdrawn to. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:44:43
We need to settle all positions on all pairs across the entire platform.


We will be posting an explanation of how the positions were settled when the site comes back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:00:25
Yes, I believe so. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:05:26
Clef wouldn't have provided any protection in this case. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:13:10
I believe so, however I can't confirm one way or the other. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:45:05


I really don't understand how this is relevant. They could have capped the investment like mycelium did when they raised money. Just because you didn't expect to have a lot of money doesn't make it alright when you lose it. 


Like i said elsewhere in the thread, this doesn't make it better... Basically you're saying at any point in the future if another large scale hack happens we'll need to roll it back and do another Hard Fork. Your proof-of-whatever shouldn't be so susceptible to being ruined by a single bad actor that it will require outside intervention anytime something goes wrong. If polo gets hacked is that another hard fork? What about an early adopter?


Where are you getting 15%? The DAO hacker stole 3,600,000 of what like 81,000,000 ethereum? that'd be 4%. And Mt. Gox had a claimed loss of 850,000btc when there were approximately 10.8 million btc. so about 8% of existing btc. So it was actually about twice as much being held by a malicious individual. But look at the threads suggesting a hf back then, they were laughed at because there was a single understanding among everyone, the blockchain is immutable. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:21:46
I believe when we enable withdrawals that will be an option, but i am not certain at this time. We'll start trying to address more questions about withdrawals tomorrow, we're working on getting the site up right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:03:11
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:12:06
We will be explaining our reasoning in a post tomorrow. 


The Bitcoin was stolen from segregated customer wallets, however that does not mean that only those who had btc in those wallets were affected so it is not that straightforward. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:49:13
Yes, any positions that were directly affected by the hack may be involved. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:40:52
We are working with authorities in the states and europe as well as top blockchain forensic companies like chainalysis who has confirmed this publicly (in a reuters article I believe). We don't have any more details that we can share at this time, as soon as we have an update i'll be sure to share it. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:19:21
You will have an update tonight. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:48:45
We did not sweep funds so it is unlikely that transaction was initiated by us, however without knowing your username, transaction, or being able to check on the website i can't confirm one way or the other. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:01:46
As i've told you several times, we have not yet reached a conclusion on how we will be addressing losses. When we have reached a conclusion, we will post an update. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:21:12
This attack bypassed any 2fa or address lock restrictions that may have been enabled on your account.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:59:47
Still preparing to bring the site up for users to check the state of their accounts. We'll put up an announcement as soon as we're ready. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:55:39
Our plans for addressing customer losses will be announced, yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:04:04
You're welcome, let me know if you need anything else. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:35:26
Not sure, USD withdrawals will not be enabled until Monday at the soonest as the banks are already closed for the weekend. I don't know if crypto withdrawals can be enabled before that or not. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:15:01


I did not mention that, all bitcoin stored at bitfinex was with bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:19:27
Thank you for the support, and no, no i didn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:55:31
Apologies, can you please clarify what you're asking?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:51:19


Yes, we are considering all options. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:50:30
We control the keys to those wallets. I've never claimed otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:31:05
At the very least we figure we should be transparent and communicative with our users. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:51:05
We haven't left that possibility out but are quite positive with a high degree of certainty that it was not an inside job. 


Quite. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:45:48
His accounts were created today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:25:43
No etc was stolen so he would be incorrect. We are sure that there was no ETC lost in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:11:47
The details have not yet been finalized, we will be clarifying this in our updates that are to follow. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:36:04
Thank you very much for the support, we really appreciate. We're doing everything we can to do right by our users and keep them up to date, so it's always nice to see messages like these. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:46:15
No, that would not be normal. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:52:13
One thing that you're failing to mention is that Bitstamp covered that at prices of like $250, the price is quite a bit higher than that now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:18:28
The site has been taken down, so no. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:10:28
I cannot check to see if your btc was stolen or not. However if it wasn't moved out of your address then it wasn't stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:53:47
The update is up right now: 
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:38:07
I'm not sure i understand your logic, the email states both bitgo and non-bitgo enabled accounts can be processed as soon as a minute after approval with a 12 hour maximum. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:21:51
We will be making a post tomorrow addressing the losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:10:53
They wouldn't be allowed to trade them. We'll have more information on this in following updates. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:31:38
If you have a withdrawal hold due to the recent password and 2fa update, please submit your withdrawal anyway and we will process it, if we need any additional information we will email you.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:17:49
Raphael is our founder, that's pretty well known since he was the one who interacted with bitcointalk when he opened bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:50:31
me too. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:48:48
I don't believe we will bring it up with transfers enabled, but not sure. Wait for the announcement for the details. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:31:02
No problem. I'll try to keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:41:26
We're still evaluating all of our options, we haven't finalized anything yet and details are still forthcoming. We'll be making an announcement with a bit more substance later today UTC time. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:59:41
We're actively tracking all transactions related to the breach. We've also reached out to all the best firms in the space that specialize in this and are working with authorities as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:39:12
This is part of our ongoing investigation, at this time it doesn't look like it, it appears to have been focused on the btc. However, the investigation is an ongoing process, it has not yet been completed. When we have more details from the conclusion of the investigation, we will share them with the community. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:28:29
We don't have any plans for trading yet, we're just focused on getting the site back up and users balances/positions settled. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:05:17
No. While we are still investigating what happened i'm very confident nobody from bfx had anything whatsoever to do with this. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:39:08
EST, but it's looking like it will be late EST. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:31:31
If you have a withdrawal hold due to the recent password and 2fa update, please submit your withdrawal anyway and we will process it, if we need any additional information we will email you.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:02:19
We've never given users preferential fees, whales or otherwise. It opens up a lot of potential problems. But as the user pointed out, it could be taken out of balance at time of trade but reimbursed at the end of the day or something. That's a more viable solution. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:26:27
We cannot release any information as the investigation is ongoing. When we can publish these details, we will do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:24:11
No problem, i'll try to the best of my ability to keep everyone updated. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:20:43
This is correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:52:27
There is no way that we could have missed it upon settling balances to the blockchain the next day. The system couldn't settle if the coins aren't there. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:09:26


That's a complete lie, he never said he used that information to trade at bitfinex. 


We don't have a single brit or hong konger working for Bitfinex... Edit: Correction, we have one brit. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:19:31
That's one of the options that we're considering. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:13:11
Yes, we have no reason to believe it is legitimate. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:53:54
I understand that you are tired of waiting and would like to check the state of your account, we want to get the site as soon as possible as well. We are doing everything we can and working around the clock to get this handled and the site up. We don't have an exact time that we can get the site up, however.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:46:12
We are currently exploring options similar to this and the viability of those options. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:18:15
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:29:14
Right now we're concentrated on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We don't have any details about how we will go about processing withdrawals at this time. We will have an update with more substance on this later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:54:33
There is no way to offer USD outside of the margin system. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:20:22
I'm not sure but i think someone created one. I'm not going to create one, but if someone does and gives me the link i'll respond to people in there. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:21:55
Fair point. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 20:20:56
I'm sorry, i'm not sure I understand. If email isn't suitable, what would you prefer to use?
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:09:08
I'm saying that after we handle losses, however that may be, he will be able to withdraw USD. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:16:24
All bitcoin stored at bitfinex was in segregated customer wallets with bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:39:26
Yes, it has stopped any funds from moving. I don't know what you mean our two addresses, i assume you mean the two private keys? We're still investigating what exactly happened but it doesn't appear as if both of our keys were compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:01:07
I don't know what information you're looking for, but as to your lost funds: We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:28:23
When I say the funds are safe I am explicitly referring to the fact that they are not susceptible to being hacked right now. We have not yet worked out the details on what we'll be doing to address customer losses. When we have more information on this I'll let everyone know, that should be later today btw. 


Thanks! Just trying my best to keep everyone updated. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:07:10
I can confirm that not all customer funds were lost. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:06:01
He's wrong, I can at least confirm that not all btc was stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:43:53
Let me see if we can lift the 5 day holds. I would like to reiterate that I don't know if greenlaned users will have their withdrawals automatically processed, but i could see that being the case. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:24:27
I'll make an update to the statuspage as soon as we have an update ready to share. And I hope so. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:05:20
only bitcoin was stolen in the hack, no LTC/ETH/ETC/USD was stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:23:49
We can't disclose any information about the hack at this time as the investigation is ongoing but i'll try to keep everyone informed to the best of my ability as this information can be shared. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:15:48
To clarify, i meant that it looks like the compromise was on our end. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:52:00
That is not correct, i updated my statement to clarify that it is only USD that we cannot allow unverified accounts to withdraw. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:05:00
This is the outcome that our team and legal counsel arrived at as the best decision. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:56:40
I do work on weekends, i worked until past 8am this morning without sleep. Woke up, finalized the announcement, and we put it out: 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:56:19
Number is erroneous as are any further plans. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:03:11
So it seems like it wasn't based on any email list from our site as i've heard this from most that i've spoken to. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:00:25
we said 24-48 hours. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:14:03
We can't disclose any information about the investigation as it is ongoing. As to how things will look moving forward, we'll have to see how things go. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:00:20
Your bfx wallet wouldn't have been correctly displaying your bitcoin balance from the blockchain, so i wouldn't say that's a good point of reference. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:48:06
No problem. If you need anything, just let me know. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:53:01
No LTC was lost in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:54:55
I'm not sure yet. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:52:57
Because manually processing withdrawals is much more secure, especially considering that everyone needed to update their passwords and 2fa.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:44:55
We don't have an office where everyone works, we are a decentralized company with employees all over the world. But we do have a bunch of people on the phone. Phil is taking this as best he can, he's focused on his work though, as we all our. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:08:04
I never denied that we were hacked. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:57:53
We'll make that announcement later today when we bring up the site with limited functionality. Trading/withdrawals will not be live upon relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:06:03
Trading is live. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:30:52
You would be able to withdraw it via a wire transfer if you're already verified. I'm not sure what other options will be available upon enabling withdrawals (because I don't know what the state of trading will be at that time, so converting to btc/etc/whatever might not be possible). 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:50:21
We're still looking at all options, however your suggestion comes with a litany of problems that make it not really viable. If some users pay 0% forever regardless of maker/taker than it opens it up the market to manipulation from those who have 0 fees through things like wash trading for example. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:35:00
We have taken down the exchange section as we are currently running some tests. We'll have it back after everything is wrapped up. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:42:46
I'm the Director of Community &amp; Product Development for bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:23:35
We are not able to release specifics about the investigation as it is currently ongoing. I'll release this information as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:08:19
I've been using this account for over two years starting at when i was at OKCoin. You can look through my comment history and see that i do in fact represent bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:37:38
I can confirm that the loss from the hack stands at 119,756btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:24:20
No problem, i'm just trying to help everyone get through this horrible situation. It sucks for everyone involved, it's crushing to see something like this happen. Thanks for the support. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:19:33
it's alright a smile makes everything better. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:27:33
You will need to email compliance [at] bitfinex.com they will be best suited in helping you get verified. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:07:54
It's relevant.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:47:31
No, it affected individual positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:40:32
I never said that is what's going to happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:39:51
Just because the hot wallet was hacked and we lost 1500btc does not mean the hot wallet held 1500 btc. Btc deposited after the hack was still subject to being stolen by the hacker. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:24:42
I'm not sure, i'd say the best course of action is to email compliance, that ensures that we receive your documents and can start the verification process. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:50:22
If it's still in the bitfinex address on the blockchain then they bitcoin hasn't been moved. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:48:07
If you googled Bitfinex CEO the second result was JL's linkedin. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:04:36
Yes, they are. This attack bypassed the restrictions enforced on users. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:49:58
Then you'd be looking at the computer illiterate person of the bunch, cause Im the one who came up with that line. And i can say that because of how things have played out and the information that we know at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:48:53
I believe that the decision was made as this is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context.
I'll pass it on and let you know if I hear back. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:49:08
What time frame are talking? Right now? Yes, it's secure as all operations are down. When the site comes up? Yes, it's secure because we're only coming up with limited functionality and no withdrawals. When withdrawals are enabled? We are still working on securing the site in a new environment, we will not take withdrawals online if we are not confident in our ability to secure the funds. After this is all resolved? We will have to do a complete evaluation of our systems before i make any statements on that. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:45:54
Grams? Sorry i'm not sure i follow.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:23:37
You will be able to transfer and go to the exchange page once the exchange feature is enabled. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:44:54
Yes, we have had a lot of users suggest this to us. We're looking into the viability of this. As i've said, we're open to all options. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:20:46
Thanks for the support. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:38:14
~~This was before the migration to bitgo was complete.~~
Misread the post, the text in the op referring to hot wallets is in reference to ltc/etc/eth which we use a hot/cold wallet setup for storage. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:46:25
Can you send me the link of that. i'm just replying to messages as quickly as possible, i haven't had time to look in the threads to see the conversations. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:49:09
I just confirmed that there will be no greenlaned withdrawals upon launch, all withdrawals will be manually reviewed and approved.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:30:03
We're not going to be bringing the site up and thus allow withdrawals until we are certain that the site is secure. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:22:22
All I was saying was that the compromise was on our end and it didn't appear bitgo was compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:58:34
That was a very dumb comment on my part. What i meant is that the hackers ability to bypass 2fa and access to all the individual wallets does not mean that it's an inside job. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:26:22
Not sure right now. We're still investigating the scope of the breach and exactly what we need to do to relaunch. We don't have these details as of right now but I'll post them as soon as I get them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:38:31
I'm sorry, but can you please explain what you mean? What wallet is holding your bitcoin, does it begin with a 3 or 1? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:48:41
I wish that was the case. Unfortunately we're fairly certain it was not. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:49:24
It's completed bs with no source. I'm talking to our CEO, he isn't on the run. This is pure fud. 
edit: besides, they're implying our ceo is the founder, but our ceo and founder are two different people. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:37:25
Let me see, i'll update this comment when i have an answer. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:29:12
I'm not sure, we'll have to see. It's a fluid situation and i'm still waiting on an update, so i don't know right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:56:11
It is susceptible to being affected by the hack, it does not guarantee that it was affected by the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:34:06
Man, i'm trying to respond to everything that I can as fast as I can. I'll try to get to it asap, but please bear with me. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:39:36
Our team on the east coast is still working on getting the site up, the last time i asked they said they think they will be able to get it up. That's all i know. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:32:01


I did that last night mentioning that we were leaning towards doing a socialized loss among btc holders and those with usd backing a BTCUSD position. 


I think it's only fair to open it up to everyone at the same time. As soon as i can release details on how the losses were assessed, we will do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:44:56


We are still evaluating the various options to address customer losses, but at this time we don't have any details to share on this. I'll be sure to post updates as they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:48:18
(a) we wholeheartedly agree (b) What areas would you like to see more transparency in? Please remember that details will continue be published as they become available. We're still conducting an investigation and can't release a lot of details right now. A lot of other details still haven't been finalized so we don't want to make any premature statements. I would like to hear where you think we can improve though. (c) we are tracking the coins and are working with the top blockchain forensic companies. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:02:28
No. None of the code from Bitcoinica had been in production since 2013. There wasn't a single line of code from bitcoinica running on bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:19:17
Yes. We hope to have the site up sometime tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:41:01
USD balances that are not loaned out would not be subject to the socialized loss. So if you USD was just sitting in your account it is not subject to the socialized loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:17:34
Only me that I know of, i'm pretty sure it's just me. Can you link me to any comments of someone stating to be with bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:21:01
You would need to check with your bank to see if they can convert the USD as that is what we will wire out. You will need to email compliance with all of your verification documents. That's the quickest way to get started. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:26:02
Don't have an eta yet. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:45:38
Thank you for clarifying that, they were created today. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:01:03
That's pretty cool, thanks for helping out!
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:35:26
Can you please resend it? My inbox is a mess. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:23:05
Dont have an eta yet but should have an update soon. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:42:10
I think that's only fair, i know we have a lot to make up for here, we're doing everything we can to reach the best possible solution. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:27:51
Please contact compliance for details regarding verification. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:31:55
Not 100%, there are two things happening that we were trying to coordinate, the announcement and the site coming back up, i'm still trying to get an update on how we're coming on the latter and if it's much longer if we can proceed with some sort of announcement first. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:43:43
The site is down and will remain down until we can decide what we what to do upon relaunch. When we have the details for our relaunch i'll be sure to share them with everyone, but at this time we do not have any information on this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:16:14
By safe I mean that it would not be susceptible to having of that USD involved in the heist. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:51:05
As soon as I can share an update, i'll post it. We don't have any new information to share at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:01:26
We've posted an update, i just posted it on reddit and the blog. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:32:46
We're still investigating exactly how our limits were bypassed. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:18:58
Your assumptions are incorrect. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:19:41
No problem. let me know if there's anything else you need or if you have any other questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:42:06
trading still offline with no eta, i think it'll at least be a couple days before we finalize any plans for trading. We'll give heads up before anything regarding trading happens. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:10:22
Pretty much, yeah. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:22:01
I can confirm that no LTC, ETC, or ETH were stolen in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:51:41
There's no proof linking that guy to our hack, but sure, feel free to let me know if you get 1000btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:54:23
As stated in the announcement:


@_date: 2016-08-04 18:00:44
When the site comes up there will not be any withdrawals, bitgo is not signing any transactions, we will not bring our systems up for withdrawals, as such we should be secured from an attack. After that we will make an announcement addressing plans for withdrawals and how they will be secured. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:55:19


@_date: 2016-08-03 12:23:05
The insurance fund hasn't been around since I joined the company over a year ago. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:52:20
Can you dm me more information. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:22:14
No, it happened today. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:24:49
I have no idea, but i wouldn't be surprised if in the process of evaluating the viability of these options something like that happened, but i really don't know. 
Edit: It doesn't look like we did those. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:10:10
They didn't use the quote from the press release, here it is:


 &gt;&gt;...We are committed to releasing updates and reports detailing the events of the hack and a financial update for customers and qualifying investors before we begin any equity conversion and have engaged third parties to complete this process.”
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:50:07
It wouldn't, no, it's only for crypto withdrawals. 


I'd like to clarify that we will not be enabling auto-processing of withdrawals upon bringing the site back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:58:44
I cannot release a list of all the banks that we work with. As to your other question, i don't believe you'll be able to move anything when the site comes back up as it will have limited functionality but please wait for the announcement to confirm this. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:33:14
And that is fair, we'll be processing all express wires within 24 hours. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:22:28
We are going to keep the site down until we are 100% certain that the site is secure and that is safe to bring everything back online. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:57:20
About 25 i think. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:36:31
Probably later. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:11:37
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll try to do that today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:34:33
We can't release any information regarding the investigation. We'll share information with everyone as it become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:46:15
Since i know that isn't what's going to happen i'm not really considering that. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:14:49
We don't have an ETA for a follow up announcement and relaunch yet. I'll post updates on this as soon as I can. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:44:59
It's not from us. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:00:41
no and we still don't have any plans regarding trading. We're focused on getting the site up with limited functionality first. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:47:12
That is correct.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:29:11
That was before the migration to bitgo was completed. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:44:36
That may show you a portion, but your bitgo HD wallet and balance is often spread across more than just those three addresses so looking at only those three it may be misleading. We showed all the bitgo wallet addresses related to your account in our reports section.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:52:08
We know for certain that it is a hack. We can see that the bitcoin has been withdrawn from multi-sig addresses to addresses beginning with a 1. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:39:20
I'm in Amsterdam. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:52:31
I don't see how we could do that, apologies. We're trying our hardest to get the site back up, but even when the site comes online it will not have trading enabled at first. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:00:48


Yeah, seen that a few times from you now, i completely agree. I'm trying the best i can to be as transparent as possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:37:47
No, you are still using bitgo even if you never went through a setup process. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:25:07
Thanks for pasting that here. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:44:55
Good advice. I think that's probably wise. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:58:39
It would mean that your funds have not been withdrawn by the hacker, yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:22:23
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
I can't really say what is or isn't out of the question at this time as we are concentrated on tracing the funds, working with authorities, and investigating what happened. When we free up some more time we'll be focusing on what we're going to do from here on. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:31:43
No, you can see the btc that has been stolen on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:41:16


We will be releasing our plans for addressing losses and what we'll be doing in regards to withdrawals today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:37:13
Thanks for the support, to answer your question:
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:24:40
Whaleclub is a name only, it's like if I create a Millionaires club, but anyone can join, the name doesn't have any bearing on who is involved there. It's just another social media outlet, just like reddit, and they know that anything they say there is going to get posted here. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:00:51
No problem. If you have any other questions just let me know. Thanks for kind words.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:56:59
We're exploring all available options. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:15:34
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:22:19


How did you arrive at that conclusion? That is not true. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:51:04
My assumption with what he meant is that the user didn't login to users accounts which may imply that login credentials have been compromised, which isn't the case here. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:19:45


We cannot release details about the hack as the investigation is ongoing. 


We will do a complete review of our security practices. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:51:40
You don't think I have any money on bitfinex? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:06:56
For now you will need to email compliance 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:04:00
They are part of an HD wallet created for each user. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:26:19
Yes, what wallet the coins were in had no bearing on whether or not they were taken. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:44:07
quite late est
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:33:11
Yes, they were. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:10:34
Stay up, it's going live in an hour and 50 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:42:52
We don't have any details that we can share yet about when withdrawals will be reenabled. As soon as this information comes available i'll be sure to let everyone know. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:43:49
I don't know how you can say there hasn't been much transparency, i haven't stopped typing since i found out about this and i'm telling everyone as much information as we can. 
1) We are still evaluating our options for how to address customer losses, but at this time have not come to a conclusion or reached a point where we have details that we can share. 
2) We haven't finalized our plans for relaunch so at this point i can't say either way. Although I do believe that unaffected positions would be left unchanged upon relaunch. This is not set in stone yet and i do not know this for certain. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:50:57


We have provided that info:


And we did not say we don't have any information about the hack or no idea as you claim, we said the exact attack vector is unknown. However, we cannot release information about an ongoing investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:34:56
We believe in being as transparent and communicative as possible, no matter what happens. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:23:26
We're doing everything we can to accomplish that, but i'm saying that saying "no one gets their money back" is inaccurate, i know that people will be getting money back. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:05:01
We are still conducting the investigation to understand the details of the compromise. We'll share the details when they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:07:54
We don't have an ETA at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:13:58
Sorry, that wasn't a very clear answer, i should clarify. 


This is why I said no, the transactions were signed by us first and then bitgo. Sorry for not making that more clear. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:04:56


This has always been available since bitgo's implementation. Go to the top right drop down menu, reports -&gt; Bitgo Wallet Addresses, it gives you all the addresses that have been used to hold bitcoin for your account, including change addresses. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:05:41
This is incorrect.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:16:02
Still working on settling balances and positions, we won't be able to know until that's completed. So, i really don't know, sorry. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:42:34
Apologies, that was a typo, i've edited my comment to reflect the correct date. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:49:40
We're monitoring what's happening with them but at this time we haven't seen a single piece of proof linking him to hack so it's better not to jump to conclusions. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:18:04
Tomorrow. We'll also be making statements about how we will address the losses and give an update on the status of withdrawals. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:49:22
As i've said several times, we are looking into what options we have for addressing the losses, but as one could probably imagine it is not a simple process and there are a lot of scenarios that need to be considered and details that need to be worked out. 


We do not have an eta for enabling withdrawals. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:53:48
not the best time to look into hiring. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:23:55
No trades were performed on our site with stolen funds, the funds left our site and never came back. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:16:46
I'll have them take a look again but it was my understanding they weren't related to the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:10:38
1. Two forms of identification from a government authority with photo (such as a Passport and Driver License [both sides])
2. Bank statement
3. Proof of address (no older than 90 days) outside of your banking information
4. KYC Declaration form 
5. Source of Funds Questionnaire 
We will attach 4 and 5 in the email for you to fill out. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:07:53
His account was created today, anybody could have made that. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:21:04
No, not that I know of. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:16:48
ETA for what? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:16:46
Thanks for the suggestion, i'll start taking a look if i keep getting similar messages from users like that.
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:50:49
If you transferred btc around the time the site was taken down then we would still have control of those funds. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:59:00
Thank you, i'll try to keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:57:17
I'm 23, and what would you prefer? we go silent and don't communicate what's happening. It's a terrible situation, but we still need to do everything we can to service our customers so that's what we're doing. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:38:16
a lot of people on here know and flibbr talked to giancarlo, our CFO. Other users on teamspeak have been in touch with phil, our Chief Strategy Officer. So there's been more people on our side talking than just me. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:10:12
Site definitely isn't down, i suggest you try again.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:40:16
I should be using better terminology, you are correct. It should state that the insurance fund was removed. And furthermore, if you read the announcement you'll see that we were announcing that we would cover any losses arising from extreme volatility and the inability to close a position before it goes in the red. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:50:03
1. It started earlier today, i'm not sure exactly what time. 
2. no. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:34:31
Yes, that is what happened. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:32:01
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:37:59
No, that would mean if you had USD loaned out in margin funding and used to back a BTCUSD position it would be included in the socialized loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:33:01
Highly doubt it, a lot of people have been trolling us claiming to be the hacker. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:04:06
I've passed this onto our team, they'll look for a fix. In the meantime i would suggest contacting support. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:27:52
Yes. We keep full reserves at all times
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:24:26
I'm not able to release any detailed information on the hack, but i can assure you not everything was lost. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:32:40
Our kyc procedures are in place to satisfy banks, we can't just remove those and let people withdraw USD. Banks don't allow for withdrawals from unverified parties. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:45:00
We're working as hard as we can to get the site ready to bring back up. As soon as we've accomplished everything we need to--e.g., settling balances and affected positions--we make an announcement. I'm not sure how long this will be but we're trying to get it taken care of asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:02:56
Under the scenario that we have mentioned nobody would be losing 100%. The loss would be socialized among btc holders and those with USD backing BTCUSD margin positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:13:32


I've corrected you on this point already, you're ignoring what i'm saying and regurgitating your arguments. I'm not going to respond to you anymore. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:06:26
In the scenario mentioned it would only be for funding used in BTCUSD positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:37:57
I can confirm that the loss from the hack stands at 119,756btc.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:02:38
Yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:08:03
He is correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:33:32
We are not going to enable trading upon bringing the site up so there won't be any forced liquidations when that happens. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:37
Should be good to go. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:20:46
No you can't see the reports section of the site since the site is down. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:43:44
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:27:01
We need to keep the site down while we ensure that everything is safe to relaunch, we cannot bring the site back up before being 100% confident that everything is secure. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:45:57
We are currently exploring options similar to this and the viability of those options. We're open to anything right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:20:02
It'd be pretty hard for him to run when we've been on calls for pretty much the entire day. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:58:54
It is not true.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:39:52
We're manually processing all withdrawals so there will likely be a decent backlog, not sure how long it's going to take. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:19:47
Yes, that's the plan. We're trying as hard as we can to get everything prepped. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:06:41
He is incorrect. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:12:04
We don't have a hot/cold wallet setup, each user has their own segregated wallet.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:39:13
We cannot bring any part of the site up before we are certain that we have a secure environment... that would be disastrously irresponsible. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:02:51
I think we've already begun as i've seen users in mention it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:22:19
My pleasure, i'll try to keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:45:05
We don't have any details right now on how we are going to proceed with withdrawals. Right now we're focused on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We hope to have an update with more substance today during the daytime UTC.
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:30:45
My pleasure, let me know if you need anything. Thanks for the kind words. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:36:25
I realize that missing this deadline again is not good. We have an announcement addressing how we will deal with compensating users and how we settled balances and positions. I tried to get everything ready tonight, but everything still needs to go through final review. My sincere apologies.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:36:13
Our legal counsel has led our efforts in contacting and cooperating with LE in multiple jurisdictions. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:13:35
We're exploring all of our available options right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:36:40
I don't know, i'd have to know your username and be able to look it up on the site, which i obviously cannot due because the site is down
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:29:52
There is no cold wallet, so the first option is off the table. Bitgo doesn't appear to have been compromised, it looks like it was on our end but the investigation is still ongoing and details forthcoming. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:27:28
No problem, thanks for the support! If you need anything let me know, i'll try to get back to you asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:23:37
It isn't a forced liquidation as that would imply that the user has insufficient maintenance margin and that is not the case. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:15:44
I didn't say that BitGo wasn't involved, I said that it doesn't look like they were compromised. And no, I don't believe our back-up keys were compromised but the investigation is still ongoing on how exactly we were compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:00:00
My apologies but I don't have an ETA at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:57:51
Yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:38:02
We have segregated customer wallets, not hot/cold as each user has their own wallet. We can't release details about the breach at this time as we're still investigating, but no, we did no lose all or nearly all of the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:53:23
I understand where you're coming from and in the end you're just trying to figure out what's going on, i can respect that. 


No, i've been passing along a lot of feedback and we're taking all angles into consideration when making these decisions. 
The thing is that the nuances haven't all been figured out yet and we're still working on settling all the balances and positions and we need to completely wrap that up before we can finalize the details. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:10:54
We're open to exploring any and all options at this time. We'll have more information no how we plan to go about this as time goes on. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:15:02
It doesn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:04:25
That was a poor attempt at a faq, we focused on creating a more comprehensive FAQ and are going to be posting that shortly.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:34:03
Feel free to send me a pm, appreciated. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:13:56
No ETC was stolen in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:32:27
We are exploring all options on that front. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:44:45
I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. By cash out do you mean withdraw or convert to usd? Let me know what you mean and I'll try to get back to you with an answer. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:44:52
I'll reach out and see if i can get any information from them. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:16:53
We are planning to bring the site up tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:25:38
I told customer support, they're taking a look. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:47:40
No, that is not what we're suggesting. What we're suggesting is that each user has their own segregated HD wallet. Certain users' wallets were drained by the hack, and others were not, that is all we are saying. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:02:51
All positions will be settled using prices as of 18:00 UTC Tuesday. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:20:07
We cannot release any information about our discussions with other exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:21:15
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:49:28
5% of recovery and for information leading to recovery (but no bounty if no recovery); if multiple persons lead to recovery, share pro rata
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:33:20
Brilliant idea. I should have done that much sooner. Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:33:03
Haircut would not touch alts in the scenario we described last night. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:55:39
If they're still in your bitfinex wallet that means they weren't stolen in the hack and are secure at this time; we have taken down all site operations and bitgo isn't signing any transactions so no more funds can be withdrawn. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:38:21
We need to ensure that the site is secure before relaunching. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:51:11


I don't believe i made any statement to this effect. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:31:34
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:45:51
American users went through a sign up process with bitgo because they themselves were being given one private key. Non-us users didn't have this process. But any user could go to the top right drop down menu, reports, and then bitgo addresses and it would show all the addresses used to store bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:11:09
No, the attack bypassed restrictions such as these. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:16:41


that is correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:58:21
Still investigating what exactly led to our limits being bypassed. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:58:31
Thank you for the support! We really appreciate it. We'll be sure to continue the communication as more details come out. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:00:31
We will be announcing our plans to deal with open positions, those affected by hack and those unaffected. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:13:39
We're concentrating on getting the site back up in a secure instance so that users can access their accounts and check the state of their accounts. After we clear some of this work out of the way we'll have more in depth conversations about our options, but no we do not have a timeline for this. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:30:35
The exchange was shut down right around 18:00 UTC on the 2nd of August. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:35:19
We plan on posting an announcement with details on this later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:41:58
We had other employees responding to tickets, responding on our blog and on facebook plus we've had others helping on twitter. There's more people helping than just me. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:30:37
Yes, it is one option that we're looking at. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:11:29
This isn't insured. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:15:58


Incorrect, everyone's bitcoin was stored with bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:22:25
The address for you trading/deposit/exchange wallet doesn't contain all the btc in that wallet. The wallet is compromised of more addresses than just those three. I'm not sure if you can see all of these addresses on bitgo's site. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:30:58
And we're working on how to address those that incur losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:52:14
You're thinking of alphapoint, and no we didn't end up going with their trading engine/platform. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:14:18
My pleasure, if you need anything, just let me know. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:59:10


that's one hell of a massive leap in logic.


I haven't released any details on what are plans are, so you're taking guesses on what we're going to do. If you read what i said, we don't have any details that we can share on what we're going to do upon relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:12:38
We are evaluating various options to address customer losses but at this time haven't arrived on any concrete plans. We'll be sure to communicate to users what these plans are. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:54:08
No, I am unsure of the process in which users will be able to withdraw their funds as we haven't finalized any plans for this yet. We hope to have an update on this later today UTC time. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:43:45
He's on the phone with us. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:49:38
I am the moderator of okcoinbtc because I worked at okcoin for one year and when i offered to return my modship, they never followed up. I tried handling twitter/reddit and our blog, but within minutes i had over 50 messages on reddit and 500 notifications on twitter. I've been trying my best to keep up with one place, reddit, as i know it will get posted to twitter. You can read about my joining bitfinex here: 
You can also ask the subreddit, they all know me. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:38:37
My money was part of the generalized loss as well. All money on the platform across all assets was part of the generalized loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:16:55
I would assume so, but I can't say for certain until we get everything settled and all the details. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:27:12
No, that is not what i'm saying. Im' saying that no fiat has been stolen and that we have not yet decided how we are going to address customer losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:42:49


Anybody can get their account greenlaned by enabling security settings. And the reason non-greenlaned accounts go through manual review is to protect users' with a hacked account from having money stolen. I don't know why you think verified customers have any preferential exit, and furthermore, i never even said that greenlaned users would have their withdrawals automatically processed, i said i could see it happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:55:46
We're evaluating all of our options right now, i've read the post by David and we're taking everything into consideration. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:29:49
We'll be explaining how positions were settled in upcoming posts. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:46:00
No problem. I'll be sure to keep everyone updated as more information becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:52:37
Your trading activity would likely be irrelevant however I am not sure as we're still investigating exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:56:32
We will be making everything clear as we bring the site back in stages, starting with everyone being able to log in and check the status of their account. At the same time we will be announcing our plans for addressing the losses and what we'll be doing moving forward. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:45:44
Can you describe what you mean by the position liquidation?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:45:41
We're going to need to come up and let users close positions, withdrawal etc at some point. That's what im referring to when i say relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:38:39
My pleasure, i just didn't want it to be misconstrued as us telling users that everything was resolved. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:43:11
All margin trading and trading of bfx tokens. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:38:18
I don't think you'd get in any trouble for that, but I'm not a lawyer. My suggestion would be to chill out.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:32:20


Your statement is incorrect. 


@_date: 2016-08-04 14:06:53
I don't know what makes you think that, we're all still here working on getting this resolved to the best of our ability. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:14:00
We will have an announcement about this later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:21:21


Bitcoin isn't nearly as big of a problem here as fiat. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:38:05
I'm pretty sure we'll get it up today. We made a lot of progress yesterday and our team is quite confident it'll go up today. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:07:49
I'm happy to hear that. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:20:59


There were per account limits as well as global limits set for a certain time frame. Part of the investigation is figuring out how the limits were bypassed. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:12:18
i'm not sure how you're reaching that conclusion. We're settling all positions regardless of margin level. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:40:26
Our team is still working on getting the site up, the last time i asked they said they think they will be able to get it up tonight. That's all i know. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:12:45
My pleasure. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:41:08
in an hour and twenty minutes. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:49:15
The bitgo implementation offered the most transparent method of fund storage while what appears to be a high-level of security. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:25:33
You do realize that all my money on the site is subject to the exact same loss as anyone else's, right?
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:15:22
This will be in our announcement that's coming out later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:48
They do now. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:53:41
Phil Potter is the Chief Strategy Officer. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:50:20
Positions are settled, balances are pretty much done we think we have all the details worked out but are waiting on a couple last things  to wrap up before finalizing our decisions. We're on track to have announce how we will be settling balances tonight. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:32:52
We did have limits in place to prevent against attacks draining our wallets. We're still investigating how the attacker was able to circumvent these limits. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:57:16
I'm sorry, can you clarify what happened. Was your account holding btc at the time of the hack or USD.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:35:21
At the soonest USD withdrawals would be enabled on monday as it's currently already nighttime in taiwan and they don't process withdrawal on non-working days.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:46:19
No, the site is down and will remain down until we are confident that the platform is secure before bringing it back up and allowing the processing of withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:20:39
Thank you for your feedback, we haven't finalized our plans for this situation as of yet, but we will have an update for everyone later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:45:11
I said that there would be an update today EST. We're still working on that.

@_date: 2016-08-06 16:31:49
Yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:55:09
Everyone, i have to sign off for a bit, i have to get some sleep. I'll be back online asap and responding to everyone's messages. Apologies for the delay in getting back to you. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:03:06
To the best of my knowledge, there is no reason to believe that transaction was related to a hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:15:41
You mean when we bring the site back up and people would be able to see what addresses were used for their account?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:56:56
Let me find out. 
Edit: Yes, we do plan on reenabling these reports at some point in the future, i don't have an eta right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:23:09
I don't really know what you want me to explain besides what we put up in the announcement:
As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach. Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC. 
If you can clarify what you want me to answer, i can try to get a more precise answer to you. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:34:41
We're looking at all options right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:42:46
Those aren't contradictory statements; just because you have been given BFX tokens doesn't waive any claims you may have against us. However, if you choose to sell those tokens, you agree to transfer any claims you may have had to the purchaser of that token. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:26:12
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:50:45
Yeah, that's what i ended up doing i think it definitely helped. thanks for the advice. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:46:52
Yeah, i'm not sure, i haven't been watching the statuspage so i wouldn't know the activity on the graphs. I understand that this a very stressful situation for all parties involved, no need to apologize. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:27:53
We are not buying/selling/trading any bfx tokens, it is our goal to redeem all of the outstanding bfx tokens at their $1 face value and will be doing everything we can to achieve that. As such, we will not be buying any of the bfx token on the market. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:51:26
That is correct, this image is not legitimate. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:47:30
I'm working on it man, but i have 20 messages in my inbox, reply to all of them, reload and it's at 25 new ones. I'm trying my best. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:42:27
No problem. They are in hong kong and it's getting quite late, so i'm not sure if you will hear from them during your daytime, but if not you should definitely have something by the time you wake up. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:24:50
It's a very shitty situation, it's crushing to have to deal with this so I really appreciate your response. I'll try to keep everyone updated to the best of my ability. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:38:56
The site is down and will remain down until we can decide what we what to do upon relaunch. As long as the site down you will not be able to access the USD. When we have the details for our relaunch i'll be sure to share them with everyone, but at this time we do not have any information on this. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:36:37
That's the plan, we think we can get it up today. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:40:06
Our team is still working on getting the site up, the last time i asked they said they think they will be able to get it up today. That's all i know. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:15:47
Probably not, but I don't know. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:58:58
Yes, that is a discussion that has taken place. No final decision has been made at this point, but i can assure you that we are not over looking this. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:26:00
This post does include the most up to date information as this is what our customer service put together yesterday, but we are looking to make more posts to the site in the coming days. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:35:59
We cannot let users withdrawal USD with an unverified account. We're evaluating what options we have to help users out in this situation. I hope to have something we can share on this tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:59:21
We're working on tagging the addresses on blockchain.info and are actively working with blockchain forensic companies to track the coins. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:17:22
We haven't decided on any details as of yet, we're still in the process of finalizing our plans. As soon as we do this we'll make an announcement for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:14:36


I'm not sure I understand what you mean here. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:30:27
Actually, what i said was incorrect. I misread the post. This was for eth/ltc/etc which did have a hot wallet, bitcoin did not have a hot wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:34:56
That's my bad, i didn't put the correct status on that page. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:51:25
We're investigating to see exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:17:44
If you had loaned out USD And the person bought BTC with that USD it is obviously susceptible to being directly affected to the hack whereas USD that was not loaned out was not directly affected by the hack as it only targeted btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:45:27
No, that is not what im saying. I'm saying that part of the hack is that they can sweep funds sent to deposit address, as with bitstamp, gatecoin, etc. 


The hack he is referring to happened in mid 2015, before we had the segregated wallet setup. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:29:23
No problem. If you have any questions just let me know, i'll try to get back to you asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:04:33
No problem, I'll try to continue to post updates as they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:13:05
That is correct, we will cover the losses arising from the other side's position not being closed out before going in the red. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:27:02
Trading will begin at 16:00 utc, there will not be a period for only order placing. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:16:32
It means that your account will lose 36.067% of assets, therefor you'd have 63.933%
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:49:30
USD. Sorry, should have clarified, will edit my comment to be more clear. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:10:21
A lot of people sold and pushed the price down. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:22:55
All of our resources have gone into this. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:48:13
No. We've taken everything offline and bitgo is no longer signing any transactions so nothing more can be moved. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:48:52
No problem, we're working on it, trying to get it done asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:04:07
That was the plan and what we strived for, however settling balances and accounts but it's a very time intensive process and is taking longer than we originally anticipated. We plan to have it up tomorrow.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:44:46
I believe that is correct, yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:45:08
Thank you very much, i really appreciate that. I'll try to continue to keep everyone updated as best I can. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:48:09
I moved to china for a year and a half after high school, did a semester at CU and then moved back to china for 2+ years and started working. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:52:14
I really don't know, my apologies. I should be able to post more about the status of wires both incoming and outgoing tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:36:36
We haven't finalized any plans for reenabling trading so I'm not sure when you would be able to convert it to crypto. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:32:02
We'll take a look, thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:17:49
I've already mentioned several times that we would be forgoing the 5 day withdrawal lock do to people resetting their passwords/2fa. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:03:05
All accounts and all assets. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:07:28
That is incorrect, we did not lose all of the customers funds. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:27:14
There were limits in place to restrict the amount of btc that could be signed for a withdrawal, we're still trying to investigate how these limits were bypassed. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:43:26
I explained how lenders were affected, I made no comment as to how we are going to treat it. There is a big difference as we are still in the process of finalizing the details of the latter. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:38:43
I think we need to give the users access to their funds as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:07:10
The bitcoin was withdrawn to multiple addresses, yes. And from what i've seen all of the hackers addresses start with 1. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:57:18
Thanks for the mention. I'll take a look. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:47:32
Not all bitcoin is stored in the address you deposit to, there are more addresses that compromise the HD wallet than just the deposit/trading/exchange wallet addresses. If you ever went to reports -&gt; bitgo wallet addresses you could see all the addresses used in your segregated wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:08:31
We're planning on having it up today with announcements addressing the majority of questions being asked by users including plans for withdrawals and addressing losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:48:13
What do you want me to clarify?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:16:37
I'm hoping to get one out by tonight EST.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:56:24
We still don't have any details to share regarding our relaunch. We'll have an update with more substance tomorrow during the daytime UTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:52:36
One is dependent on something that has nothing to do with the network and one directly breaks many of the networks rules (e.g., 21,000,000 cap) and required bitcoin to fork with no alternative. A more apt comparison is mt. gox and the dao hack, we didn't roll back on the gox hack. Bitcoin has never bent to the will of a third party, ethereum has, there's a major difference. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:58:44
I don't, i'm sorry i don't have more information for you guys right now. We'll be making an announcement later today that will have this information for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:29:29
No fiat was stolen, only btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:56:36
At this time I cannot clarify any further as the details have not been finalized. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:18:42
We're not sure when we are going to bring the site back up, but yes that is the plan. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:42:47
It says that we will be posting an announcement tonight and that we will be releasing an explanation on how we are addressing those who had used btc to open an ETC margin position. 
Time zone EST. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:01:17
there's no need to apologize. And i don't think those statements are contradictory, I said that the investigation is ongoing but it doesn't appear they were compromised. That isn't to say that they weren't compromised. 


Yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:32:58
We're working as hard as we can on reaching that resolution. I know that time is of the essence here, we're all putting everything we have into this. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:27:52
We haven't solidified our plans for relaunching the site yet. We plan to have an announcement with more substance on this later today UTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:32:13
We're still investigating what exactly happened, but I don't believe so. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:42:14
This is a very shitty situation indeed. It sucks for everyone involved. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:11:23
No problem. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:10:19
Are you asking if the 111btc short will just be written off? because that is not the case. We'll settle positions affected by the hack using prices as of 18:00 UTC yesterday. And we're still evaluating the various options for addressing customer losses. I hope to have an update for everyone by tonight EST, but we'll have to see how everything goes. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:41:34
We're still investigating exactly how the hacker was able to surpass the safeguards that we had in place with bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:13:12
Unfortunately it appears you are correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:36:32
All rested up and ready to go. Only had 80 messages this morning when i woke up... progress. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:29:45
We will be manually doing this as there are scenarios in which the hold will be maintained. If you need the hold lifted please email support. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:23:21
Thank you, i'll try to keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:26:09
I was referring to getting our key. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:47:30
No. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:01:38
We're working on this right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:43:15
I'm the Director of Community and Product Development for Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:58:37


restrictions such as this were bypassed by the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:03:34
We will not be processing any deposits or withdrawals until we complete our investigation of what happened and figure out all the details for relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:24:54
Apologies, but i'm not looking at users' account or post history, i'm just trying to respond to everyone as quickly as possible, i had 80 messages when i came online this morning, i can't look at post history before responding. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:23:52
Nothing as of yet but talks are ongoing. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:41:18
Not that we can share at this time as the investigation is ongoing. When we have more details that we can share, i'll be sure to do that. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:04:57
All bitcoin were secured with bitgo, so if you had bitcoin on the site it was held with bitgo. 


Then that means it was not stolen in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:43:37
I don't know. We'll have an announcement about that soon. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:53:56
We're still investigating what happened and trying to discern the details of how exactly we were compromised. 


We reserve the right to close a users position. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:54:54
Announcement is out 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:44:12
Yeah, it's a shitty situation... But we're doing everything we can to keep users informed. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:54:41
I can't tell you, I have no idea nor do i have a way to check at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:06:44
You can literally see the moment we were hacked because the amount of coins stored in multisig accounts plummeted, this happened yesterday. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:31:50
16:00 UTC
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:37:28


This is not an all bitcoin gone scenario, so yes there most definitely is. 


I believe so, i sure as hell hope so. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:42:37
We also have more details to be announced regarding bfx tokens that we will be posting in the coming days. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:16:01
All positions will be settled upon bringing the site back up, so there won't be any margin calls. Furthermore trading will no be reenabled upon bringing the site back up. Also, the reason why margin funding providers would be affected is that the funds they loaned were possibly used to buy BTC that was stolen in the hack, not because of margin calls. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:33:34
Please email compliance they are best suited to help you with the verification process. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:23:57
Next few hours. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:43:02
All i can say is wait for the announcement, that will answer your questions much better than i am currently able to. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:49:22
Have you ever used crypto for commerce? Could you imagine making a sale, shipping your product, and then learning that some exchange got hacked, and because of that you're transaction is going to be rolled back, you're not getting paid for that stuff you already shipped.  
Yes, i like to know when i look at my bitcoin wallet, what's there is there and isn't going to be affected by some exchange, or dapp, or anything. What is mine is mine and i never have to worry about a hard fork and rollback. That's one of the whole reasons bitcoin was attractive to me. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:59:22
We are still looking at the best way to handle relaunch. At this time I don't have any details that I can share with you but I'll be sure to post information as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:37:13


Your account being compromised isn't exactly the same as the bitcoin being withdrawn, but yes it does mean that the bitcoin held in your wallet have been withdrawn. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:54:49
Yes, there is a chance that your position was affected by the breach. I can't tell you if it was or not, but we are going to be making an announcement later today with more substance on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:18:42
We're still conducting our investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:47:38
I don't really know, we haven't finalized the details for exactly how we're going to be moving forward. We hope to have an announcement with more substance on this subject later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:27:44


Yes, they will be traded on the open market. However we're currently exploring some options for how we can better use these tokens to compensate users. We'll have updates on that in upcoming posts.
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:47:59
I said that the 36% haircut is not being applied to company assets, that is not to say that the amount being contributed is more or less than 36%, that is to say that there wasn't a generalized haircut of 36% across all assets. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:34:38
We don't use cold storage, every user has their own segregated bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:53
Now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:56:11
It's today. I was pasting that sentence and didn't update it. My apologies, i'll correct any mention of tomorrow. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:34:10
I don't know how anyone could think that we've remained quiet. I've been sending messages non-stop with updates and information about what is happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:34:51
I realize that missing this deadline again is not good. We have an announcement addressing how we will deal with compensating users and how we settled balances and positions. I tried to get everything ready tonight, but everything still needs to go through final review. My sincere apologies. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:08:03
I would have to be able to look at your account which i cannot currently do as the site is down. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:44:33
We have things like this in place. We're investigating how they were able to bypass these security practices. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:12:33
Please read the following sentence in that announcement:
Our order book depth and increased volume over the last several months has created an environment where we are comfortable in managing the **risks associated with forced liquidations**
We agreed to cover losses for margin funding providers in the instance that we were not able to close out a position without it going into the red due to volatility, not related to a hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:31:32
Only USD that users had provided for margin funding would be considered loaned out. If you just USD sitting in your wallet it would not be directly affected by the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:56:04


We haven't said this is what we're going to do. In fact we haven't said what we're going to regarding this situation as we still don't know. We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:49:15
We're still in the early stages of the process so I don't have any dates yet, but we'll post more details as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:06:20
He's wrong, I can at least confirm that not all btc was stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:44:40
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:21:11
No problem. Let me know if you have any other questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:14:07
We haven't used the hot/cold wallet setup since our implementation with bitgo as each user has their own wallet that the funds are stored in. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:37:10
I realize that missing this deadline again is not good. We have an announcement addressing how we will deal with compensating users and how we settled balances and positions. I tried to get everything ready tonight, but everything still needs to go through final review. My sincere apologies.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:52:12
compliance 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:36:11
We were hoping we would be able to get it up yesterday, but the amount of work that needs to be done to settle positions and balances is much more than we originally anticipated. We're trying our hardest to get it back up asap. Our plan is to have it up today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:15:20
We are going through and painstakingly combing through everything to make sure it's all ready to be brought online. We've been in constant contact since the hack about the best way to go about this is, and i think we've reached our decisions carefully without rushing. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:35:52
Thanks for bringing this to my attention, it's been updated. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:38:52
If you have a withdrawal hold due to the recent password and 2fa update, please submit your withdrawal anyway and we will process it, if we need any additional information we will email you.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:15:30
No but I know it's something closer to: 


Which is what a user watching the transactions said. I personally haven't been watching the move. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:47:01
It appears so, but we're still conducting the investigation and how exactly we were compromised. We are doing everything in our power to do right by our users. We'll be posting our plans to address customer losses as soon as that information becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:29:52
No we were not sweeping addresses, we just stopped signing transactions as did bitgo, so no transactions can go through right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:11:16
That is still the plan. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:58:13
We're exploring all possible options. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:42:48
The site is down and will remain down until we can decide what we what to do upon relaunch. When we have the details for our relaunch i'll be sure to share them with everyone, but at this time we do not have any information on this.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:52:10
We'll be sharing more information about what options we have as soon as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:10:29
I would say you lost my bitcoin. That's my point. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:30:47
I'm not exactly sure how they'll see their 64% represented, there will be more details on this in upcoming announcements.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:23:17
I'll try to keep it up then. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:42:48
Not in the slightest. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:41:50
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:59:38
Yes, i can confirm that this was sent from our customer support. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:46:01
You will be able to move funds and create API keys upon launch. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:29:24




No, any claims as to how we would compensate users are false. We haven't made any decisions at this time and are still exploring what our options are. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:17:19
They receive a bfx token, however they cannot be traded on the platform. We'll have more details in upcoming posts. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:06:07
You would need to either verify your account or trade your usd for crypto and withdraw. However, since the site is down and operations are paused, you cannot withdrawal for the time being. We're working on ensuring the site's integrity before bringing anything back online. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:42:07
Doesn't appear to have any relation. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:49:40
He doesn't have one because it isn't true. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:00:35
Yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:07:18
I would say you can expect a response by tomorrow. They're in HK so they're probably offline by now, but that means they'll probably respond to most emails by the time the US wakes up tomorrow. But it depends on how many emails we get, we'll try to respond as quickly as possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:48:06
It means that greenlane is irrelevant, some 5 day locks will still apply. Password/2fa resets from logging in when we brought the site back up will not trigger 5 day locks. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:36:37
I've read your comment a couple of times and i'm sorry but i still don't really understand what you're asking. 


I have no idea about their investment and we invested in blockstream, yes. 


We were one of the exchanges that signed up for liquid, yes. 
I don't see how we're related to the 27k bitcoin buy from a year and a half ago. I'm just not really understanding your question, do you mind clarifying. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:17:13
It does sound like it however I couldn't confirm or deny that without knowing your account and being able to look at it on the site. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:22:22
It's because you had USD with Synapse. We're working on getting this resolved. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:45:46
There is no one address that holds on the funds in bitfinex, we use segregated customer wallets so multiple addresses were "hacked" since there is no single pool of funds. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:11:27
Yes I do. Nobody works at the address in HK but we do have people in HK. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:41:43
Where did i say that it was? Not all transactions from the deposit wallet would be from the hacker, we need to settle balances from your deposit addresses so if you look up your deposit address it won't always have the same amount of BTC as you have in your account. But i looked at this users transaction and it went from an address starting with a 3 to one starting with a 1, that means it wasn't an internal transaction. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:06:07
Yes, possibly since the position you were funding could have been affected by the hack. We are working on on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We hope to have an update with more substance today during the daytime UTC.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:33:42


I can see you're a man that's always looking ahead. 
We haven't decided which currency the token will represent, but will have an explanation on this later. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:09:54
Not all trades are settled to the blockchain, the miner fees for something like that would be insanely high. And yes, anyone can check and see that their balance was settled daily. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:53:12
It means that your btc was not stolen from the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:16:19
BTCUSD: $604.06
ETHUSD: $10.1905
ETHBTC: ฿0.016899
ETCUSD: $2.837
ETCBTC: ฿0.00471495
LTCUSD: $3.7518
LTCBTC: ฿0.00621295
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:09:45
Yes they do. Even if you didn't set one up it's what we used to store your btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:19:53
I understand what you mean. I only slept for about 2 hours last night and only ate for the first time today like 30 minutes ago. I hope to have an announcement for everyone up shortly, but we'll have to see how things come along. Sorry i don't have any more information right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:34:12
We have to manually process all of the withdrawals and as you can imagine there are a lot of people withdrawing. We're trying to process everything as fast as possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:05:16
It has nothing to do with authy, we don't even offer authy for logins, only google auth (which can used with authy, but isn't an authy token)
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:52:29
We will give a 2hr notice before starting trading.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:59:34
We can't release any information about the hack at this time as there is an ongoing investigation. We'll be posting updates as they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:47:01
He is incorrect, and you're close on the reasoning, but not completely.
I don't know why he thinks we we didn't pas withdrawals to bitgo as anyone can see that the bitcoin stolen in the hack had two signatures, one from us and one from bitgo. 


We did have limits, per account and global limits. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:56:00
Announcement is out: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:59:36
We'll be evaluating all options available to us, we haven't made any decisions yet but we'll be sure to keep the community updated. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:43:08
There were limits in place, per account and global limits. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:53:40
I want to clarify one thing right off the bat, triumph/synapse is for Americans only and even at that not all Americans were on boarded with synapse. 
I can't verify any details about the balance of your account. I can't get on the site and check or anything like that. 


No USD was stolen in the hack, however USD that was loaned out is susceptible to being affected by the hack as the borrower could have used that usd to buy btc which was then stolen. 
Right now we're just focused on getting the site back up and giving users access to their accounts to see the state of their account. We're also working on how to address the losses and are exploring all options in that regard. We'll release more information after this after we've had some more time to talk about it, right now we're busy working on the site. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:41:35
We are open to all options and are actively looking at ways in which the above can be viable. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:04:53
We have disabled this feature as we have moved all bitcoin to cold storage and no longer have segregated wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:23:04
we'll release more information after our investigation is completed. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:37:34
I really don't know the specifics on how this would turn out. Apologies. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:50:10
The bank would depend on your account, however I can't look that information up right now as the site is currently down. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:24:37
Balances on the site at the time of it being taken down did not accurately reflect the actual balances on the blockchain. We will be addressing how we will handle losses later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:52:46
Btc deposited after the hack was not stolen. I don't believe there will be any special treatment or priority give to them however.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:34:28


The system was compromised, so saying an account was hacked isn't exactly correct. I can say that multiple accounts were affected. 


No. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:05:35
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:07:26
I'm trying my hardest to keep everyone updated. Thanks for the support. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:18:35
I've addressed this countless times, the sound clip is linked in this thread and people can listen to what he said and decide what they think, but arguing with people about it is a waste of time. He did not trade on inside information, or actively trade, he would adjust his position (i think it'd be ridiculous to say if you work for a bitcoin exchange you can never buy or sell bitcoin) and would only use limit orders so as to not move the market. Furthermore his account is monitored by the rest of the team. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:53:00
No. People who have had funds stolen and know their addresses can look on the blockchain and check for themselves though. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:22:07
Not by the person who reserved the margin funding.

Man, i've got nearly 2000 notifications on twitter and every time i send a message on reddit i've got two more waiting. I'm doing all i can, but im maxed out here.

We'll be sure to inform users as soon as we have any details available to share.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:23:40
That's why i said nearly 100%. 


Our counsel has advised to not release any details regarding the ongoing investigation and we're following their advice.

Phil is not the Chief Security Officer, never has been. He's the Chief Strategy Officer. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:38:16
Which wallet the BTC was in has no relevance on whether or not it was taken in the theft. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:47:05
Nope, it's 2:46am and messages are still flying in. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:58:21
I believe that since the btc would be sold for usd that it would not be susceptible to the hack, but i am not certain. We'll have more information on this in the coming updates. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:04:33
Sorry but at this time we do not have an ETA for getting the site relaunched. We'll pass on this information as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:23:52
I said that USD was not stolen during the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:57:07
No, the founder is not the CEO. I've also been talking to the founder the entire day. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:45:58
You're a smart man, we're going to do that. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:46:20
Thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:37:42


That's not true. At Bitfinex we have near-real-time proof-of-reserves (we settle balances to the blockchain at least once a day) where users can independently verify their funds on the blockchain at any time. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:17:44
We cannot release details about the ongoing investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:28:14
He is quite nice. I don't understand why this thread was posted, if you google "Bitfinex CEO" he was literally the second result (now there's more results since this post came up), we've never hidden who our CEO is. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:01:30
Trading is restricted to non-us residents, so no, verified us accounts cannot trade bfx tokens. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:36:55
I realize that missing this deadline again is not good. We have an announcement addressing how we will deal with compensating users and how we settled balances and positions. I tried to get everything ready tonight, but everything still needs to go through final review. My sincere apologies.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:49:59


I believe these to be in tandem. 
Thank you very much for the support and just know that we're doing everything we can do right by our users and get this situation resolved as best as possible. We are still investigating how the limits we had in place were bypassed and will be sure to keep the community updated. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:19:21
Still working out the specifics, but i can confirm that margin funding providers will be affected by this as well. To what extent, I'm not sure at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:35:01
I believe that is correct, yes, as you wouldn't be holding any bitcoin at the time of the hack since you already sold them to open your position. However im not positive, we'll have more information on this in the coming announcements. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:07:56
I'll let you guys know as soon as i have an answer. Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:21:51
Believe me, nobody wants incidents like this to stop more than me. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:26:07
We have a pretty small team and most of us have been here for a while. We also have strict permission limits for who has access to what. Furthermore, i've been on the phone with our entire team and am nearly 100% certain that nobody on our team did this. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:34:50
Alright, thanks for the support!
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:23:22
The first stage gives clarity without compromising security by allowing withdrawals. Stage b/c we're still working on finalizing the details for, so i'm not certain they won't come up together or not, but i don't think they will be at the same time. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:27:42
I'm currently in amsterdam, i was in thailand from march-july. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:35:58
We are exploring all options to address the losses, yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:00:52
But you had funds on the exchange at the time of the hack. The reason deposits made after the hack aren't subject is because those funds weren't on the exchange at the time of the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:15:55
Any deposits made after the hack would still be under our control. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:35:11
At this time I can't tell you that, we don't know as we haven't decided. Right now our stance is that we're only going to close margin positions that were affected by the hack, however this is not set in stone and is subject to change. If there is a change, of course i'll keep everyone up to date on what the details of the change are. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:13:53
Thanks for the suggestion, i'll look into it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:47:46
That announcement was made before we migrated to bitgo. That post was made in January 2015, mid 2015 we migrated to bitgo. So no, it wasn't a typo, it was just outdated on what our security practices were after we switched to bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:27:40
It isn't legal to wire USD without doing kyc, that simple. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:25:10
Some bitgo wallets were drained of funds while some weren't, correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:17:29
Only view your balances. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:50:38
No ETC or ETH is missing. 


Not at this time. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:15:57


Because each user has their own address, so when we were hacked the bitcoin came from segregated customer wallets. Some users can see that their bitcoin was part of the theft, others can see that theirs wasn't. That's the only way to describe it. 


I've said that we're want to bring the website back up for people to close their positions/withdraw as soon as possible, and the first step in doing that is making sure the site is secure. However I've also posted countless times that we have not yet arrived on concrete details for the relaunch and haven't decided exactly how we're going to handle this. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:16:07
We will be opening up the site again for trading/deposits/withdrawals, that's all the details that I can share right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:38:49
ETC balances weren't affected by the hack, we'll post an update about our plans for relaunch later today UTC time. 


Positions that were directly affected by the hack will be settled using the price as of 18:00 UTC yesterday, unfortunately I can't tell you if your position was affected or not as I don't have access to that information myself right now. We are working on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We hope to have an update with more substance today during the daytime UTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:15:38
This attack bypassed restrictions such as those. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:58:07
It's not legitimate. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:09:34
Like i said, not all users received them which is why there isn't a reason it is coming from the breach. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:09:24
We wholeheartedly agree. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:12:01
I'll have someone look into it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:09:11
We don't have any details that we can share about how the relaunch will play out. Currently we are just working on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We hope to have an update with more substance today during the daytime UTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:36:02
our site is down and that is the site you would need to get the complete address breakdown unless i'm mistaken, so you can't get that from bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:57:55
We've made an update to the blog: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:26:13


I never made that claim. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:35:19
That's why we split up our announcements today, because we need to announce the plan for addressing losses when we bring the site up. Since we still had a lot of work to do on bringing the site back we made a smaller announcement to keep users update in the meantime. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:49:59
We are in discussions with potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. However, as one could imagine these talks take time and we are still in the early sages. If there any updates on this front, we'll be sure to communicate it with users. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:15:22
no problem. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:03:37
That's not for certain and I cannot verify one way or the either since I am not able to get on the website and check for you. My apologies. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:58:29
We haven't decided what we're going to do for situations like these. We will need some more time tomorrow to access the situation of open positions and then figure out what to do. Of course during this time i'll be posting updates as soon as they become available. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:22:12
We are tracing all of the coins that were stolen and haven't seen any relation between his transactions and those coming from the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:58:04
That is not the case. The downtime last week had nothing to do with a hack but rather post-trade processing. The reason we were down for as long as we were is because we had to go back and rebuild affected positions from a hiccup in the post-trade processing. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:41:34
If there's a haircut that doesn't mean that he wouldn't be able to verify and withdraw the USD in his account. If there isn't a haircut that doesn't mean that he wouldn't be able to verify and withdraw the usd in is account. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:01:59
Then it is quite likely that your funds were part of the theft. I can't really confirm that right now as I can't look at your account, but if the funds were swept an address starting with 1 it's likely it's controlled by the hacker. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:32:14
 &gt;That means the 2 keys they hold were.
That is incorrect. I said that it looks like the compromise was on our end and not bitgo, i also said it doesn't appear that our key kept in cold storage was compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:56:47
We made the time of the adjustments the time of the site going down as that also matches with the prices we used (they were market prices as of 18:00 UTC 02/08/16).  
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:52:49
we had per account and global limits. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:21:27
What happens when you go the exchange tab?
Withdrawals will likely be done manually, ~~however I could see green-laned users still being processed automatically.~~ Update: No, we will be processing all withdrawals manually. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:32:26
I should be able to confirm this tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:19:42
I don't think newly verified us residents would be on boarded with synapse, in fact i highly doubt it. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:41:11
I can confirm that ETC was not affected by the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:59:34
No it is not. 


Unless it's one of the countries banned from using our services (like north korea) it shouldn't be an issue.

I realize that missing this deadline again is not good. We have an announcement addressing how we will deal with compensating users and how we settled balances and positions. I tried to get everything ready tonight, but everything still needs to go through final review. My sincere apologies.

I've told you in several comments, deposits made after the hack were not stolen and in our possession. We will post updates on our plan to launch withdrawals as soon as we can.

We're currently in the process of trying to discover if anyone without a bitfinex account received these. We have confirmed that not all users received a phishing email (i didn't for example), so we have some reason to believe it wasn't from a leak. However we're still trying to gather more information.

They'd be held by the person borrowing usd.

We would have covered margin funding providers if in the case of extreme volatility a users position wasn't liquidated before going in the red.

Please show me where i've said we didn't get hacked?

If they were used in a margin position with BTC they could have been affected.

We're planning on getting it up today EST. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:01:01
The issue on the 26th was related to post-trade processing and had nothing to do with a hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:14:16
We'll have details about the methodology used tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:47:36
I would be extremely cautious believing anyone claiming to be the hacker. We've already received a lot of reports of different people claiming to be the hacker.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:04:02
Yeah, that's not how it went. We've had our limits with bitgo in since we implemented with them. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:33:30
So what is it, we said that didn't get hacked or we got hacked by my own admission? You can't have it both ways. 
If someone logged into your account and withdrew bitcoin from your account would you email us and say "oh no, someone stole your bitcoin", no they would say "someone stole *my* bitcoin". We may hold customer funds but they're still customer funds. How is this even a conversation, just because we hold bitcoin doesn't mean it's ours. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:22:45
Drew misspoke, some verified US users have accounts through our banking partner synpasepay, these users' USD would be stored in FDIC insured accounts. However, that is not to say that all verified us users had accounts through synapse. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:36:06
The insurance fund from volatility for the margin funding was removed in march 2014. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:25:59
If you have a withdrawal hold due to the recent password and 2fa update, please submit your withdrawal anyway and we will process it, if we need any additional information we will email you.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:02:34
We most definitely intend to release explanations on the methodology used to balance positions and balances. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:49:50
We are still evaluating various options to address customer losses but at this point we don't have any details we can share or conclusions on what we'll do. I'll continue to update everyone as information becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:43:59
All positions were settled at prices from 18:00 UTC on August 2nd, the time the site was taken down. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:11:39
As far as i'm aware, that is still the plan yes.

We are still down, maintenance page is still up.


No problem, i'll try to keep them coming. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:01:47


No, as other users have posted one key from us was used, and then bitgo signed with the other key. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:13:33
No problem, thanks for the support! I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:39:24
There is no way to do that at this time. We're working on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:31:09
To be completely honest, i'm not sure if the fact the trade happened after the hack would mean it can't be fixed or not. Apologies. But right now we're concentrating on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We'll also have an update with more information about what we'll be doing moving forward today UTC time. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:27:28




No, we settled balances to the blockchain once a day. 
If you have any other questions just let me know, i'll try to get back to you asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:02:28
When the website comes up addresses will be correctly reflected. This means that it will also accompany how we are going to address the losses. I will also be making an update about withdrawals tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:50:30
We do.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:11:41
At some stage yes, but I am not sure when that will be. I would recommend sending your verification documents to compliance
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:31:16
You would still be able to use the banks that we have outside of synapse. Not all us customers were on boarded with synapse. 


Doesn't mean you can't withdraw from our other banks. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:58:18
I edited my statement, i misspoke. It doesn't appear to be the right number. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:17:11
Unfortunately, on the site, which is down. However I'm seeing if we can get it up on the blog for everyone to see. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:52:19
Instead of wading through eloquent answers, here's what they're talking about:  
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:36:32
No problem, and no they did not. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:56:51
We've made the announcement: 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:13:34
Yep... going out for dinner is the same as me disappearing. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:58:38
I responded to him. I just went out to grab a bite to eat, sorry for the delay in getting back. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:35:38
During the process of settling balances and positions it looked like several different outcomes would be the most viable at different stages. After flibbr leaked what giancarlo had talked to him about we figured we might as well address them as they were being presented as fact. But I purposely stated that it wasn't set in stone because we hadn't finished settling everything yet. In the end, this was the decision that seemed most prudent. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:26:25
We will be explaining the reasoning behind this in the coming announcements. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:48:57
I just confirmed that there will be no greenlaned withdrawals upon launch, all withdrawals will be manually reviewed and approved. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:46:21
We haven't made any statements about addressing losses as we're still exploring all of our options. We plan to have an announcement about this later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:30:14
I'm going off of EST time as the person doing the majority of the work to get balances and positions settled is in EST time zone. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:52:00
We can't share details on the hack right now as the investigation is ongoing. As soon as I get details that I can share publicly I will do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:57:37
So because we were hacked and money was stolen we shouldn't do anything to protect the funds we have left? That doesn't seem very wise.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:34:18
Only positions directly affected from the theft will be settled, and it will be settled at the price as of 18:00 UTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:25:25
No no no no, sorry, i'll edit this to be more clear.
I don't think stage b and c will come up at the same time. I think it will stage b first and then stage c. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:35:52
1. I'm not sure what time that will happen but we're planning on getting it back up today.
2. When 1 happens we will be making an announcement regarding  
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:10:53
We don't have a hotwallet and it doesn't look like any of the transactions from the address you listed go to an address starting with a 1 which is what the hacker drained the funds to, i'm guessing not. But I really couldn't tell you one way or the other. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:38:52
I don't have any details that i can share on how we are settling balances and how those balances will be affected by the haircut besides saying that only BTC balances and USD loans used in a BTCUSD position are subject to the socialized loss. The details on how the socialized loss would be done are still not decided. As soon as I have more information on how this is done, i'll share it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:07:18
That is incorrect. Balances on the site did not accurately reflect balances on the blockchain at the time of the site going down. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:24:54
We were not sweeping funds, we just stopped signing transactions as did bitgo, since it's a multisig wallet no transactions can be sent now. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:34:12
We are looking at various options on how to address the losses and have received a lot of feedback from the community on different ideas. But yes, we are considering things similar to what you mentioned.

It's a massive leap in logic. Someone stole btc === the exchange themselves stole the btc. That's a huge leap in logic.

I doubt me saying we are processing withdrawals would have carried much weight, referring to a public statement by a user would be preferred by many I think. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:22:27
There will be an update tonight. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:43:10
We are still investigating the scope of the hack and its consequences. When I have more information that I can share on this, i'll be sure to do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:13:55
Yes we do. 


I don't know about the feasibility of blacklisting addresses.

Granted, this is a bit beyond my technical knowledge, but the DAO made for an especially easy "rollback", if you can even call it that, because everything was still isolated within the DAO. But if an exchange is hacked then that ethereum goes all over the place and it becomes a *much* larger problem of getting back and there wouldn't be as graceful of a way to fix it without affecting innocent parties' transactions. 


fair point. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:32:29
We have announced that we will be reenabling withdrawals, we just don't have an eta for when that will be yet. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:55:48
We appreciate the support, thank you very much. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:49:22
Yeah, i never thought it would be such a bad thing to have my name plastered all over major media publications...
Thank you very much for the support I appreciate it. We're doing everything we can to do right by users and get everything resolved. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:36:38
We still don't have any details on how exactly this will be handled. We will be looking at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation, but as of right now we don't have anything information to share on this. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:20:53
Not related in any way. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:46:45
I don't think hiding that from users is going to accomplish anything. I'm trying to give everyone as much information as possible and keep everyone informed. We've always prided ourselves on being transparent and communicative, nothing's going to change that. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:24:33
The investigation is still ongoing and we're working to discern the scope of the consequences for this hack. At this time we're focused on settling the balances/positions and bringing the site back up so that users can see their balances. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:47:28


No. 


We'll be sharing the reasoning tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:16:05
First off, in the interview I say that we're already contributing to cover the loss via bringing on users as shareholders. Secondly, i take about contributing in the settlement of balances/positions and covering that. And [here](
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:58:30
Can you explain what you mean? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:58:06


Yes, lenders, and we will be releasing more details about this tomorrow in our explanations. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:20:27
1) We will evaluate various options to address customer losses, but at this time haven't come to a conclusion on how we're going to handle this. We'll continue to post updates with more information on this as it becomes available. 


It would seem so but I cannot confirm one way or the other without knowing your username and being able to look it up online. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:13:23
As for our liability in situations like this, I would refer you to our terms of service. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:15:04
Everything you just listed could be done by any exchange, and there is no way to prove a negative so it's a futile exercise.


Quadriga.cx which was going public in Canada and dealing with all the red tape around that had their CEO talk about trading on his own exchange. I receive my salary in bitcoin, are you saying i shouldn't be able to sell my bitcoin because I work for an exchange? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:54:45
Fine, i'm not 100% certain that it isn't going to be 63% but that doesn't appear to be the ~~wrong~~ edit: right number. But claiming that the number is accurate is incorrect. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:39:26
I didn't state that they weren't compromised, I said that it appears we were the one's that were compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:40:07
Where have we made that argument? I have never once stated "we internally assigned to your name, so it's your individual loss" or anything even close to that. You keep posting questions that infer that we've already publicly taken a stance, but in every single instance that isn't the case. Since we have a lot of users who are asking legitimate questions and not putting words in my mouth, i'm going to focus on responding to them.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:24:02
Except for that anyone could have watched their balances and verify their bitcoin on the blockchain, it'd be hard to cover an insolvency when you have near-real-time proof-of-reserves. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:28:29
Correct, other currencies were not affected. We don't have a ballpark right now, as soon as details like this become available i'll share them. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:38:31
Please resend. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:17:07
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:45:02
Individuals owned the bitcoin in the wallets... it would be ridiculous to think that an exchange owns anybody who deposits' funds. 


These will be happening in stages, so we will bring up the site for people to check balances before withdrawals will be enabled. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:40:48
No problem. Let me know if you need anything or have any questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:05:54


We are taking all precautions in bringing the site back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:57:07
I am merely explaining how lenders could be affected by the hack by explaining what happened, i did not make any indication towards how we will handle this. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:12:48
I am not taking any comments personally, i know that this is a stressful situation for everyone involved and people just want to know the state of their funds, the problem is that right now there are just some details that we still don't have. We have to settle all the balances and positions before we have all the information we need to make final decisions, so that's what we're waiting on. Until that happens we just can't make decisions, once we can i will make announcements regarding withdrawals, our plans for addressing losses, and an explanation of how we went about settling balances and wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:15:26
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:04:07
The account balances displayed at the time the site was taken down did not accurately reflect users balances on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:30:22
We don't have any more details on that at this time, we'll release information as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:18:03
There's their source. You can listen to it for yourself and make a conclusion. I'll copy my post from elsewhere here to explain what happened:


@_date: 2016-08-03 23:16:47
We are prepping a new announcement right now and will post it within the hour with more updates to follow tomorrow. Thank you very much for the support. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:43:15
I think our users at least deserve that much, openness and communication. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:37:09
If you have any specific questions let me know and i'll try to get answers for you. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:04:53
Still working on getting the site ready to bring up, so settling balances and positions. After we finish that i'll have an announcement. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:29:33
Ill ask but i'm confident they would be considering the circumstances. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:06:13
I think you're confusing [Ledger Labs]( with [Ledger wallet](
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:38:11
We're still investigating exactly what happened and trying to discern the details of the hack. 


Yes. 


We have one private key that we use to sign transactions, bitgo then has a key that they use to sign transactions, and there's one key that's kept in cold storage. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:45:15
More than likely i'll make a post or announcement about it (not just a comment) and follow the instructions outlined in that post. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:51:34
My pleasure. Let me know if you have any other questions, i'll try to get back asap. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:53:21
Ah, something like that makes much more sense. That's a possibility, but the problem with that is even with 0% fees, it would take a very long time for some to make up in fees what was lost in btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:05:45
That's a good question, i've asked to see if anyone on our team knows for certain but i think i know the answer.
I know that from the beginning we wanted to allow people to opt out of the bitgo wallets because it's an American company and some people don't like that. We drafted that email when we were in the process of migrating bitgo accounts; at that time you could go to the account section and you would see if you had been migrated to bitgo or not. So we drafted that email for both those who have and have not been migrated. Since we wanted to allow users to opt out I think we never bothered changing the wording. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:43:29
We cannot release any more details about the hack at this time. We'll make this information available as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:47:54
Not sure yet, nothing will probably happen today HK time, looking for an announcement in late Europe/USA though. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:05:36
No problem, we've been doing everything we can over the past few days to figure out the best way to handle things, and this is what we arrived at.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:25:51
We are trying to do everything we can to right our users. We're exploring any options available to us. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:16:15
The queue is quite long as we have to manually process all withdrawals, we're going through them as quickly as possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:31:25
I'm reading all the replies and messages, i'm seeing it all. Thank you very much for the kind words, we're trying our absolute hardest to right by our customers. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:10:32
Then it had no funds stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:42:20
No problem, i'll continue to try to keep people as informed as possible. 


Me too. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:24:49
That is literally what we put in the blog post:


@_date: 2016-08-05 11:42:50
That is not part of the aforementioned scenario. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:33:59
The last time we got hacked we covered every single cent, what are you talking about? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:42:54


That's all i'm asking for. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:22:50
We'll be reviewing the withdrawals and processing them on a case by case basis. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:15:12
And what's the upcoming crisis? And people have confirmed this on the blockchain, so not sure where you're coming from. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:46:36
they are
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:08:50
We're trying to get everything ready to bring the site back up. There's a lot of work to settle the affected positions and balances and everything. We'll have it up and the announcement posted as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:32:06
As i've stated several times, my account is subject to the same loss as everyone else. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:08:36
I realize that but there's only so much information we can release right now and we cannot release details as there is an ongoing investigation. However, i can share that not all customer funds were lost, so that's what I'm doing. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:47:47
I believe we're lifting the 5 day hold considering the circumstance, but there seems to be a lot of questions about this so i'll clarify and update you guys. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:55:40
New announcement is out: 
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:40:02
That is correct.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:22:34
Sorry, are you trying to quote or referring to something?


No USD was stolen in the hack, only btc. 


If usd was just sitting in your wallet it wouldn't have been subject to the hack. If you opened a long short that means you used USD to buy btc, and that btc could have been stolen. That's why margin funding providers were affected by the hack. 


If the usd was just sitting idle in a wallet then it wasn't at risk, if it was used to buy btc then it was affected as that btc may have been stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:19:13
It would have been impossible for us (Bitfinex) to hide the hack. 120,000btc leaving p2sh addresses over a short time is not going to go unnoticed. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:12:52
Funds deposited after we discovered the hack will not be susceptible to the haircut. I'm trying to get the exact details (cut off time) right now. I'll add that to the announcement.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:26:11
The scenario mentioned would be among those with bitcoin balances and/or active loans to BTCUSD positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:35:02
Yes, compliance is working as hard as possible to process all of the incoming verification requests. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:57:23
I'm not sure if they have been canceled or not, but when we come up there won't be any trading and users will have access to their accounts. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:36:47
Thanks for the suggestions, we'll be sure to carefully consider any decisions before arriving at a conclusion. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:28:00
We're working on putting an announcement up on the site, we have a blog post, and i made a post on here. Thanks for letting me know. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:28:08


@_date: 2016-08-03 13:13:18
The protection is that we would cover any losses that we could, as if we can't cover losses for the lenders on a site based around p2p lending... it'd be bad. So as long as we could cover the losses for margin funding providers we would. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:59:14
Was not internal. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:09:19
We're open to all ideas, but giving 0% fees for certain users can open up a litany of other issues, for example some users could unfairly influence the market with 0% fees via wash trades. We're evaluating all options, but i personally don't believe that is a very good option. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:37:54
We will have an announcement about the state of withdrawals later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:03:23
No ETC was stolen in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:56:28
We said that is one scenario that we are leaning towards and clearly stated that nothing was set in stone, so no the details have not been decided. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:23:54
No, that's not what I'm saying. I don't know if your position will be settled or not, it depends on whether or not the hack affected the position or not. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:53:10
ew&gt;Could users have prevented their bitgo wallets from being drained? Can't recall any security warnings or recommendations concerning this issue.
No, there was nothing users could have done to my knowledge.


We're still investigating the hack to figure out exactly how we were compromised, but it does look like it's on us. 
**Clarification: I meant that it appeared we were the ones that were compromised**
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:59:42
Can you please pm me your username so that I can take a look and see what happened. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:27:17
That would be correct, thanks for pointing that out, i'll edit my comment. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:43:00
It says that we will be posting an announcement tonight and that we will be releasing an explanation on how we are addressing those who had used btc to open an ETC margin position.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:21:04
We're open to all options. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:07:49
Yeah, that's where we are right now, just need a bit more time to unravel everything. And yeah, the day is pretty 不好
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:53:03
Are you saying allow people to donate to help cover the losses? I mean, we'd be open to that, sure, but we need to concentrate on how to resolve this without donations. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:11:47
We had limits on bitgo withdrawals for this exact reason. So that if we are compromised we can limit our loss to what our limit was. Obviously the hacker surpassed this limit and we're investigating exactly how this happened. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:58:36
We will be manually reviewing all withdrawals so it will probably take a bit of time to process all of them. I'm really not sure on a timeline though, i think it depends on how many withdrawals we receive. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:49:26
5% of recovery and for information leading to recovery (but no bounty if no recovery); if multiple persons lead to recovery, share pro rata
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:35:38
I don't know, i wouldn't be able to tell you right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:21:26


Your funds were still on the exchange even if another user was trading with them. 
I don't really understand your example, all money is sourced peer to peer, all funds are accounted for. It's not like futures where the position exceeds the amount of funds backing it. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:48:34


That's exactly what they're doing by going to that outlet, giving updates to their users in a public fashion. Phil was on Teamspeak for over an hour the other day. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:40:30
I'm not sure how the time line of advancing between the withdrawal and trading stage will go, so I'm not sure. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:37:19
I talked to them, they needed to get the site up to check something for verification but that they would be responding now. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:20:31
We're working on solving it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:29:25
I really don't know, i'd have to know the positions and the account and look it up, but i can't do that so I can't say one way or the other. 


2fa was bypassed by this attack and anyone who held btc on the site had a bitgo wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:00:48
I said that the 36% generalized loss wasn't applied, that is not to say that there is no contribution from bitfinex nor is it to say the contribution isn't over that number. You put quotations in your post to make it seem like i said that and yet, i never actually made that statement or any statement like it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:16:01
Yes, i believe so. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:15:55
1) Let me ask about the express wire.   
2) yes  
3) We're aiming to allow creation of new API keys in the next 24 hours. 
As soon as I hear back about express wires, i'll let you know. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:00:06
It is done across all accounts and assets, so it would be applied to all funds on site. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:49:44
As i've mentioned elsewhere, we are not overlooking this situation and have discussed it already. We haven't made a final decision but will have an update for you tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:45:09
Looking on the bright side, that's nice. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:55:10
Good catch, thank you. I've edited the comment. We're prepping an announcement right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:04:12
I'm positive that every member of our team will be working tomorrow and sunday.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:00:26
The loss is generalized across all assets, correct.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:00:38
Yep, I know what you mean with syncing the codes. But the problem is that the website was tossing up an error while it had actually accepted the code. So it wasn't due to a sync issue as that would have just said invalid code and been the end of it. BitGo accepted the code, but threw up an error and acted like it didn't accept it. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:08:29
The address you posted is one of ours. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:54:22
We have made investments in shapeshift, blockstream, and netki i think. I don't really have any knowledge about anything regarding liquid. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:13:03
Yes. Next stage will be bringing up the site and allowing users to check the state of their account. I will also be making an announcement on how we plan to address losses as well as an update on plans for withdrawals. 
I'm really not sure where trading fits on the time schedule, we're just focused on getting the site up with minimal functionality so that users can access their accounts. I'll have more information on fiat withdrawals tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:03:33
I don't know where he's getting his 73,800btc number. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:43:57
We are working with the FBI and European authorities on the investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:36:47
We will be addressing this situation in the coming announcements. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:51:21


Or, you know, you could just listen to what he said and you'll see that you're wrong:


I'm pretty comfortable with my manhood and "intellectual toolkits", as is the company that hired me. Thanks for the advice though. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:10:03
No problem, we'll be posting more details as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:17:00
Yes it does. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:51:42




We haven't have a hot/cold wallet setup since the bitgo implementation. Instead each user has their own wallet with limits on how much it can withdrawal as well as a global limit. We're still investigating how they were able to compromise this setup. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:33:52
We are planning to bring the site back up today, i know i said this yesterday as well and i apologize for missing this deadlines, but we're working as hard as we can to bring everything back online and are confident we'll be able to do it today.


Losses will be shared among btc holders and those with USD backing BTCUSD margin positions. 


Still deciding how to handle this, however i can assure you that we are not looking over this and are having discussions about how to handle this exact situation. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:24:34
You need to be able to login to the website. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:52:22
Yeah, it fucking sucks. I've felt like shit since the moment I found out. We'll do everything we can to keep you guys up to date with what's happening and how we plan to address everything. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:10:59
I'll pass along your advice to our admins, but we are still working on the details of what exactly we'll do upon relaunch. I'll be sure to post these details as they become available. I suggest those that need to be alerted sign up for alerts on our statuspage, bitfinex.statuspage.io, and it will email you when we have an update. But that's all we can do for now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:51:18
True, i would assume that would come online with other cryptos but i really don't know. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:36:47
And if we brought the site back up and it it turns out that ETH wasn't safe, how would you feel then? It would be beyond idiotic to bring any part of the site back online without being confident in the integrity of the site. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:15:25
The bfxcoin image being circulated is not legitimate. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:37:41
I'd really suggest that everyone stops inferring meaning where there is none. It's this simple: we have not made any decision on how we are going to address losses. We haven't decided one way or the other and have stated as such countless times. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:32:35
It would be misleading to say that the security breach has been resolved. For some reason when we post updates to the status page it doesn't alert users via sms with the update. So we had to close that incident and open another to ensure that the they got an sms. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:48:35
That is correct. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:54:54
We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:32:58
I hope to have that announcement up today EST time. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:31:56
The protection comes for instances in which extreme volatility leads to positions not being closed before they go into the red, and as such losing lenders' funds. In a situation such as that we would cover the loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:14:35
That is not what is happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:58:24
No, as a European you would be able to sell them. US residents would not

Do you mind linking me to where I said "Bitfinex itself will not contributing to help cover the loss" because I never said that and in fact have had made multiple statements to the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:34:52


Should it say "Show this QR code to others you want to join your wallet BUT YOU CAN TOTALLY JUST USE YOUR PHONE AS THE SECOND KEY KTHXBYE"?
And if I don't want one of the keys on my phone? 


I'm well aware of how multi-sig works, it's just I think we have different preferences for how to use it. My preferred setup that I arrived at through much trial and error was as so:
One key that Coinkite stores, can be signed by anyone. One key that Coinkite also stores, but is encrypted with a strong password that I control. The third key is in cold storage. This means that anytime i need to send bitcoin i need to have 1) login credentials to coinkite. 2) password for the encrypted key. This allows me to make transactions from one device (if I wish), with multiple layers of security. Using your own suggestion, "use your phone", you don't know if one of my 2fa keys is on my phone therefor ensuring you need to have both of my devices to access my wallet. 
I do realize that coinkite is different to copay, but I think copay still has a lot of work to reach a usability level that coinkite is at. But another user has brought up some of the copay forks, which I think is awesome and really hope that more wallets come from the copay code that bitpay has released, and that some of them will be a bit more suited to my needs. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:16:21
I'm really not sure, but I'll post information on what will happen to open non btc positions as soon as that becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:49:44
We'll be updating the blog about possible scams. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:03:45
We do we have several staff in HK as well as our registered office address. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:27:37
Please email compliance for details on verification. It generally take a day or two but i can imagine that we'll swamped with verifications so i'm not sure how long it will take right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:42:26
There's also a lot of private messages! But yeah, trying to keep up to the best of my ability. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:15:10


Yes... of course. All of users' bitcoin is held in individual accounts. 


Guess where those deposits/withdrawals come from/go to... individual accounts' wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:01:02
working on it, thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:01:39
If they know what their bitgo wallet addresses were then yes, they can check, otherwise there isn't really a good way to do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:25:23
Thanks man, just trying to keep everyone updated with what's happening. It's a terrible situation for all of us, but I think everyone deserves to know what's going on. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:49:34
I don't know this information and phil and others are a bit busy at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:24:07
i know, i read the thread. And the user is also saying we didn't email anyone about the hack, or regarding the 36% generalized loss, but our support has sent out hundreds and hundreds of emails since the hack, pretty much everyone who emailed us about these problems got a response, I don't know why he thinks it's weird that you got one. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:10:19
They're in HK so there's a good chance they are already offline, but i told them to be on the lookout for a rush of verification requests and they said alright, so i assume there's just a backlog that they're trying to work through. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:18:00
No problem, I realize that this is a terrible situation for everyone (me included) and that at minimum users deserve to be updated on what's happening. I'll continue to update everyone to the best of my ability, but the messages are piling up and i can't get through them fast enough. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:56:38
Not all users USD is at the same bank, so some accounts have usd stored with one bank and others a different bank. 


No problem, i'll try to keep you updated on everything that's happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:12:54
We do not know what our plans for relaunch will be at this time. As these plans come together and details become apparent I'll be sure to share them with everyone. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:05:20
We don't have a specific time, just today and using europe's "day", we're working on the announcement now. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:04:11
Not sure, we'll have details in upcoming posts addressing what's going on with bitgo and synapse. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:07:59
I don't know. We are working on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. We're trying to get this done asap and get an announcement out with more information on how we're moving forward. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:40:36
Any btc on the site was susceptible to the theft to best of my knowledge. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:25:49
If you deposited btc after the hack we would still have the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:01:41
We most certainly have not as we haven't seen the final details of what everything looks like with all positions and balances settled. Before we see that we cannot make a decision. 


Bitcoin lent out by margin funding providers can only be used to fund a position, it cannot be moved or loaned out by the receiver. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:09:29
Yes, tether would require verification. No problem, let me know if there's anything else that I can do for you. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:34:39
No, it just means August 4th EST. No problem,  let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:29:03
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:19:06
No it did not. We are still evaluating the scope of the consequences arising from the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:56:28
Probably like 99.9999% that your bitcoin wasn't stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:08:55
Details are still forthcoming, there are still a lot of things that need to worked out for the bfx token.

@_date: 2016-08-17 11:07:59


To my knowledge it is. 


I have made several comments about us working with the FBI and European authorities.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:08:36
We don't use cold storage for bitcoin, since our implementation with bitgo we've used segregated customer wallets so that each user has their own bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:40:25
UTC -4 
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:07:36
And please elaborate on the agenda im pushing... sorry what wallet do you think i'm trying to promote? A defunct wallet? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:28:20
I updated the announcement with some rough details on this. Deposits made after the hack was discovered is not subject to the loss, so it will not be affected. I'm trying to get the cut off time for that. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:16:16
1. We're working on it as we speak. We need to ensure that platform is wholly secure and we also have to do a lot of work dealing with affected positions and settling them. We are working as hard as we can to get this done and get the site up for users to check their accounts asap. 
2. Yes it will
3. Yes
4. Yes
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:57:51


Orrrr, don't blame anyone. Understand that this is a complex situation with a lot of different parties and no one is at blame here. I don't how you could say chinese pools are incompetent and should be blamed when they've never even been given the segwit code in a release so that they could test it. That isn't to say that the fault is on core either, they're doing their best to make a number of very important upgrades to the network, these things take time. Don't be so divisive and turn this into a us vs. them. We're all in this together. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:13:02
These details are still being finalized, we'll share more information on this when it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:48:57
The reason i'm not replying is because you're making a lot of comments based on assumptions of decisions that haven't been made. 


As i've stated elsewhere, we're bringing the site up in stages. First step is to get the site up so people can check the state of their account. At the same time we'll be publishing an announcement addressing exactly what you're asking for. This will happen before withdrawals are ever enabled. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:28:05
Because regardless of how they arrived in our wallet, they are now in our wallet so we can't bring up the site and operations without being wholly confident that we are running in a completely secure instance. So we can't allow certain users, whatever their situation may be, to withdrawal as our systems aren't ready for that. We cannot let people withdraw right now. When our systems are secure and ready for one person to withdraw, they'll be ready for everyone to withdraw.
What the user wanted:


Cannot be done.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:35:51
Who said that's how we're treating it? We have yet to announce details as to how we're treating it as we're still in the process of settling positions. Only after that is done can we finalize the details. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:32:07
We posted an update last night explaining that we will be settling all positions and what prices we would do it at. We're currently working on doing that and once that is done we will announce the methodology used for settling positions and balances. We will also address losses and plans for withdrawals. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:02:49
I can't confirm or deny one way or the either since I can't get on the site and check, but I can say with a high degree of certainty that we would have those keys. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:23:33
We cannot bring any part of the site up before we are certain that we  have a secure environment and have all balances and positions settled. Then we will bring up the site for people to see the state of their account and we will make an announcement regarding withdrawals. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:23:23
Yes, there is a chance. I won't be able to tell you one way or the other though as I don't know your username and can't check balances with the site down. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:18:25
I lend you USD, you use that USD to buy BTC, that BTC is then stolen. What are you going to return to the lender? In addition we are settling all positions across the exchange regardless of their margin level. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:31:42
There will be more details on this in upcoming announcements. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:10:21
He withdrew to an okcoin wallet i though, so how would that be the same wallet that received transactions as the hack?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:57:06
Corrected, the right number. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:57:26
That's an excellent point, i'll talk to the team about it. Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:32:16
~~There are a lot of ways.~~ Edit: That was a very dumb comment on my part. What i meant is that the hackers ability to bypass 2fa and access all the individual wallets does not mean that it's an inside job.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:07:12
Not to my knowledge, the only other bitfinex accounts would be and if it's not a post by one of these accounts or mine there is no reason to believe they are from bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:24:29
If the USD was used to buy bitcoin and that bitcoin was stolen in the theft then yes, that margin funding position and lender will be affected. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:15:00
I hope to have an update on fiat withdrawals tomorrow. At this time I don't have any information that I can share and i can't check the status of the withdrawals as the site is down. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:45:15
That is not what i'm saying. We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available.
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:43:15
It was addressed by us, we have moved all of our bitcoin to hot/cold wallet setup. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:40:24
It will be reenabled upon enabling the exchange feature. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:04:28
It hasn't been a day yet and this is still a fluid situations, there are still a lot of things happening that influence this decision. It wouldn't be wise to make a statement now that something in the next few minutes could invalidate. As such, we're waiting until we have a better control on the situation to make statements releasing such details. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:08:23
Trading will not be live when we bring the exchange back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:04:36
I don't know, i haven't really been talking to raphael about his twitter. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:40:08
We don't have an ETA yet, we're working as hard as we can on getting up as quick as possible. As soon as we have the details finalized i'll be posting updates.
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:39:42
Green-laned users are users that meet the requirements as detailed here: 
Those with these security settings enabled has their withdrawal processed automatically, whereas we would otherwise manually review their withdrawals. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:12:22
I've still got a couple hours in me. I'm hoping to get a new post out that will address a lot of the questions that people are asking. If we can't do that soon i'll try to update the faq instead. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:45:41
We haven't finalized our plans for relaunch yet, we plan to have an update with more substance on this later today UTC time. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:53:34
What do you mean, changing the spokesperson?
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:29:14
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:24:00
They would be, yes. There's settlement once a day where we settle balances on bitfinex with balances on the blockchain. That's the whole point, so that users can verify their bitcoin on the blockchain and ensure what we say is there is there. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:34:54


That's not possible as there is a maximum of 3.3x leverage. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:33:37
This is in our ToS:


@_date: 2016-08-06 16:02:46
Statuspage is updated, it's also going on the site.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:40:59
We have not decided that at all, we said we were leaning towards that scenario but i also clearly stated that nothing has been decided. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:55:10
At no point have we blamed losses on customers. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:34:47
We can't release detailed information on the hack at this time as the investigation is ongoing. As soon as this information becomes available i will share it. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:57:33
You should see personal messages. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:39:48
I have a green iphone 5c and don't even have a car, let alone a private jet. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:32:15
It means that we need to see how the process of getting all the balances settled, positions settled, and getting the site running on a secure instance goes. If we hit delays then the announcement will likely be delayed, if things go smoothly, we will have the announcement up hopefully quite soon. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:11:27
We'd be open to negotiating with him/them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:18:09
I am not certain, but yese it does seem like that is related to the hack. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:02:55


That's nice, but the problem is I want as little connecting me to the BTC wallet I use as possible. If I use a phone I can't be anonymous (I live abroad and foreigners always have to supply their passport to get a phone number) and by using email there are 2 problems: 1. it does make staying anonymous that much harder. and 2. adds another attack vector. If someone gets access to my email they can try to reset the password and then they're one step closer (not sure this applies to you guys though).


I would recommend having the page that you enter your 2fa secret include all the relevant withdrawal information, that way you have it right there where you can see everything before confirming the withdrawal one last final time. 
In general though, I would heavily suggest using a key-scheme similar to the way coinkite had it, it makes everything so much easier and secure at the same time. That's a hard combination to get, and they did it. 


Is there somewhere you'd like me to send some reports?
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:53:12
That's 600, not 600k. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:59:10
Probably. I'm hoping we can get something up by nighttime EST but we'll see. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:03:00
We're working with the best blockchain forensics teams and the relevant law enforcement agencies to do exactly that. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:20:01
They were being processed at midnight last night... so that is definitely not the case. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:07:41
We still havent finalized the details about how we are going to open up withdrawals. I'll post information about that as soon as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:44:21
That's a brilliant idea. I will heavily suggest we do this. Thank you very much for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 12:55:16


If it's a common use case why don't you streamline it within the desktop app? Right now I create the wallet and it tells me to share the invitation with other copayers. Why doesn't it give me the option to be the other copayers? 
I'd prefer to be able to have multiple layers on one device (e.g., login password, 2fa, password protected key) so I'm going to give the Chrome app with OSX a shot. I do really like the co-signing page on coinkite though as it allows me to have multi-layered security and be able to do it on any device from anywhere. 
Edit: To use a shared wallet i'd have to access copay in 3 different ways. This doesn't make it very user-friendly for a single user. I'd suggest letting one user have multiple keys within the same app. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:09:58
They did only compromise btc wallets and those restrictions only apply if you're accessing a users' account through the website or api. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:06:20
When we reenable withdrawals, yes, you will be able to withdraw your USD via wire transfer. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:00:57
Checking it now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:49:20
No usd was stolen in the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:54:22
As in we've contacted the best blockchain analysis companies in the space and have reached out to the relevant authorities. We're doing everything in our power to follow up on this. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:09:31
It's a shame it happened at all, and yeah i agree bitcoin was doing well, volumes were high. It really sucks. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:20:43
I haven't guessed how we are going to handle losses once. I've stated countless times that we haven't made a decision on this matter. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:41:04
There were tons of faked screenshots going around, i would need to see specifically which you're referring to. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:41:03
I can only assume so. It's 2:40am on saturday for a lot of us and we're still online. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:31:32


NO! It is not your deposit address! There are multiple addresses that comprise the wallet used for your account. Just because funds are not in the deposit address **does not** mean your bitcoin was taken. 


This surpassed traditional security measures such as 2fa. 


We are evaluating all the various options for addressing customer losses. At this time we don't have any details that we can share on this, nor have we made any decisions regarding this. We'll continue to push out updates on this as information becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:40:10
We will be posting an explanation for why we decided to handle it this way once we bring the site back up.


We are bringing the site back up in stages for security purposes. First we will bring up the site with read-only functionality, then withdrawals, and then trading. At least, that's the plan. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:18:24
While this happened as in when we took the site down or the hack happened? If it's the former, then we would have those coins, if it's the latter i wouldn't be able to tell you one way or the other. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:23:52
no problem. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:47:59
When i say relaunch i am referring to bringing the site back up so that people can close positions, withdraw etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:04:58
our funds are in multi-sig wallets so they start with the 3, to the best of my knowledge all of the addresses used by the attacker started with 1. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:05:08
Yes, your methodology on this calculation is wrong. The hack compromised the hot wallet, that yes, only contains 0.5% of total btc however this type of hack also sweeps all incoming deposits. So it takes whatever amount you had in the hot wallet and continue to take whatever amount is deposited until you're able to stop the attack.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:41:27
Affected positions will be settled at the price as of yesterday at 18:00 utc, correct. 


User balances did not accurately reflect the balance on the blockchain at the time of the site going down. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:24:17
To be honest though that doesn't make it much better... That means that anytime a thief is able to get his hands on a lot of coins ETH is going to have to hard fork to protect the move to POS. What's the threshold for this? Gatecoin lost a lot of ETH in their hack. If polo gets hacked is that going to force another hard fork? What if some wales get hacked and lose their ETH? Maybe one shouldn't rely so heavily on a system that is apparently so susceptible to being derailed by one bad actor. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:48:36
We're doing everything in our power to do right by our users. We'll be making an announcement addressing the losses, withdrawals, and how we went about settling balances and positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:40:17
Alright, thank you very much for the suggestion, i'll pass this on to our team. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:30:51
First of all i highly doubt polo has 119,756btc, and secondly, we're exploring all options. If someone has a legitimate proposal, we'd be interested to hear it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:42:04
We are doing everything we can to make right by our users. That's our goal first and foremost, that's what we're working on now.  


Bitcoin is honey badger. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:20:20
We don't have any reason to believe so. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:57:08
I've never heard of them, I'll check it out and possibly add it to the list.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:14:13
I just talked to them, they will be. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:59:51
We sync balances to the blockchain once a day, so balances on the site don't always reflect your balance on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:07:49
I don't think it's a problem with recording the conversations, it's recording the conversations, and then posting it with a fake quote like "Bitfinex confirms they aren't doing anything to help users". Or taking something completely out of context and posting it. 


After pretty much any big event in the last two years we've had phil/giancarlo/myself have gone onto teamspeak to speak with all the traders there. I view it as just another outlet where traders congregate. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:29:18
I'd have to be able to take a look at the user log and see what happened, i can't figure out what's going on just by seeing that info. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:30:23


I never said that. I said that it looked like they had not been compromised and that we were the ones who were compromised. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:42:56
My pleasure. Let me know if you need anything or have any questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:43:30
Only bitcoin was stolen in the hack ETH and ETC were unaffected. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:11:54
It appears he was mistaken, he will take another look at your ticket. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:16:07
I don't. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:28:01

We'll be very careful in how we go about deciding our plans for relaunch and will definitely take this into consideration. Thank you for the feedback. We'll be sure to keep users informed on how we plan to relaunch. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:34:52
Hmm, i'm curious why that is, i'd be interested to learn more. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 15:31:56
Just to add to this as some might not be aware. Every day we settle all of the bitcoin on Bitfinex to each users' multi-sig wallet. That means that *at least* once a day we settle everyone's balances to the blockchain from one multisig wallet to another, not to mention the processing of all the withdrawals from multi-sig addresses. So something like this would definitely be beneficial towards us. 
edit: thanks for the gold @_date: 2016-08-10 18:25:19
I really don't have an idea of how long withdrawals are going to take to process. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:22:22
It's not unusual situations causing the delay, it's just a time intensive process. We're being very careful in our decisions and are discussing everything in length. 


Perhaps after we get things resolved. I've tried going for walks to clear my mind but pretty much the entire time i'm just thinking about replying to messages and other things i can be doing to help the situation. Won't really be able to clear my head till this is somewhat handled.

No problem, let me know if you have any questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:43:18

We're working as hard as we can to get the sight back up so that users can log in and check the state of their account. We plan to have the site up with another update on how we're going to address losses and the situation with withdrawals.

Our explanation that we will post tomorrow will go over this. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:54:57
I said that it appeared that we were the ones that were compromised. That's all i said. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:34:10
We are looking at various options to address customer losses, but at this time don't have any details on this that we can share. I'll be sure to post the details as it becomes available. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 05:32:40
That's beside the point, you have to have people buying bitcoin for the price to go up, more stores accepting bitcoin will not accomplish that. 


Not for the short term, right now we have 3600 btc/day mined, it's fair to think that a good portion of that is sold, that means to keep the price where it is just from the selling pressure coming from the block reward, we need somewhere around $1,497,600. That's per day. So no, just because you hold your coins doesn't mean that value is going to go up. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:57:14
Coinkite has never given me any issues where i've had problems signing up with bitgo on several occasions with a multitude of issues spanning 3 years. I thought i'd give them another chance today, but again, couldn't even sign up due to bugs. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:27:49
We were trying to bring the site up and make an announcement at the same time. I'm not sure how we're coming along with that as I'm waiting for an update, so we'll see, i'm not sure yet. 
Upon bringing the site up there is not much that you'll be able to do. Trading will not be live, the purpose of bringing the site up is to allow users to check the state of their accounts.

He could send it to any of the addresses he stole it from if he wanted to give it back. But i would imagine if he's at the stage where he wants to send the coins back we would be in touch and give him a fresh address.

I get that, but that's an extra attack vector. Someone trying to access my account through password recovery. Plus i don't like tying anything that could be linked back to my identity to my btc wallets, which emails definitely do.

Looked through this guys comments and he's just a troll. Shouldn't have wasted my time. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:39:18
You guys do offer pretty good anonymity because they can just use google auth and password/pin, which is exactly what I want. But I need something that offers more customized key generation/storage. I can get over small UI/UE things and even help by submitting bug reports and stuff like that. But I need the basic functionality that coinkite offers. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:15:29
We will be addressing withdrawals, yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:09:38
1) [Done]( We were never hiding these, we've already sent this out to multiple people. People have even sent versions of this to me. 
2. This is public knowledge, we've stated it several times and i believe it was even in the withdrawal emails. We have spending limits in place, both global (site wide) and per account that limited the amount that could be withdrawn. The investigation is going to determine how these were bypassed. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:59:30
The plan has been to bring withdrawals online first.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:53:51
Linking a bank account is part of the verification process. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:44:30
If you sent the bitcoin after the hack then it would not have been stolen in the hack. 


We're working on getting the platform up and running on a secure instance so that users can log in and see if their accounts have been affected as well as the state of their positions and orders. Beyond that we don't really have any details that we can share for relaunch, but we plan to have an announcement with more substance later today UTC time. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:31:09
I do not know what it means for fiat withdrawals that have already been approved. I am planning on making a post regarding this later today. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:09:53
That is an inaccuracy in this post, he says:


That's incorrect, the attacker only had access to one key. He signed with our key and then bitgo signed with their key.

Laughter is the best medicine i guess... I've always been the guy to make inappropriate jokes at bad times. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:00:17

@_date: 2016-04-11 18:35:54
I'll give that a shot, but right off the bat they're not off to a good start requiring an email to sign up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:35:49
If you were only holding ETH, ETC and USD then none of your funds were stolen in the hack.

Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:46:36


When the site comes back up we will have an announcement addressing how we settled positions and balances as well as how we are addressing losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:31:30


I doubt this will have any bearing on whether or not he position is settled. I'm pretty sure the sole criteria is whether or not the position was directly affected by the hack. 


We cannot share details about the hack at this time as the investigation is ongoing. I will post this information as it becomes available for me to post.

Omg, this is my last response because you seriously have 0 reading comprehension. 


I'm critiquing all the wallets and show where they need to improve. Not showcasing their strengths, as said in the post:


More illogical statements:


... 


So is it because of my ignorance or is it my being in China that I dislike it? 


Again 0 reading comprehension as one of my complaints for electrum was: 


But you can't read, so can't expect you to see that I'd want a web version, not a desktop version that requires my own server to run. 


And last but not least here you're demonstrating the lack of a basic grasp on english. Please tell me how any of this was "unfair" or "biased". I went through and put on display the **shortcomings** of these wallets. Not the **strengths**, hopefully you can understand that this time.


You pointed out no relevant valid facts. And look at your comment history, see how so many of them are negative, that's cause you troll and people don't like you. Probably why you had to create a new account too, seeing as how this one is only 8 days old. 
Anyway, have a nice day, you're insufferable and I'm not going to respond anymore. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:44:15
No USD was stolen in the hack, so yes, you would be able to verify and withdraw the USD in your account. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:15:54

I was taking another look at GreenAddress and was wondering if you could tell if there's any security benefit to using the 2 of 3 versus your normal setup? 
Edit: A big usability thing for me is being able to withdraw my entire balance: if a user tries to submit a withdrawal for their entire balance you should have the option to deduct miner fees from the total instead of having to guess what the miner fees are and then deduct that manually and hope you're not leftover with any dust. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 04:59:59
This is the setup i'd like to have with the Copaty wallet, maybe i'm missing something but would really appreciate the help:
* 2/3 mutli-sig  
* 1 key held in the app on desktop
* 1 key held on my phone
* 1 key held in cold storage
The way that makes most sense to me (again, i might be missing something) would be to allow creation of multiple keys from the same app. So for example, one key that I create and keep on desktop, one key that i create from the desktop app but keep in cold storage, one key that i create from my phone. 
Security wise, it's just what you mention, having keys on different devices / platforms, but in my example I get to create an offline key right from the same app i'm already using and then move it to cold storage.

Hey mason, I'm well aware of what/who BitGo is, I work for Bitfinex (i'm even quoted in the PR we did together) and we use you guys for our bitcoin storage.
I can absolutely DM you about the bug, but to be honest I'm just tired of dealing with issues like this. I've had a myriad of them from BitGo and there's no point in dealing with them *plus* paying a fee for the service when there are more user friendly and free options out there.

Bullshit. I think most bitcoin cash supporters, myself included, still want to see bitcoin succeed.

We figured out what we needed to do relatively quickly in regards to settling balances/positions, the problem is actually doing them is time intensive, so until we wrap that up there isn't too much to share.

If you take advantage of our security features the chance of your account being compromised is extremely *extremely* low. We have IP locks, PGP encryption for emails (so to confirm any of withdrawal, security setting change etc you'd need their pgp key), locked withdrawal addresses, google 2fa, sms 2fa, and Clef 2fa and more. If you take advantage of all these your account will be extremely secure.

It's HK and BVI, can you please explain what's dubious about this framework?


We changed it because it wasn't the correct term, when the term was chosen in 2012 there wasn't any framework for regulation or anything of that nature. Now that we're moving toward that we need to more accurately depict our products to reduce misinformation.


We don't allow unverified users to deposit/withdraw fiat, so we're not acting like a bank. Furthermore, there isn't any regulation against holding users bitcoin without KYC/AML pretty much anywhere except for NY, and so to comply with this we no longer allow NY residents to hold btc on our exchange. We are very cognizant of the regulations and are very diligent in ensuring we are compliant. 


Your conflating futures with p2p margin trading when they're fundamentally different so this is not an apt comparison. With futures your position isn't fully backed by funds, with p2p margin trading it is. In the rare occurrence of a flash crash where the trader is not liquidated in time bitfinex has made the lender whole every time, and this hasn't been in an issue for a long time now. 


This is incorrect. We take a 15% fee and we guarantee the funds provided by margin funding providers. 


Yes, we did have our issues in August with order stacking and flipping positions, but that wouldn't affect the OP at all since he'd be doing margin funding, not trading. Nonetheless, these issues have been fixed which was demonstrated during the rise to $500, we handled over 50% of the global BTCUSD volume (nearly 300,000btc/24hr) and had close to no lag and no downtime (one of the only exchanges not to go down during this period). 
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:27:26
We don't offer 2fa through email, only additional 2fa (additional checks, but not primary), and why shouldn't we offer SMS 2fa? Google auth can be localized to the computer as well (google auth chrome app).

I don't see how this keeps getting perpetuated, it's quite well known who owns it. Raphael, our founder, was quite active in the community before I took over with handling the community aspect and he focused on dev work. Giancarlo, our CFO, is on teamspeak talking to traders all the time and is very easy to get in touch with and talk to. Phil, our Chief Strategy Officer is always on teamspeak talking to traders as well and often talks to our users. Both Giancarlo and Phil met with a bunch of users in NY during the inside bitcoin conference. So it's not really fair to say that little is known about us.

@_date: 2015-12-07 06:49:55
I feel like i'm in a good position to comment on this having worked for the largest chinese bitcoin exchange and the largest USD bitcoin exchange. 
It isn't easy, there's a massive language gap and each side exists largely within their own eco-system. I think having conferences like the one currently happening in HK are a massive step forward in the right direction, they get a conversation going between both sides and with that contacts are made that can help bridge the gap. I know that several Chinese companies are making efforts to expand into the West; I founded OKCoin's international team and as such am well aware of their intentions to expand abroad. You have companies on the mining side like Bitmain that have a couple foreigners working for them and help bridge the gap within the mining industry (Jake from Bitmain is one of the most knowledgeable people about the Chinese bitcoin industry in the world). On the other side companies like Circle had their last funding round co-led by a Chinese investor and hinted at plans to go into china; at Bitfinex I talk to Chinese clients on an almost daily basis; and beyond that I know of several other western companies trying to find in roads into China. So I do believe the gap is shrinking as time goes along, but we need both sides to make efforts, reach out and contact people and try to garner opinions from all sides. 
I believe it is inevitable we will follow the steps of the broader tech scene and grow closer and closer. The largest IPO in US history is from a Chinese tech company (alibaba); google's latest flagship phone was made by huawei (nexus 6P); Xiaomi is getting more and more popular in countries in the west. We will follow in their footsteps, but it takes time. 
Tldr: Give it time.

We have real-time proof of reserves via our integration with bitgo, any one can independently verify their funds on the blockchain at any time.
Also, I'd like to point out that the poster you are responding to is incorrect. The USD you provide via margin funding is used to back the position of the trader that took your margin funding offer. We don't take your usd and put it in any other investments or anything like that. I don't know where that user is getting that from.

I'd argue the opposite, start learning the language and as you do so you'll learn the culture. It's not easy to learn a culture, nor is it easy to learn the language, but if you start with the language you'll get the culture. Also, I would argue that Chinese culture is dominated by the pursuit of money, there isn't a huge disconnect there.

@_date: 2015-12-04 14:36:34


No, no we're not. The USD that you're lending is being used by the other traders as backing for their positions. We don't touch customer funds or use them in any way for investments. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:28:32
This does a couple things:
1. Every user can independently verify their bitcoin on the blockchain. They don't have to trust us that their bitcoin is there, they can see for themselves.
2. Every user has their own individual segregated wallet. So the concept of "pooled-funds" is no longer existent in our cold wallet. This means a few things: The use of this model, where each customer has a separate set of keys and wallets, allows for a much greater level of granularity. Whilst in the past BitGo would have to treat a pooled wallet as a single unit, BitGo can now customize policies for each wallet. Furthermore, it will now be possible for BitGo to perform OTP directly for the customer, enforcing multi-institutional second factor authentication (Bitfinex will be the first factor and BitGo the second factor), requiring attackers to compromise both institutions before getting funds.

My pleasure. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:10:44


I remember asking you if this would be possible last summer when OKCoin was looking to undergo a proof-of-solvency and you said it would probably take a couple of years before we got to that stage. Glad to see that you've been able to cut down on that considerably!
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:02:09


But there was no clarity on whether or not any of that applied to bitcoin, and to be honest there wasn't much thought put into the choosing of the name for that reason.


But no lender lost money because of this, so it only had secondary effects, i.e., traders temporarily leaving the exchange and demand for margin funding decreasing and thus lower rates. It didn't directly affect them. 


And to be totally honest, we very much appreciate that users are being this diligent. We'd much rather have informed users than uninformed. Furthermore, we're comfortable that informed users will use us as their exchange (as you have) because of our superior features, liquidity, and security. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:26:55
I wasn't there and I didn't listen to too many of the speeches/panels so I can't really say one way or the other, sorry. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:41:14


What do you mean they've never explained what they do with the cut we take? It's a fee, just like a trading fee, we keep it.

Massive customer base is the first thing that comes to mind. Think about the amount of money stored on Gox, that was a HUGE amount.

1. We make a signature using the private keys the funds are held in. 
2. We have a method on our site to make sure users funds were included in the root hash given to Stefan Thomas. 
3. Look up Stefan Thomas's easy audit , it's on github, he requests json files. Just cause it's not on Wikipedia doesn't mean it isn't a thing. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:21:30
To quote &gt;we had to remove them from our system when they launched their 0% fee model. It can't be used inline with exchanges that do have fees unfortunately so we need a more clever alternative :)
However, we are talking about how we can be added back to their site. Hopefully we will be able to come to a conclusion that works.
To answer your second question: because they are AWESOME. Have you ever had some dai minority rice noodles(岱民族米线）? Life-changing. Take a trip to yunnan and you will have your mind blown on the awesomeness of noodles.

We won't move off-shore. We have our Beijing office and plan on keeping it. However, we are currently working on our international website as well as getting everything ready to open an international exchange. An important thing to note here is that we aren't doing this out of fear of what is going to happen in China, we're doing this because we see a market that we think we can capitalize on and that we can offer otherwise non-existent services to, e.g. P2P Margin Trading. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:27:00
I'm the same guy, this is just my new personal account and since I already translated it somewhere else, here ya go:
From when Bitcoin started in 2009 Bitcoin has developed/grown in every country thanks to innovative thinking and skilled developers. Many people believe that BTC will become a new payment technology allowing for more efficient, cheaper, transactions. The World’s Countries supervision/regulation organizations have given Bitcoin a fitting environment to develop because of the importance of innovation. My country(China)’s supervising/regulating bodies have wisely given bitcoin a relatively loose/free environment to operate in. Furthermore, in the announcement made by the five ministries(I think this is in regards to the Dec. 5th statement) as long as a person accepts the risk of dealing with bitcoin, they are free to buy and sell BTC. 
However, we also realize that Bitcoin has run into a few problems in China, for instance the price volatility, market manipulation, insufficient notices of risks towards small investors. This all led to some smaller investors losing money. Being a BTC trading platform means that we have responsibilities we cannot shirk whenever any type of problem arises. Currently Huobi, OKCoin, CHBTC, BTCChina, BTCTrade have all been having deep conversations and deep self-examination(maybe they mean we’re all having a gut-check). We have all decided to engage in self-regulation as promote positive development of Bitcoin. 
We have all agreed to the following:
1. Give sufficient notifications of the risks associated with trading btc and lead them to use normal/common investment concepts. 
2. Do not participate or organize large Bitcoin marketing conferences or gatherings. Instead we will promote conferences related to technology and innovation. 
3. Follow the regulations, operate an exchange legally and within the regulatory framework. We will stop our P2P margin trading before May 10th. After all loans are repaid and accounts are settled, all margin trading services will be stopped. 
4. To curb excessive speculation and protect small investors a fee will be levied on HFT(high frequency trading). The five major exchanges will discuss a rate which will be used across all five platforms.
5. Our trading platform will transparently handle the settlement of all accounts in regards to outstanding loans resulting from margin trading 
6. Comply with the requirements of the relevant state departments, strictly verify users identities, track suspicious transactions and perform anti-money laundering checks. 
7. Establish a strong system for disclosing information to users and allow them to wield their right to information.
8. Regularly tell the relevant authorities of recent developments and risks.  
Give me more time I'm still working on it.
These five Bitcoin exchanges will voluntarily follow the terms and conditions laid out above. Furthermore we all agree to strengthen our consultations and actively move forward in operating a transparent exchange as to spur healthy development for BTC within China. At the same time we will accept all supervision.
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:06:01

It's my pleasure, if you ever have any questions or would like anything translated let me know and I'll see what I can do.

@_date: 2014-08-21 04:22:51
I don't know why people are saying that we're approving of the regulations, we aren't. I can't speak too much for Huobi and BTCChina but OKCoin has made our stance clear. 
In [this]( coindesk article our CTO made it very clear we don't like the proposed BitLicense:


And so did I:


We didn't go after the whole BitLicense because we feel other parties have already done so in depth, such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce. We decided to focus on the parts that directly affect international businesses. 
So, no, we at OKCoin do not support the BitLicense. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:21:22
OK, thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:41:48

I've heard this a lot, Amex charges the highest so stores generally don't like to accept it, or don't. However, one of my friends(who's restaurant accepts bitcoin) received in the mail the other day a flyer from Amex saying that they charge 1.9%, no other fees. So is Amex changing or are credit card fees for merchants really that low now?
@_date: 2014-06-29 07:58:42
I can try to answer any questions you might have. I work at OKCoin and we will actually be doing an AMA on Monday at 9:00AM EST, come join us and ask away. 
To answer your two questions you asked here: No, Bitcoin is in no way, shape, or form banned in China. There has only been one official release by the government on Bitcoin and it said very clearly that people are allowed to hold, buy and sell Bitcoin. So, no, it is not banned.
An explanation of OKCoin’s high volume:
A lot of discussion has been centered on the trading volume at OKCoin and how it is “fake”. This, however, just isn’t true. It all boils down to the zero-fee trading model. Because we don’t charge our users any fees for trades there is a lot of HFT(High Frequency Trading) taking place. This leads to the “bloating” of our numbers. We have admitted this and our CEO Star Xu made a statement about this in a [Coindesk article written by Rui Ma]( 


There is an excellent [article written by Zhang Weiwu]( about the zero-fee model in China which includes many examples of how this method of business is prevalent in China; the focus is on user base. For readability I’ll put some of his examples and key points below:
Taobao, the largest consumer market in the world, charges 0 fees for all buys and sells.
Baidu(Chinese Google equivalent) offers 2,000GB of free cloud storage. To put that in perspective, it’s 400 times more than Dropbox.   
However that’s dwarfed by QQ, which offers 10,000GB. All free of charge. 
The volume on OKCoin isn’t fake, we aren’t fabricating numbers. That many coins are being traded on our site. However, the volume isn’t indicative of the amount of funds on the site. The fact of the matter is that comparing sites that have 0 fee trading with sites that charge fees doesn’t paint a reliable picture. phrased it well when he commented in [this thread]( 


Emphasis added by myself. 
So, to wrap it up, our volume at OKCoin isn’t “fake” it just isn’t a good indicator for funds on the site and for this reason can’t be compared to the volumes of exchanges that do have fees. 
Also, if you ever want to ask a question you can reach out to me under this account or on twitter at   and Facebook at

Hi, 
It's my pleasure. I'm happy that you want to participate.
I'm not gonna lie, at first glance it can look confusing. But in reality, it isn't. We can't accept bank transfers directly, so we use verified resellers which sell vouchers. The process is as follows:
Rmb in your bank accoung --&gt; Send to verified seller via bank transfer --&gt; receive recharge voucher --&gt; account recharged :)
For the most part we all use similar methods because it's what available to us. 
If you need more help just let me know and I can take care of whatever you need.
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:24:03
Really? Hmm, that's odd. Did the price pass what your order was placed at?
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:57:56
If i'm understanding what you're saying correctly, that wouldn't affect anything because our no fee trading allows for massive cny/btc volume, at our height 8 billion CNY in one day(early march). However, if I'm misunderstanding your point, could you explain further. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:19:46
There was a meeting--but we also talk between each other quite often as well outside of meetings--and I believe what you're referring to is the agreement to introduce trading fees to HFT trades that was part of the joint announcement in early May. However, Huobi has always maintained that they will not add trading fees to their site, so to stay competitive either will we. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:35:55
Correct. It will be up within 12 hours.

The problem with this is that traders often times keep funds on site to trade with. Those who use our no-fee trading for HFT, our algorithmic trading, and margin lending, need the funds on site to trade with. So, in my opinion, this also doesn't give a good representation.

I'm still not entirely understanding your question. Are you saying that some think we should change the BTC/Fiat balances to what they were pre-gox crash?
All users will get a percentage from the 200k coins, and we might be able to return it in their preferred currency, I'll have to double check on that. 
Also, please take note, this is not an OKCoin takeover, we are not handling this takeover. BitOcean is. We will be licensing our technology and services to BitOcean for their restructured Gox exchange. 
 
@_date: 2014-12-01 10:19:25

The law in California *just* changed Bitcoin to a legal currency, so even in the country that is arguable leading the charge in Bitcoin regulation, it still isn't a legal currency. 


This builds onto their statement that financial institutions can't touch bitcoin, it's saying that it can't be on the FX market with financial institutions trading/holding it. By your definition of illegal, bitcoin is illegal in 99% of the world.

No one really knows. That's the problem. A lot of people say that most people in the government don't really mind bitcoin but there are a few who do and they have a lot of guanxi. Some say the state is about to crack down and arrest everyone. The truth is that no one knows and so it's hard to do anything because you don't know if you'll be poking the bear or not. 


I work for OKCoin and we feel great. It can get annoying at times--not having clear guidelines to follow--but I feel like we're still innovating(we have some big things in the pipeline that will be coming out over the next few days) and we're always growing. We are working to get outside of China, but things within China are a long long ways from dead. China still has the most mining farms, mining manufacturers, most exchanges, highest volume exchanges(but we have 0fee trading, so that bloats our volume) and the Chinese have not given up interest. 


It depends who you are talking to. I live in Beijing and so most people here are in the upper class of China, relatively speaking, or at least more clued into what is happening in the world and so many of them are aware of it. I've had many cab drivers that I've talked to about it and they knew exactly what I was talking about and were even following it. However, the vast majority still don't know what it is. 
I live in China, work for OKCoin, and love Bitcoin, if you have any questions about Bitcoin in China or how things are going feel free to let me know and I'll try and help out as much as possible.

I think a distinction that needs to be made is that the PBOC has yet to make a stance besides their Dec. 5th statement which doesn't bar them from working with BTC companies. So, the PBOC's stance isn't 100% clear as of yet. There are rumors but nothing official besides the Dec. 5th statement. 
However, to answer your question, we are working on opening up overseas as we speak.

From another answer in this thread:


Bitfinex is located in HK, not in China. With many of our users being based in China we have to compete with sites that have 0 fee trading, if we add a fee, there is a high likelihood we would lose a portion of our customer base.

@_date: 2014-05-06 07:21:54
From when Bitcoin started in 2009 Bitcoin has developed/grown in every country thanks to innovative thinking and skilled developers. Many people believe that BTC will become a new payment technology allowing for more efficient, cheaper, transactions. The World’s Countries supervision/regulation organizations have given Bitcoin a fitting environment to develop because of the importance of innovation. My country(China)’s supervising/regulating bodies have wisely given bitcoin a relatively loose/free environment to operate in. Furthermore, in the announcement made by the five ministries(I think this is in regards to the Dec. 5th statement) as long as a person accepts the risk of dealing with bitcoin, they are free to buy and sell BTC. 
However, we also realize that Bitcoin has run into a few problems in China, for instance the price volatility, market manipulation, insufficient notices of risks towards small investors. This all led to some smaller investors losing money. Being a BTC trading platform means that we have responsibilities we cannot shirk whenever any type of problem arises. Currently Huobi, OKCoin, CHBTC, BTCChina, BTCTrade have all been having deep conversations and deep self-examination(maybe they mean we’re all having a gut-check). We have all decided to engage in self-regulation as promote positive development of Bitcoin. 
We have all agreed:
1. Give sufficient notifications of the risks associated with trading btc and lead them to use normal/common investment concepts. 
2. Do not participate or organize large Bitcoin marketing conferences or gatherings. Instead we will promote conferences related to technology and innovation. 
3. Follow the regulations, operate an exchange legally and within the regulatory framework. We will stop our P2P margin trading before May 10th. After all loans are repaid and accounts are settled, all margin trading services will be stopped. 
4. To curb excessive speculation and protect small investors a fee will be levied on HFT(high frequency trading). The five major exchanges will discuss a rate which will be used across all five platforms.
5. Our trading platform will transparently handle the settlement of all accounts in regards to outstanding loans resulting from margin trading 
6. Comply with the requirements of the relevant state departments, strictly verify users identities, track suspicious transactions and perform anti-money laundering checks. 
7. Establish a strong system for disclosing information to users and allow them to wield their right to information.
8. Regularly tell the relevant authorities of recent developments and risks.  
Give me more time I'm still working on it.
These five Bitcoin exchanges will voluntarily follow the terms and conditions laid out above. Furthermore we all agree to strengthen our consultations and actively move forward in operating a transparent exchange as to spur healthy development for BTC within China. At the same time we will accept all supervision.

Currently, for a European(in Europe) it would be quite hard to buy bitcoins on OKCoin because you have to have a Chinese bank account. However, if you do have a Chinese bank account it would be very easy. Also, we are aggressively expanding into the international market and will hopefully be able to support European customers very soon. 
Edit: second part of the question. We are working on having an audit done right now, so this will be public information in not too long and you can compare the two sites then.

If you are Chinese or a foreigner with money in the bank, you can go to OKCoin.com, register an account, do a bank transfer to one of our verified resellers and buy a recharge code(0 fees) and use that code to add funds to your account. Then buy/sell bitcoins as you wish on our exchange.

I work for the exchange [OKCoin]( and can help you with any questions you might have. 


We need basic personal information for KYC(know your customer) and AML(anti-money laundering reasons). However, to purchase bitcoin on OKCoin.cn you don't need to provide proof of residency or a passport photo. 


Bitpay is a company for merchants that accept bitcoin; they take the bitcoin and give the fiat to the merchant through bank wires, all for free. This removes any worries related to volatility for merchants.


With proper security measures it is quite unlikely that you will lose any bitcoin. Use 2fa(two factor authentication) and strong passwords and you will be fine. 


Here is a wiki [link]( describing what the blockchain is. In short, it is a decentralized ledger tracking all transactions. It is hosted on nodes distributed throughout the world. 
[Here]( you can see the confirmation times. It will not become too much faster, sometimes it might be a little under 10 minutes but it will generally always be at ~10. 
If you have any other questions let me know. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:43:33
This is a sensationalist title and not very close to the truth. China supposedly(this is a rumor, like the rumor that all chinese banks were going to cut all ties with bitcoin companies yesterday, which didn't happen) banned the media from reporting on the bitcoin summit. They did not ban attendance in any way, shape, or form. 
Also, the summit went on without a hitch and there were great speeches all around. (Roger Ver) tweeted about it and also had a very thought-provoking speech himself followed by a very informative Q&amp;A. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:56:00
We've done an OKCoin AUA [before]( If there's interest for another one we can get another one set up. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:27:18
I addressed this in a post that can be found [here]( But I'll copy and paste it for convenience. 
An explanation of OKCoin’s high volume:
A lot of discussion has been centered on the trading volume at OKCoin and how it is “fake”. This, however, just isn’t true. It all boils down to the zero-fee trading model. Because we don’t charge our users any fees for trades there is a lot of HFT(High Frequency Trading) taking place. This leads to the “bloating” of our numbers. We have admitted this and our CEO Star Xu made a statement about this in a [Coindesk article written by Rui Ma]( 


There is an excellent [article written by Zhang Weiwu]( about the zero-fee model in China which includes many examples of how this method of business is prevalent in China; the focus is on user base. For readability I’ll put some of his examples and key points below:
Taobao, the largest consumer market in the world, charges 0 fees for all buys and sells.
Baidu(Chinese Google equivalent) offers 2,000GB of free cloud storage. To put that in perspective, it’s 400 times more than Dropbox.   
However that’s dwarfed by QQ, which offers 10,000GB. All free of charge. 
The volume on OKCoin isn’t fake, we aren’t fabricating numbers. That many coins are being traded on our site. However, the volume isn’t indicative of the amount of funds on the site. The fact of the matter is that comparing sites that have 0 fee trading with sites that charge fees doesn’t paint a reliable picture. phrased it well when he commented in [this thread]( 


Emphasis added by myself. 
So, to wrap it up, our volume at OKCoin isn’t “fake” it just isn’t a good indicator for funds on the site and for this reason can’t be compared to the volumes of exchanges that do have fees. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:53:35

@_date: 2014-08-19 08:54:48
I saw that. There's a limit on price variance because you don't want orders going into the order book so far below/above the market price that they won't be filled. For example, if the price is $500, I put in an order with 10% price variance, that'd be putting in the order at $450, the likelihood of that getting filled in a reasonable time is quite low, so we limit how lare of a variance it can be.

Hey everyone,
The deposit addresses on the site have been updated and the incorrect addresses removed. We hope to have withdrawals reinstated a bit later today.
I hope to have more updates shortly and will be sure to keep everyone updated on any developments.
**Bitfinex Update**
We have updated all of the deposit addresses displayed on the site. However, we need to wait for our bitcoind to finish syncing before any of the new deposits arrive to your Bitfinex account. Once this sync has completed I'll place another update, however users should see any new deposits in their account.
I'll also be sure to keep everyone updated on the withdrawal status as well. 
Withdrawal Update 17:11 UTC
The withdrawal system is being tested, some small ones have gone through and withdrawals should return to normal within the next hour or so. Thank you for your patience through all of this, I know it isn't ideal. 
**Final withdrawal update**
Withdrawals are being processed, we have quite a few to process but they are going through. Please bear with us while we process these.

I wholly disagree. First off, Bitfinex is a western company with europeans occupying 3/4 c level employees and an american occupying the other. I think the only asian they have is the kazakh girl that works support, who admittedly does an excellent job. But having worked for both okcoin and bitfinex, i'm confident that the former (which *is* asian) is much inferior to the latter edit: in terms of support.

I assume what you mean is that you had a buy order open for 25btc at 428 and a sell order (stop) at $422.5. Edit: Actually, after rereading your post, i'm confident that I know what happened. You probably opened a buy order at 428 and a sell limit order (not a stop order) at 422.5, when the system noticed you trying to submit an order below current market price it filled it for you at the best possible price (right around the market price). But I'll need to know your username to confirm. 
As to it executing a stop as a limit order, that would not happen, they're executed as market orders. And you're saying that the price hit $422.5 and your sell stop triggered opening a short. That is the expected behavior, stops can open a position in addition to closing one. But until I know your account username I can't actually see what happened and this doesn't sound right because the price didn't hit $422.5 so the sell order would not have executed.

If you're doing HFT, which many users on our site do, having a fee completely kills what you're doing. So, why would they trade on a site where it will cost them tons of money versus a site that will charge them nothing? Doing otherwise would be irrational. We admit that our volume is bloated due to this, we've openly admitted it. If you would like to read more about our volume, please see my [other comment]( in this thread.
Besides that, I can't comment on anything for Huobi, you'll have to ask them about their user base, not us.

It'd be the other way around, in this instance the volatility is happening because of the amount of slippage a person is incurring. 
For example, the price is stable, but then Pablo needs to buy $1,000,000 worth of btc. As he buys the bitcoin, the price will rise as he eats through the ask side. As the price starts to go up more people see the price rising and start trading, then he continues to buy further pushing the price up. If there was sufficient liquidity, him buying wouldn't drive the price up. Right now on bitfinex $1,000,000 would drive the price up to $420, $11 increase. Then he's going to need to sell that, which would drive the price down $7 using the current order book. So the price would move $18 off of only $1,000,000 (remember they would 1000x that a week), i know i'm glossing over some stuff, like how more orders would be placed as the price moved potentially thickening the book, but nonetheless, the point stands. 
But yeah, in the future it could happen just looking at from a theoretical point of view.

@_date: 2016-03-21 06:22:53


Sorry, but no. I've worked for the two most liquid exchanges in the world, OKCoin and Bitfinex, and utilizing all the tools they both have, hidden orders, iceberg orders, TWAPs, there's still no way you could avoid insane slippage. I once had someone contact me when I was in China and asked for help moving over $40,000,000/month into China, they wanted to use BTC if it could cut down on the fees they were paying. We looked into it pretty deeply and eventually concluded that there was just no way, the books aren't liquid enough, bitcoin is still too small. And $40,000,000/month is significantly less $1,000,0000,000/week. 


It's not the volatility that's the problem, although if you're moving the market that much volatility probably will be crazy, clear the book on the bid side when you purchase, and then clear the ask side when you sell, it'd be madness. But the real problem is going to be slippage, not the volatility.

I do find it funny that the people sending these have apparently not read up on your views about ethereum and bitcoin's roles and how they can 100% co-exist. As you told me earlier today, ethereum is meant to do things that bitcoin in it's current state simply cannot do, it's not meant to replace bitcoin. 
You and the Ethereum Foundation as a whole have always been quite stand up, so I don't think anyone here really believes (at least i really hope not) you guys are the ones behind these messages.

Can you please send me your username, I can look into this for you. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 03:54:20


I strongly disagree, look at 2014, one of the biggest years for adoption news (microsoft, newegg, tigerdirect, directtv, dell, expedia) and yet the price continually went down. 
What bitcoin has to do to go up is give people a reason to spend bitcoin at these places instead of cc's, which at this point there is very little reason to do so. Until then where you can spend bitcoin won't really matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:48:48


Btw, Jake isn't a BU developer, or a developer at all for that matter (he states this in the video as well). He's just a large proponent of BU and works for bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2016-03-21 06:00:04
$1.3billion is the number that was given out but it has a couple of flaws, they calculated it by going silk road did x amount of bitcoin sales, price of bitcoin at this time is $x (during the time this number was widely circulated the price was very high) so the total amount = $1.3billion, but at the time of many of the transactions bitcoin was at like $10, not $1000, so it's a bit flawed. 


You're 100% correct, there isn't enough liquidity in all of the bitcoin exchanges combined for the cartels to move entirely to btc, not even close. Plus, they would have to verify with an exchange, and someone randomly buying $1,000,000,000 of btc every week would probably draw some red flags.
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:26:04
My pleasure, and thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:26:01
Nowhere in your comment did you contradict what I said. People had issues withdrawing USD, not btc... 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:59:26
Gotcha... i just meant withdrawing plain old btc, the problems with USD were well documented and very bad indeed. 


Yep. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:18:12
then why did 2015 spend the entire year bouncing around $250? There were tons of places to spend, but no one was actually spending their bitcoin there. Haven't you noticed how many places are dropping bitcoin as a payment option because of people not actually using it. Just because they can't spend it somewhere doesn't mean they will. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:10:58
I think the vast majority of people that have spent time around Ver would completely agree with you. Every time i've been with Roger he's constantly extolling the benefits of bitcoin and talking to everyone about it, you can just see how much he really loves bitcoin. I might disagree with him on the best way to scale, but I have 0 doubt that he believes he's doing what's best for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 12:30:22
Try out destinia, i've found them to have better prices and options than cheapair and they also accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:26:53
I use copay as my wallet and use their recommended fee. I generally send bitcoin several times a week if not every day, i've only ever had a one issue with a transaction taking a while to confirm, and it was because an exchange sent it with a static 0.0001btc fee, and it took several hours to confirm. Outside of that, never had an issue. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:15:50
4 years without a hot fix speaks for itself. 3 months with 3 hot fixes also speaks for itself. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:08:45
So... just like i said. He never said Mt. Gox was fine. He said that the fiat withdrawal issues were caused by the banks. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:46:39
I think at this point it's silly to not include them on any list. They are **by far** the largest exchange, have the largest p2p funding market, have the most money on the order books, have the largest volume on pretty much every time scale. And with the cny exchanges being forced to add fees, it exposed them for what they were and showed how bitfinex is not only the largest USD exchange, but the largest in the world. 
During the last rally Bitfinex and Stamp were pretty much the only exchanges that didn't suffer downtime and I don't think bitfinex has had any unscheduled downtime since the hack. They've been pretty much rock solid. 
They've put a system in place that allows for anyone who lost money to recoup &gt;97% of their funds if they held on to their bfx. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:00:54
That was a typo, it was supposed to be 2014, not 2015, my bad. The video that roger made was in the summer of 2013... And nobody was having any issues with withdrawing btc in 2013 when that video was made or for months afterwards. How else do you explain the higher btc price? If people couldn't withdraw btc either, they wouldn't be buying it at an extreme premium just to get their money off the site. 
edit: just look at this thread, should answer your questions: 
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:37:18
Except for nobody knew that and people were able to withdrawal their BTC without any issues until ~~2015~~ edit: 2014... the withdrawal problems were on the fiat side. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:00:29
My pleasure, and good call. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:57:17
Yeah, it is pretty clear who i support. Why don't you ask some of the core devs, like btcdrak or bluematt? 
Just because i support core doesn't mean bullshit that's pro core, anti-bu/roger isn't bullshit. 


O god... i always hated on because of the insane conspiracy theories... but here we go. You and should have a faceoff and see who can come up with the best conspiracy. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 05:29:56
How would having more stores accept bitcoin increase the price? You would have to make people who don't use bitcoin now buy bitcoin to use it. Having more stores makes it more convenient for those with bitcoin to spend it, but if it's just as easy to use something i already have (a cc) then why would I buy bitcoin. We need to find use cases that drive people to use bitcoin over traditional models and spending bitcoin at stores isn't that. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:40:51
I wasn't aware that roger was supposed to hold the btc for gox...
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:09:42
I have no doubt that Roger has bitcoin's best interests in heart. He's done a whole lot for bitcoin that people here seem to forget, and he's been a part of this community for longer than the vast majority of us. But that doesn't mean that he knows the best way to scale bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:01:55
They were having issues withdrawing USD... not btc... 


they were having problems with USD, not BTC... 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:05:26


read this thread. Look at all the people asking why arbitrage wasn't happening. It wasn't an issue with btc withdrawals, it was with fiat. In 2014 when gox collapsed is when the btc withdrawals started having issues.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:06:16


Lets take a look at some of the companies that he's invested in and helped get off the ground:
blockchain.info  
purse  
kraken  
bitpay  
safello  
He's gone around and spoke about the benefits of bitcoin trying to get people to use for longer than most people have known what it was. If you've ever spent time around roger, he's always going around and looking to support companies that accept bitcoin. He's always talking to people about bitcoin and trying to get them interested. 


How has he been misinforming people? And you obviously don't know how he got that name if you think he gave it to himself. Peter Vessenes gave it to him because of him seeing roger with a group of people surrounding him as he spread the word of bitcoin. 
And yet roger still owns a massive stash of bitcoin that pales in comparison to what he has in alts. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:51:08
Do you really think they would have accepted the document even without that? Seriously? They blame all the bugs in BU's code on core, and can't accept that maybe... just maybe... not everything is core's fault, but you think they would have accepted that every major exchange except for one (which is also calling for replay protection btw) supported core on this regard (without some silly conspiracy theory like AXA bought the exchanges or something)? They wouldn't/won't accept anything pro-core or anything anti-bu, this is no exception. 


I still have no idea why they didn't do that, but that's all of their faults. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:43:07

How long can people keep using this excuse? Sure, it *could* happen in core... but it doesn't. It repeatedly happens in BU. This is what, the third hot fix in a couple months they've had to put out? When was the last hot fix for core? 2013?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:42:39
The only problem with this would be that has been around since the very beginning as well, Satoshi obviously had some trust in theymos. So maybe Satoshi's vision rubbed off on him as well. Think about it, theymos is one of what, 3 people (satoshi, gavin, him) that can use the Bitcoin alert system. So I think this kind of kills your point a little bit, there's a split between the 2 remaining holders of those private keys, Gavin and Theymos, in that they disagree on small vs large blocks.

Bullshit. Jake's had his views on the blocksize debate since long before he started working for bitcoin.com. I know because I've gotten into an argument with him on this for at least once a week for a year and a half at this point. His job is a result of his beliefs, his beliefs are not a result of his job. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 06:11:38


But this alone is the other problem and why they would never use it. That amount of demand proportional to todays market cap would drive the price up so much that the slippage would be MASSIVE and therefor they'd be losing a ton of money, so they wouldn't use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:01:59
I don't know why you think Erik would sign something supposedly different. There were two people that came out and confirmed that the document had changed, so it's not just Erik trying to stir up shit, the document changed... 


uh... by doing exactly what's in the document... Seems pretty straightforward to me.


Except for that's not what he said at all. 




@_date: 2017-03-18 06:19:05
Btw, there's another mistranslation. It doesn't say the big pools will win, the rest can't survive. It says the majority chain will win and the minority chain will die. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:30:13
First off, you don't know that. I understand that people are likely frustrated because bitfinex hasn't put out a post-mortem on the hack, but that doesn't mean they don't know which attack vector was used. Second of all, even if they don't, that doesn't mean that they can't completely remove the possibility of a similar hack by one simple thing: remove bitgo from being the custodian of your coins. Without the bitgo implementation, a similar hack is impossible. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:01:54
Sorry to see all the shit slinging and conspiracy theories here Erik. Thanks for taking the time to collaborate with the exchanges and come up with a way to handle the fork if it does indeed happen. And thank you for coming in here to further explain what happened and clear up confusion. I'm sure there are many many others like me that appreciate what you're doing, don't let the vocal assholes in here take away from that. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:48:00
You're misrepresenting what happened. Please link me to when he said that Mt. Gox was "fine"? If you're putting it in quotes, you shouldn't have a problem showing me where you got that quote from with a time stamp, right? He said that the withdrawal issues were being caused by the banks and not a lack of fiat at mt gox, which was true. Bitcoin withdrawals weren't an issue at that time, which is why gox was trading at a premium, you could buy and withdraw BTC, but couldn't sell and withdraw USD, therefor gox having more buy pressure than sell pressure. Then gox lost all the bitcoin and collapsed... Two completely separate incidents.

I can't remember all the details of this account, but i do remember some facts. Do you create multiple accounts to do just this and never trade with any of them and repeatedly deposit/withdraw without trades? If so... probably not a good idea.

I'm claiming that people were not having issues with bitcoin withdrawals in summer of 2013, the issues were on the fiat side. Hence the premium, people were willing to pay higher amounts to get their funds off the exchange, and the only way was through bitcoin.

look at a lot of the videos that roger makes, he reads a prepared statement. The gox video alone in that.
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:36:11
Yes and no. On the one hand, if you held onto your BFX the solution put forth by Bitfinex would allow you to recoup that amount, so yes. But on the other hand, it's not Bitfinex paying you the whole amount you've lost, it's others buying the bfx from you in faith that bitfinex will continue to redeem that at their $1 face value. So while Bitfinex hasn't made everyone whole, the faith that they will has allowed people to recoup pretty much all of their losses (if they held onto their BFX), which of course exists because bitfinex has done such a good job to date on paying people back, being a reliable trading platform, and crushing it in terms of volume. It is indeed impressive, they've done a very very good job of handling the hack.

None of us 3 were here at that time, however I just talked to our CEO about it and he said that following the PBOC release we had a few users using HFT, after this was brought up with our customer support we looked into it and contacted the users and made them stop, resulting in the massive volume dive. The canceling of the Q&amp;A isn't related, I speak from personal knowledge, he is extremely busy and often has to prioritize certain things, at the time, the Q&amp;A wasn't the most important thing.

I don't think you're understanding how the BFX tokens work. It's not pegged to btc, it's pegged to the USD value of all coins at the time of the hack. So what the price does is irrelevant, they owe a static 1USD per token in debt. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:26:52
shouldn't be an issue then. And if you're transferring back to the same wallet you sent from, that also makes it less likely to have an issue. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:17:35
Don't care who it was, it was on the main/core client. Many of the core devs were devs then as well. Can't just point to two people and blame it on them, other people were part of the review process then as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:57:33
Or it's an attempt to put a stop to constant bitching between the two sides and opens up an avenue for them to put their money where their mouth is. It also can be used as an indicator of what's to come in the future. If BCC trades near market and BCU trades at like $10, probably doesn't bode well for BTU after the fork. The inverse is true for BTC. This allows people to get insight into how they may want to trade in the event of a fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:07:43
They used the price at the time the site was taken offline which I believe was $604
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:34:58
I completely disagree. He went into the thread in which he said that the document had differed, he explained what was different, he explained his stance on the situation, and added a ton of clarity. Just because it's not what you wanted to hear ("bu is an altcoin") doesn't mean that he did "damage".
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:24:01
As is, if you held onto your BFX you would have been able to recoup ~99% of your losses. There's a reason why they're over 50% of the BTCUSD market.

On the run up to $504 we reached nearly 300,000btc/24hr without any issues or downtime, so almost 3x what we did yesterday. Plus we've made a lot of improvements since then so we should be able to handle even more. I'm confident we'll fair just fine.

So you think we should give everyone access to the backend? that's not how it works, we have strict access controls.

He also can only use limit orders and not cross the book. The stop hunting is completely baseless and a lie.

Where are you getting the idea that the collateral doesn't exist? Go to the margin funding page and see for yourself. Every trade is fully backed by funds on the site. There are over $7,000,000 on our margin funding books (plus over $30,000,000 more already out) for the explicit purpose of acting as collateral on trades.  I don't know where you got your misunderstanding, but it's not even close to the mark.

Unfortunately this was not an option. We were told by our hosting provider we needed to complete the move to the new hosting center by the end of the weekend as they were shutting off power. This was in part why we had to have the scheduled downtime and this was also the cause of the slow response times some were experiencing the other day.

No, you're still wrong. Fractional leverage means that we would be creating leverage out of nowhere, that's factually incorrect and not even close to what the CFTC said. As always, the funding for leveraged trading comes from other users on the site, every last cent is accounted for, it is not fractional in any way, since the beginning.

I second this, egifter has worked great for me as well. 


I think egifter actually has more, and you can choose whatever amount. I chose one for like $1112 for amazon, with gyft you could only choose like $100, $250, $500 etc.

This is an ongoing process and something we continually work forward. One thing we have done is consistently address the issues that we have faced. Our hot wallet was hacked, we implemented segregated customer wallets giving users near-real-time proof of reserves. The post-trade processing issues we experienced last august; we routinely updated users with what optimizations we were making with our change log and communication on reddit, twitter, wechat and other various mediums. These optimizations were put on display when we reached nearly 300,000btc/24hr volume with minimal lag and no downtime comprising over 60% of the the BTCUSD volume. I'm not saying we don't have our issues, but we address our issues, progress in that area, and come out stronger. This will not be an exception. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:54:18

Not even close. We routinely handled much higher volume than this in the past week. Just in the past week we broke $100,000,000 in trading volume and remained above 100,000btc for days.

@_date: 2016-06-21 19:05:41
There are multiple points that I’d like to address, first of all being that your timeline here is massively skewed:
The site started experiencing problems late last night requiring us to take the site down. We investigated the issue and believed that we could get the site back up and running again around 00:00 UTC. While we were down the price had moved down on other exchanges causing the price to dump down upon resuming trading. Unfortunately the trading engine crashed again almost immediately leading to us taking down trading. During this time users were able to withdrawal as they pleased. This went on for several hours until we once again resumed trading around 4:00 utc. We posted updates on twitter, reddit, tradingview, our statuspage and made an announcement on the site. The site started operating again but we warned users we were still not at 100%. We noticed some irregularities and decided to err on the side of caution and take the entire site down while we continued to investigate. The issue was a networking issue within the datacenter and due to the sensitive nature of the issue we believed it to be much wiser to take the site down completely until we could come to a more reliable solution. During this entire time we were on the phone with our hosting provider trying to figure out what the issue was. They identified the issue and this allowed us to resume trading about 4 hours ago.
Now to address several of the points people have raised about the timing of the migration:
This migration had been planned for months, it wasn’t something that we could push back any further. Our hosting provider informed us two weeks ago that they would be cutting off power to the datacenter that we were currently using. This required us to complete the migration over the weekend which was done successfully and we saw a high volume of trades processed with minimal to no lag and no other indications that anything was awry in our new location. We worked with the datacenter to identify the problem which they were able to do after several hours. At this point we learned that this was not limited to just our servers but was a more widespread issue throughout the datacenter itself affecting multiple clients. After they identified the issue and put the required fix in place we were able to resume trading.
As to resuming trading: we gave users a 10 minute window to cancel their orders before going live. We had notified users that we would give this 10 minute window via a notification on the site, twitter, reddit, tradingview, teamspeak and our statuspage. We resumed trading from the last matched trade and the order book quickly filled in and we were quickly near parity with other exchanges.
As to the stop loss. We ensured that the exact scenario you described wouldn’t happen by manually handling liquidations and stops.
If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will try to answer as many as I can.
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:59:34
What are you talking about? Instead of being open about downtime? I was using every media we had available to communicate exactly what was happening with our site.

If anyone ever has any doubts about whether their funds on bitfinex are safe I urge them to go check the blockchain.

So using bitcoin to get local money to spend isn't "using bitcoin"? So what do people generally do when they go to asian countries? According to your definition you can't "use a debit/credit card" because most places won't take them, and using it at an ATM to get local currency, again breaks your definition of "using" them. I use bitcoin a medium of exchange... that's using bitcoin. I use bitcoin to book hotels... that's using bitcoin. I use bitcoin to book flights... that's using bitcoin.

Really? [Twitter]( [reddit]( I'd show it on tradingview but that chat doesn't go back that far. We absolutely did warn users that the site was going to go down. 


Not sure what you're asking here. We manually handle them so as to prevent dumping onto thin books. 


Users could cancel their orders if they so wished. Those who didn't want to cancel their orders could leave them there. This seems like the superior solution. 


It was not planned. In an ideal world, yes, we would know when everything is going to go wrong. But in reality things happen quickly. The last time we took the site down, I started noticing oddities, called the devs, confirmed and had to take the site down all within 10-15 minutes. During which time I was doing everything I could to notify everyone on reddit, tradingview and twitter that the site was going down. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 02:56:22
What? No... why would you say you know this? It's 100% false. Every trade is fully backed by funds on the site. There are transparent metrics telling you how much is taken out in leveraged positions, how much is take out in margin funding, and you can quite literally see the funds being reserved for margin funding. There are over $7,000,000 on our margin funding books (plus over $30,000,000 more already out) for the explicit purpose of acting as collateral on trades.

This is not what happened at all. You're speaking out of ignorance here on multiple accounts. The problem was network connectivity within the datacenter. While we were working with our hosting providers to find a solution we were working on a way to get the website back up and running in the meantime. We warned users that this was not 100% and that we were still waiting for a more complete fix. Unfortunately we started noticed oddities and decided to take the site down until we could come to a more reliable solution. Our hosting provider identified the solution that caused issues throughout the datacenter, not just affecting bitfinex, and worked on a solution. After they found the solution and worked on a fix we were able to get the site operating again. 


No stop losses were triggered upon re-entry, again, you're speaking from ignorance. We manually handled liquidation orders and stop losses, so no, no stops were triggered upon reentry.

They would distribute it according to RRT after redeeming all the BFX. It wouldn't be fair to do it across all account pro rata, since some of the account held onto their BFX and have only had the value of redemptions added to their accounts. Whereas many sold their BFX and got $0.3-$0.6 for them, so you'd be punishing the people who held onto the bfx and rewarding those who sold them (they get the USD/BTC from selling the BFX, plus the pro rata distribution). Bitfinex has carefully considered how to go about distributing recovered coins, that's why RRT exists.

They are no longer doing this, after the hack they moved back to traditional hot/cold storage and aren't settling transactions to the blockchain once a day like before. 


What happens if Kraken gets hacked the day after the one-off audit? You wouldn't know that they're running fractional reserve. By settling to the blockchain once a day you're giving everybody the ability to verify their funds on the blockchain daily, making it nearly impossible to operate without the same amount of BTC as users have deposited.

THE DEFENDANT: I've been taking cold medicine.  
THE COURT: All right. Does the cold medicine
affect your ability to understand what you're doing right now?  
THE DEFENDANT: It might impair my ability to
  determine that. I feel pretty miserable. I have the
 flu currently.  
 THE COURT: Would it be better to do this a
 different day?  
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to do this today
And your other point is way off the mark as well:  


Where did he state or imply that it was a physical threat? He said that he felt the additional charges and possibility of more jail time was a threat, he never implied nor stated he thought it was a physical threat. As soon as the judge clarified that's what he meant, roger said no he was not threatened. 


 way in order to cause you to plead guilty in this case?  
 THE DEFENDANT: It depends on how you define
 "threaten," but I would say no, Your Honor.

harmed or some member of your family will be harmed or
something bad will happen to you apart from the legal
process.

I'm not going to another exchange; exchanges are going to have problems that require dealing with the public at large, and I just don't want to handle that area of business anymore. I'd much rather be in a position where i can work closely with large clients, as they are much much easier to deal with than those with $42 in their account who always seem to scream the loudest. 
Also, i'm not confident that the Chinese exchanges haven't been hacked, it's just that they never went away from hot/cold wallets and so the hack would be comparably small. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't release it if they were hacked. And even those that aren't hacked aren't absolved of losing large amounts of money. Huobi has accidentally transferred amounts totaling nearly $1,000,000 to the wrong accounts on two occasions.

I'm not aligning with anybody over anything, i'm merely pointing out your misrepresentations. I'm pretty outspoken in my support of core and i disagree with roger on the best way to scale bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that I don't find it annoying when people massively misrepresent things to besmirch others. If what you think he did is so bad, why can't you simply represent it as is and let people draw their own conclusions instead of trying to add implied meaning or your own spin on things. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 02:06:19
So do you also believe that ViaBTC's tweets about blocking segwit that were made around the time of price jumps caused the price to go up? And that the rise in may was caused by Peter R's work on xthin blocks (i've seen many claims of this)? 
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:10:58
Or it could simply be the market going up and going down. There isn't always a concrete event tied to the price jumping up or down, in fact more often than not this is true.

I use destinia for the majority of my flights and i don't get charged the cc fee, plus destinia often has better prices than i'm able to find anywhere else. And this isn't a rare occasion, i travel extensively; multiple cross-continent flights a month and tons of domestic flights (been to 29+ countries this year). It's sooooo much more convenient than credit/debit cards.


how is that not a legitimate use of bitcoin???
@_date: 2016-11-19 16:16:50


Yes, that is correct. I don't think it would have been fair to Bitfinex or the users to quit when things were at their worst. I wanted to see them through the worst of it and make sure that it was apparent I wasn't leaving a sinking ship. Instead i'm leaving an exchange that is back comfortably sitting at the  position. However, I realized that no matter what an exchange is going to experience problems that need to be dealt with on a very public front and I was tired of doing that, hence my resignation. 


That's the whole story, but if you have any questions or need further clarification on something i'd be more than happy to answer in an attempt to help clear things up.

I made no comments to the veracity of the claims, i merely shared what i was able to find on Chinese media.

O, interesting. I never looked on GDAX for a job so i hadn't noticed that. 
It was more than just the trolls, it was the realization of not wanting to deal with the public and be in the spotlight, and that no matter how good an exchange is, it's going to have problems that will need someone to get out in the public and deal with it. I really don't mind dealing directly with my clients, it's dealing with the public at large.

No, not really. I don't know why people are downvoting you, you're right.


They didn't outright ban it, they just made the wording very ambiguous and it can be interpreted that merchants can't accept bitcoin, this is why there is no Chinese Bitpay/Coinbase equivalent.

For verified users, it's pretty easy, we just check the address that they used to verify. For unverified users, we do an ip check and if we see that the ip is from new york we ask the user to confirm that they are/aren't an NY resident before continuing to the site. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:06:20
I completely disagree. I feel like most of the people that i've known in the space since the beginning of my time were immediately attracted to the idea of bitcoin after hearing about it. That's also why myself and most of my friends are 100% crypto and have been since we got involved.

After that 15 minute window the matching engine will return online and operations will continue as normal.

@_date: 2015-08-09 01:32:05


I think you're quite mistaken on why we aren't applying for the bitlicense. 


Regulation isn't the only way to accomplish this. Bitfinex is the only exchange in the world to employ segregated customer wallets for all users' bitcoin providing near-real-time proof of reserves. We didn't do this because of any regulation, we did this because it's the best security method out there.  
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:31:07
Why? The vast majority of the people this affect will be the ones that use Taobao or use their alipay/tenpay account to buy things at merchants. None of those merchants accept BTC (nor will they since the regulation on using bitcoin for purchases is too ambiguous for anyone to proceed confidently) so why would more people trade/adopt btc because of this? I highly doubt that this will have any increase on the Chinese demand for btc.

There are many factors to our decision, however we hold our users' privacy in very high regard, and seeing how we are an international exchange with a high percentage of users coming from outside of NY. Adhering to the bitlicense would put these users' privacy at risk and it would compromise the privacy of our employees (having to send finger prints to the NYSDFS). There is a slew of other reasons behind our decision like how much time it takes to go through the application as well as changing our system to comply with their regulations. In sum, we didn't view it as worth our time or the best for our users' interests. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:54:02

Yes, I do, as I've talked to many of them comprising a large portion of the hashrate. They also signed an agreement to this effect, saying that they would run segwit once a 2mb proposal of non-witness data was put forward. We have it here, i think we should run with it as I do strongly believe it would get consensus. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:26:20
I don't work for them now however, so it'd be weird to refer to them any other way. For example, take the sentence i just wrote, if I was to heed your advice it would be "i don't work for us now however".

@_date: 2017-04-04 06:29:29
Yeah, extension blocks are such a silly idea. [It's not like core dev johnson lau came up with the idea]( or [theymos made a post about it two weeks ago talking about how they are a good idea]( and [Adam Back definitely didn't have good things to say about extension blocks in 2015]( 
And since roger has also invested in Bitpay, does that mean that they're up to no good as well? Should we not listen to anything stephen pair has to say? And what about Kraken? Should we belittle anything that they affix their name to like the agreement among exchanges to list a BU forked coin as BTU?
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:28:38


and somehow got it in an article, complete with quotes from Stephen Pair, all within a couple hours? Or maybe we should go with occam's razor here, which would imply that samson merely put something out shortly before the release? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:34:08
Joseph Poon has already responded to saying he'd be happy to prevent boosting in extension blocks:


of proof or documentation of this (doesn't need to be conclusive, just
something), I will provide my word and promise publicly here and now
that I will personally see to it that a commitment which solves this
(albeit possibly using a slightly different format to make it
compatible) is added into the Extension Blocks spec. If there is
evidence, my support and authorship of the Extension Block specification
is contingent upon resolving this issue.

You can't, you can put Tether, which while being pegged 1:1 with USD, still isn't USD.

@_date: 2017-04-04 03:54:21
Instead of subscribing to endless conspiracies, maybe it's best to look at the obvious explanations for things. It's pretty obvious that the release was already prepared and ready and that samson just tweeted about it before it was published. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:11:19


Uh... actually the whole reason they got hacked was due to the segregated wallets setup they had in which customer funds were segregated... That's why the hack isn't one large transaction leaving a single address, but lots of transactions with bitcoin being sent from each customer's individual address. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:01:13
Not sure, when need to ask tether, but i don't believe there is.

That doesn't really contradict what they put out. They said the wires went out and were rejected. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:14:37
a) the amount is inaccurate. b) the hack happened due to their segregated wallet setup, so saying it happened because they *didn't* segregate customer funds didn't make any sense. and c) they didn't "borrow" the money, the customers funds were stolen... and they already redeemed every bfx token, so if you just held on to your bfx you would have been fully repaid by now.

So he has a problem with the governance of bitcoin, which was the main point of the article i linked to. Yes, he's had a problem with the governance for a long time (since before blockstream was even founded), that says nothing about the current road map or the technical merits of the proposed scaling solutions.

Yeah, it was still enforced. Not quite at current levels, but yes it was. Bitstamp and mt gox both required verification, the gox verification queue got to like 25,000 people at one point in early 2013. 


Trading isn't really the same as selling bitcoin and receiving USD in your bank or in cash though. You can still trade without verification on the majority of exchanges, but you can't withdraw USD without verification on any exchange that I know of.

For example, Itbit pours their OTC volume through their order book (they deny it, but there's a ton of proof to the contrary) and that's why you'll see 10,000btc go through at a time with no volatility and the orders themselves don't move the market.

The system ensures that the trade would not give you a negative balance at the time of execution, so the trade would not have been able to happen. Because this redemption had a relatively small effect on open orders we didn't change the quantities or cancel any orders, but if the redemption would have a larger effect we would have to do that.

An exchange matches trades in real time, so you place an order, and if i place an order that would match it, our orders are matched, trade completed, and that's the end of it. This is an auction, this only occurs once a day (the actual trades, you can place orders whenever) at 4pm ET. So this is like batched volume vs real time volume i guess.

It says 24hr volume is 0 though? so maybe it was just a bug, but no trades were matched.

Nobody is being forced equity; if a bfx holder wants to convert to equity we are exploring options to allow them to do so; if they want to sell their bfx and get market value for them right away they can also do that; or they can wait while we try to redeem all tokens at their value of $1 USD, as we just did with 1.18%. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 10:01:16


Conducting a full forensic investigation of our systems and preparing the report takes a lot of time. We are in the process of doing this with of Ledger Labs and plan to release more information on this as soon as possible.


and if they don't believe in our ability to redeem those BFX they can sell them for over $0.5, effectively returning them 83.13%. We suggest users not to sell so that we can redeem all bfx at their $1 value and this is an option for them to do so.

I can understand that, to the average consumer bitcoin may still be intimidating, circle allows them to use it without knowing that they are. I don't really care if people know they're using bitcoin or not, as long as the benefits from using it are being reaped. If everyone used bitcoin today without knowing they were using it, but had nearly free, 24/7 near-instant unstoppable transfers, i'd be happy and consider bitcoin a resounding success.

He says that 9 transactions per second isn't going to work and that fundamental aspects of bitcoin's architecture need to scale. He never said anything about pivoting away from bitcoin due to the lack of scaling. He didn't say anything at all about the lack of scaling. Why are you trying to twist what he said to fit your own narrative?
Segwit, schnorr signatures, libsecp256k1 verification, those are all things working on scaling the fundamental aspects of bitcoin.

What country are you located in? If it was a western country and he sold his bitcoin there is a very high chance that he used an exchange or service tied to his name. To sell bitcoin for USD in America (or Europe) he would probably have signed up at a bitcoin brokerage/exchange (e.g., coinbase, circle, or mt gox/bitstamp if this was two years ago) and give them all your information (passport/id, proof of residence, and possibly social security # or tax id) or use localbitcoins which for a lot of people isn't nearly as convenient and you can't get as good of a price. 
Once you share the address it should be pretty easy to find out if it belongs to a known bitcoin company and you can go from there. 
edit: 


That's like saying it would be ok if the roommate stole all the money in his wallet as well just because he knew he was going to buy drugs with them. That bitcoin is money just like the money in his wallet, your brother also could have used it to buy any number of things.

@_date: 2017-09-13 09:54:31
Ah, i see, I was in fact missing something. I didn't know that chainalysis rebranded. 


I had a discussion with some of the team at blocktrail back in 2014 when they were adding a bunch of features to their blockexplorers, like flagging transactions from darknet markets or gambling websites. I argued that it was a terrible thing to do and bad for bitcoin, but their counter-argument completely won me over and now I think any analytics companies are a very good thing for bitcoin. Basically they were saying that all of this is possible to not just them, but governments, or anyone really, you just have to dedicate the time to it. As such, it's better to know where our weaknesses are by seeing where analytics companies are able to gather this information and fixing that, than getting angry and bitching at these companies for doing something that any government could do but none of us being aware of that. 
I wholeheartedly think companies like this are needed. If a company with practically nothing in resources in comparison to a government can ruin the fungibility of bitcoin, we have serious issues. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:03:59
I disagree. In 2013 I think this place was pretty much only about price. How often would you come here in 2013 or even 2014 and see the whole front page filled with posts about something technical like segwit or schnorr or lightning. I think in the latest pump we've definitely reverted more to price posts and memes, but i'd still say we are much much more focused on the technical (e.g., segwit) and fundamental (decentralization) aspects of bitcoin than any point since i got started in bitcoin (2013).

Your stance is complete horseshit, i've never once heard anything like that from a miner and I've spent a lot of time in the Chinese bitcoin community and done business with a lot of miners. If you honestly believe that miners don't want to go through with the next reward halving, and I'm sure you believe miners control BCH, then lets make a wager.

You can't count all core nodes in with UASF. Sure, they both support segwit (as does 2x), but if doing an upgrade without consensus is an attack, UASF would be an attack and such an attack would be means to an end to get segwit activated. 


Is that consensus? Seems like you yourself don't know how you define consensus. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:40:30
So you're saying that nodes are what form consensus and anything without consensus is an attack on bitcoin. Following this logic, UASF was an attack on bitcoin. It didn't have consensus, per your own definition...

I'm not. If you don't understand the difference between a p2p model and a custodianship model, i'm certainly not the one playing dumb. 


Don't know what them being regulated has to do with anything


if there isn't actual support for it, then they can't do anything. The only way it would succeed is if there is legitimate user demand for it. So saying that they are taking over is a contradiction in itself. 


That's one hell of a leap in logic. That's like saying since blockstream and chaincode labs are based in america, which has strict KYCAML regulations and has been known to force companies to install backdoors, can control most of bitcoin development then it is likely that governments will force AML/KYC/Blacklists etc. on chain.

At Bitfinex we have near-real-time (settlement happens about every 30 mins) proof of reserves through Bitgo. Each user has their own segregated wallet and can independently verify it at any time on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:10:05


We have the highest volume of any BTCUSD exchange on 24hr, 3 day, 7 day, and 30 day time frames. When there isn't volatility all the exchanges generally end up with somewhat similar volumes, this was true before the hack as well.  If you look at our share of the volume, when things are quiet, we've pretty much always traded in a similar range to other exchanges, but when things move we take over. Look at last september, we were ~20% of the market, then in november when the price moved we went back to ~60%. Since the hack we haven't really seen any big moves, but on these couple percent moves, we still go back to number one in volume. I'm excited to see how the next big move will play out. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:31:56
That's not true at all. I definitely support segwit and think it should have been activated on day 1. But I'm also for trying to keep as much of the players in the community (devs, miners, companies) together as possible. Without 2x we lose the miners and many of the biggest and best companies in the space. For this reason, among others (e.g., i don't believe the rhetoric behind 2mb leading to a complete collapse of decentralization) I support 2x. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:20:13

The ToS does not say that using a proxy is against the ToS, it says that using a proxy for the purpose of making it harder for us to inspect the activity on an account is not allowed. There are tons of legitimate reasons to use a VPN/proxy with our service. E.g., if you have an ip whitelisted but travel, you can have a vpn with a dedicated ip address. Besides, I use a vpn 99% of the time I log in, and I know many of our users use VPNs as well. That in itself is not an issue.

For maybe a bit longer, but then the higher profit margins that the other companies make are going to lead to them getting more and more mining power and soon KnC wouldn't have the hashing power to compete. If they're going bankrupt at a price more than 2x what it was 6 months ago when the chinese were still making huge profits, they're not going to last even if there is a rally. It'd only be delaying the inevitable.

Although Bitfinex swaps aren't the same type of lending employed by sites like BTCJam, it is practically the same to the lending party. Furthermore, the loans on BitFinex are guaranteed, they can't be defaulted on, since if the money loaned to the trader gets close to being lost the trader will receive a margin call, have his position closed out, and the loan will be returned to the lending party.

But the amount of inflation eventually pretty much reaches 0 after a while. It's like how there will never really be 21,000,000 bitcoin mined, just closer and closer to 21,000,000, ETH inflation gets closer to 0%.
This is the best way to understand ETH inflation. There's 100eth, if i add 10 eth every month, at the beginning it's 10% inflation, but after 100 months there's 1,100 ETH, so now the inflation is less than 1%.

Because the statements made by the Chinese government were intentionally vague, they never actually strictly stated that the exchanges couldn't do this.

Hey Over the past week or so I’ve been in touch with BitFinex and am very pleased to announce that I have joined the BitFinex team as Director of Community &amp; Product Development.
For over the past year I’ve been focused on creating the best trading platform in the world and that is what I want to continue doing. While talking with BitFinex the one thing that attracted me the most is their commitment to this goal; our views are very much aligned. They are 100% focused on the exchange and giving traders the best experience possible. I hope that together we can continue to improve the--already very strong--products offered by BitFinex.
It is my honest belief that one of the best ways to improve your product is by listening to your users. I think I demonstrated this at my last job and moving forward I want to ensure everyone that I will be taking this mindset with me to BitFinex. I will continue to interact with the community, listen to what you guys have to say, and try to build the trading platform that you all want to use. You can contact me on here at anytime with any suggestions, problems, or just for conversation.
I look forward to working with you all and BitFinex towards creating the best exchange in the world.
Cheers,  
Zane Tackett

Kraken doesn't have the issue of taking care of lenders as they are the lender. Bitfinex has p2p margin trading so it's much more complicated.

Hi I work for bitfinex and would love to help you understand what the swap feature on bitfinex is and how to use it. 
Basically, you are going to lend out bitcoin or USD (it's up to you which) to other uses who will be trading on leverage. The benefit to this is it adds liquidity to the market since there are more/larger trades being made on the exchange, it allows for traders to earn more on price movements, and most pertinent for you, it allows anyone to earn interest on their bitcoin/usd in a very safe matter with pretty much 0 risk of default (we liquidate traders before they lose the money they have on loan). 
Does that help you understand the swaps any better?
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:24:30

The thing is that if you have a market cap of $10,000,000,000 and you add $1,000 the value lost is on such a small scale so that it doesn't matter. The type of inflation happening in the global economy is a set decreasing inflation rate forever, so it's not an apt comparison.

This comment makes absolutely no sense; you're saying that in the past we've done lowered the price to do a short squeeze (basically getting people to have their shorts filled at the low price and use that for a short squeeze to shoot the price up). Except you're saying that those with the orders at $190, $180, $170 didn't get filled, so who would be on the receiving end of a short squeeze if nobody got their orders filled at artificially low prices. It sounds like you mean there was a long squeeze (that drops the price) but mistakenly thought that a short squeeze drives the price down. 
Besides, this whole comment has been proven to be false by an independent third party: 


This would mean that the orders around $190/$180/$170 were filled otherwise execution wouldn't be in line with expectations. They follow that up with this:


Again completely disproving what you are saying.

And lets go back and look at the 1hr chart on both exchanges and see what happens with an RSI over 30? Sometimes it goes up, and sometimes it goes down. It is not an infallible indicator, if the RSI is over 30 that does not in any way shape or form confirm that the price is going to go up. It's one of many indicators, that when combined can give you an idea of the market--and even if every single indicator points to the same thing--that could still be completely wrong.

So what you're saying is, anecdotal evidence is going to rule out evidence based in fact. A company that is funded by Andreesen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and DCG is a much more reliable source than your friends. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 06:09:21


No, it's actually very simple. The site had very bad lag during this time, so people would see the price of $170/$180, but due to lag that order wouldn't hit the order book for upwards of a minute. By the time their order was actually placed, the price was no longer at those levels. 
This conversation is pointless, you're saying i know a guy who said something while i'm presenting actual evidence. Have a good day.

I wish they got a bit more recognition for it. They've done a bunch of amazing open source work. Copay is an excellent wallet, insight is a good block explorer, and I think something for nodes.

There are so many things wrong with this post it's hard to decide where to begin, but lets get started.
* redditor for 2 days
Off to a good start
* when it should by all technical indicators show the price should have risen.  
As all of us here know, technical indicators never fail and past performance is always indicative of future results. Also, can you point to these clear technical indications that it should have risen?
* Bitstamp is far worse than Bitfinex as I have seen the spread be as large as $2.00
You realize market makers add liquidity to the books and reduce the spread right, not the other way around. So having a big $2 spread would be indicative of a lack of market makers. 
* and the buy price is hyperinflated so margin investors
Bitstamp doesn't have margin trading. 
* margin investors cannot play the bounce with the sell price is extremely low therefore trapping them
Most market makers do so across multiple platforms, if the price is higher on bitstamp, they would buy btc on bitfinex at the lower price, send it to bitstamp and sell it. Or they would hedge whatever positions/orders they have on one exchange with the other. So you have no point here, one exchange having a higher price doesn't "trap" anyone.


And how is "Bitfinex" prolonging the downtrend (interesting that you would point to us though, considering we led the rally the entire way up)? Maybe it could be people taking profits, or possibly people buying on the lower priced chinese exchanges and selling on the USD exchanges for a profit. 
Basically this whole post is "I thought bitcoin was going to up in price and it didn't, but I want to blame someone so why not blame the exchanges or market makers.

Currently positions get liquidated when a user's margin is ~10%, so they've lost ~90%. 
The remaining margin comes from whatever btc is left over after the user has been margin called.
Example: I have positions open with $100 in margin, after losing $90 I am margin called, I would have $10 of margin remaining after the liquidation. This $10 would then be deposited into the insurance fund.

It's not just "armchair" detectives, but ex-employees (like myself) and the ex-CTO who have intimate knowledge of the situation. There's also traders who do large volumes on there and can see when volume washing occurs. It's not a theory that the chinese exchanges inflate their volume, it's fact.

You're talking about the blog post written by Arthur Hayes, the CEO of Bitmex. And the point was that there were more efficient existing systems than bitcoin for evading capital controls and that bitcoin wasn't being used that much. But the fact is that right now Chinese are only allowed to send out $50,000/year, Beijing has more billionaires than NY, they need to send more than that. So there are a lot of work arounds, but they're being cracked down on; unionpay transactions are now limited to $5000; UnionPay is charging higher fees for international withdrawals; UnionPay is cutting down on which ATMs can be used for withdrawals abroad; they're shutting down underground banks that are facilitating capital flight.

We will indeed. And yes, I definitely have more trust in btc and that's why I use it all the time, keep most of my money in btc, and work for a bitcoin exchange. I'm not going to lie though, i've been doubting eth for a while now and i've been wrong for a while now. I've always been excited to see what they come up with but never saw the price doing what it did, still excited to see what applications they come up with though as right now it's mostly speculation.

OKCoin isn't in the big block camp... they didn't make any statements towards either sides for pretty much the entirety of the scaling debate until a month ago when they came out and said they hope **miners and devs can work together to activate segwit:**

Right, so I'm watching Blockchain.info headlines waiting to see something about our market makers, so that I can call them (even though this was posted at night during Europe/US and tell them to put the price lower than Bitstamp because a 2day old account is accusing us of something on reddit with a single iota of proof. That makes total sense. 


Really? You didn't see this before the regulation news came out? Their 7 day avg. spread percentage is 0.15% (as is the 3 day and 24hr), their 30 day is 0.12%, so barely any change.

While we are constantly monitoring the situation of other cryptocurrencies, we are more focused on the growth and development of bitcoin. We are all strong believers in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and general and want to work towards ensuring a bright future for them. However, at this this time we are focused on improving the usability of Bitcoin through OKLink as well as the ability to trade bitcoin on OKCoin.
If an altcoin comes along that we believe has a bright future and adds more to the table, we will definitely look into it. 
I think many altcoins are experimenting with the capabilities of the blockchain and what cryptocurrencies can do and look forward to seeing how many of them plan out, for example: storj, ripple, ethereum.

Our stop orders are stop limit orders, not stop market orders. This means that during times of high volatility when the price is moving fast the order may not be filled. We have addressed this before in the past on We suggest that users leave ample room between the "Trigger Price" and the "Order price" so as to ensure that the order fills.
The reason why we don't use stop market orders is that using market orders can lead to cascades which cause flash crashes as seen on BTC-e and Bitfinex in the past. 
We are aware of the issues and are looking into superior methods to ensure that users can safely exit their positions while away from their computer while still avoiding the dangers of cascades.

Sure you could change what's displayed on bitcoin.org as the "white paper" or whatever you want to call it. But we all know Satoshi and satoshi only wrote the whitepaper and that's the end of it. No amendments, additions, deletions, it is what it is.

This is incorrect; they offer margin trading via p2p lending, 20% of the interest earned from the lending party is paid to the exchange. Furthermore, they make money on CNY withdrawals, I know okcoin charges 0.43-0.28% for withdrawals, the cost to them is much lower.

Your friend more than likely didn't use Coinbase exchange (exchange.coinbase.com), but rather coinbase's brokerage service which is generally 1%. I'm assuming he used a debit card to buy and incurred some additional fees there. 
[Here's a table of most of the exchanges and their trading fees](

This logic is hilariously flawed. By following your logic, lets say we raised bigger blocks and more investment came into bitcoin. Do you think it'd go into the company that is profitable at these prices, or the company that is declaring bankruptcy at these prices. If a rally happened, the chinese miners that are currently in profit would be way more so in a rally leading to them further outgrowing the west. If KnC needs higher prices just to break even, there's no logical situation that they can compete with the chinese.

I wouldn't say that they're the biggest exchange. They have peaks like this where they have high volumes, but if you zoom out and look at a longer time scale i'm almost positive we (bitfinex) are still quite larger. 
Also, compare the size of the order books, we currently have 46,000btc worth of bids on BTCUSD, they're most liquid pair is ETHBTC which has 8335btc, add on ETCBTC which iss 7243 and you're at about 1/3 of our most liquid pair's order book. 
Another example is margin funding. We currently have ~$40,000,000 opened in longs and 18,000 btc out in shorts. I highly doubt either of these numbers on polo are even close.

No, he didn't "forget" to mention it to me at all. It doesn't change the fact that when we're getting to $5 and above transaction fees, more traditional alternatives might actually be cheaper. 


Dynamic fees isn't a complete solution. We use bitgo's dynamic fee calculation and still run into issues with users not having withdrawals confirm quickly. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 08:05:23


Not even close. Ours (bitfinex) was 0.5%, we only ever kept 0.5% in the hot wallet. Bitstamp lost 19,000 btc valued at ~$5,000,000, quite a bit more than us. Furthermore, shortly after the hack we implemented real-time proof-of-reserves so that users could independently verify their bitcoin on the blockchain at any time. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:00:50
Yeah, this is complete bs. I tried talking with roger in vietnam a couple weeks (i'm a quite vocal core supporter) and we had an excellent conversation. Not only that, but he showed me how the problem with rising fees is much worse than I assumed. He showed me specific transactions he has sent with over a $5 fee that took hours to confirm. He also showed me all the emails he gets from bitpay about transactions not confirming causing issues for merchant payments. I heavily suggest any of you try talking to roger as I have, you will likely have a wonderful conversation. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:05:11


I can assure you this can't be farther from the truth. Why would someone who's probably personally invested in more bitcoin companies than anyone else, who holds a massive amount of bitcoin, who uses bitcoin every day want to disrupt bitcoin? He sees a side of things that very few of us do, I certainly haven't. He showed me specific transactions with over $5 fees that took hours to confirm and told me about other transactions with higher fees and the same problem. He also showed me a bunch of emails that he gets from bitpay telling him the users' transaction hasn't confirmed causing issues with their merchant payments. So I can see how he's frustrated. Sure, you can fault him for how he goes about it, but you most definitely cannot fault him for wanting to "disrupt" bitcoin.

Which we (bitfinex) will not be doing. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 12:58:24
No, it's a maker-taker fee schedule. If you're a maker you get a rebate, so maybe 0.05% and they charge the taker 0.15%, so the exchange takes 0.1% and gives the maker the 0.05%.

Do you accept bitcoin for treks in Nepal? I just visited and thought it was the most beautiful place in the world, and would really like to return. If I can pay for a trek with bitcoin i would 100% do it. Plus, I always like to meet up with fellow bitcoiners on my travels.

1) Trading will not cease, only deposits/withdrawals. 
3) We (bitfinex) are looking into allowing withdrawals on both chains.

BitGo was implemented to securely store the BTC in a transparent fashion that provides users with near real-time proof of reserves. 


This is up to us, we can even use custom settings for specific accounts. 
It sounds like you haven't link your bitgo wallet with your bitfinex wallet. Your bitgo wallet isn't just automatically linked to bitfinex, you need to do that from within your bitfinex account. Alternatively you can just go to the top right drop down menu, go to reports and click "Wallet Addresses" under the "Bitgo" section and it will show you all the addresses used in storing your bitcoin.

That's actually demonstratably false. After the PBoC went after the big three lots of smaller exchanges saw it as an opportunity to take market share and started advertising how they could deposit/withdrawal no problem and their volumes instantly blew up. You'll never believe what happened... they shut down withdrawals shortly thereafter. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:42:42
That is incorrect...

Right, because the chinese government wouldn't lie. Like in May 2014 they definitely didn't tell all of the media that they couldn't report on the beijing bitcoin conference, and then in public say something completely different. 
And you're taking the comment from the PBoC at face value. "we did not ask trading platforms to suspend w/d." could also mean, "we did not ask trading platforms to suspend w/d. but if they didn't, we would shut them down and/or arrest them for violating capital controls and money laundering laws". For example, read the Dec. 2013 announcement about bitcoin from the chinese gov, it's masterful in not really declaring anything illegal, but still allowing it to be interpreted as making things illegal at the same time through ambiguity. 
As to solvency claims, you think all chinese exchanges just so happened to hit solvency problems at the exact same time? Not just the big three, but all of them... 
And your paragraph about capital flight makes 0 sense. "Nobody is going to leave their bitcoin on the exchange in first place" uh... exactly, that's what they were trying to prevent; people being able to get their bitcoin off of the exchanges....

Bitfinex is a BVI company and nobody knows when USD withdrawals will resume to normal. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 11:26:34


Since the company I work for is mentioned in the title i feel compelled to respond to this comment; you are so far from the truth. If the exchanges didn't care about the long term success why would we spend all of our time working towards creating products for the bitcoin community. If I didn't care about the long term success, I probably wouldn't have had my salary be 100% bitcoin for over 2 years. We invest in companies we think can help bitcoin, when there are problems within the industry (e.g., blocksize) we take part in the discussions and try to help everyone move forward. We're all working towards the long term success of bitcoin, i'm not sure most people in this thread can say the same.

I'm not sure what you mean, what's my "trip" with him. I've talked to several times, he helped support the beijing bitcoin meetups and get them off the ground, and he's been a major boon to the bitcoin industry. Without his miners there's no way we'd be where we are today. He's villainized on here, but you only see a very curated view of how things really are.

This isn't true at all. They have very very high difficulty in moving money out. Yes, many are connected and able to buy properties abroad, but even more are not and cannot send their money out of the country. You can't just walk into a bank in China and wire $20,000 to the states.

Except for the translations are terrible. Example from a previous comment of mine on the whole 8btc post debacle. 
Anyone who speaks chinese can very clearly see that the poster never said that anyone had agreed to anything, he said he was proposing an idea:
One of the points the guy makes is:
Translation: this is just a suggestion that i'm giving to miners and pools, if you don't agree or have a different opinion, just ignore me and treat this as chit chat.

No, he's villainized here because he has a different point of view. 


People bitch that none of the bitcoin companies fund development. They fund development, and people bitch that they try to take over bitcoin and consolidate their cartel. And this doesn't just happen here, when blockstream was created to help fund bitcoin development the people at did the same thing.
By this logic, has DCG not tried to take over bitcoin and consolidate their cartel because they've invested in so many bitcoin companies? 


keep dreaming. Bitcoin mining, and mining in general, will always be inherently centralized to a certain degree.

uh... no. They restrict how much money you can move out of the country, but moving money within the country is much easier and has less supervision than it does in pretty much anywhere in the west. You can move $1,000,000 between accounts without question where in america it would trigger so many compliance checks it'd make your head spin. 


No, they want total control over politics. 


No, china is a major part of bitcoin and supplies the majority of the networks hashrate. You simply fear the unknown. Have you ever been to china or talked to the chinese bitcoin community? If they were taken out of the equation, volumes would collapse; they don't only trade on chinese exchanges, they also comprise large percentages of the volumes on non-chinese exchanges. 


Beida is not the university closely linked to the government, that'd be Tsinghua. Basically you know nothing about china and so you just spout bullshit because you're afraid of the unknown.
