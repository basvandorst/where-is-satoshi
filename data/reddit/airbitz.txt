Hi n0mdep. Yes, you can backup the private seed of each individual wallet in your account. Click on the Export icon (top left) in the screen of a wallet. Then choose [Wallet Private Seed]. This is the raw entropy of a BIP32 wallet. We don't yet have good tools to extract the private keys from the seed, but there are some basic command line tools in the Libbitcoin SX tools.

We considered solutions like waggle but chose against it as those require a centralized server with knowledge of the transaction and the parties involved. It also limits the ability to be cross-compatible with many independent wallet implementations. We don't want to limit this to just Airbitz to Airbitz. We're trying to get a standard in place and are already talking to several payment processors to get it on the merchant side.

Sorry for the quick skim over the backup system. Basically once a wallet is created, it is encrypted locally then automatically backed up onto peer-to-peer cloud servers. This all happens before a user can ever receive any funds. We want to make sure there's never a point when a user has funds in our wallet and they could lose them due to device failure.
Hope this helps

A receiver's phone would still want to broadcast this to the network and make sure that it wasn't double spent. That would not save much time at all. You are right that sending the Tx to from the sending phone to receiver phone does allow the sending phone to be offline (so long as it has up-to-date UTXOs). But it would require both NFC and BLE to do that which Android does not support very well, even in v5.0

We've been in that exact scenario in a sub ground level cafe trying to pay with poor internet. I totally hear you. Once Android 5.0+ with good BLE support takes off, then we can do a one-tap to get the Bitcoin URI, then use BLE to send the transaction from consumer to merchant w/no internet. We are working to spec out the full BLE-only (no NFC) transaction for iPhone in the meantime.

Airbitz will likely be the closest thing to Dark Wallet on iOS. We already use and contribute to their core Libbitcoin/Obelisk and we're looking at putting in all the added privacy features next year (tor, stealth addresses, coinjoin).
You can already use it today on iOS and Android 
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:30:05
The Airbitz wallet does connect to airbitz servers but your identity or deviceID are never sent. Even your transaction meta data is encrypted by your own credentials before being sent off the phone. Like every other mobile wallet, some info is leaked when connecting to bitcoin nodes as specific addresses and transactions are queried and those are tied to your IP (but only your IP address). We will be improving that with prefix queries early next year. Airbitz is probably the most anonymous wallet that still provides server backup and synchronization between devices.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:28:30
The first 'tap' is to exchange the bitcoin URI. The Sender then needs to accept the amount or enter an amount. In order to send that back to the merchant, you'd need another Tap (awkward) or BLE.

Airbitz cannot import a master seed. You can export the master seed but it is not in BIP39 format but rather in raw entropy format which needs to go through a step to get it into the master seed. Not ideal at this point. Sorry. We're looking at supporting BIP39 early next year.
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:50:30
Note that the login &amp; password you use to sign up are seeded and Scrypt hashed to encrypt your data locally on the device. Then they are hashed again with a different seed before leaving your device and hitting the servers where they are hashed AGAIN server side before getting saved. Your account info (login, password, all meta data, settings, private AND public keys) are fully encrypted locally and never known by Airbitz or anyone else. The only reason to "sign up" is so your data can be encrypted, backed up, and synced to your other devices.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:16:44
The same can be implemented with Bitcoin by simply auto-paying up to a certain amount from a wallet. That's effectively what 'tapping' a wallet on a sensor does. It deducts from your account without you having to approve it. That's dangerous with Bitcoin unless your wallet has some spending limits. And that's what we've put into Airbitz.

You can login on any device that was logged into before. Basically, logging in the first time on a device will download your encrypted account and wallet info then decrypt it. Logging in a second time is just decrypting that data already on your phone.
Note that the device must have been online when any new wallets were created in the account. Once it has the wallet in there, you can recover any funds that the wallet receives, even without Airbitz servers being up.

Touch ID is on the roadmap. Really it can only replace the PIN since it isn't secure enough to replace the password which is the encryption key.
2FA is being thought out. We want to make sure it's easy. Issue with 2FA is that we don't collect emails or phone numbers and we don't want to. That only leaves Authy/Google Auth. But if a user loses their phone with the 2FA key, they are screwed.
However, since we are ONLY a mobile app, someone can't brute force your password by hitting our servers directly via a webpage. Our auth server is locked by an API key. Not great, but better than if we gave web access like most wallets that have (and need) 2FA.

Out of curiosity, what would it take to get you to switch to Airbitz as your defacto mobile wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:26:43
If our service went down, you can still send your funds out by logging into the app and just doing a Send. The app knows how to access 3rd party bitcoin nodes. You can login to the app an a device that you've used before even without Airbitz servers. It does requires a full login/password (not PIN login).
Right now there are no good tools to import the private seed. We are working to push out some simple tools to do that. In the meantime, it requires the Libbitcoin BX command line tools.
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:50:09
There isn't any friendly software to sweep the private seed at this point, but it is doable using command line tools from the Libbitcoin or Airbitz Core open source code. Note that this would only be needed given absolutely catastrophic failure as our wallet can still send funds even if our servers are down so long as you've at least logged into your account once on your device.
The Airbitz wallet allows you to "local-login" which just decrypts your data on your device then send out the funds directly to the bitcoin network.

This is our first attempt at slowly eliminating the dependency on QR codes which can be frustratingly difficult to scan under a lot of lighting conditions. It is only available on iOS for now due to Android 4.4 limitations but we're shooting to get it into Android 5.0 soon.

The method of preventing a spoof is that the BLE request broadcast only shows the first 10 digits of the pubkey + the requesters name/handle. If someone else utilizes the same name/handle, then the UI colors both the requests in orange and warns that there are duplicate named requests so the payer can check the public address with that of the requester to make sure they match. If a request is selected by the payer, the full URI is pulled from the requester and the full public address is compared to the 10 digit prefix. If it doesn't match, then the request is flagged as fraudulent and the payer is not allowed to send it money.

@_date: 2014-12-21 19:14:37
Challenge with doing this offline is that you also need bluetooth or a double tap which is VERY awkward. Right now, Android doesn't support BLE functionality in a proper fashion to do this. Rest assured we'll push forward once it does.
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:20:01
The account login/password allows you to create multiple wallets in the account. Each wallet is an HD, rolling address wallet so you change addresses with each transaction. You never have to deal with addresses individually. The wallet does it all for you.
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:17:29
Sorry, it's pretty tough to support anything lower than Android 4.1. So much functionality and UI interfaces aren't available so we'd have to double code a lot of things. Hopefully this isn't too much of a hindrance.

Not true. Airbitz is NOT a hosted wallet. We go through great lengths to retain user privacy and financial autonomy. We have ZERO control over users funds and fully encrypt all user private AND public keys with the user's credentials, not ours. You aren't trusting Airbitz with your money any more than you are trusting a wallet like Mycelium or Breadwallet. See this for an understanding of how our wallet functions:

Identity is needed to easily create email/SMS templates for when users send bitcoin requests. All info is local, client-side encrypted. We see absolutely none of this info other than location info for the business directory, and that has no association to a user.
Contacts are used for payments requests as well as to easily tag transactions from people in your address book. Once again, all info is locally encrypted and we have no access to that info.
We are an open source wallet so people can verify the purpose of all the access needs.

Airbitz has an adjusting fee and it was upped during the stress test to achieve higher priority transactions. It has always had this ability in case of such occurances. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 02:17:19
Backup restore right now will be a tough process. We have some commandline tools to recreate the private keys from that master seed. The bitcoin nodes we access are fully peer-to-peer and run by multiple parties and are very likely to not go down. Those are used to send/receive bitcoin.
However, the servers that store your data are only on Airbitz. They are needed if you lose your phone so it can restore your data to a new phone. 
That backup seed would be needed if you lose your phone AND airbitz goes does. We think that would be a very rare case, but if you're that paranoid, we let you backup the seed.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:50:32

Providing incredibly high security over a broadcast standard is difficult, and that is why we've published the BIP for other developers to review, comment, and improve.
1. Regarding the dead address, we can alleviate this by hashing the full public address then using the first 10 characters. We originally thought of this implementation but wanted to save UI space and not have the user presented with both the hash AND the public address on the recipient's screen. We'd hope that the incentive structure makes it uninteresting to do such an attack but it is worth putting in that extra measure.
2. This is simply due diligence on the user's side. Maybe we're asking too much, but the combo of an incorrect recipient name and a differing address prefix are two measures that should provide enough warning to a user.
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:58:02
Note that even though Airbitz lets you record all your transactions with rich meta data, all that info is 100% private and encrypted on your device, with your password so no one else can see your transaction data or private keys.
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:46:10
Give Airbitz a try. Lots of functionality to make bitcoin super easy to use. Auto-encrypted and auto-backed up. Uber levels of privacy built in. You control your private keys but it "feels" like mobile banking with simple username/password access from multiple iOS/Android devices. Would love to hear your feedback.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:10:03
NFC is already implemented by multiple wallets. It is just super clunky due to Android limitations. Recipient needs to tap their screen *while* the two devices are in contact. Unfortunate
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:57:02
We are in contact with Libratax and will be working with them on an export format that works with their software. We also love what [Tapeke]( is doing in making a financial tracking app that utilizes local, client-side encryption to provide full privacy instead of uploading all your financial info to a 3rd party. We'll be making sure to be very compatible with them as well once HD wallet support comes in.
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:16:56
Keep an eye out for an upcoming release in a few weeks that has 2FA support. And we're going to accomplish the worlds easiest to use 2FA. So mind boggling-ly easy it puts Authy to shame while it still retains full privacy (no giving up email, phone number, or other personal info). :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:19:00
No. it's clunky because of a security precaution on Android. A device may NOT send data over NFC without first tapping their screen. Therefore the URI can't be sent until then. And the worse part is that they require that *while* the phones are in contact. 
NFC will be great when implemented on the merchant side. They can use custom NFC hardware without that limitation. The URI recipient doesn't have that requirement so all would be good.
BLE is a great solution for person to person transfer w/o the need for a 3rd party identity provider like how Waggle requires Hive to be the 3rd party.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:54:24
In October, we launched our mobile wallet with support for Bluetooth transfer of the payment request, eliminating the need for QR code scanning between two Airbitz wallets (on iPhone only for now). Our long term vision has always been to bring incredible ease of use to the bitcoin ecosystem and this was one significant contribution to that cause. We’ve had some people rave so much about this feature, that they said “Just don’t show that ugly QR code!” Well, bitcoin isn’t free of QR codes just yet, but we’re one step closer.
Today we’re publishing the spec for our P2P URI Wireless Transfer Protocol so that other wallets and payment processors can view, discuss the spec, and offer inter compatibility with the Airbitz implementation. We hope for a world where bitcoin becomes more fluid for peer to peer value transfer than anything available on *legacy* payment methods.
