If decisions are reached via the input of each and every member of the community/collective/group then nobody is having anyone deciding anything for them. If these decisions are being reached via consensus or by a two/three/four/more tiered system of decision making, again involving the input of all at each stage, then nobody is having anything decided for them. Yes, if the decision that the group reaches is not favourable to one particular individual, then they will be subject to a decision that goes against their wishes, but it is reasonable to acknowledge that if their wishes were to be met then the same fate would belie some other member of the group who disagreed with them.  
 
There is an argument to be made that it is impossible to act in any other way than in ones self-interest – the ‘there is no selfless good deed’ argument put forward by none other than Phoebe from popular 90s sitcom Friends. Looking at things this way obscures the fact that humans are compassionate, empathetic and sentient beings with a consciousness of their surroundings. It is possible for someone to say to themselves (for example) “although this will not benefit me in any way and may even leave me in a less favourable position than I am in now, I want this outcome to pass for the benefit of others so that they may enjoy life as I do”. This allows for possibilities that a society of individuals encouraged to act primarily out of self-interest for the good of the whole would find much more difficult to come to; a society such as that might say “although this will not benefit me in any way and may even leave me in a less favourable position than I am in now, I want this outcome to pass to improve the living conditions of others, therefore making this a nicer place to live and increasing opportunities for trade and commerce, increasing the employment base etc etc”. All very admirable ends but thinking like this in the long term leads to certain individuals taking extraordinary measures to ensure their self-interests are realised, this is something we have witnessed in our own lifetimes many times over.

Infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier. 
On the real though this is a terrible story and I feel absolutely terrible for OP. In my opinion if someone really wants to hack someone badly enough they will find a way, and in no circumstance can it be the victims fault for being a victim. 
If this happened to me I think I'd give myself some time to just mourn, learn the lessons then start again. Oh I'd also join a team of Ninja hackers and make it my life goal to seek revenge on such lowlife scum Punisher style. Feel so sorry for OP :(

This is another thing that libertarians/anarchists and other new world order types fail to explain. Once this ideological utopia is realised in their geographical location, what about all the other countries who still have governments with schools, armies and healthcare systems etc. what will they do? 
How we get from now to this wonderful future, where we all volunteer into our leaderless societies and pay for everything from the school down the road to the sewer underneath it, is always absent from this kind of discussion.

The distinction you make between community and collective is yours and yours only - objectively speaking the two terms are interchangable, in the sense that a community can be described as a collective and a collective can be described as a community. 
Nevertheless a world in which everyone is 'forced' to be part of a group is no better or worse than a world where everyone is 'forced' to be an individual. I am not advocating that people be forced into anything, I advocate a society that is organised, built and run with the collective benefit of all within that society in mind. 
A society comprised of atomistic individuals acting in self interest, with no provision in place in which to ensure agreements, rights and obligations are met is not a sustainable society in my opinion, its success is based on a set of assumptions that do not fully stand up to scrutiny.

[reposting due to mysterious disappearance]
The unquestioning belief in capitalism and markets reveals the limited scope with which people in this sub and the likes of AA use to understand human relations.
I'd be interested to know what people's understanding/definition of capitalism is or what it even means. Capitalism itself is such a broad term that you'd probably find there are as many definitions for capitalism as there are people. I wouldn't be surprised if most people gravitated towards a free-market/laissez fair definition as this is all that most people have been shown/told.
For me Bitcoin and crypto will have flourished when the discourse escapes the limiting understanding of human relations as a series of exchanges between atomised individuals for the purpose of maximising self interest. Breaking free of this requires a much more accurate understanding of how 'money' has been used historically, and will therefore enable much wider possibilities for how money can be used to create systems of living not seen on this planet for at least centuries or even ever.

@_date: 2014-12-18 17:43:31
I am aware of this and this is the point I'm making, Bitcoin has history; countless (up until now) failed attempts at compromising the blockchain itself, years of resillience and trust built around the name alone let alone the protocol, features and peripherals (how many other cryptos do you know that are compatible with Sidechains/Coloured Coins etc) Countless numbers of free and robust wallets etc. 
Bitcoin will never go to $0 unless the infrastructure around it completely disappears and the protocol itself is compromised, essentially as long as someone has use for Bitcoin it will always have value. I'll have a use for it even if it does go to $0

If no violence is used against peaceful people it is libertarian. Is pious pious because god loves pious?
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:52:36
I don’t believe I suggest that it does – individuals acting in self-interest regularly work together if a common interest has been identified. The enemy of my enemy is my friend etc. However this is completely different to saying that a decision will be taken by a group of people, a decision that may not necessarily serve ones self-interest but serves the interests and benefits the group as a whole, possibly to the detriment of a single person or minorities interest. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:52:47
I think you missed my point - please identify in anything I have written an example of where I have advocated a monopoly on coercion to enforce group decisions. 
This is the point I make, some libertarians seem to assume that any society that doesn't use the libertarian model and has any degree of collective organisation, will also inherently use violence to enforce the will of one group on another. I think this assumption is reductionist and highly limited in scope.

@_date: 2014-11-16 16:00:14
This is something that's always frustrated me about Bitcoin - the long and erratic transaction times. 
You see a lot of talk in this sub about alt-coins, referring to them as scams/pump and dumps/clone coins. The truth of the matter is that there are some good ones out there that have actually solved problems like this, with transaction speeds as low as 10-12 seconds on some. 
I'm a massive fan of BTC and a hodler/spender too, but like someone else mentioned this is a major bug that should really have been fixed by now. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:22:28
“Libertarianism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between collective decision making and centralisation. As a result of this, every time we suggest an action involving any sort of group decision, the libertarians conclude that we want a system akin to the state where all power and decision making responsibilities are conferred to a tiny elite of people who then impose their own interests and desires upon an unwilling majority who are powerless to stop them due to the elite’s monopoly on violence which enables them to force the majority to accept whatever they give them.
When we suggest the idea that education could be a statutory provision resourced and supplied by the group as a whole the Libertarians say they are being coerced into funding their education. We suggest universal healthcare, the Libertarans say they are being coerced into paying for their health. We suggest roads etc..
It’s as if by providing them food from the communal garden, the group is forcing them to pay for what they eat!"
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:52:35
Why does collective decision making have to take the form of central planning? 
Can collective decision making not be done in a decentralised manner, where individuals come together and reach consensus on a particular goal/idea, and then that goal/idea is realised through the actions either of the whole collective or a fraction of the colletive acting on behalf of the whole, for example?  
To say that individuality equals freedom whilst collective approaches limit freedoms is reductionist and a false dichotomy - there are plenty of examples currently where individualistic processes and structures lead to corruption and oppression. 
The Tragedy of the Commons is often trotted out as a rebuttal to those of us who believe in collective approaches to society, well  take a look at the [Tyranny of Small Decisions]( for reasons as to why individualist, self-interest driven, laissez faire, non-harm, non-interference type societies might also provide conditions for corruption, monopoly and degradation to exist.
To OP: I am an egalitarian, a liberal and a social democrat/anarchist at heart. Bitcoin as a piece of technology is inert, with a tide large enough to carry all boats. The trick is not to try and convert those that disagree with social democratic/liberal ideas, but to show the example, get up and build the structures and processes necessary to transition away from current authoritarian systems. Once the transition begins it becomes much much harder to argue against it, as we are currently seeing with crypto itself. 
In a sentence, the time for thinking is over, its over. The time for putting our money where our mouths are and building the future we wish to see is right now and we all need to do our bit no matter how small.

No the size of the ruling elite is irrelevant, it's the assumption/fear that there will be a ruling elite at all
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:42:42
That's why the software uses a trustless escrow system to mediate transactions.
Bitcoin is paid by one or both parties to the escrow to act as collateral. If one party scams the transaction the other recieves the collateral payment of the other.
For example: Bob wants to buy 1btc from Alice for $400, and asks for 1.5btc as collateral. Alice pays 1.5btc collateral and waits for Bob to pay the $400.
Bob pays Alice the $400 and alerts Alice. Alice sends Bob the 1btc over BitHalo and the escrow instantly sends Alice back the 1.5btc collateral. Job done!

This. A system based on competition, individualism and self-interest (profit), where the one with the most money has the most power, will only give us what we already have. We can easily do better, however I do understand that for all of us in one sphere or another it is difficult to think outside the box when you've been inside it your entire life. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:42:43
Yes I wondered this myself. Could be trolls like suggests, in which case that throws the whole survey into disrepute. 
If we are to assume the integrity of the data then this could mean either that the Bitcoin/tech spaces indeed have a really big problem attracting cis-women, or that for whatever reason Bitcoin is really popular amongst trans people. If that was the case then it would be really interesting to know what those reasons were.  
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:53:31
Again the distinction you make between community and collective is totally unique to you and is not uniform at all - I cannot point to any objective source that sets this distinction out (if you can please inform me). Similarly, I could say that you are wrong, and actually it is an organisation that represents strong unity, common goal and purpose, whilst a group only has some common grounds that hold it together because they see benefit in cooperating. Do you see what I mean?
At no stage in any of what I have said above have I explicitly said nor implicitly implied that people should be forced to accept anything. Why is it that for some of you any ideology that promotes the idea of a group acting together involves some form of coercion? Is this a result of living under the command-control state systems we have been made accustomed to our whole lives?

The lead developer of Darkcoin just won an award for trustworthiness and competence so no idea what you're talking about there. 
Blackcoin's POW phase was completely open to the public and lasted two weeks, and it has been relatively stable the last 5 months averaging roughly between 8 -12 bits a pop, no pump and dump there. 
There is a list of Blackcoin innovations as long as my arm including POS2 (completely reconfiguring coin age so it is no longer used to calculate network weight in staking, thus making the coin more secure. If this is 'a lack of innovation' you have very high standards!). There is also Bit/Blackhalo, Excoin; the first purpose built exchange for a cryptocurrency, the first coin specific multipool, Onyx etc and so on.
Don't take my word for it though, see for yourself here for a list of ongoing and successful projects --&gt;

Too right, the vast majority of alts are what we would call shitcoins. Probably only about 15-20 alt-coins worth knowing about really. A few I would add to your list would be Dogecoin, Darkcoin and Blackcoin. Slimcoin I've never heard of.

No I've not heard of Emercoin either. Namecoin is certainly a really interesting so if Emercoin provides a twist that could be interesting. 
Proof of Burn sounds absolutely brilliant, I've heard the phrase before but this is the first I'm reading into it. Essentially by placing 'mined' coins in an unspendable address you burn them,  and this then allows you to create value elsewhere; either by bootstrapping another coin to the value of the burnt coins or through some other implementation. Open Bazaar is using proof-of-burn for its reputation pledges system. Sounds pretty clever!

Food prices actually aren't going up due to those reasons, many of the price spikes have been due more to western commodity speculators. Global food production is essentially at an all-time high right now. The growth in demand from a global middle class that increases by roughly 150m people per year is certainly a factor, but its definitely not THE reason.
Also oil prices massively spiked in 2011 and 2012 due to the economic crisis, which compelled world governments to revise-down growth targets and therefore oil budgets. Iranian sanctions and (as you correctly stated) supply disruptions in places like Syria, Yemen etc also contributed, but supply disruptions in Yemen were not THE reason for an international oil price rise to around $130 per barrel. 
Moral of the story is: 'supply and demand' unfortunately doesn't work as an economic skeleton key you can use to explain away anything and everything. 
Now I'm not so sure about the US but I know over here in the UK the effects of £365m (over $500m) worth of QE have been masked, in part, by an artificially low BoE interest rate of 0.5%. Once the inevitable happens and the govt gets tired of giving out essentially free bonds/loans, if they raise interest rates by .5%, 1%, even 1.5%, the rate of inflation will certainly take a sharp upward turn. Weimar style hyperinflation is a long shot in my opinion but it would be folly the Bitcoin community to discount the effect of QE on both the fiat based economies and ours.

The title of this post reminded me of the Nas Lyric from the song Hate Me Now:
"People fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer. Guess its just a theory of man become a monster"
There are plenty of people in the world who wouldn't want something like Bitcoin to succeed, and they will spread misinformation and half truths in order to undermine it. As most people find it hard enough just to get along with their daily lives let alone understand how to safely use bitcoin, they won't/can't take the time to fully understand bitcoin, and at best will rely on (mis)information from trusted sources. 
Ultimately though I don't think the spread of FUD by mainstream media outlets will be enough to reduce the possibility of widespread adoption of bitcoin, particularly if the bitcoin economy/community continues to innovate and grow as it currently is doing. The more we find utility for bitcoin, and the more innovations of the likes of Bitpay, Mastercoin, blockchain.info etc that find their way into the mix; the more opportunity bitcoin will hold to make a difference to the lives of communities everywhere. 
As someone above explained very well there is no pr or marketing department for bitcoin beyond those of us that believe in the concept. In any case word of mouth is the most effective form of promotion there is, so for someone who for whatever reason may need bitcoin but doesn't know it yet, that person is relying on you, me, and us, to explain by word of mouth what this bitcoin thing is really all about.
