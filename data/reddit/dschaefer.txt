I agree it's not the right place. I also am by no means saying the current system is good. My point is that after a few thousand years of written history we have no examples of any long lasting society that was good to the people and wasn't violent or corrupt. It's unfortunate, but there is always someone looking to exploit good naive people. Just look at bitcoins short history...
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:43:41
Yeah, she seemed hung up on that, which is unfortunate. More unfortunate is that the enthusiasts where eith unable or unwilling to address the question.    
The truth is, if she is still hung up on it being drug money, many other people will be as well, and enthusiasts need to educate the greater public that that perception is not correct. I would explain to her that the reason it was/is attractive as a means to buy illicit substances is the same reason that cash money is an equally attractive method. You can transfer it from person to person without having your name or a personal account attached to the transaction with the added benefit of a physical face-to-face exchange being unnecessary. While these benefits have been attractive to people trafficking illegal substances they, and the many other features, will be equally attractive to the general public when they become aware of them and when the goods and services they want may be purchased with a decentralized digital currency.    
It is unfortunate that generally 'seedy' operations seem to drive these innovations, but when the innovations are truly positive they quickly transcend that. It has been bit-torrent and the porn industry that has driven many advancements in the distribution of video entertainment. It was napster and the like that drove the distribution of digital music and is probably a huge reason that a lot of digital audio technology as well as the ipod ipad etc even exist the way they do in todays form. Major companies that have been around for ages are slow moving giants. It is difficult for them to implement new technologies, and they have the safety net of feeling untouchable. So, these things start with the lowest forms of business, the ones that have to adapt and move quickly to stay 'safe' then the little guys pick them up because they see the true benefits in the technology. Finally, and often too late, the big guys jump in.    
Look at the itunes music store, basically a legitimized (centralized) napster, did not even exist 12 years ago and is now one of, if not the, the largest music retailers on the planet. They saw the benefit that digital music distribution had to offer and they have been handsomely rewarded for it.    
So going back to the purchase of illegal materials using bitcoin, It puts a bad mark on bitcoin, but it also illustrates how useful a tool this really has the potential to become. If we can get past the fact that people will find a way to do things illegally regardless of if its with cash, crypto, or something else because it makes a great headline and good stock footage, we will see to fruition the greatest change in the way we are able to transfer value since the first physical coin was struck. If the media would report, clearly, the potentials of this technology, and seek to understand them themselves we would get to experience a more trustworthy, less corruptible, cheaper, and convenient means of transferring money a whole lot quicker. If instead we continue to beat up on it, the banksters will have time to create a centralized version of the same damn thing so that they can maintain the control and continue to charge fees on services that could be free, or near free, deflate the value by creating more as they seem fit and basically remove every other feature that makes this technology so awesome.

sure, but to me it works like natural selection. The more that we can solve the problems that many people currently feel the government (tries to) solves, it wont need to come as an agenda, or a political affiliation, it will just be done that way because it makes the most sense and there is no need for intervention. Political parties on the other hand generally can point out what is wrong with the way things are done, but rarely are able to offer a way that doesn't have plenty of its own issues. So while it aligns with the views/dreams of libertarians it doesn't need to sell itself as a political thing, because it just makes more sense than the current options.
Nobody WANTS a nanny state, there are people that believe things would be better off now without it and there are people that think it is better than the alternative. If we could actually prevent crimes, or other issues with technology the laws pertaining to it will go away because they will never need to be enforced, or they will be unenforceable.

From what I've been told, the CC merchants can dictate that you don't upcharge, or require minimums, in their service agreement, but they can't dictate how you charge for things with cash. So while the end result is the same its the difference of being in breach of contract or not. That's how I understand it. In my business I don't charge more/less for different payment methods and basically everyone ends up paying for the 'swipers' CC usage.

You can calculate the gain on parts of the BTC. If you have 1000s of bitcoin I highly suggest hiring a tax attorney or a CPA as you can easily afford it and they will help a lot. My account is one of the more expensive in my city and he does taxes for my business, a lot of other random income and my income from my job and it's like $900. I would guess you could find a professional to help for that or less. Remember though if you have 1000s in bitcoin you only need to claim what you've cashed out or spent, you don't need to claim gains on the BTC until you've exchanged it.

But before the FDIC usd was a ponzi scheme? What if there is a massive run on the banks and everyone wants cash? Would it really matter that the FDIC insured your paper money for 100,000 when they pay everyone by printing copious amounts of it and it hyperinflates overnight? Is it any less/more of a scam since we left the silver/gold standard? It's the same fucking thing. The majority of usd are intangible numbers in computers in banking software. The software is, however, out of date and based on antiquated systems. The software is also controlled by people who have proven they no longer have your best interests in mind, but they are your only option. Bitcoin on the other hand is a newer technology that works more smoothly and requires you to trust no one but yourself, however, you are welcome to trust other people as well. If you choose to trust others it can blow up in your face and end up losing you money the same way that trusting corrupt banks has.

No, because the inner workings of something align with the beliefs in a certain political agenda, it doesn't mean that that technology is political. Do you think the internet and the ability to transfer information from one pleace to another with no human 'middle man' was a politcal movement, or just good technology?
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:13:10
No, they weren't "realized" if you still own the BTC. If you spent BTC for goods services in 2013 then you need to pay taxes on it. Gains are not realized until you "cash out." If you spent less than a thousand bucks over the course of the year I would personally not be overly concerned with it as the likely hood of a 'small fish' getting audited is slim and even if you were audited and they discovered this, the taxes/penalties would be slim. Again, that is what I would do and I am not a CPA this is not tax advice. If you spent more, or would like to do everything on the "up and up" I highly highly suggest hiring a CPA, especially if you've had large gains and made many transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:17:00
Yet you failed to provide any actual explanation, or examples. I forgot that bitcoin has many people behind it that still believe some libertarian utopia can exist and are able to ignore peoples inherent selfishness.

Too late for what? To pay taxes? Yes you won't have to claim the gains until your 2014 return. I am not a tax attorney, please speak with a professional.

Taking a picture of a barcode is clunky as hell. I'd much rather use NFC or wireless communication of some form.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:10:29
No more expensive than exchanging to fiat and buying things. You have to pay taxes when you use the BTC one way or another, but if your paying taxes it means the BTC made you money you wouldn't have had otherwise. If you buy $100 worth of BTC and spend it while it is worth the same thing you don't owe any capital gains because no gains were realized.
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:25:30
The consumer pays the fees regardless. They are built into overstocks and everyone else's prices. Without a discount of some type you are still paying the fees with BTC. Right now you are also paying fees to get into BTC, the hope is that BTC will have an economy that you will earn, or have goods purchased with BTC and you won't have to use exchange services like coinbase, but I would guess that is many years in the future for the average consumer.

Amazon accepting it won't do jack. It needs to be paid to people for goods and services. Until people have it and are looking to spend it it won't matter if Walmart target and best buy and Amazon accept it. If it is to become a general use currency (I think this is many years away and will most likely act as a backbone in transactions IMO) it would have to be how people receive payroll etc... I don't see that happening on a grand scale. I see it working akin to debit and credit networks to transact national currencies before it would be used as is. But what the fuck do I know, I just believe that this is amazing tech that I am excited to see out to better use than buying shit on Amazon.

I don't think it's going to replace the current system. I do think it has potential to positively change it. I also think it has some shortcomings. I do think there are plenty of idiots that shout moon anytime it gains a few points even on the back of losing many fold what the gain was. I don't know how you define 'change the world' but I'd say the fact that this is a discussion means it has. Even if Bitcoin is never widely used, it has let a cat or two out of the bag so to speak.    
I'd love to hear why you'd prefer to use PayPal moving forward. I'd also like to point out that your certainty in your "sinking ship" statement makes you look like as big of a tool as the people that know that Bitcoin is going to be used for the majority of the worlds settlements.

Not if you are looking to make a couple of extra bucks. A buy of bitcoin is like putting the same amount of money in a slot machine. If you don't mind losing the money fine, but don't do it with the expectation of making money. Nothing is a 'sure thing' and this is a very risky way to try to 'make a couple of extra bucks'. If you are interested in the technology and think it could be a fun bumpy ride and wouldn't be overly upset if you lost your money then by all means, come join us!

Could you have your friend pm me. I'm trying to work out the best way to do this. I'd love to use coin base but don't really want my employees logged in to my account, but I need them to be able to figure out the exchange rate and also verify purchases. 
I currently use square register on an iPad so something on iOS would be amazing and I know coin base has been yanked from there.

I'll be a little more helpful, but you should REALLY use the search.
Asking if it is a good time to invest tells me right away that it is not a good time to invest *for you.* Do some homework. This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. This is NOT a 'sure thing' and no one, as much as people will pretend here, can predict the future. If you would like to buy some coin you can, but if you are looking at it as an investment you should try to look at it more like legal online gambling. This is uncharted space. There is a very high chance that you will lose money. Do not 'bet' more than you can afford to lose.
Also, you can buy partial bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-10 03:41:04
There isn't savings in that. It's a ripoff until it is widely adopted. At 2.75% through square, you won't hit $30 until you process &gt; $1000. For you to process $1000 USD in ONLY bitcoin assuming 1% usage you'd have to be doing $100000 in sales per month to break even with CC processing. On top of that if you are doing $1.2M in sales you are getting better rates than square. I'm not saying processing BTC is bad, I am saying bitpays new $30 flat is extremely high until BTC is more widely adopted. I suggest coinbase hands down.
Edit: I didn't see this was an option and you can do 1% still. I thought it was the only way bitpays operated I'm glad to see it's not, though I doubt it will be cost effective for the majority of businesses and think the 1% will be better.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:57:08
I agree and I am in no way as confident in bitcoin as an 'investment' as so many people here seem to be. I did buy some that I am holding on to, but for me its like a trip to Vegas except instead of a slot machine and some super rich casino owners I am putting my money behind a technology I find highly interesting and intriguing.
Besides that little bit, I am considering accepting it as a form of payment at my retail establishment, but I think it is clunky at the moment and people are doing it for the sake of doing it. If it becomes as easy to accept as a credit card or cash (including decent reporting) and it saves me 1-2% I won't even have to think twice. Right now the extra legwork to report the income and securely accept it isn't worth the 1-2%. I would be a lot more interested in paying my distributors with bitcoin and think it would currently be more beneficial for large national/international purchases like that.
The ride is certainly a lot of fun and I have learned quite a bit, but the number of people who seem to 'know' this is a 'sure deal' floor me.
