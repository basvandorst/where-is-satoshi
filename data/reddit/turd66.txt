the lawnmower.io userbase?
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:10:29
cool article, well done. what about buying over time vs at one time (and thus price/amt)?

I buy bitcoin regularly using the Lawnmower app (
Trying to speculate by timing the market on short term price movement is a fools game.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:12:43
LOL ^ :)
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:58:25
more understanding is always better, but yes - like in most things the broad majority probably just need a decent general grasp while the experts handle the details and make it as easy to use for the masses as possible
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:15:19
can you explain the fees the traders generate a bit more? what kind of trades are they executing?
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:55:28
wow... great news for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:39:16
cool thanks. do you think deposit growth for your savings accounts will follow deposit growth onto your trading platform, or is this needed to keep your deposit interest rates pretty constant (i know they're variable so you can adjust)?

relevant - lawnmower.io

Been using it for a few weeks, automatically purchases via a Coinbase every couple of days. I trust Coinbase for holding the coins, plus its really not too many to worry about given it's just spare change and they only watch your bank statement similarly to Mint.

is this surprising to anyone? the easiest way for her to expand quickly is to just buy companies/tech/talent like this. the industry is still tiny and these deals are relatively super cheap.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:31:36
have you ever tried to advertise something bitcoiny in a non-bitcoin sub lol
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:15:25
Coinbase's Vault is probably one of the safest (centralized) places you could keep your bitcoins. If you trust yourself to handle the safety and privacy of your private key more than Coinbase + the tech/restrictions they put on the Vault, then you might want to look into a safer (not centralized - just you) way to hold/store your bitcoin (like using another wallet/app like Mycelium, paper wallet, your own other private key storage option).
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:42:54
but the market cap is still extremely low right now. if huge bitcoin adoption occurred, we might think the price would skyrocket - dunno if a moon flight path is stable :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:23:59
So awesome, love everything about ShapeShift!
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:48:39
cool, hadn't seen these. think bitpay's done the most mainstream-targeted marketing?
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:59:49
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:30:59
do you loan out deposits to make money like a traditional bank?
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:48:21
everything? isnt that kind of a pain day to day for purchasing various items?
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:54:15
DCA into all 3
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:01:23
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:59:13
they're still trying to figure it out :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:08:10
holy shit 93 cents of arbitrage!
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:06:03
haha no way, here i was thinkibg 100% was beyond hardcore
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:11:32
good point, something like btcjam or bitlendingclub?
@_date: 2015-06-27 06:38:00
hopefully quicker adoption...

Hi Jesse,
Do you plan on expanding out your crypto offerings? If so, to what coins/assets &amp; when?
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:05:18
while browsing their blog
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:44:10
i just do both
i have a bunch of bitcoin i've previously purchased &amp; plan on saving, but i spend bitcoin whenever i can and replenish occasionally (mostly now just using the lawnmower app) 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:41:39
damn, hadn't seen this, wow - extremely clean!
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:12:12
this is great!
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:42:34
love shapeshift &amp; the design :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:09:50
fave new bitcoin projects/startups?
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:01:04
true - any sense to how many addresses folks usually keep larger amounts in? how about the % held by exchanges in one address for many people? or what's your estimate for # of people holding say $10 or $100 of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-14 16:49:14
futureeee! iot + blockchain will be cray
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:56:50
awesome! amazing right in messages
@_date: 2016-09-14 13:23:51
so probably like a few million people have access to a noteworthy amount of btc, with a decent amount held by exchanges &amp; early miners, and a bunch of smaller addresses created in bulk programatically
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:50:42
tramp stamp public key (QR form)!
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:55:05


@_date: 2015-04-06 21:21:55
Agreed on both, really digging Lawnmower.io
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:53:20
these are all pretty good:
1) coinbase.com or circle.com
2) breadwallet.com or electrum.org
3) shapeshift.io
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:57:35
check out bitquick.co as well
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:17:37
uhh... just buy another $50 the second day. The $100 is in aggregate.
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:07:01
I got the beta a few weeks ago, it's been great to see myself adding to my total bitcoin holdings as the price has been falling as I probably should be. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:01:51
There's data on BTC/USD prices for years back at this point, at least on a daily time frame, and obviously the data for the Dow and gold. If you're looking for a nice correlation on any sort of time scale between any of them good luck. Might as well look at correlations (and inverses) with different currencies, interest rates, indexes, etc. and drive yourself crazy :)
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:14:18
Digit bores me b/c its kinda just a bank account. Acorns &amp; Lawnmower are super sexy apps tho and i have also made $ with both
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:45:37
just link a back up credit card on coinbase for instant buys
