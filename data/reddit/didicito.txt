I have tried shutting down the iPod and turning it back on. In fact, that is what I used to do when it got too slow, and it worked. But not this time.
Device is an iPod touch 4G.
iOS version is 6.1.6 (itunes doesn't allow upgrades beyond that on this device).
Blockchain app version is 2.0.5 (itunes doesn't allow upgrades beyond that on this iOS version.
And yes, the device is jailbroken, that's how I got the .plist file.
I think I'll try to get a similar jailbroken device so I can copy the preferences files and see if it picks it up.
Thanks a lot for your help! I'll consider a reward if I get my btc back.

I think it is REALLY worth the trouble to get some permanent legal and financial advice to do such a thing in a country that doesn't have a escrow service yet.
Also, I think it adds a huge responsibility because with an escrow you'll be part of the image of the Bitcoin project in your country.
But as a business, you'll always win BTC and fiat even when Bitcoin goes down. SPECIALLY when Bitcoin goes down.

I'm a Bitcoin supporter and I think I'm a bit of an equalitarian. I don't think inequality itself is a problem (it simply means different qualities). I just this there's a tipping point at which nobody deserves more wealth exactly as there is bottom point at which nobody deserves less wealth.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:31:54
I see, well that is indeed a point to be taken.
But then we need to consider that financial activity is moving towards digitalized systems more than physical money. So if you would be given to choose between a public or a private ledger digital system, what would you choose?
I think the public ledger of Bitcoin is totally coherent with OpenSource principles. And enables a HUGE amount of transparency considering how little individual privacy is compromised.
Also, a fully anonymous and transparent system might be impossible by definition. I consider transparency FAR more important than privacy. I think the root of all evil in human history comes from the lack of transparency.

So, considering this would be a BTC site, I guess there is a little bit of margin for legal interpretation if BTC is gambling or not. Right? I mean, is it always considered gambling even if I'm not using legal tender directly or inderectly?

Ok, I haven't tried it myself, but you can mine using your cpu with this software: 
I guess it should have options to mine "solo" or to join a mining pool.
If you mine solo, you will be trying to find the sollution hash by yourself (which is mind blowingly unlinkely to happen).
If you mine in a pool you will provide your hashing power to the pool, which will reward you with an amount of BTC according to their own particular rules.

I think the most important part of Bitcoin is taking responsability in your own hands. Actually OWNING and having as much control as possible of your money. That should be the focus of any Bitcoin related ad.

"That leaves me with a bitcoin address and a key, that was generated completely offline. Right?"
Well, depends on what you understand by "completely". There is the possibility that you have some keylogger or malware process running. If you want a better method try running the code of the page from a live-cd without that OS ever being online.
"My question is how when I go to import my wallet into a place like blockchain.org, how is it even aware that the bitcoin address that was created offline even exists?"
As somebody said, all wallets already exist. You are just "discovering" the private key that corresponds to that public key.
"My other question is how does the offline program attach my passphrase secret key to that wallet?"
It uses an algorithm which is available in the page source code for you to go through or have somebody explain it to you if you please.
"My last question, for now, is how does the offline bitcoin generating program not generate the same bitcoin address for two different users if its offline?"
Brainwallets with the same encoding method "creates" the very same public/private key.
"Random" wallet generator might duplicate wallets, it is possible, but rather unlikely.

I'm not familiar with bit-card, but in order to create a secure paper wallet I think the best way is to:
1. Get a live-usb Ubuntu (or any Linux distro)
2. Download the bitaddress source code from their GitHub repository and store it in dvd, cd or secure pendrive
3. Boot the Ubuntu in a not internet connected pc or laptop
4. Generate as many private-public key pairs as needed
5. Hand-write, or store in a des3 or AES, or print
Many of this steps involves some risk, but I think it is a good compromise between security and convenience.

1. Not 100% sure how actual "partial" transactions work, but most wallets will handle the inner workings of it internally without you having to worry about it, and spending whatever fraction you want form the balance you actually have.
2. You can create raw transactions and broadcast them to the network, without any software wallet. Obviously you have to understand deeply how private keys, public keys, and signatures work.

It is impossible not to feel a little bit Columbus or Neil Armstrong for being part of this.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:36:09
I like to think of it more as America (the whole continent)  before Europeans.
In fact, I see the whole digital world as America before Columbus, and Bitcoin as the discovery of precious metals in the natives.
Of course, it will end the same way. All early adopters killed, raped and pillaged.

You should have as much precation as possible always. Not with this particular file, but with whatever you download from internet.
I didn't understand the question about superior system. You should be aware that mining forces your hardware to compute a lot, which might increase heat, electrical usage and might reduce lifetime of your hardware, as any heavy processing power practice.

But your analysis talks about the market price. Bitcoin is already a success. Even if the market price gets back to 1u$s. It is still the best mean to transfer value in way too many aspects.
I think you should be more specific on what aspect of Bitcoin you are saying that will fail, and then specify wtf you mean by fail.
Talking about Bitcoin price and pretend that you are talking about Bitcoin is clear sign that you are still missing the whole point.

Zizek says there are things we don't know we know. That would be ideology, and it's pretty relevant concept for Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:40:27
Wait, I have never seen the term. "Satoshis per byte". But it makes perfect sense.
So, isn't the transaction size in bytes kinda not under users choice?
AFAIK, 100BTC in a single address needs "less bytes" to spend than 4 addresses with 25BTC each.
So, isn't the "satoshis per byte" variation affecting Bitcoin's fungibility? If that's the case, the single-address 100BTC is worth more than 4 addresses with 25BTC each, since they don't pay the same fee to be spent.

Nice post.
Got me thinking, is it possible to have every product at a grocery store with it's own unique public key? So vendor can track exactly which product was paid for by whom.
Would that be practical? This will SOOOO happen eventually.

Both competition and consensus need to exist. I think we need a lot more consensus on Bitcoin value before spreading the competition. imho

Yes, it would deflate the currency/commodity even more, but the market would do that after some time, gradually and subtly across all transactions.
Just like it would happen with any other currency/commodity.
