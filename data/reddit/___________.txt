If I said to you the proportion of *mail servers* would decline relative to the proportion of email users as email was popularly adopted, you'd tell me this was an obvious thing to deduce.
If I said to you Satoshi predicted the proportion of Bitcoin full nodes would decline relative to the proportion of thin clients as Bitcoin was popularly adopted, you'd hopefully tell me the same.
The price elasticity of demand for running a full node drops off a cliff when the cost rises above a miniscule number, i.e. if it's harder than visiting Reddit.com, most people aren't going to even bother. They will instead visit Reddit.com and complain to others about blockchain bloat, and pretend that's really the reason for the decline in full nodes when that is clearly untrue.
Take BitTorrent. Here is an extremely successful decentralized sharing protocol where public share ratios incentivize altruistic seeding, which is partly comparable to the Bitcoin full node model. Yet people still game the BT share ratio system, because it's hard to seed files. It takes more effort than visiting Reddit.com and people generally loathe doing anything that costs them time and money. They just want their files. In Bitcoin, people just want their wallet to work. Nobody but the most die hard supporters of Bitcoin will ever care about running a full node.
Most people just want to leech. They're practically ADHD when it comes to software, and they aren't interested in running anything that doesn't give them everything they ask for instantly and for free.
Bitcoin full nodes don't constitute such a software, which is why the numbers are declining.
You could remove blockchain bloat altogether and get the same outcome. The number of full nodes is *going* to dwindle relative to the number of thin clients. It's absolutely unavoidable. Do you think an African tribesman, a Chinese peasant worker or a rural Indian farmer will ever care about running a full node if it ever comes to that? If Bitcoin is successful, billions of people will run thin clients while a tiny minority run full nodes and an even tinier minority run mining farms. Just please stop scapegoating blockchain bloat as being a major reason for this happening. Even if there is no "bloat" whatsoever, the outcome is the same.

Privacy systems are only as strong as they are adopted. The smaller the anonymity set, the worse is the anonymity.
If you want an audit trail, you need to be keeping receipts, and comparing your wallet history to your purchase history, and to the history of centralized website deposit and withdrawals. This is the way it works now, and honestly, ring signatures which is what I had in mind by network wide mixing, wouldn't make this meaningfully harder.
CoinJoin doesn't seem resistant to sybil attacks even if it's deployed universally.
Multisig escrow has direct costs: additional BTC fees must be paid, and BTC must be parked in the multisig address for at least one confirmation. Compared to ring signatures, with multisig escrow you also need to cooperate with a third party to decide under what conditions the BTC can be withdrawn. It should be obvious why this cannot be enforced network wide.

Efficiencies of scale mean CPU hard coins inevitably result in mining centralization, as do GPU hard coins. You end up with CPUs or GPUs in mining farms instead of ASICs.
No amount of code trickery can get around efficiencies of scale. It will always be more efficient for entities to scale up specialized investments. Proof of work mining centralization is fundamentally inevitable for this reason.
And I've read the Ethereum whitepapers and wiki, completely. My conclusion is they are creating an entirely new programming language from scratch built on experimental compilers and VMs. That these are poorly documented, poorly maintained languages with numerous bugs lurking. These languages are being designed by people with little to no experience in language design, and this alone is going to be the engineering challenge of a lifetime for them.
On top of that they have to cultivate a brand new blockchain which is going to be vulnerable not just to mining centralization and 51% attacks, but to untrusted code execution.

That says nothing about a person's political leanings. Heard of Freicoin? Who would've guessed that Freicoin, which levies annual *taxes* on its own userbase could have problems with adoption /s. In a free market, the only working approach is clearly disinflationary. There is no other viable option.
Also, wouldn't you agree efficiencies of scale all but guarantee proof of work unavoidably leads to the building of giant centralized mining farms?
Do you believe your grandma, Joe Bob from Kentucky, a Chinese farmer, an Indian migrant worker or an African tribesmen will ever run a Bitcoin full node? In the best scenario for Bitcoin adoption **billions** of people will run thin clients while a tiny minority run full nodes, and an even tinier minority run mining farms. That is the future of Bitcoin if it is successful.
Many have theorized Satoshi was a physicist or had a scientific background. We can probably count the number of anarchist physicists in the entire world on one hand. And yet you think a physicist, or a scientist, who launches the beginnings of the world's first global cashless society has to be an *anarchist*? Of all things, why that? Lots of people hate banks and bankers, from *all* spectrums of political leanings. There is nothing inherently anarchist to hating bailouts.
I'm sorry, but my opinion is drastically different. Bitcoin is not the work of an anarchist, it is the work of a plutocrat.

99% of Windows and Mac users have no intention of ever running software that doesn't instantly start up. Bitcoin full nodes are simply out of the question.
Do you ever see rural Indian farmers, Chinese migrant workers, African tribesman, or your own grandma running a full node? If Bitcoin is to succeed, **billions** of people will run thin clients while a tiny minority run full nodes.
No matter how little the blockchain is "bloated", the dynamics of blockchain tech adoption are such that only a minority of dedicated entities will seed a copy of the full Bitcoin blockchain. Even if most people *can* run a full node, PCs will never have the uptime and availability of dedicated servers expressly maintained for the purpose of running a full node.
As Bitcoin adoption increases, the proportion of full nodes will decline sharply. This is absolutely unavoidable.
No, 80 bytes of OP_RETURN is NOT going to be the straw that breaks the camels back. Come on. The truth is, the only real controversy surrounding Turing Complete Bitcoin blocks (TCB) is, since the core Bitcoin protocol doesn't support the feature, the unit of account inside those blocks **cannot be BTC**. To be blunt, this pisses off large Bitcoin holders, who tend to be offended by dumbed down techobabble and who also tend to be incredibly mouthy and defensive when it comes to their baby. But come on, don't pretend like "blockchain bloat" is the reason you're against systems that use OP_RETURN.

Good concept, but one that isn't at all resistant against sybil attacks, i.e. you and ten government agents mix your coins. They can automatically track which coins are yours by process of elimination.
You could always require a security deposit for CoinJoin makers, but a well funded adversary could easily game that system.

This article points out two things:
1. Counterparty's relationship with Overstock.com has ended with the Counterparty team leaving to create their own [company](
2. Counterparty ported the pyethereum VM to the Bitcoin blockchain which enables Ethereum contracts to be executed on an additional platform target. We can agree to disagree on the importance of this aspect.
I remain ambivalent about the prospects of Turing Complete™, and consider it akin to "anonymous" coin buzz.

No. Your *invalid* Counterparty broadcast would get mined by the full power of the Bitcoin blockchain. Then, the consensus rules of Counterparty would summarily reject it. Conversely, *valid* Counterparty broadcasts, would be successfully parsed by all Counterparty nodes.
It's akin to creating a P2P sportsbook where we decide the betting rules in advance. In this case, we all agree that an OP_RETURN output with `CNTRPRTY` prepended to a specially encoded payload signifies a bet, order, send or broadcast and is executed as such.
Then it's just a matter of initializing balances. For that we use proof of burn, which creates an initial allotment of neutral tokens which can then become stocks and assets, or do nothing and just be used for betting and sending around.
Nodes come online by first scanning the Bitcoin blockchain: nodes parse the chain to January 2014, where they are programmed to initialize XCP balances based on the protocol's defined burn rate. It then tracks sends, betting activity and so forth to make state transitions through time, consistently in accordance with the protocol. Invalidly formatted payloads aren't considered.
The only *threat* to Counterparty consensus is a team of people forking the reference implementation in their favor and attempting to sway the end users of the protocol to move to the new rogue rulebook. Changing the rules of Counterparty is about as likely to pass muster as a rogue group forking Bitcoin Core and increasing the supply cap from 21,000,000 to 42,000,000. You might as well just create Liteparty at that point. Why would any end user of Counterparty go with the fork that destroys the fundamental properties of the network.
These properties, of P2P sportsbook rules allow for a distributed API to be created for our betting matches, which allows industry leaders to pick up the activity. And because our bets are secured by the full hashing power of the Bitcoin blockchain, you bet your ass they're going to be there in ten years. As with Bitcoin, Counterparty's consensus is as principled as its community. After all, it's theoretically possible to increase the supply cap of Bitcoin to 42 mil, it's just that it'll never ever happen, for socioeconomic reasons.

Thank you for pointing this out. Satoshi predicted this would happen in several places.
To think thin clients are "killing" Bitcoin is laughable.
The truth is the price elasticity of demand curve for running a full node nose dives when the cost rises above a miniscule figure, i.e. if it's harder than visiting Reddit.com, most people aren't going to bother.
This is just the cold hard truth. You could make a full node perfectly simple and even relatively inexpensive, but if it's more expensive than a visit to Reddit.com, most people just aren't going to bother. That's just our ADHD society.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:59:02


This statement is false. Counterparty parses OP_RETURN for specially encoded data payloads, it doesn't care about BTC inputs and outputs. So long as the Bitcoin blockchain isn't 51% attacked, and blockchain reorgs are avoided, no problems whatsoever. Mixing by default is a good idea.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:47:04
I agree, it's good you don't need a server farm to run a single full node. Practically speaking, however, 99% of Windows and Mac users will never want to use a piece of software that doesn't instantly turn on. Downloading Photoshop or Steam games is one thing, and is hard enough. If the blockchain grew to be over 1TB, that could be seen as too ridiculous for the average person to handle, hence the innovation around thin clients.
The stated outcome seems impossible to avoid, but for social *not* technical reasons. Again, 99% of the world has zero interest in running the equivalent of a M1 Abrams tank on their PC. It will simply never happen.
Fundamentally speaking it is inevitable for the proportion of full nodes to dwindle, significantly so, as Bitcoin sees greater adoption.
The relationship between Bitcoin adoption and proportion of people with any semblance of a technical understanding of the network is steeply inverse in the same way. This is why the technically gifted members of the Bitcoin community need their feet held to the proverbial fire, and not treated like Gods. Especially Satoshi.
Note I am NOT saying Satoshi wasn't a genius. Just that he may have been a genius who **wasn't an ancap**. The Bitcoin network works just as well if ISPs run most of the full nodes, with dubious effects on liberty, and yes, I think Satoshi clearly recognized this, realized it was an inevitable result of the dynamics of adoption and simply didn't care.

Governments will have seized plenty of BTC to bankroll sybil attacks, plus an unlimited fiat budget.
If the adversary is willing to mix for 0% fees, it could undercut the whole market.
I'm all for more privacy, but I think it has to be accomplished with ring signatures or some other automatic network wide solution to be effective against sybil.

If it's harder to run a full node than to visit Reddit.com, most people just won't bother running a full node. The only way to change this is to incentivize full node ownership either with money or respect, and both have very little hope of working.
As Bitcoin is popularly adopted, the proportion of full nodes will decline sharply relative to the userbase. It's absolutely unavoidable and Satoshi publicly predicted it would happen this way on two occasions.

That's not all there is to it in the slightest. It used to be the case that very few people treated thin clients like Electrum and Multibit very seriously at all. Bread Wallet didn't exist. I'm not sure about Mycelium. We now have hardware wallets too, another item that previously didn't exist and they certainly seem to be pushing for thin client support, *because it makes sense* as opposed to forcing people into running full nodes.
Blockchain bloat? That has got to be the last thing on a person's mind when choosing a wallet these days.
Thin clients are growing in adoption whilst full nodes are looking worse and worse for the average person, because they are worse. The user interface of Bitcoin QT and Armory both are horribly obtuse. Most people just aren't willing to wade through downloading the blockchain and navigating interfaces that were obviously designed by a programmer. Adoption of thin clients at the expense of full nodes then, is absolutely predictable. And I'd be shocked if it has *anything* at all to do with blockchain bloat, as that issue pales in comparison to the effects of consumer education and thin client innovation.

I can see why proof of burn would be more resource intensive with mixing enabled by default, but with OP_RETURN support, the blockchain parser could backtrack until it identified a specially encoded OP_RETURN.
Increasing the anonymity set would be very valuable for Bitcoin privacy. It would also simplify accounting if we could treat Bitcoin cold storage withdrawals the same as withdrawing cash from a bank account, which is really much more logical. If you want tracking, use a centralized service.
