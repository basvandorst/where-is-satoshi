I live in the US. I'll use Coinbase because it's another place I've purchased from in the past and never had any issues with. 
I started using Celery when I first heard about them because I liked the idea of supporting a newer company when they first started, hoped to increase competition in the cryptocurrency marketplace, etc. But I never had any bad experiences with Coinbase, so it looks like I'll be headed back there.

That's how mine started out as well.

Awesome! Glad to hear that it worked out.

Yeah, it is weird. From what I’ve read of their replies it sounds like there were an isolated batch of orders where they, for some unknown reason, weren’t able to purchase the coin for at the right price. I’m assuming that issue was cleared up by the time your ordered.

I used my bank account for this and all of the purchases I've made from them. My payment went through without any issues on my side. 
I didn't use an exchange because I don't have an account on any of the exchanges. I don't actively trade so when I buy some I would go to Celery, or now to CoinBase I guess.

Huh, I'll have to look that up over on Not sure what exactly their motivations were or what would cause a situation where they were completely unable to spare the 0.1942 BTC  to complete my order, even if it did come at their expense. I've had enough possitive experiences with them that I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it does seem suspicious to me.

No response since I posted this, other than the guy in the comments who apparently works for them I guess. But he didn't address anything to me directly, so no real response. 
They clearly consider the matter finished and I'm just waiting to get the refund I've requested since I didn't have any other options.

I'm in if there's room.
