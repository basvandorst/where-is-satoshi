Great job. Totally agree. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:21:49
Noob here. Can you explain what this means?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:19:09
Same. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:25:40

$7 on eBay. "Gold plated" hahahah
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:14:32
And i just have to have my BTC in a wallet correct? Or what is the procedure for getting them?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:13:55
I agree completely. 
I got in around 4500 and I'm definitely not selling. I am pumped that it's getting so low right when I get a big paycheck so I can buy in low. Helped to read Reddit for weeks to realize that holding is the best option for me.

What does "all in" even mean?

So strange indeed.

His legs are way too long. Even other pictures of him on the site. Wtf
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:50:51
3 days here too. Takes that long to learn it all and buy hahah
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:20:32
Alright I'm convinced. Just bought again. Hahah
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:41:38
Oh damn. Yeah skipping that shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:39:49
Both. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:42:47
Haha. Split what you want to spend. Take one half for an instant buy and the rest for weekly smaller purchases. Dollar cost averaging.

Does the Blockchain wallet suffice?
