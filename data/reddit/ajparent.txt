I wonder how/if this gets reported to the IRS as it does with cash?
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:08:57
I guess that makes sense. I applaud the original poster for accepting bitcoin for their car. I hope more people are willing to sell for crypto in the future. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:33:42
I’d be more worried as the buyer of the vehicle. I’ve long been wondering about making big purchases with crypto. What’s to stop the guy from saying he didn’t get paid? If someone has an answer to that, I’d like to hear it
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:11:17
Depends on size of purchase. Not many people are buying lambos with bags of cash.  They are with bitcoin though!

The reason, 20-1 bet is out there, is because the bookie will use your bet money as working capital and pay you your 5% in 2019 with out thinking twice...  that’s a pretty cheap loan for them...
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:14:42
No, in that particular bet, you have to bet $21 for every $1 you want to win.  I’m referring to the bet where bitcoin goes under $1 at some point in 2018

It’s just another step in adoption by the average person.  
@_date: 2019-11-01 04:07:23
You can’t just add to the market cap... market cap is not the same as amount of money invested... $10 billion would surge the price significantly more than that.

At 3k, I’ll buy up another 7 btc, so I’d welcome it
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:07:33
Bought more just a couple days ago. With the stability we are seeing. It’s giving promise to a nice bull run.

It happens... I had to stop myself from playing online as to not piss back all my profits. I have a tendency of chasing losses. Sometimes it works, sometimes you bust.
You should buy some bitcoin, and set it aside for the future..

Dollar cost average if you can
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:33:06
The same people who are depressed when it goes up and they didn’t buy, are the ones who wouldn’t buy when the price was 3200 because”it’s gonna drop lower”. Just buy it already and enjoy the ride. I think most people agree that if bitcoin doesn’t crash to near zero, it’s probably going to rise to an astronomical number.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:32:41
Coinbase is by far the easiest. And then for at least the next couple months, you can use binance to pick up some altcoins. You alternatively can use a vpn to mask your location...
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:51:16
It makes sense that he can recommend you purchase. Your purchase could cost his firm a lot of money in litigation if the investment goes sour. His securities license doesn’t cover crypto... yet.

Good luck with this... outside of coding, you need to have been an early adopter, or have some very wealthy backers...

It is literally my job to know “why” people invest for retirement...
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:48:01
I still find it laughable that people think bitcoin is to buy drugs.... Idiots... lol
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:37:44
That is exactly what I think.... how is that difficult to comprehend?  It opens the investment up to a whole new set of people who don’t have the ability, or know how.  Do you know how many people have nearly all their liquid investments within retirement accounts that can’t currently invest in crypto...
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:27:32
I make my employer a crap ton of money... so feel sorry all you want... 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:33:50
You are claiming people wouldn’t buy a btc etf.... that is just patently false, for the reasons I’ve given above. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:44:17
What are you talking about?  
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:28:44
Nothing is stopping you from updating the tech as it advances. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 17:42:03
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:26:31
Honestly, create a paper wallet and store the private key on a usb drive. Stick in an envelope with the child’s name on it and instructions inside Incase something happens to you. Leave in your safe deposit box for safe keeping. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:37:35
Lol. No... trump’s tax change was for 2018... you could never assume like for like with crypto... that being said, taxing crypto is ridiculous..
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:32:08
Um no.... I don’t invest in crypto for either my employer or my clients.  It’s not allowed in my industry. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:04:04
Just remember... only 21 million people can possibly ever have 1 bitcoin... it’s far more likely having 1 nyc will put you in the top 1-2 million of holders. I’m sure someon can search how many people currently have 1 btc in a wallet somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:08:58
Do you honestly think people won’t buy a btc etf?  Lol
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:22:00
Several reasons. 
Ease of purchase
They can buy it in their IRA
They can buy it in their brokerage accounts
Financial advisors can now recommend it as part of a diversification strategy 
They don’t have to risk getting scammed
The list goes on 
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:27:26
Tron will eventually be a contender
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:19:56
Does local bitcoin operate there?
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:55:52
This doesn’t sound like a bitcoin scam. It just sounds like blatant fraud. According to the article, no bitcoin or any crypto was actually purchased. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:06:19
Less bitcoins hitting the market every day... only one thing that means...
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:17:53
Pump and dump schemes are better targeted towards smaller crypto projects. It’s unlikely that this is what we are seeing. Whether it’s the start of a bull run is another question. One to which I have no clue. Could be capitulation. Eventually there won’t be people willing to sell. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:32:08
Tell him that he can send the bitcoin to you personally to your bitcoin wallet. You will then sell them and take the cash out, and then give him the agreed upon value. He will likely say no, and you will realize he is trying to scam you. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:34:18
Yes. It means that bitcoin becomes more scarce, and price will likely rise as a result.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:00:08
Next stop 8k
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:26:50
Any alts he doesn’t own are shitcoins. Don’t listen to idiots on the internet. Do your own research.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:09:00
Haha. For sure they won’t!  Back it up and keep your info safe. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:43:47
Literally wrong on every account for myself.  
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:00:16
Even if it’s a few years from now... I’m not worried. I really enjoy watching the tech flourish. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:18:30
Your wife’s gold bracelets are not being used as a store of value though :)
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:41:12
I get the same from my family. Thy are always asking about bitcoin “crashing”. I usually just respond that it’s a long term investment and this market cycle has happened 5 times in 10 years and is not surprising. Don’t worry, next massive bull run, they will all be asking about how much money you are making and how to get in
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:55:57
It doesn’t actually need to...
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:36:43
Take the same $1000 invested into the bracelet and invest it into bitcoin in 2009, and let me know what’s worth more...

Now try to sell it for it’s appraised value. Lol. 
Not to mention after you took it out of the store, it was probably only worth a few hundred dollars. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:45:54
Exactly. Once your wife purchases that $1000 bracelet from the store, it’s probably now only worth around $150-200 if you go to sell it.
