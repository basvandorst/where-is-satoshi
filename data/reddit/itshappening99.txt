We need more new uses for Bitcoin, things that you can do with them that you couldn't easily do with normal money. To paraphrase Andreas Antonopoulos - I'm not excited about using Bitcoin to buy stuff on Amazon. I'm excited about the new things that we'll be able to do with Bitcoin that haven't been thought up yet.

Gold is suitable as a store of value partially because it can be used to make jewelry, electronics, etc. What makes Bitcoin a good store of value?

This is amazingly fucking stupid.

The change in quality here has been so dramatic that I suspect upvote bots are involved. I know some of the change is due to the bull run but the other crypto subs have not been affected to this degree, and even during the late 2017 run up it was nowhere near this cringy.

What's more, without these fees these exchanges never could have been built, and without the exchanges cryptocurrency would never have achieved the level of adoption it has so far. In the future exchanges will be more decentralized and fees will go down but we needed that centralized bridge in the beginning or we never could have gotten to the point where decentralized exchanges were viable.

I was on the fence about Bitcoin Cash until someone called it Bcash, then I became convinced how bad it is.
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:10:56
Yeah but they're calling it Bcash. That should convince you that it's bad. The other stuff doesn't matter.

Anyone involved with all this care to clarify the difference between zerocoin, zcoin, and zerocash? People in this thread are saying they aren't the same thing but they seem to be related in some way beyond just the similarity in names.

I wish people would do the BTC price cheerleading somewhere else. It comes across as greedy and gives Bitcoin a distasteful appearance.
One thing I like about the Ethereum community on Reddit is that they have a main sub for discussion about Ethereum and other ones for the stock market style discussion, which even if innocent can come off as stock market style pumping.

Another way to combat that attitude would be less of the obnoxious, greedy "to the moon" crap from our own community.

Their website has no information on who works there. It's also based out of Hong Kong.
The amount of regulatory compliance to do what they claim this wallet does is enormous. You'd expect a company that went through those hoops would be more transparent.
Also! Their promo email! Reads like a pump! and dump!
This whole thing is extremely sketchy.

How does the exchange make money? If it's through fees, what's to stop a clone from copying the code but with lower or no fees?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:34:37
The promotional email BTCC sends out has exclamation points at the end of most sentences. It feels more like a scam than a real company.

Definitely an editor shoehorned that in.

I would love to know who specifically is automatically downvoting positive comments about bitcoin. Bitcoin is obviously a threat to a lot of different organizations, but who actually put the effort in to hire people or create bots to do the vote manipulation?

What is the point of this post other than to try to pump the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-06 00:38:18
I agree when it comes to exchanging crypto, but how are you supposed to convert to fiat with a dex?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:56:14
He compares some aspects of gold with some aspects of bitcoin. It doesn't logically follow that bitcoin is supposed to be a store of value.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:12:11
It's remarkable how asinine this sub has become.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:27:30
This is snapshillbot worthy.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:39:03
This kind of petty stupid shit doesn't help whatever "side" you're on much less crypto in general.
