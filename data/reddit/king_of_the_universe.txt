He's seeing both sides, but he's *portraying* as if this is the only thing that matters - why? Because to get the people on board that actually matter (The consumers, the ones who pay.), you first need to have something to download. It's like creating a social networking site: "Ok, I'm gonna check this new thing out. ....... Man, there's only like 5 people there. I'm outta here."

Just deal with a different instrument in the meantime. There's lots to choose from. E.g. as I saw in a forex sub yesterday, the Turkish Lira (TRY) keeps falling. EUR/TRY has been rising for years straight. Ignoring the unavoidable "small" drops in between, and the patience required to smooth those structures out for sure (maybe weeks), it seems like a safe bet.
I wasn't subscribed to any forex sub so far, but that'll change. As another user said, indeed they inspire to look for pairs one would normally not think of (there are so many to choose from).

Don't you only have to pay taxes once you have actualized your winnings (= turned into fiat, sold the instrument)? I thought that's the way it was with stocks. And (if so) I'd assume that's the way with cryptos. It's not a bother of mine since all I do is CFD instead of holding actual cryptos, that's why I know nothing about it.

If long term hold is the right move, then BTC rising is the right guess. Thus, buying now would make sense. And after a strong rise, sell \*(and maybe even short on top of that). Buy again when it has fallen a wee bit. That's not gambling, that's maximizing profits.
You're welcome to point out where I'm wrong, because neither do I want to give bad advice, nor do I want to have wrong beliefs.

I don't disagree in general, but there certainly are opportunities that can rather safely be bet on. I personally bet on cryptos only in my demo account, because they seem mostly random to me (see e.g. the current moment of perfect undecidedness), so my strategy is probably out of place here. And even with stocks (e.g. Twitter  you may rather be right one should better buy an index in a dip and then keep holding.
But some instruments have an even more special identity than others. For example: The VIX and other such volatility indices (in my beginner-trader opinion) reliably oscillate. 
When it's low, and you put a lot of money into it, the only thing you can lose is time, it seems.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:14:52
I'm not a BTC buff, but I assume that it will rise to at least 10k again at some point. While that's not enough for you, you *could* consider to buy via CFD (contract for difference, margin trading) now (or soon) that it's low, later sell, thus even out your losses.
Via CFD, you only need a small fraction of the money (e.g. €630 for 1 BTC on T212), but the downside of course is that if your trading account doesn't have enough reserves (in the amount the true value of your purchase changes downwards), the position will be closed and you lose that amount. E.g. you had €1000 in your account, your purchase goes down by that amount, the account is now empty and the trade has ended.

Seems very plausible. Are you sure enough about this to short Bitcoin, though? I can't get out of the uncertainty zone. (I don't ask to get trading advice.)
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:42:04
Someone said Bitcoin falls on weekends. I was curious, so this morning I took tradingview.com screenshots Dec2017 to end of March2018 of FriSatSunMon, then I slowly scrolled over them in Photoshop and marked entry points I might take for shorting Bitcoin and also exit points. 80% winners! At least, if my goal would have been to predict whether it rises or falls (which is kind of the core of the game), that would often have worked.

One reason to think that Bitcoin will eventually rise from the grave and fly again (from the article):




Cryptos are still rather new, and a reasonable guess is they (in whatever exact form) are here to stay. The first (Or most prominent? I'm not an expert.) example is Bitcoin. That's history millionaires are likely to eventually want to have for sentimental or show-off reasons.
Isn't it inevitable that Bitcoin will eventually take off instead of permanently falling below $1000?
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:09:42
So, I assume you short Bitcoin and make a few hundreds extra each weekend?

trading212.com is where I do it. (Can't say if they're good for real money because I only lost so far, but I am rather sure that's my fault. Still, the disclaimer belongs.) Among lots of other things (forex, commodities, stocks) they have 6 cryptos, 5 of which also in a 0.1 variant (but those have larger spread). 1 BTC (Not 0.1 but the full thing.) requires you to invest €630 at the moment. Ignoring the spread, you can close the position at any time and immediately have your investment back. With whatever win/loss that occurred via price movement, of course. **You don't own it, you only bet on it.**

I didn't know this was a thing in general (which this sub-discussion makes me believe). But regarding DAX, a coworker who has been trading (stocks, incl. put/call options) for many years told me that the DAX is probably gonna dive a lot more even though it has already. Why?
Because its moving averages of 200 days and of 50 days have just crossed each other while there already was a downtrend. Supposedly, that means that the likelihood of even more considerable imminent drop is high.
It seems the same applies to other instruments, too - e.g. the Bitcoin. I didn't know this, and I don't know if it's true at all. But it seems to be a thing in many people's minds.
You can see screenshots of the possibly imminent cross in other responses to our root comment.

So ... will Bitcoin stay in the macroscopic areas it has been in since Dec 2018, or will future trading have to zoom in a lot?
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:36:33
You just have to be sure enough that a certain price will be reached again and be patient, despite the hard doubts that will come in just the "right" moment as if the will of the other traders were creeping into your brain.

Yep, I'm new, and I almost never trade Bitcoin. What gave it away?
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:16:21
Personally, I prefer forex and the main indices to Bitcoin betting, they seem more predictable to me.
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:00:35
Regarding 1&amp;2:
Well, I don't like to trade Bitcoin cause it feels to chaotic, unpredictable, so when I say I doubt I'd put my money where my screenshots are, that doesn't mean much.
But I must say: The data I used was 100% of all EXISTING data, because everything that happened before the big skyrocket before Dezember 2017, when all the world said "Bitcoin" at least once a day, was an entirely different world, so I assume it also behaves entirely differently. Yes, it's only 17 data points, but it's all data that could be surveyed.


No, I heard someone say that Bitcoin drops on the weekends, and so I checked if that's a viable strategy to bet on. If that's hindsight bias, then I don't know what's wrong about hindsight bias. I mean, I did see the screenshots in full, but it's 17 of them, the chart movements are complex, and I revealed them only bit by bit when I made the entry/exit points.


True, partly because it would have been a few paragraphs, and partly because I'm still a beginner whose take on when to enter/exit is still to a high fraction emotion, is not entirely intellectualized decision making.


Yep, I know that the actual numbers could still be bad, but priority 1 should be to have a high probability of winning the trades. All other parameters can be adjusted once that goal has been achieved. At least, that worked well for me in my paper trading.

Bitcoin is dead and alive at the same time. They should call it quantum superposition coin.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:18:41
Maybe you can help make this more clear by doing the test yourself: Here are the screenshots without spoilers in the file names and without me drawing onto them:
Just watch them one by one, revealing them pixel by pixel by moving a window over them. And try to pick your entry point for shorting when the hill seems to decline, and your exit point when the valley seems to rise again. That's what I tried to do (after first having seen all screenshots rather clearly, so I can not say how biased I was when I did what I just described).
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:37:37


I'm not saying you're wrong, but it should certainly be considered that *a lot* of what's going on in the market is fantasy, speculation, assumptions of what others will do. E.g. when Facebook just dropped a lot due to the data leak thing, I am sure that a lot of that drop was related to expectations regarding *what others will do*, so you'd go along with those expectations, sell, and rebuy once the stock is down, now you made a profit.
And in the Facebook example, that needn't mean that the company is actually worth less than before - at least not by that amount. A lot of that drop could just be mutual speculation for the sake of making a dime.
Abusing the death cross as a predictive indicator could be just the same.
Also: While the Bitcoin death cross is not a certainty, I mean, it may just be a grazing shot of the two indicators (maybe with a bit of crossover, but no real deep cross), other death crosses may be more massive, *and you can therefore see them coming with some certainty in advance, and there's your predictive power.* So I think as a beginner trader. Take it with a spoon of salt.

I have the feeling it does that almost every time. Just did a screenshot survey:
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:43:36
Depends. If you think it's very sure that it will fall below this and also rise above this a few times, why not bet on oscillation?
