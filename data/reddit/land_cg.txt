it's a problem in areas with inelastic demand, which is why he has countermeasures for those niches
US healthcare and drugs is very inflated at the moment already

I have a theory...which could be completely wrong.
These smaller bear/bull runs (like the current dip) could be partially influenced by Chinese investors. I own a few stocks on the Shenzhen stock exchange and it feels like that the Chinese are heavily affected by sentiment..even if the news is somewhat unrelated or shouldn't affect that particular stock.
When Terry Gou announced he was running for president in Taiwan, his company's (FII) stock shot up from \~15 to 20 for two days..and just as quickly, it fell down to 13.
Trump's quarrel with China and Huawei is currently putting all Chinese markets in a dip. Initially, one random tweet from Trump (before the Huawei announcement, a lot of people thought the tweet was an indication that talks with China fell through) sent all the stocks in the red. Strangely afterwards when the misunderstanding was cleared up, there was a period of a few days where the beverage stocks I own shot up \~15% over a couple of days. This was around the time bitcoin went up to 8200. Then Trump decided to ban Huawei from American markets and all Chinese stocks started dropping and bitcoin, which was struggling to stay above 8000, has now dipped a bit as well.
