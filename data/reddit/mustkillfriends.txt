Waited for almost an hour to drop it to around 13900 so I can buy at 14k. But it never got to that point.

Same thing was happening to me a week ago when I really needed to buy it. I'd suggest add your bank details because it does not need to deduct the amount.  Just signing through your bank and add your checking or savings account  Although the con for that is your payment gets processed in 3-5 business days but in the end you get to buy it at the price it was at that point of time. Hope that helps.

Same. But now it's over 16k. If it doesn't fall back to 15k I won't be able to forgive myself.

Should I wait till it goes to 14k or regret my decision of not investing while it goes past 20k by this weekend?

After seeing it dipped to less then 14k I can't buy it now at 14.5k. I know I sound crazy but I still believe it will go less then 14k before New year's.   Let's see if I'm wrong ��

Seriously even I need to know from someone who knows his shit about Bitcoin to tell me how it will fail. Because I can't see any reason now. 
Just bought $400 litecoin  I think I  bought it a bit high but I'm positive about it and thinks that it would rise again. I'm hoping for Bitcoin to drop in sometime but it's been really crazy lately.

I'm sorry if I come across stupid but lately due to work I haven't been able to follow updates in crypto world and specially Bitcoin. Could you link me to a good resource to learn about lighting network and also educate me on how  far is it before we see it being implemented for all? 
I see a lot of people have high hopes and I feel left out for not knowing what's happening :(

Go to  and enter a DC zipcode 20001 or something else. You will see all the ATMs have buy only options. NO SELL!!
