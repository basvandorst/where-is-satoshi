Thanks for the comment, I did not consider modeling energy loss through heat transfer or a decrease in hardware reliability over time. I do believe it would be valid to do so, however I would not imagine those two factors included would produce a significant source of error. The energy cost I am using is an average, meaning it is likely overestimated or underestimated depending on the mining location.

"Some random guy" sounds kinda cool :p

Hi ebliever, I personally would not purchase your "sculpture" unless it was on par with Michelangelo's David. I do believe there are many flaws to the labor theory of value and there will always be subjectivity tied to all things of value. The valuation method provided is an objective one supported also, and indirectly, by subjectivity.

Hi panacea102, thanks for the comment. I agree with your statement where in many countries the production cost varies in which it may be significantly lower or higher than the valuation model provides. The energy cost I am using is an average energy cost in a first world country. Additional significant factors I am not considering in the model include business expenses such as real estate, facility costs, employee overhead, etc. However, this is a fairly simple and straightforward model with sources of error due to the use of averages.

Both of you bring up a great point and it's one I asked myself before building this model. When thinking through it, the miners are the ones who bring bitcoin into circulation and thus have significant influence on price action. They can and most times will decide to sell their bitcoin eventually at a profit, increasing scarcity with low demand and collectively pushing the price higher over time as demand is met.

I think they are both dependent on one another, however the market price is dependent on not only the production cost, but numerous other objective, and most likely subjective, variables. The miners are the ones selling bitcoin into the market, setting the price accordingly with an aim to profit from their production efforts.

My predicted production cost based on curve-fits from past difficulty and hardware efficiency metrics yield a production cost of about $11,000 per bitcoin directly prior to the halving in May 2020.

What about the occurrences when the production cost was greater than the market price, such as during the months following the previous halving in 2016? I think they are both dependent on one another, however the market price is dependent on not only the production cost, but numerous other objective, and most likely subjective, variables. The miners are the ones placing (selling) bitcoin into circulation, setting the price accordingly with an aim to profit from their production efforts.

Hi LucSr, I'm not sure I completely understand your first question. The production cost will double upon the block reward halving. The effects of this can be seen on the chart on the website during the last halving in mid 2016. To answer your second question, I've compiled mining hardware specifications from 2015 to present day using averages and an exponential decay curve-fit which represents a power efficiency increase per hash rate as hardware efficiency continues to improve over time. Hope this helps!

If the production cost solely follows market price and not the opposite, how do you explain a production cost that does not fall to the market price when the production cost is greater than the market price? For example, take a look at mid 2016 when the block reward halved, the production cost was far greater than the market price for months, yet did not fall to meet the market price. Rather the opposite had occurred.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:23:27


The production cost is what instantly doubles when the block reward halves because the block reward is in the denominator of the production cost equation. The thesis of this objective valuation model states that if the production cost holds after the block reward halves, then the market price will likely "catch up" to the production cost, which is what has occurred during the previous two halving events in 2012 and 2016, possibly contributing to sparking massive bull runs.


For known hardware specs from 2015 to today, I've applied a curve-fit and ensure that it's up-to-date with the most recent and efficient mining hardware known specs.

Thanks sealpoint33, glad you enjoyed the post.

Hi dietrolldietroll, I agree in your statement that value is subjective. There are countless reasons why somebody would buy bitcoin, however subjectivity would be extremely difficult to model. Therefore I have used one objective valuation method only as a framework. There are sources of error present I am sure, however in using averages, the correlation throughout the past has been strong.
