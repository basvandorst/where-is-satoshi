Wow just one step closer to Amazon's eventual acceptance of Bitcoin. Then we'd have a really easy way to tell others "what you can do with bitcoin." Even though Amazon's acceptance really shouldn't mean anything because bitcoin has so much more potential, it would be easier to just be like "I don't know what the future holds, but at least Amazon accepts it. So it must be doing something right if amazon takes it." Just to explain to new people who might not get it.

Uhh I think you're a bit paranoid lol. Amazon is awesome. I never have to face another human in a shopping department again! Lol

Couldn't you negotiate a good rate on that insurance, given how unlikely it is to get hacked? To them it's free money and to you it's total peace of mind for you and the customers. Maybe that's not how insurance works I guess?

What are the arguments for/against this bill? It sounds pretty reasonable to me. What's wrong with it? Do you just blindly oppose all relationships between Bitcoin and government? Can't you see this helping businesses by showing their customers they are transparent and willing to pay to show that? As a customer I think like this bill... so what's the issue?

Oh sorry I left out one more thing. Bitfinex went down and caused a panic sell in Bitcoin. So the OP sarcastically proposed the same solutions the Ethereum community is proposing to fix their problem.

tl;dr: Two interpretations, depending on what side of the debate you are on:
- An attacker stole 3 million Ethereum from a smart contract
- An anonymous person [used a feature and was rewarded with 3 million ether](
