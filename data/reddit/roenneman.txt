Alright, 22 results are in. To anyone who's lurking, you can download the results from this link: 
I have imported the CSV with results in Excel and made some pie charts to summarize the results. Feel free to play with these results and see what you can come up with. 
To me, the most interesting results are that a majority of those who responded (small sample, I know) think BTC will go over 10K this year, that by far most people can take some risk and are holding crypto for the long term and a significant portion has 80-100% of their savings invested in crypto. That signals to me just how much people around here believe in crypto's potential. It means that people put their money where their mouth is. 
By no means do these results mean a lot. It's only a small sample after all and some of these results you may already be familiar with just by browsing this subreddit. However, I still like seeing these results and may follow up with a next questionnaire some time again in the future.

I am aware that official stats can be misleading (true inflation, true unemployment, true tax rate, etc.) because it matters a lot how a measurement is operationalized. However, even a very pessimistic view of USD inflation should forfeit that year on year the drop in purchasing power is 'only' in the single digits. If you invest your money in a traditional index fund, you probably become a little richer over time. 
My point is that bitcoin is a lot more volatile than USD by any comparison that matters. It's hugely misleading to take the value of bitcoin as a constant and extrapolate how much the usd is inflating. That grossly neglects the success (upwards volatility) of bitcoin.

That's silly. The value of a dollar is very stable with regards to it's purchasing power. You can buy a loaf of bread for roughly the same amount of money as you could 10 years ago. That's the only real measure that matters in the end. Bitcoin **is** experiencing hyperdeflation (i.e. scarcity of supply and increased demand). The USD has a little bit of inflation.
This is a good thing for Bitcoin of course, but let's get our facts straight.
