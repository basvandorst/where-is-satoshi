why is there beef between r/btc and r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:45:03
what is a fork and why do you not care about them? (genuinely curious. i just got 'serious' with cryptos ~4 days ago)
thank you

im new here but this seems like a quality repost. basing my judgement off of comments

im new here but here i go. 
step 1) create an account on Coinbase.com. put your legit information.
step 2) do yourself a favor and setup two-factor-authentication in their setttings. this is done by installing Google Authenticator app on your phone and linking it to your Coinbase account. very simple. Coinbase has clear instructions. 
step 3) link your bank account to your Coinbase account. this might be instant, or it'll take a day or two. 
step 4) use that bank account you just linked to buy bitcoin at a press of a button. you can also buy ethereum (ETH) and litecoin (LTC) on Coinbase. i hold shares of both, including BTC. 
bitcoin (BTC) is stored in a wallet. Coinbase itself is an exchange (place to buy BTC, etc..), and a wallet (place to store your cryptocurrency). 
generally speaking, cryptos (BTC, etc..) should not be kept in large amounts on an exchange because of safety reasons. 
personally, i use the Breadwallet app for iOS and its very simple to use. i'd reccomend it. 
if you get to a point where you invest more money which needs to be kept in a safer manner, check out paper wallets or hardware wallets. that is where your bitcoin should be stored, if you have an amount you feel needs to be kept safer. 
rule  dont buy more than you don't mind losing
