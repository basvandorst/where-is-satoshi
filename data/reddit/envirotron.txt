socialism does not call for handing over absolute power at all. not even in the slightest sense. If you meant to say communism, then we could talk about how an authoritarian left wing ideology can fail, which is essentially what we're seeing here.
Socialism is a centrist ideology that calls for the same government structure that we have in the US and many countries in the world today. Many things in the US would not work with out the aid of socialist policies. Its funny that socialism can work for our congress members and veterans in the form of "free" healthcare, but it "can't" work when applied to the whole population. The cultural "war on socialism" taking place in America is exactly what the crony capitalists and mega corporations want so they can retain the power and influence they have in America. You're being conned by the forces that manipulate public opinion to maintain their power and influence.

I think you are only one who believes socialsism has to exist word for word from the early texts discussing it. Thats insane and even the dimwitted religious individuals understand that you can take certian principles and apply it to modern society, while others are clearly outdated and ignored. 
Ideologies evolve. Of course modern followers of any ideology are going to dismiss the outdated principles. Capitalists have done it too, i dont understand why you have to be so "all or nothing" in your position about socialism.

Do you even realize that Engels was advocating for Scientific Socialism by showing that Utopian Socialism - an idealistic view conveyed by Marx - is flawed due to human nature? Or did you just pull an exceprt that you believe proved your point? 
Edit: and if you had actually read it you would understand that Socialism: Utopian and Scientific focuses on the materialist conception of history, which is based on an analysis over history, and concludes that communism naturally follows capitalism.

How is my math off? You dont know my take-home...
And are you using the rate before inflation? Average 10-year returns in the stock market is roughly 7% a year after inflation. As I get older my portfolio will get more conservative and will likely, or mord so hopefully, drop to about 5% after inflation. Then with a 3% withdrawal rate, my investment should last another 35 years after retirement. I've done the math. I have several accounts but my "1 million by 55" requires a $220/month contribution over the next 30 years to reach my goal. 
I agree, people make poor choices, but thats not all it comes down to. Some of us are fortunate enough to be given the guidance and support, both emotionally and financially, to succeed early in life. If you are raised in a poor area, you only have access to below average education, and additionally, you would have no financial support to go to college if you even had the grades to get in. With absent parents, these effects are compounded. Then you get stuck working a shitty job, barely affording to live, you have no extra income or time to move for better opportunities or to advance through higher education. Its not always just a series of choices. You have to make due with the hand you're dealt. Majority of people in the world are dealy shitty as fuck hands. 
And like I said, in America, having a million dollars in retirement is nothing compared to the wealth that just a few hundred of the richest people in the country control. According to a Charles Schwabb survey, Americans define "rich" as having an average of $2.4 million. The government defines a wealthy individual as individuals earning at least $500,001/yr, and couples earning at least $600,000/yr. 
You should take a look at the Rueters article titled "Beyond the 1%", its a pretty interesting read and breaks down the tax situation in America pretty well.

What are you on about with loans? Can you explain this? How does a decrease in purchasing power help me pay back loans?
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:47:46
Sorry, I misunderstood initially. 
I'm having trouble understanding how inflation rate doesn't work in conjunction with interest rate to make it more difficult to pay off loans. Is there a term to describe this phenomenon so that i can do my own research? 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:37:57
No, thata financial independence. Totally different than wealthy. You can be financially independent on $100,000 if you live incredibly frugally and in a LCOL area. 
Ive been investing since my early 20s, and i dave roughly 40% of my take home pay. I will probably be able to have a portfolio worth a little over a million by the time I'm 55, but life throws curveballs all the time. And working your whole life for $1 million so you can live on $45k/yr, isnt what I would call "wealthy". Additionally, even if most americans stsrted investing and saving early, they would never be "wealthy" because they just dont have a high enough income. Its not a choice. It definitely take hard work and persistence, but its not something you just get to choose. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:02:00
I looked into this. Interesting concept, but should only hold true **provided wages increase with inflation**, which for the past 20 years, haven't really done that.
Inflation can also help lenders in several ways, especially when it comes to extending new financing.
First, higher prices mean that more people want credit to buy big-ticket items, especially if their wages have not increased. On top of this, the higher prices of those items earn the lender more interest. For example, if the price of a TV goes from $1,500 to $1,600 due to inflation, the lender makes more money because 10% interest on $1,600 is more than 10% interest on $1,500. Plus, the extra $100 and all the extra interest might take more time to pay off, meaning even more profit for the lender.
Second, if prices increase, so does the cost of living. If people are spending more money to live, they have less money to satisfy their obligations ( **assuming their earnings haven't increased**). This benefits lenders because people need more time to pay off their previous debts, allowing the lender to collect interest for a longer period. However, the situation could backfire if it results in higher default rates.
Just in case anyone else was curious like I was. I've never considered how inflation affects loans before.
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:36:36
Well, you're almost right with your statistics. Sure, the top 3% paid the most **income** tax, but how much of the total tax revenue does that account for? Im not saying this is wrong, but everyone shouldnt be paying equal taxes. 
One reason for this is because the top 3% have much more valuable assets and wealth that is being protected by the military than your average middle class citizen. Its almost like insurance. You have a more expensive car, its going to cost more to insure.
Additionally, the top income earners utilize a kuch larger percent of public infrastructure than your average middle class citizen. 
A flat rate doesn't account for these things imo. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:42:58
So...i dont know what 18 year olds you know, but 16-19 year olds are only making an average of $21,840/yr. The average salary of 20-24 year olds is only $27,456/yr. Most people from the ages of 18-24 simply dont have a high enough income to put away $20k/yr. Most people arent making enough to save what they need to until about 25. If you start at 25, at $20,000/yr for 37 years @ 6% (a much more realistic return) should net a portfolio worth $1.97 million. Most people still cant save that much money that early on. I understand what you're saying, but missing out on that initial $120,000 between 18 and 25 is a huge set back. Thats also a HUGE amount of money for someone that age. It just isnt realistic. At some point you're going to want to buy a house, have kids, etc. Majority of people are not going to be able to put away over half their yearly gross income every year. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:11:01
yeah, it would make sense. You look at whats happening around the world where hyper-inflation is killing issued fiat currencies, like in Venezuela and Argentina. People in these countries are buying up Bitcoin as much as they can, because it is a much better store of value currently than their respective fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:11:30
Yeah, thanks. It's actually pretty interesting. Something I've never thought about before. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:16:22
Hm, cool stuff. So I figure this would theoretically work in the opposite way with a deflationary currency. I know issuing loans in the form of, lets say bitcoin, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon, if at all, but it would be interesting to see how lenders would adjust to this. I'd assume interest rates would be higher as deflation increases, and lower as deflation decreases. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:34:19
It depends on your definition of wildly. You're forgetting that the USD does fluctuate wildly relative to certain foreign currencies every single day.
I dont trade currencies. I use BTC as a store of value and occasionally as an exchange of value. So, I'm not an expert.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:06:06
well, taxing bitcoin as a currency would be a good start. I don't think I've asserted an argument to ban taxes on cryptocurrency, just that it should be at the very least taxed in the same way we tax FOREX trades.

Yes, but tax on capital gains/losses on currency is structured differently than taxes on capital gains/losses on stock or property. Bitcoin is taxed as if it were a stock or property.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:30:22
I pay taxes on income recieved in the form of USD. I use these USDs, which have already been taxed, to convert to BTC.  It shouldnt be taxed again if I want to convert from Bitcoin back to USD. That doesnt seem right in my eyes. 
Here's another way to look at it. If I recieved $100 USD in 2008, and waited 10 years to spend it, I dont claim a capital loss of $21 when I go and exchange it for a good or service of equal value. Im not sure if I explained it well enough, but I hope you understand the point. 
Taxes are just getting ridiculous. BTC was designed so that we didnt have to rely on centralized banks and regulatory agencies.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:04:16
Not at all. The IRS is taxing Bitcoin as a property or stock, not a currency. 
I think FOREX taxes are kind of ridiculous too, but they're not taxed the same as a stock or property.
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:17:04


Thats not really true. This happens literally every day, because the USD does fluctuate, especially compared to foreign currencies. But taxes on FOREX trading are structured differently than taxes on stocks and property. We should at least be taxing BTC the same way we tax FOREX trading, but I would prefer that there were no taxes on these kinds of transactions to begin with.

Taxes on CG from holding currency are structured differently than CG on profit from holding a property. 
If the IRS taxed bitcoin like this, instead of as a stock or property, then at least it would be fair. I still dont think its right though. 
For instance, if I go on vacation to a foreign country, and exchange my USD for this foreign currency, I shouldnt have to pay taxes on any left over foreign currency that I want to exchange back to USD. It just seems ridiculous. Taxes on currencies should be restricted to individuals who trade currencies regularly for profit. Thats just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:45:00
Thats literally what theyre taxing on bitcoin. Even if bitcoins value didnt change at all over a given period, if the USD decreases due to inflation, we're essentially paying capital gains taxes on bitcoin because the USD lost purchasing power. This is a hypothetical scenario. 
The value of bitcoin changes in EXACTLY the same way the value of the USD changes in value. Bitcoin could be worth more USD simply because USD decrease in value.
That shouldnt be taxed.
And it doesnt matter if new dollars are created, a decrease in purchasing power is a decrease in value. If my 1 btc is worth 9,000 USD today and worth 10,000 USD tomorrow, i still only have 1 btc. So your argument that a 1 dollar bill cant lose value because its always 1 dollar makes absolutely zero sense.

It is a currency. It meets all the criteria to be considered a currency. Can we stop pretending cryptoCURRENCIES aren't currencies?

I understand what you're saying, and yes, capital gains should be taxed. 
I just disagree that an increase in purchasing power of a curency should fall into this category of taxable gains. Its not a stock or property. 
I dont mind paying taxes. I mind being double or triple taxed. Especially when there are individuals and companies at the top whose income/profits aren't even taxed once.

Bitcoin is unequivocally a currency. Lets take a look at the three properties of currency: 
It is a store of value. Check.
It is a medium of exchange. Check.
It is a unit of account. Check.
Bitcoin is a digital currency.

@_date: 2019-11-06 18:22:55
We should not be paying taxes on an increase in purchasing power. Bitcoin is not a stock or commodity, it is a currency. I can't write off depreciation due to inflation on my USD, so why should I have to pay taxes due to deflation on my BTC? It makes literally zero sense.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:59:59


Yes it has. A $100 bill in 2008 has the same purchasing power as $121 in 2019. This means that yes, the value of the $100 bill has decreased over time. It's still a $100 bill, just like 1 BTC will always equal 1 BTC. 
If we can say that the value of this $100 bill hasn't changed then neither has my bitcoin, it's still the same amount of bitcoin it was 3 years ago.
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:06:21
it was just an example from a website. Many people do take out personal loans for expensive purchases. If you have a credit card and you buy a TV on credit, you effectively just took out a loan to buy a TV. 
Well, that's what is curious. How would loans operate while using a deflationary currency? I don't think they would operate much differently. When deflation is high, so are interest rates. When deflation is low, so are interest rates.

Since you don't seem to understand what "money" is: 
Functions of Money
Money is often defined in terms of the three functions or services that it provides. Money serves as a medium of exchange, as a store of value, and as a unit of account.
Medium of exchange. Money's most important function is as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by barter, which involves direct exchange of one good or service for another. The difficulty with a barter system is that in order to obtain a particular good or service from a supplier, one has to possess a good or service of equal value, which the supplier also desires. In other words, in a barter system, exchange can take place only if there is a double coincidence of wantsbetween two transacting parties. The likelihood of a double coincidence of wants, however, is small and makes the exchange of goods and services rather difficult. Money effectively eliminates the double coincidence of wants problem by serving as a medium of exchange that is accepted in all transactions, by all parties, regardless of whether they desire each others' goods and services.
Store of value. In order to be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. If money could not be stored for some period of time and still remain valuable in exchange, it would not solve the double coincidence of wants problem and therefore would not be adopted as a medium of exchange. As a store of value, money is not unique; many other stores of value exist, such as land, works of art, and even baseball cards and stamps. Money may not even be the best store of value because it depreciates with inflation. However, money is more liquid than most other stores of value because as a medium of exchange, it is readily accepted everywhere. Furthermore, money is an easily transported store of value that is available in a number of convenient denominations.
Unit of account. Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a common measure of the value of goods and services being exchanged. Knowing the value or price of a good, in terms of money, enables both the supplier and the purchaser of the good to make decisions about how much of the good to supply and how much of the good to purchase.
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:26:07
Money does not need to be "stable" or "widely accepted".
@_date: 2019-04-17 10:19:41
I think the USD is good money. I would most definitely NOT keep my entire net worth in USD. I think Amazon is a good stock. I would not keep my entire net worth in Apple stock. Do you know why? Because keeping your net worth completely in only one storage of value would be an unnecessary risk fueled by something beyond stupidity.

just because no one does, does not mean it can't be used as a measure of value. It would be perfectly accurate to say one ounce of gold is worth  0.1472268 BTC, just as I would say one ounce of gold is worth $1226 USD.
Again, to be considered "money" it only needs to have the ability to be used as a measure of value, etc. To be considered money is not dependent on how widely accepted it is.
Native Americans used beads and seashells as "money", this isn't all that different.

Not at all. Using 800,000 years of historical data, we can create a model that can predict with a pretty high degree of certainty the overall temperature of the planet 10, 20, 50, 100, or 500 years in the future. We can provide a decently accurate range of temperatures to expect on any given date, however when you look at seasonal averages, the accuracy is within a few percent, which is essentially what this bitcoin forecast is doing. The model is not saying that on March 26, 2020 (example), bitcoin will be worth $59,764. This is why your analogy isnt the best one for the argument youre trying to make.

what is "money"? it's just a vehicle that stores value. 
Here is the definition for Money:  Something generally accepted as a \*medium of exchange\*, a \*measure of value\*, or a \*means of payment\*: 
No where does it define money as a liquid or common. Bitcoin however meets all of these parameters, and is therefore, technically speaking, considered money.

The definition for "money" is  something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment. Gold *could* be used as a medium of exchange, a means of payment, and a measure of value. It is therefore considered money.
Bitcoin also meets these parameters and thus is considered money.

Thats exactly what money does. 
I have sheep and produce wool. I need feed for my sheep, all i have is wool. The farmer who has the feed doesnt need wool. Uh-oh. What now? 
Enter currency. I can now trade my wool for currency and then use that currency to buy feed, and everyone is happy. 
BTC is the exact same thing. Now, you have a decentralized way to store value across all centralized currencies. 
Your mind is closed and your view is small. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:36:23
Well, you have your theory, but you essentially said exactly what I said with the additional speculation that some unknown whale is going to immediately offload his/her BTC. Mind you, youre claiming this with virtually zero proof. 
How is the "illusion of demand" any different than say "real demand"? Supreme is an entire company built on the illusion of demand. If everyone thinks demand is high, they suddenly want it and that creates a demand. Dont talk to me about basic market theory if your basic market theory involves specualtion about a giant foreboding whale selloff. 
All you have to do is look back and you will understand that this is HOW BTC grows. Its always been this way.

Yeah, my aunt is the same way. She kept saying "okay here's a napkin, i wrote that its worth one dollar so give me one dollar", and for the life of me i couldnt get her to understand that analogy is more akin to how the USD works and not crypto. She also couldnt understand that something is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. Oh well.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:29:49
K bud. Forgot that intro to econ taught you how to determine the intentions of a trader. Guess I must have missed that. You havent provided any proof to suggest ONE person is responsible for the recent growth. I mean come on now, if you actually studied economics you should be ashamed of yourself. 
Youre talking about healthy growth in a normal, regulated, market. Bitcoin is a currency, it doesn't behave the same as a share of a company. Intro to economics likely did not include a lesson on cryptocurrency, unless things have changed in the past 6 years. 
BTC price is driven solely by what someone is willing to pay for it. Thats your into to economics. If one person is willing to spend more than market value for it, that drives the price up. You call it manipulation, i call it economics. This just sounds like a whole "deep state"/"new world order"-esque paranoia.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:40:08
Does anybody though?
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:14:07
Deflation usually happens when supply is high (when excess production occurs), when demand is low (when consumption decreases), or when the money supply decreases (sometimes in response to a contraction created from careless investmentor a credit crunch). It can also occur due to too much competition and too little market concentration. 
Bitcoin is a limited supply currency, modelled after gold. 
So, perhaps youre just hung up on the fact that i used the term "value" instead of "purchasing power".  Bitcoin's value is not solely determine by how much of a certian kind of fiat currency someone is willing to trade for 1 BTC.

You're not quite right about that one, but I'm glad you can remain unbias and impartial. 
"A very comprehensive sustainability assessment undertaken by Ahlers et al (2010) attempts to quantify the environmental impacts of the US Dollar, in contrast with polymer-based notes produced in Australia. The major environmental costs, based on data from 2002, are as follows (Ahlers, et al., 2010):
Water Use During Paper Making: 1 million gallons / day = 1.4 billion litres per year
Water Use During Printing: 250,000 gallons / day = 0.35 billion litres per year
Waste Ink &amp; Pulp Sludge = 6 million pounds = 2720 tonnes
Electricity Use During Printing: 97850 MWH of electricity = 0.35 million GJ
Electricity Use for Pulp Making = Same as electricity used during printing = 0.45 million GJ
Ink Usage = 3540 tonnes
Over 7100 tonnes of cotton
Over 2300 tonnes of linen"

Uses less energy use than it does to mine actual gold out of the ground. Should we stop mining for gold since it doesnt have much value except for the fact that people find it shiny? 


Yeah and a price thats increases on a year by year basis shows a trend towards succession, not failure.

Whenever the markets are doing poorly or crypto is doing poorly i just think "Nice! Everything is on sale!". Some people think I'm crazy, but ive been doing pretty well for myself building a decent portfolio so I'm goona keep doing what I'm doing. 
Will probably hold my BTC through the next crash and buy more when its on sale again lol.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:57:11
You cant really explain a $700* jump in value by just claiming "whales". Just saying. BTC is priced based on what people are willing to buy it for. All this shows is that demand is high right now.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:30:16


Righ, so BTC is a part of the product of the energy spent.

Okay cool bud. Like i said, my degree (an implication that it exists) does not rely on your belief in it to exist. 
If demand for a product is high, and supply is fixed, price increases. Whether that demand is generated by one, two, three, or hundreds of thousands of people is irrelevant.

How do you put any other kind of asset on a company's account?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:10:49
Ive seen a study that explains "time in the market" vs "timing the market". They "invest" $10,000 right at the peak of the market before each major crash (Economic Crisis of 1973, Dot Com bubble, housing market crash, etc.) In the scenario, they held their assets and didnt sell during any of the crashes. Over several decades of picking the absolute worst timing to invest, the portfolio still succeeded in providing postive returns, close to the average of 7% iirc. 
So, i just throw a few bucks every few weeks into each of my investments and speculations. But i can imagine how  crushing it would be to see a coin you spent mere cents or dollars, and you sold for only a few hundred, only to watch that asset you once owned soar in value to be worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  It would be absolutey crushing. Almost as crushing as buying at 18k and selling at 3,500k.
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:41:05
If $3.35 in 1981 has the purchasung power of $9.29 in 2018, then purchasing power has not remained the same among minimum wage workers.

Obviously a 1981 vehicle in 2018 isnt more valuable. And obviously 2018 models dont exist in 1981. An average new car in 1981 and an average new car in 2018 are both equal in value in the form of independent transportation. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:33:47
Um what? Go ahead and compare them then. It doesnt change the fact that you dont mine at idling speeds. GPUs have to woro very hard and generate a ton of heat. This is just the nature of GPU mining.

Lets do the math again since you seem incapable of grasping the concept.
$10/month =$120/year. At $3.35/hr thats 35.82 hours needed to work to afford a pager.

I mean, listen, you definitely dont have shitty points. You're definitely more informed than the average user, but i really think we need to do a more in-depth analysis. 
So, BTC definitely uses a good amount of electricity. That electricity basically supports the entire network, payment systen, and book-keeping, as well as the production of new "currency". 
In the conventional monetary system, we have the electricity used to produce physical bills as well as the electricity required to support the network and payment system. 
I dont have time to go find all the numbers and do this kind of in-depth research for you right now in this comment section.
I think its important to aknowledge the shortcomings of Bitcoin and other credible cryptocurrenies in an effort to fix those problems instead of discrediting this sector entirely. I dont see cryptocurrency ever not existing now that the cat has been let out of the bag.

Fiat is inflationary. If you hold cash (we're not talking about buying bonds) over several decades, that cash will have depreciated in value due to inflation.
Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), are deflationary. If you hold bitcoin, over several decades, the bitcoin will have appreciated in value due to deflation.

I never said it solves the problem, i simply said that yes the energy is used to process transactions but also yields a reward of bitcoin when the block is solved. Saying the energy is going solely toward processing transactions is disingenuous. 
But im pretty sure SegWit and the Lightning Network were created to tackle exactly the issue youre proposing.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:02:42
Well i ask, because the per transaction value i can find is something closer to 450KWh. Not to mention that while yes, breaking down BTCs energy use to a per transaction value is useful, it doesnt tell the whole story. Because some of that electricity is also being used to generate new BTCs.
