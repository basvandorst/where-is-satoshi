If someone is invested in Crypto, it's something they definitely should know about.

Worthless underlying assets whose speculative value is obtained from earlier investors hoping to make a profit from other people buying it a higher price.
No one is committing the fraud explicitly or intentionally, but it functions exactly like one.

You're not making actual arguments. I wish you luck with your investments, but you're basically approaching it like a magic wealth printer. Your arguments are basically that bitcoin is magic internet money and *what if* it doesn't stop gaining value.
If you don't see a problem with saying something "challenges the very concept of 'value'" and then immediately hyping up the value of bitcoin relative to it's conversion into fiat money, then you don't know what you're talking about.

Bernie Madoff orchestrated a $65 billion dollar fraud. I'm pretty sure that phrase is getting me caught by the automoderator, but you know what type of fraud it is. A large market cap in no way assures the value of the underlying assets. With Bitcoin's disputable utility of a currency, both through the inability to efficiently process transactions and through volatility that renders it useless as a baseline store of value, there's decent evidence to suggest that it basically functions as a decentralized version of Madoff's fraud.

It doesn't matter what your delusional aspirations are. Just because you want bitcoin to be worth 100k doesn't mean that it is worth that much.

Are we just rallying against the idea that words have meaning now?

The value of bitcoin comes from the idea that it's usable as a currency, right? A stable store of value to function as a medium of exchange. It sucks at that. That means that it has no inherent underlying value.
The fact that you're treating it as an investment is bad. The asset's liquidity is provided by other people buying into it, hoping that other people will buy into it and make their asset more valuable. It's like investing into a tech company that doesn't make any products or do anything. It can't go on forever and as soon as people stop buying into it and start selling off, the entire thing collapses like a house of cards.
I'm not saying don't buy in. Bitcoin is an amazingly volatile speculative asset, and that makes it a good gamble in the short term. In the long term, it functions like that type of scheme.

ooooooooooor, because no one wants to spend money or loan money at all because that five dollar hoagie is a hundred dollars a week from now, it's functionally useless as a currency. Both hyperinflation and hyperdeflation are bad.
