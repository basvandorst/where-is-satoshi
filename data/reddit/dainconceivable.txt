So what's the odds on 20k by the end of the year? 
Like it's crashed before and bounced right back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:18
HODL ON!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:41
Trying to work out where the bottom is so I can buy it cheap. 
Its payday as well.

I say $6666 is achievable by halloween.

Everybody is probably spamming the new button right now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:23:54
To be honest neither did I. 
I thought people were talking crazy talk about bitcoin being 10k by the end of the year... Guess the crazy talk guys were right. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:49:33
Brought some when it was 2k...
Fuck why didn't i buy a fuckton more. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:35:45
Really considering buying one of these. Plus i like all kinds of tech.

God damn!
He got that spot on. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:03:04
I was thinking it was going to stablise at 5k and slowly go up and down overtime, maybe hit 6.5k mid march. 
Well boy, was I wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:18:29
Bullish rally, up ahead.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:31:25
Well done, like a lot of us here, we really wish we got involved when bitcoin first started. Back then the moon was probably £100 a coin.
Look where we are now.

Damn autocorrect caught me off guard again. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:57:04
So going by that math, now would be a great time to invest, who's to say I can't sell all of it in July and buy a hot tub in August 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:37:40
Wait, is the ~~inhabitable~~ inevitable crash finally happe.... and its going back up again.
Edit: Using the correct word this time.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:15:57
Gets me, everytime.

As long as nobody pokes bitcoin with a stick we should be good.
I expect some wild fluctuations in bitcoins value over the next few days, but will soon stablise again as usual. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:11:35
I'm assuming your having the same issues with being unable to buy/sell on coinbase.
