The same is possible for canadians through cavirtex.com as well. (I believe ExchB is USA based only?)

Lol, nobody's allowed to make a buck these days?

You didn't seriously buy all of that from newegg did you? 80 video cards should be enough for a "supplier" type purchase? Could you not have simply called up sapphire and asked for 100 cards or something?
Just say you are starting a new business and buy that one load..?

90% of the money changing accounts was hopefully early adopters backing up their coins.

I have had a few requests about becoming a moderator already. Thanks guys!
I am not going to moderate (or hire any moderators for) r/Namecoin until the community gets too out of control with SPAM. I would like to allow the community to decide where things should go. This is a brand new world, nobody really knows how to control it yet anyways.

Investing has and always will be a rich man's game.

Did you censor your former moderators too?
What happened to edzillon, hullaballo, and noagendamarket whom I believe were all moderators until just yesterday? Now it's just Atlas and some new guy I have never seen? (No offense, jakemates! Something just seems odd about that. Trouble in paradise perhaps? :P)

You meant atom and atlas, right?! :P
Video shows Atam on the left and Atlas on the right I am pretty sure.

They are quite responsive with their feedback submissions. Simply click on "Contact" and send them an email with what you think should change. They want to know.

Why wouldn't I spend, you ask?
Because I'm a rational individual who understands economics.

Who said I have to use bitcoin as a currency? What if I choose to use it as a phenomenal store of value instead? And just cash out a bit of fiat as I absolutely need to?
(Which is what I believe will happen and plan on doing at some point.)

This thought somewhat frightens me, I was hoping we were not all thinking this.
I was talking with my buddy the other night (both of us early adopters who bought into the market around $1 before Mt. Gocalypse and then $10 after the big crash) and we deduced that we were not currently at the point where we would purchase any more of them, but we were not about to spend any of them either.
We do not want to purchase more because we are happy with the amount we have, ***and*** it is good investment practice to never purchase as the very highest value ever before seen (basically every day for the last few months).
We wont spend any because the price keeps rising so quickly, it would be foolish to do so economically speaking.
So if the lot of us arent buying more, and we are not spending them, the price is sure stop surging. Which is a good thing, because that would remove our second problem and allow us to spend the bitcoins. That is all I have to say :P

Yes, which I admit I will do, when I absolutely must, as I suspect many others will do as well. It's been nice debating with you :P
