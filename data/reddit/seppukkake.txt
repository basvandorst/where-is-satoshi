No issues with withdrawing funds or anything like that? What are their policies for ID and so on?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:57:02
This isn't specific to any crypto casino, ALL casinos do this with bonuses. If it was unrestricted you'd just deposit funds, claim your bonus and withdraw immediately. Trust me, this is normal for casinos and is why you deposit without claiming them.

yeah, said in my post that I don't care about bonuses for this exact reason. Surely there must be at least a couple that are reliable?

Oh you, harr harr.

I have just realised this is an acronym and now I cannot separate the idea when I think about an ASIC
@_date: 2013-06-22 19:02:53
tragically, no. But with a large enough R&amp;D budget...perhaps

ask in there's a thing in the community about a $10 drone
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:27:59
unfeasibly as they dont have global capability unfortunately, but yes a bitcoin courier service would be tremendously useful

I've edited the post again to expand some info

controlled via wifi is a bit more complex than say buying a nice cheap Tx and flying it with that. Although in saying that I believe there are micro and flea sized drones on the market which can be operated via wifi through your phone. they're not the greatest, the hubsan x4 was my first quad and it's a beaut.

for real? 5 downvotes for getting scammed on what is supposed to be a reliable p2p bitcoin transaction, i'm confused and disappointed. I figured this community would at least take heed of my mistake. If I were trying to scam someone out of a GTC why would I be paying for it? and if it were a BTC scam why would I mention it here? I dont understand the logic tbh
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:22:32
this'd be a real world scam, downvotes for getting scammed? :/
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:38:25
Oh absolutely there is the tech for this, outside my scope right now though :P

not a problem, i'm just glad to know there's interest. :D
