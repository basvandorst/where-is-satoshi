That's not true. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 04:29:20
Nothing really. Just that fact that it's not an everyday thing for the majority of people. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:54:21
I can say that we have good control here. Some banks -some- are working towards Bitcoin research and integration BUT that will not happen with a guy like Osbourne. 
Bitcoin eventually could be integrated with systems like PayM and such. 
Hopefully with a system like PingIt too. 
But the guy below is correct. We need this to be on the banks will and not the governments list of regulations. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:54:04
Meh. I like in the UK which is also a shithole. I'm moving to the US soon with my job &amp; family. I have a few btc, nothing major. I work in IT and live the idea of it. Christ maybe in my future (not long) kids lifetime quantum crypto (that's it isn't it?) will be protecting finances from tax grabbing governments and banks. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 23:25:58
Faster? Yeah I suppose so.
Cheaper? Subjective. 
'Securer' Don't make me laugh. 
More convenient to access? Ah your from the US banking system.

Signing up to the dam thing destroys the idea of Bitcoin alone. The verification is scary. No different from a bank eh?
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:12:35
So a waste of everyone's cash
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:57:45
Haha that is a good point. Like when you go to bike shows I suppose blokes get a small ego trip of getting a signed pic of them with a model. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:21:14
People need to stop using the word censorship. Jeez
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:10:32
That's strange. Yeah over here they are ridiculously expensive. Although from what I hear about US carriers they might be cheap!
@_date: 2014-06-30 04:57:42
This is a strange article/title. 
'Bitcoin event shows popularity with people that use Bitcoin'

@_date: 2014-08-07 14:22:11
I managed part of the team that developed Pingit and have contact with the PayM team. 
I don't know why but I have the feeling that PayM could be combined with Bitcoin but *again*. Why would people want to use it (outside of UK)
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:50:07

Yeah! I've never had a problem with things like pingit and now PayM. 
Free movement of personal money is useful, shifting money between bank accounts with text confirmations or PINSentry (barclays) devices. 
US banking seems really shitty from what I hear.

I've said this in three threads today:
DON'T buy Alienware. I've said this in the other thread. They are a waste of time and if you *really really* need a gaming laptop there are better brands that deserve your cash. Just because Dell has started the dick sucking process doesn't mean that we should all jump on their back. 
If by time you've tried to build a desktop. Or a tiny powerful PC in say a Bitfenix Prodigy. 
AND you've looked at every possible alternative. Then maybe buy one, but by god you won't be happy with it. 
Check or just the internet. And besides there are companies that will build for you if you give them the components. And 95% of manufacturers give better support than Dell.

My mind has no need to be anywhere else. 
I can't speak much for your other point because I've never known anybody fuck up so badly financially that they can't get an account. Then again I'm not to up to date with the US system as of late. 
The double system used in banks is fine? 
There haven't been any major issues with it in a long time. So 'dwarfed' is a very catch word.

My same comment from the Buttcoin thread:
My terrible cubicle farm job? 
My terrible 'cubicle farm' job earns me 175x a bitcoins worth per year. 
Or more realistically around a modest 10x per month. Plus whatever interest I get on my ISAs and current account. 
And financial protection, and insurance etc etc.

One thing that is irritating is the stereotyping about customers. I'm a project lead for a British bank and own Bitcoin. I own a MacBook for certain work and personal (including application development). iMac, iPad and iPhone 5S. Does that make me part of some sort of circle jerk problem? No, I just had a android phone and *didn't like it*. Stereotyping a company's customers is wrong and doesn't help image. 
One thing to notice would be that *yes* maybe android owners are the type that would like to be 'paid in Bitcoin' for example. (Again a generalisation that's complete rubbish). But if the tables were turned and say Microsoft was the same or Google even, would it be the same sort of posts? Probably not, it took a while for PC gamers or 'nerds' to stop hating the company. Apple is (for some reason) a easy company to hate on and has been for bloody ages. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:04:52

@_date: 2014-05-30 23:39:23
Yeah comments like that are silly. People are left hundreds of thousands in some cases, that could be easier to steal than bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:18:01
This happens so rarely! 
Give the merchant. Well I can say it's your own fault if you give your information to a dodgy merchant. But again there are laws covering this. 
Bitcoiners hate this system until they need it. 
In the UK my money is covered up to X amount. And fraud teams are pretty much 24/7 for card cancelation and reclamation. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:26:14
Telling a tiny investment firm about Bitcoin is silly. 
It's the equivalent to people that walk into a bank and ask?

OP what the hell are you a 16yo anarchist. Grow up. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:15:05
I work for a bank and want Bitcoin to be integrated into our systems. In reality it could, it might take a few dedicated teams and maybe some sort of synergy between various banks IT teams, or contracted teams. And then it might happen. My main hope is that it gets integrated into PayM or Pingit which I can aid with. 
Obviously all *we* can do is wait and see what happens. 
The main thing that gets me about Bitcoin is that it is a decentralised currency that is not decentralised. -due to the way people are letting it be regulated- 
I suppose to answer your question would be that I don't want to sound like a hysterical libertarian or just crazy person who paints everyone with the 'statist' brush and slags anyone off who doesn't believe them. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:23:43
Your comment confuses me slightly. 
I wasn't complaining about Apple. 
And yes of course it's a big improvement

Overstock *should* have gone down the shitter. There are better companies out there. 
They noticed the fervour behind Bitcoin and knew that not many companies accepted it. 
So of course people flocked to Overstock, for the wrong reasons. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 02:06:02
A lot of people are replying to you and banging on about freedom. 
When at the same time everyone is scared of Bitcoin being regulated.

Everybody has been saying about eBay and fees. 
What fees do you pay in the US for eBay?!
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:32:36
It's the same as with Apple. People would rather bitch, moan and write articles about it rather than try and make it happen 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:59:23

I can tell you in five years Credit and debit cards will outweigh Bitcoin users still. 
Bitcoin offers no actual benefits outside of somewhat low fees.

@_date: 2014-09-25 03:03:28
Yes the bank branch 'prints' (term)/programs you another card. It's pretty neat. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:42:42
Well, it also makes sense. It's mostly for if you owe back or are in debt right? 
We already get automatic deductions for more things and I personally have to file a high earners tax form (which is a pain and I wish it was automatic). 
It's just another way of it being more efficient. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:10:05
And yet be warned who you give to because not all charities are as 'non-profit' as we'd like. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:06:16
Sweet! Some awesome stuff on there 
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:45:22
Problem being also that the majority of the population either don't care, don't know, or don't *need* to use Bitcoin yet as it truly doesn't have that many advantages (yet). 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:36:58
Couldn't I just buy a bomb with btc as well as dollar (or pound as it stands). 
I mean, if we want btc popular! :D
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:35:03
The UK is instant. 
Bank account transactions are really efficient and two examples of things that beat btc transactions would be PayM and Pingit (which I had a hand in developing...well I managed some of the team) 
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:00:20
No because would probably get it voted up anyways. Then slag everyone off for not caring.

Ah yeah I forget you guys don't properly have PIN yet. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:51:22
Potentially. But banks are being hit with a boatload of fines currently so I can only imagine regulation will come after. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:33:58
Yes but I work and get paid in the UK. Due to the nature of many peoples jobs that I know they also can get paid internationally as well. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 04:13:13
So of course there's a donation link. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:53:02
I've NEVER heard of Overstock. Ever. Are they a thing over here EU/UK?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:19:54

That's very true. Tipping someone you agree with is all a bit alien to me (being from England). But I know it doesn't happen. If you tipped a developer for something open source or tipped a waitress $0.05 - $1.00 you'd feel like a bit of a tit. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:14:28
That's a pretty high percentage!
As a example:
I manage 16 people currently, all of them have a MacBook or alternative but do all of their work on iMacs / (one I'm not that rich) Pro. All of us hold bitcoins in one way or another. We're *all* bad people?
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:25:02
We've known this for a while, for a time they were practically rimming the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:53:27

@_date: 2014-03-09 18:09:51

DON'T buy Alienware. I've said this in the other thread. They are a waste of time and if you *really really* need a gaming laptop there are better brands that deserve your cash. Just because Dell has started the dick sucking process doesn't mean that we should all jump on their back. 
If by time you've tried to build a desktop. Or a tiny powerful PC in say a Bitfenix Prodigy.

Oh this is true. In the UK especially there isn't much competition with Bitcoin that I need (*need*) to use it. 
US banks are broken. And out of date.

@_date: 2014-08-14 02:03:04
*some* banks in the UK have a certain interest in implementing it within our systems that work. 
I mean I could be on the phone all of tomorrow to two other teams and push this out *but alas* we actually don't need to yet. 
The only time banks will do this is when people have demand for it and currently in the UK (and nearly everywhere else) there is none. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:44:46
That's great. Get in line. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:12:34
Credit and Debit cards are more/equally secure dependant and offer greater protections than Bitcoin. 
But bitcoiners always seem to think that whenever you buy with a credit card that the 'person on the other end of the phone' (by the way if you are paying over the phone for something you're doing it wrong) will steal your details. 
I can cut my debit card up now and go and get a new one from my local bank same day. Again I have access to a 24/7 fraud line and financial protection/ 'insurance'.

The UK is pretty awesome for banking, Pingit for example is pretty neat. I have had an account with most of our major banks and I've never had any of the inconveniences that most US people have had.

It might just be me. But occasionally the Bitcoin community sounds outright delusional. 
No, OpenBazaar won't be the fall of eBay.
Overstock won't be the fall of amazon. 
And then they tack on some sentence about freedom and politics and shit. 
People aren't *afraid* of Bitcoin. Especially not bankers and the like.

One thing is:
Say I have £1 and I want to buy a item for exactly £1. I can do that with a pound coin. Whereas Btc may change violently. Even if its a marginal change so my £1 in btc may be worth 0.99 the next day.

Hey look it's the daily we hate Apple post! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:29:34
I agree, there is nothing wrong with Apple at all, more people are willing to rip into a fantastic company than not on reddit (mainly). And it's rather annoying, even the Android sub isn't this bad. 
Apple have fantastic CS, staff and support staff. It all comes with the purchase, they also recently made 90% of software free, including pirated, the hate is just it *internet hate* a load of bullcrap. I don't even have a preference, I've used everything and have a iPhone &amp; MacBook, along with a gaming desktop (which shuts people up), because they work *really quite well*. 
Of course they aren't going to be looking into it yet (although who knows). The bigger the company, the more people can blame them (see the kids making purchases thing), and they certainly have no issue with cash flow either. So btc would just be a tiny token percentage of flow. And when you look at it a different way (taking as a example), what company wants to get involved with a user base that constantly slags them off?
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:54:58
This is the correct answer really. It's been ToS from day one, anybody that devs knows this.

@_date: 2013-11-23 02:46:06
One of the things I've always wanted to know is, what the *hell* do I do if I play for a service I don't get?
Just saying, if I get scammed, as rare as it is, with my debit card, or PayPal, I can get my money back in a few minutes if I hold a valid case. 
What can I do with btc. This is one of the main things putting me off it. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:17:44

Yay! I've been wanting to ask this for a while, how would a English (born and raised) couple go about moving to the USA?

Thats just r/bitcoin jerk-off bait

On the other hand. If rather not be downloading apps where devs can request everything from my device. 
Oh and by the way, it's in the Mac App Store. So do your research first. 
The author of the app just doesn't want you to know why it was pulled.

This is another thing that got me, someone pointed out the Trezor as an example here. One day it's worth £69, then £180. Should the price tag have changed, no idea, BTC is still hard to gauge at the minute.

A. That's not a lot
B. Get a better bank

Not even PayPal, just paying by card. I'm into Bitcoin but I haven't brought any yet, because, *yes* I can spend it on certain things, but, I can with my good old fashioned GBP.

It's the UK! People still measure weight in stones! On paper we're alright, but society needs to catch up.

I'm not requesting insurance at all. 
If my money goes to a service I'm not happy with, how do I get it back from that merchant painlessly? So far I can call the monetary provider up, and done.

They'll also have the logistical advantage of actually being able to deliver. Instead of dicking about

Move with the times? 
You speak as if everyone is using btc (shudder) and moz are the only ones not

Yeah it is a issue, especially for non-maths inclined people. 
Galaxy bar: 80p
In btc one day it could be something completely different 
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:59:30
Considering you can't pay with cash... yeah

Why has the price not changed at all to reflect economy. It's putting me off getting one
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:33:50
FINALLY. Food.

I know but the price changes right? I'm not too 'up' on it yet (I have 3p worth) but I had 2p. Then 1p as the price changed. So my guess is that could stop you from buying something

I just protect mine with a 256 generated pass. Nothing special, I do have Offline Armoury/Paper backups.

Short on money?
Buy a expensive miner!
Confuzzled me a bit, bloody awesome though :)

Can't you make a wallet like the one he's doing with ARMOURY?
