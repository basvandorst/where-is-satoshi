Sorry if there was a misunderstanding, my concern was when a IT business with customers all over the planet are paying in BitCoin.  That business must report revenue to the authorities.  If you don't report the revenue (or skim it), the authorities will become suspicious as to why your company is always making "losses".   I was brainstorming ways to appease the tax office.

It is difficult to track the geographic location of the person who is paying you Bitcoin, so you have a lot of freedom in choosing where to book revenue.  So instead of thinking how to deal with salary and other expenses (which are usually geographic dependent), you could set up a subsidiary in a tax haven with its books denominated in bitcoin.  Then through transfer pricing, move the profits off shore.  This is quite scum baggish but creative maybe....

I suppose you could do the something as those websites that let you trade giftcards.  The licensing requirements would be much more lenient I think.

Revenues in bitcoins, but expenses would be in dollars.  The tax authorities would be able to sniff out something from the discrepancy between the two.  Instead, you have to set up a holding comapny offshore which does it's accounting in all bitcoin.  Then you cam setup a transfer pricing arrangement between the offshore company and the local authorities.  This is probably the cleanest way to do this.
