You're point is valid and I want to shout love to the 'noobs'. :)
The noobs are still early.  They might not be the generals, they are the army and they are going to be rewarded well vs. everyone else who comes later.
And they are why you and every other early Bitcoin pioneer built what is here.  You didn't do it in spite of the noobs, you did it FOR the noobs. 
A year ago, I was a noob (and still am!) But every time I get a PM from one of my friends who see my bitcoin posts on FB or elsewhere asking me to explain it, I get very happy for them. We need all the noobs. :)

You all who were in early.. congratulations and Do good with your wealth please.  
All of us who are in late, this isn't even the moon yet.

The supply of coins for sale under 10k is about 1/3 what it was last night.  Supply is dwindling. 
This could change, obviously, but I think it's interesting and if I'm reading this correctly it means that less and less people are willing to sell below 10k and the demand side is giving up the hope of a dip and buying what they can under 10k.
Personally, I'd love a huge dip.  Just for an hour or two.

Did you borrow from a loan shark who's going to break your knees if you don't pay him back by the end of the year with interest?  If not, HODL.
If you're over leveraged or going to lose your house, sell.  
If you're gonna have to forgo a new TV or miss a vacation HODL.
Just know.. 9k was a bit of a fun meme moment. 10k is a milestone.  The moon lies ahead of us.
