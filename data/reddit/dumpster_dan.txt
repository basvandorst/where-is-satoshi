Me too, I want to see the price go way down again so I can actually get in on it this time.

I hope it's the latter.  I love the free market!

I'm gonna buy a couple soon just to hedge against that possibility.

Better hope the NSA doesn't backdoor them somehow and put a gag order on the manufacturer.

Pretty sure that's a fan.

Well yea, no investment is without risk.

As a conservative, this article is filling me with joy.  Stupid progressives.

Well, if you were to sell bitcoins locally, in person for cash the IRS would have no knowledge of it.  You could use them for goods/resellables though and depending on what you purchased from where, I doubt the IRS would know about it.  I mean people generally expect to take a hit when they're laundering money so even purchasing physical goods and reselling them somehow, while it would cause you to take a bit of a haircut, could still be favorable to reporting the income.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy and it is set up to be a deflationary currency.  This makes increases in price/value likely.

But how is it any different to just buy bitcoins on an exchange if that is your main goal?  You are supporting the network by providing liquidity and are supporting the price of bitcoins, if not causing it to go higher.  That keeps or increases incentives for others to mine.

When you receive bitcoins, the IRS doesn't know about it, yet at least.

Why would it be advantageous to purchase mining time or capacity in GH/s on the cloud compared to just buying bitcoins on an exchange?
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:21:05
Yep, this is not credible at all.  There isn't even any commentary or analysis to support the claim in the title.

I don't know, couldn't they view the blockchain and figure it out?  I always thought that's why those bitcoin mixing services existed.  For that and to scam you out of your bitcoins.  I'm sure a lot of them are full of shit and just rip you off.
