I bought myself and my bf $70 worth of dogecoin 100,000 each and sent it to the dogecoin tip bot wallet. We loved the community and heavily tipped others. Then the creator stole everyone's coins and has now disappeared. They would be worth 
~$3,000 today ����

Having trouble finding these quotes anywhere else other than disinfo.com ...
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:35:55
Yes, that was idea, at least.

I was hoping to put them on a Ledger Nano or Trezor but I admit I haven't checked to see if they can hold all these different coins!

Oh that's not what I meant! The way I wrote the post is perhaps confusing (Sorry!) I just edited it--Does that make more sense now?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:30:21
Ah, I see. Thank you so much for this explanation. I tried searching about it but I couldn't find anything! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:18:45
Ha, okay thank you so for your response anyway! 
  
Why are post-fork coins on 'government radar' so to speak?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:57:26
Thank you for your response that makes sense! 
Casascius coins are not what I had in mind but thank you for clearing that up!

Ah, I see. Thanks!

I was thinking that someone in the future might want the prestige associated with having an 'early adopter' coin. 
  
Historical/Collectible value could be a reason, as well. 
All 3 reasons would only increase in likeness as time goes on and crypto becomes more ingrained in all of society. 
--If it's even possible. Or makes sense. Which, going by the responses in this thread, looks doubtful!
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:18:16
Oh wow! I appreciate your willingness  regardless if we are able to work something out! I will PM you--Thanks!

@_date: 2017-12-14 22:52:25
Okay thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:44:48
Thank you or your answer I really appreciate it! 
  
In theory they represent the same price but unfortunately some marked/dirty coins have been valued as less. Also, by expressing interest in buying an 'early' coin, I am proof that at least one person might be willing to pay extra for an 'early' coin. (Edit: like those collectibles)

Thanks for the warning about collectibles!

FYI the showshine boy story is likely bogus. Kennedy was involved in insider trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:52:53
Okay thanks anyway, ha!
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:49:03
Thanks good point. 
Ledger Nano can hold the most it looks like, but not nearly as many as I was hoping. 
Any idea why they limit how many? Technical/size issue?

Please re read the post. That's not what I asked! I admit the way I wrote may be confusing sorry about that
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:30:53
Sorry that wasn't what I meant. I tried rephrasing my question with an edit
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:52:14
Good point thanks!

I didn't check their comment history so maybe they are a Bcash shill idk --
--but it looks like they are just explaining that because they received BTC before the fork, they should technically have any equal amount of free Bcash as well.
