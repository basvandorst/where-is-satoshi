It looks like they deliver in Brazil, thanks!

I'm brazilian and this guy would be awesome as president, however he is not doing partnerships with other politicians and that is making him less relevant in television and media.
Here in Brazil we have television time for all candidates every night during campaign. João Amoedo got only a few seconds of time because he is not doing partnerships to increase it. He is being true to his ideals, but he is not going to win the election with just that.
However, if he does win, see all of you guys in Rio de Janeiro!!!

I still feel sorry for everyone that lost money this year, hope that they keep around until the market recovers.

Following you comment I found an article in Medium about Coinsbank. The guy had issues trying to level up in KYC too. He seems to be using Wirex now.

I'm with you man, but I'll need a way to spend money around the world starting today. I'll keep my money hodling BTC, hoping that I don't need a card in a near future.
