I second this
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:14:20
So can we be sure, that bug was not (successful) used to create more Bitcoins than allowed by the protocol? Or ist that impossible? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:08:44
I asked because of the actual bug. I wanted to know if someone already missused the bug to create more Bitcoins than allowed 
Specially the inflation-part.
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:12:43
For me the best answer so far. Thank you. So can we be sure, that bug was not (successful) used to create more Bitcoins than allowed by the protocol?

Proof: Satoshi was not god
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:19:52
Where did I say that? 
Bitcoins exists on the Blockchain. Right?
And there will be a maximum of 21 millions that should ever existing. 
But if there will 22 millions maybe 1 million created with help of the actual bug... Would anyone know about it? How can we find that out?

Any causatilitys with that:
??? (congested mempool)
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:20:03
Just search for a word, beginning with 1 or 3, with the amount of characters between 26 to 34.
It will not contain the uppercase letter "O", uppercase letter "I", lowercase letter "l", and the number "0".
If your email App didn't support such a search, you could just search for "BTC" or "bitcoin" :-)

 Happy New Year! Looking forward to setting up a lightning node in 2019!! 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:06:12
Thank you. So it is not safer than the the tip Bots we know from real Blockchain transactions. Some Bot creators sole all the money.   
The only difference here is, that the amount is very small and fees are not existent.
But is there a safe place to store Bitcoin in Lightning-State when i do not have a Full Node with Lightning-Client?  
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:13:37
Ok. Thanks.

Set to bip49 and you can create Segwit adresses. You also can use the offline version of this tool.

But they wrote segwit would be insecure and dangerous. And now that Litecoin is still alive...
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:51:20
I think it was more secure and helpfull, to wait for successfull activation on Litecoin.
