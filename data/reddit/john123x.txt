i agree, its the client bad implementation. but we have no choice to use client, you expect us to download all blocks? last time i heard, total blocks is over 22GB already

I think your right, he holds ZERO BTC, he holds alt coins that current value equivalent to 200btc.
There are chances that he might lose everything. Alt coin IS NOT BTC.

 (this is my problem, see the in and out transactions, and my amount is 0)

my multibit is the classic from 3 years ago (its in cold storage due to my trading losses 3 years ago), resync takes over an hour for me

i will provide screenshot and all the details asap at my main post. this will convince you all bitcoin new feature of "variable address for request payment" is dangerous.
i rather have security concerns than money dissapear.
your link also shows dangers of bitcoins
"Accidental loss
In Bitcoin abstraction, an address is an invoice for a specific payment. Once that payment is made, the receiving party has no reason to retain the data for the address (technical details simplified) and may discard it. Even if someone does not choose to discard that data, it may have since been lost in an accident or compromised. In any of these situations, any future payments to the same address would go in to a "black hole", and be forever lost through no fault of the recipient. "

when you request payment, and gives the address to the sender for him to send you bitcoins, if you notice the address is not fixed, and its different for different requests
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:05:18
It should be less than 1usd
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:25:08
The fee is exorbitant....
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:43:56
What nonsense are you talking about?
Are you okay?
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:33:18

Third world country's bank VISA is irreversible. They are so god damm lazy, they just ask us to settle with the merchants.
