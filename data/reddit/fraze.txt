they're being used for an item, not a currency trade, so it makes sense

High fee's and slow verification times.  
But overall they're the best i've used for Canadians.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:04:14
I've called them multiple times.  For me at least, phones work better.

Is GST in it? I always thought there wasn't sales tax on BTC because it was treated like an equity (if you are trading).
Seems wrong.

Hopefully they spend it to further bitcoin in canada.  But they could just be trying to make more money.  Keep in mind eventually they will payout dividends from those fees to investors so they are looking for maximum profit.
Them saying its for regulation reasons doesn't mean it actually is.  I'd like to see some proof.

It would work the same as gold I would think, but I'm not an expert on etf structuring.

rumor mill a churnin, wait for confirmation from a REAL source

Its going to be an amazing aftershock pump.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:04:00
Probably will be a while and lower before it stabilizes. Not that it matters, its swinging like a thing that swings.

At first when I was watching I was like... wow, bitcoin must have failed hard or that was one expensive heart.  Then I realized this.

He's absolutely right.  It's still early in adoption only morons buy high and sell low.
The key to remember is only risk what you can afford to lose.  Now is the best time to buy...

Every exchange in US/Canada will report to their respective tax agency.  Why do you think you need to get verified? Because the companies are complying to governmental policies.
It's the exact same as fiat money, just remove the banks.

This is just wrong. They will adapt but it won't result in any shinkrage.  Bitcoin is just another means of currency.  
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:40:41
You can't compare a currency to an equity.  But you're half right.  It's all about how much market cap you think bitcoin will take.  If you think Bitcoin will take 10% of credit card transactions, it will be a hell of a lot higher than it is now (just to facilitate the transactions)
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:08:47
Transaction fees / Chargebacks / Withheld payments
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:58:30
It's standard.  Main reason is it's easy to create a fake one.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:24:00
That does not make sense. Carry on.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:26:31
It's just for people who want to quickly buy some for whatever reason.
Like before I was verified on an exchange I bought .08 to play around with.
This is the only service that was instant and easy I found online in Canada.  Sure anyone could set this up and compete with lower fees (but you'd need to get rep somehow, QuickBT is endorsed by cavirtex)
