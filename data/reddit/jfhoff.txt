so if you know someone locally who has the blockchain up-to-date, you can just copy it onto a 16 GB flash drive and pop it in?

Sounds good... leave a number at me

No... the question is: would you rather be in ANY existing anarchist region, or under ANY democratic/republican government?

Don't call it a "Bitcoin Crash Course"! "Bitcoin Crash" has a very special connotation.

I don't want to discuss my idea yet, but some credentials: I have a 45-year career as a computer design engineer, working for Control Data, Elbit Israel, Fibronics Israel, Honeywell, ADC Telecom, Lucent, Agere, Lattice Semi; I have 4 patents and a patent pending; I was responsible for part of the floating-point unit on the CDC Star-100, the world's most powerful computer in its day (in the Guinness Book of World's Records as such).

Thanks for the kind word. I agree.. what's there to lose but a few minutes' time? Maybe I really know what I'm talking about, and it could be a great opportunity for both of us!

Thanks for your responses. I see your point. But even if I don't save (hoard) BTC, there's nothing to keep others from doing so. Is there anything to keep BTC from spiraling out of control?

No... it has some characteristics borrowed from Bitcoin, and Satoshi's work was definitely an inspiration. But as I say, it is totally decentralized (like Bitcoin), employs no trusted party (like Bitcoin, unlike Ripple), but yet verifies in seconds and no mining is involved (like Ripple). That's more than I'd like to say unless I find that I can trust you to work with.

I expected to get a response like that from someone, maybe most. You don't know anything about me, and there are many people thinking about crazy ways to improve Bitcoin. What makes me think I have something to offer? But still, if there's anyone out there who'd like to see if I ***do*** have anything to offer, I'd like to hear from you.

Wouldn't it be a great idea to assemble a list of people in large cities (and small) who are willing to share their blockchain? Then, for a drive across town, a newbie could be online in minutes :)

True, but isn't it worth the trouble to let me know if you're capable of the task? Of course, the reason I want to wait on publicly announcing the idea, is that I want the two of us to bring something at least partially developed to the forum (if you're the coder, you'll be glad you're not in a race with others to develop the idea). I need to find someone capable and ***trustworthy***.

Send me a phone number to call: me

My idea involves no mining, verifies in seconds, and requires no trusted party. And yes, this would be a proof-of-concept for an altcoin, dubbed Zapcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:48:55
What I'm looking at having coded is much more extensive than a "me-too" client spin-off that tweaks a parameter, but all I want to do at this stage is a proof-of concept client that would only have the basic protocol in place, to see if it could manage transactions without crashing and burning. I have methods worked out to deal with various means of attack, but that could come later. What if a protocol could verify transactions in less than 30 seconds... ?

I see that subreddit as being for anyone (hairdresser, tax consultant) who's willing to be paid in Bitcoins... no? But thanks, I'll give it a try!
