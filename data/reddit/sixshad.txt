Oh, this does not really better my opinion on LN at all. Only time will tell though, but i would not bet on bitcoin being the nr.1 crypto anymore at the end of 2018, especially because LN is not the only problem bitcoin has.

Maybe not today, but maybe tomorrow it will be clogged up and expensive again. I am really thankful for everything bitcoin achieved for all of the cryptocurrencies. But right now i fear that LN will not be implemented fast enough and even if, will not be enough to make bitcoin a usable day-to-day-currency. Maybe it will serve as a store of value, but there are certainly coins that would make a better currency than bitcoin.

Happy to see him speaking so positively about cryptos. It‘s no wonder that switzerland would be very welcoming to cryptocurrencies, considering their history, as he says. 
Though i am glad i could read this rather than hear him speak, because this guy because this guy talks like a coma patient that‘s been given valium

Absolutely, though i shall be forever thankful to Satoshi and Bitcoin for making all of this blockchain revolution possible in the first place

Hey, no insult intended from my side it was a joke. And you cannot deny that bitcoin had and will (at least sometimes) have problems with fees. Also 12 minutes is pretty fast, but for $9.75, i could also wire the money. 
Young, tech-savy people will easily adapt bitcoin and altcoins, but if bitcoin continues to have transaction fees like this i can not imagine my grandma or my dad adopting it. They do not care at all if the money arrives in 12 minutes, so for them it‘s only overcomplicated new tech. Now, if you look for example at XRB with instant transactions and no fees, i could imagine them being somehow more interested. 
Just because bitcoin is the first mover, doesn‘t mean it has to be the end solution. Just ask altavista, or this other ex big internet company, forgot about the name because they couldn‘t keep up with new tech and disappeared almost entirely. Again, no insult intended and chances are i may be terribly wrong

Depends on how you define fast. Compared to bank wire it still is reasonably fast. But back in the days, biggest advantage was moving a thousand bucks around for like a cent.

So that will be $8 for the pizza, $30 for the fees and you‘ll get the pizza as soon as we have 2 confirmations, should be about 2 hours. Thank you for your purchase

I agree with you on many things, especially your perception on the value of a coin. I think there will be more than one coin in the future because of this reasons. And i did never claim that bitcoin is dead or will die, because i‘m actually holding quite a bit of my portfolio in it. But as for now, i look at bitcoin more as a store of value, especially when it will get less volatile in the future. And this is a good thing for me, because as you said, bitcoin is still more decentralized and secure than most other coins, and has made itself a name. Thank you for your rational response and explaning your viewpoint.

Hypothetically, if someone like cryptogreetings.com prints out paper wallets and sells them to me, wouldn‘t it be possible for them to wait until i loaded them with funds, use the private key they saved before and take all my fundings without me even noticing? Or am i missing something??

Not an expert myself, but a few important tips:
-If you only have small amounts that wouldn‘t bother you if you were to lose it, you can just leave it on coinbase if you trust them. (There have been exchanges in the past and recently that stole coins or got hacked)
If you leave them on Coinbase, be sure to have a strong, unique password (don‘t store that password anywhere online or where someone could easily find it. Better is to memorize the password)
-Also strongly recommended is 2FA. 2FA is an additional security for your account, so whenever you log in with your password, you will have to put in a code that is generated by an app or sent by sms (The apps are generally more trusted and recommended than sms, i can‘t explain why exactly as i don‘t know myself)
-Better than storing it on an exchange is using a wallet where you own your private keys. There are many different wallets, which one you use is up to you. However, be sure to use a wallet that has been tested to be trustworthy, there are entire websites dedicated to wallets. Personally i‘d recommend electrum, but purely because i know it the best and have used it for a long time
When setting up your wallet, be sure to follow the instructions exactly as described. No shortcuts here, or you might deeply regret it later. Also test your backup before you send any big amounts of coins, and store your seeds and passwords in a secure location. If possible, use 2FA
-Hardware wallets are small devices that sign your transactions for you. They mostly come with an seperate wallet but can also be used with many other wallets. They act as an additional security, because they store your private keys in a way noone except you can get it. Also hardware wallets are considered very safe against almost any attacks, you can use them even on infected computers (Although this would not be recommended, because most likely you will input other data the infected computer could steal, like your adress or whatnot).
Hardware wallets are definitely recommended if you have any significant amount of coins, some use the rule of thumbs that if you have more than one paycheck in cryptos, get a hardware wallet.
Hope i could give you a small introduction to wallets, if you‘d like to read more, i‘d recommend

If someone would actually know what Bitcoin‘s next steps are, i think he‘d sure as hell not share this info. All the rest is pure speculation, some with better arguments, some with close to no arguments. But if you find someone that can predict the price of Bitcoin, please let me know as well ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:03:22
Well that would be a real reason for sadness

Agreed, the hefty fees render bitcoin as a currency almost completely useless.
We can only hope there will be an update to this, the sooner the better.
Remember when fees where fractions of a cent, ah simpler times, although not very long ago.

also you can communicate quite well using an atomic bomb, like for example "fuck you and everyone near you"
Very effective communication

Thank you very much for the explanation, will definitely look into this further :)
Looks like a vey cool gift for christmas

True, this is the best crypto-related post i‘ve ever seen, even after seeing it at least a couple hundred times

Gonna make an ICO called Bircoin, with only one coin to be ever sold in total. If it‘s for McAfee eating his own dick, i bet you there would be people ready to chip in some money

Unless the price isn‘t somewhat stable for years, this will not be possible for most people... All the love in the world for cryptos, but I can‘t afford to lose 30% of my wage, a man‘s gotta eat
