According to your post ( you obviously like Bitcoin and Wikileaks.
Did you know Bitmain has the power (again, I'm not saying they will do anything) to not include donations to Wikileaks, in case they i.e. do not politically agree with them?
Do you believe anyone should have to power to do that? If yes, you're better off with Paypal okay?

ASIC's sole purpose is to secure the Bitmain network? And they're pretty much obsolete after a year?
Now: would you rather have the potential decentralisation of every household (obv almost everyone has an Intel/AMD processor at their homes) or would you rather choose a much smaller group of people who can afford the risk of buying a device solely for bitcoin mining (much smaller decentralisation)?
Did you know: Bitcoin emission in fiat is roughly $10m a day. Roughly half of that (or even more) goes to Bitmain.
Would you not prefer a more even distribution?

Did you even check them out? ProgPOW 100% uses all functions of a GPU. An ASIC would have zo emulate a GPU. Who do you think is better at this? Bitmain or AMD/Nvidia? Think again

They're not ASIC resistant unfortunately, they make it more costly to produce an ASIC, yes, but that ADIC will still be hundreds of times more efficient in terms of hash/energy and hash/dollar. 
RandomJS, ProgPOW and Merkle Tree Proof are truly ASIC resistant according to my research.
