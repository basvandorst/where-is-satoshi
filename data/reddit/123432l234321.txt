It is real money and can be used in real transactions. It is also surrounded by a culture of silliness and each coin is currently worth little enough that microtransactions can involve large numbers, like numbers more than 0.01, unlike bitcoin.

"to have", "to enjoy", and "to do" are not usually reflexive verbs in English. I like it.

I'm sorry it is making you feel that way. I think the grammar of doge-speak is supposed to be more akin to lolcat than to Asian stereotypes, but I can see how it could be perceived as related to those stereotypes especially since the Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed. 
I expect you'll get negative backlash from two groups: the usual race-realist/freespeech/ronpaulisgod libertarians for the usual horrible reasons; and the section of the doge-community whom I expect will lash out because they don't want to think about the fact that their innocent fun has hurt someone else. They will likely blame you for feeling offended, but it is clear to me that the fault lies with the people who ruined this meme, and possibly the whole area of alternative grammar on the internet, for you and many others by attacking people like your mother. The people who attack you for being reminded of very hurtful things are the ones in the wrong.
I use doge-speech, and will probably continue to do so in places where I know the people will not be hurt or reminded of bad things. Now that I realize that there are people who might be hurt by it, I will avoid using it anywhere I am unsure of. The pleasure I get from novel grammars is less important than the pain and cringing it might cause others if I use them in the wrong context.

About 22000 satoshi of dogecoin if I multiply rightly.

They're woven out of a metal glass containing hummingbird-blown microglobes filled with Dom Perignon, then gilded with 24-carat gold in a patented process involving nanobots in trade-secret capacity and polished by hand by orphans in no fewer than 5 developing nations before designs are beaded onto them by specially trained Scops owls using beads made of precious gems. The finished products are packed by monkeys in Japan then shipped in octocopters and are delivered anywhere within thirty minutes of manufacture, so long as you pay extra for Snack_man Prime. 
24-bitcoins is a steal.

Yes, in some but not all philosophical systems for at least some interpretations.

It's a safe strategy. Judging an asset for its long term potential is much less a gamble than day trading and is the best choice for anyone who isn't experienced and skilled at day-trading. Don't feel uneasy because someone drunkposted about using that strategy to "hodl" bitcoins; the logic for using that strategy is basically sound if explained with all the eloquence of a freshman halfway through their first pub crawl.
