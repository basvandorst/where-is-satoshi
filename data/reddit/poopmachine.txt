Read [this]( and [the report] ( released last week showing how Tether was used to inflate BTC price. Allegedly, 48% of BTC price jumps coincided with Tethers being printed. If true, the paper predicts a 30-80% crash in BTC price.

He ran a random walk simulation with a positive bias. No shit it goes up. He assumed a positive bias because the price has grown since inception. That's some hardcore scientific method right there.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:38:36
Tether was used to purchase massive amounts of Bitcoin, and helped drive up its price to where it is now. Unlike every other cryptocurrency, Tether claims to be backed by physical dollars. If it turns out that Tether doesn't have $2 billion in the bank as they claim (that's what the subpoena aims to verify), that means Tether was a scam from day one and will collapse overnight. That would also mean the BTC price is currently insanely, artificially over-inflated.

First, the current cap is [$192B]( not $549B. Market cap is just the current price times the number of coins in the world ($11,500 * 16.8M = $192B). If the price drops, so does the market cap. It's not a measure of real money invested.

That is true, but it's not enough to qualify it as a pyramid scheme. In a pyramid scheme, the price of the underlying asset *always grows* (because it's set by the organizers, not the free market), thus requiring an exponential number of new investors to pay off existing investors. With a traded asset, the price is free to go up and down based on traders' views on the market.

Yep, the only difference is that investors are long-term gamblers, while speculators are short-term gamblers.
@_date: 2014-11-05 08:53:53
Every exchange tells you its margin requirements. E.g. Bitfinex: for a 1:1 leverage, the margin is 10% (displayed in your account summary). Say 1BTC=$100; you'd need at least $10 (10% of $100) in your account to short 1BTC. You borrow and short 1BTC. You now have $110. Against your prediction, BTC shoots up to $110. You have hit the ceiling ($100+10% margin). Bitfinex panics and takes your $110 to buy back 1BTC you owed it (short squeeze). You're now down to $0.

@_date: 2014-11-07 22:17:52
Last year around this time, the price blew up tenfold in two months. Was there tenfold adoption going on at the time? No. The thing to remember about markets is the price is driven by the **anticipation** of big things to come ("buy on rumor, sell on news"), not the big things themselves.

Price discovery process: 1) Merchant accepts Bitcoin 2) merchant immediately dumps Bitcoin at market price (merchants are in the business of making money, not investing or speculating). 3) Price keeps dropping until enough Bitcoin proponents step up to the plate and absorb the fall. 4) Fair price discovered (it may turn out to be 10c, but at least it's fair!)

Mining is still profitable (at 10-16c/kWh in the US anyway). Running a standard 600W miner for a month only costs about $40. Check out the [profitability calculator]( for details.
However, with the price in a downtrend, it makes sense for miners to immediately dump all coins they mine at market price to maximize their profits (and thus driving the price even lower).
