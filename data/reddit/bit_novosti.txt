I'm trying to set up multisig escrow with escrowmybits and I'm utterly confused by the process. In addition to buyers and sellers BTC address it asks for "public keys". Why? What's the purpose of this?
Instructions to obtain such "public key" ask the user to go to 3rd party site and EXPOSE your private key. WHY WOULD ANYONE IN THEIR SANE MIND DO IT? 
It all looks extremely suspicious. Maybe I'm missing something, could anyone explain the logic of it all?

It's long overdue for Coinbase to be removed from the list of Bitcoin wallets. Through their deliberate actions and policies, they became worst enemies of everything Bitcoin stands for.

No. They are not just "one competing company".

Having good bridges from Bitcoin to fiat is nice to have, but not critical. Loss of decentralization, on the other hand, is critical as it turns Bitcoin into another PayPal that fails to make a difference. As an example of Coinbase and their policies clearly demonstrates. Without real decentralization, everything else is in wain.

It makes total sense to keep your Bitcoins in a wallet under your control, not centralized services like Coinbase or Circle.
In case of a fork into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT, you can keep the coins of the fork you prefer, and spend/sell off the coins of the fork you consider inferior. Double win! ;)

Good summary. Russian political regime is very much personalist, so it doesn't matter much in practice what 'cover title' its top leader holds: Secretary-General, President, Prime Minister. Everyone knows who is 'the man in charge'. For the last 16 years, and for a foreseeable future, it's Putin. Also, Russian leaders are not good at retirement - they either die 'at the helm' or are ousted. The only exception for the last three hundred years was Boris Yeltsin, who retired peacefully. And he's still laughed at as the weakest Russian leader in recent history, for all his troubles.

Nick Szabo dreamed up smart contracts and bitgold. Adam Back invented Proof-of-Work concept in general and specifically Hashcash. Both bitgold and Hashcash are precursors to Bitcoin, it could not happen without these critical inventions. I would even say that Nick Szabo is more important  SCHOLAR in cryptocurrency. Satoshi's contribution was limited to one (admittedly, very good) research paper. His role in practical implementation of cryptocurrency is much greater than his academic contribution.

You see, Brian, what you’ve built is not a wallet, it’s a bank. Bitcoin Bank, a trusted intermediary between ordinary people and their money. If traditional bank appeared out of fear of ordinary people for the physical safety of their gold, your Bitcoin Bank feeds on fear of ordinary people for safety of their bitcoin from hackers, scammers and their own technical mistakes. Same as traditional banks grew their influence to control the flow of money worldwide for their benefit and later corrupt the essence of money itself, Coinbase and similar Bitcoin Banks (Circle, Xapo) are now trying to assume control over Bitcoin protocol development and steer it to their own benefit, not benefit of the gullible plebs. There is just one problem with this plan, Brian. It won’t work. We don’t really need Bitcoin banks, their tightly controlled AML/KYC wallets and their captive exchanges. You see, in Bitcoin anybody can be his own bank, his own wallet and his own exchange.

No, first we need TheDAO that will crowd-finance a DAO that will format giant blocks of text into easily readable paragraphs. Surely, lots of profit could be found in such wonderful endeavor. It's a win-win!

"If [someone] can succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust." - satoshi Aug 15 2015

This subreddit is choke full with horror stories of traders who thought they are 'playing the market' on Coinbase. And then suddenly having their confirmed trades reversed and nullified. Turns out, Coinbase played them instead. And don't even start me on AML/KYC Gestapo Coinbase is so fond of running. Good riddance, MtGDAX 2.0, the weakest link of Bitcoin ecosystem.

Transfer the balance to unopened physical BTC coin, such as Casascius or Titanium. Sell the coin. It's not your problem any longer what the new owner does with the coin or BTC on it.

1. Is your plan to continue operations even though your guarantor went belly up? You are not planning to liquidate the ETN?
2. How are you going to hedge your positions now that you are not able to source BTC from KnC mining operations?

This reporting (derived from Coindesk story, I guess) is factually incorrect. Russian “Bitcoin Ban Bill” is still very much alive and kicking. There was a minor disagreement between two government agencies, which was blown out of proportion. Now it's resolved and the Bill is on its way to Duma. Most likely, will be put for initial vote shortly.

It has nothing to do with "US visa application/payment fees". The document only concerns foreign investors applying for EB-5 who would like to have their qualified INVESTMENTS made in BTC, rather than fiat currency.

But of course. You can't demonstrate imaginary solar mining operations. Hamster breeding is more realistic though.

It's not just 'a few words', he speaks Russian natively. Anyways, a positive spin is what cryptocurrency in Russia badly needs, given the 'Bitcoin Ban Bill' pending in Duma. Every little bit helps here.

It's quite clear that HF will be pushed through by Ethereum Foundation, no matter what. Community is presented with a false narrative that 'there is no other way'.
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:45:30
No need to be scared, this is just how Bitcoin works. Of course, it's getting more valuable the more it is used. That's the whole point. However, there won't be any 'deficit' due to its superior divisibility.

We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone.
More: 
Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (diligently hidden, pro-fork) coin vote on Carbonvote, 19% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners voted against the previous 'DAO softfork' and would logically oppose hardfork as well. Such a significant minority of stakeholders should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a clear choice.
If we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized applications that are actually censorship resistant.

"Unless you can divide a Bitcoin into more pieces." - does hundred million pieces sound enough? Because that's what bitcoin is divisible to. One hundred millionth part of bitcoin is called satoshi.

No, just asking for identification does not qualify as AML/KYC Gestapo. Demanding to see your tax returns and threatening to close your account otherwise most definitely does. And this was not even the worst of it.

Yes, any broad characterizations (such as I offered) lacks the subtleties of actual situation. Of course, there are some members of 'siloviki' clan that have different standing on cryptocurrency issue. It's also not very clear what exactly is going on since most of the action happens to be under carpet.
Regarding your suggestion that mostly anti-Bitcoin stance of Russian ruling elite is caused by bias of crypto-media coverage, I don't think it reflects the reality. Crypto-specific media is too weak in Russia to have real influence. Besides, ForkLog is Ukrainian media site, not Russian.

"Basically it would mean that whoever controlled the 51% could manipulate the records at will, or essentially steal all of the bitcoin!"
Why do they have to repeat this piece of bullshit scaremongering over and over again?

Again, I ask you to consider implications of this for Bitcoin.

AML/KYC Gestapo run by Coinbase is 10 times worse than anything I ever encountered in banking system. People tend to think 'Gestapo' term is exaggeration and Coinbase horror stories that regularly appear on Reddit, Bitcointalk and elsewhere are not true. Unfortunately, they are wrong. 
And don't forget that Coinbase is currently the biggest systemic risk to Bitcoin ecosystem - the way MtGox was back in 2013.

Popular support of any political party is at a very low level. However, it doesn't matter much as political parties have no real influence over political system. This system is a personalist regime dominated by executive hierarchy based on personal loyalty.

Political process in Russia is always a bit like 'bulldogs fighting under carpet', as per Winston Churchill. We can see some indications of this fight, but we can only guess at what position is winning and why.
So, on a very general level, there are currently a few factions among Russian top brass with regards to Bitcoin/crypto. One faction is mostly convinced that cryptocurrencies are the future and it's impossible to fight them. This is video of German Gref (Sberbank CEO, member of Putin's inner circle) voicing this position (English CC):
Another faction (mostly 'siloviki', a coterie of military, police and secret service strongmen) advocates harsh and strong suppression of Bitcoin/crypto by any means necessary. Such as this (English CC):
There are also those proposing caution, 'middle ground' and 'wait and see' approaches, such as Russian PM:
What bulldog faction will prevail in this undercarpet fight? No one knows for sure, your guess is as good as mine. ;)

Not everyone in Ethereum community is happy about the direction EF is taking it. This people should be given a choice. Some people will migrate to Counterparty/Rootstock, no doubt. Others would rather stick to original Ethereum concept. This project is for them.

Technically, there are currently no laws in place covering Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. However, there are attempts to pass laws specifically banning their use, exchange or mining. So far, these attempts are unsuccessful - not because political opposition exists, but because it was impossible to formulate such laws in a way that only targets cryptocurrencies without touching anything else (such as airline miles or somesuch). The latest anti-bitcoin draft law was called off from Duma this May, and Finance Ministry promised to rework and re-introduce it come September. So, the drama is going to continue.

If you already have ETH, no need to invest anything - you'll get both ETH and ETHC post-fork automatically! Actually, if your ETH funds are on Polo or Bitfinex, they WILL credit them to your account. So, you will have both ETH and ETHC on these exchanges. With Kraken, no such luck - seems like they'll keep ETHC to themselves, as per their announcement. Leaving you with ETH only.
