Where did you buy your machines from? I have been shopping around and looking for a reputable place. Thanks!

If that happened to me I wouldn't be even be able to type a post, because: 
*I just got done murdering my spouse and I would still be trembling. 
*Blood from said murder would still be on my hands and since I'm broke now I can't ruin my computer.
*I would not even know what Reddit is because my Yacht doesn't have internet.

Just keep at it, every month I had money left over I bought more stocks and BTC.

To me it is no different from me providing "advice" in regards to the stock market or real estate. We have no idea what changes the market will bring, but we can educate people in what it is and allow them to make their investment decisions.

Great question. I did it all very terribly until recently. I started buy buying just before the ATH. Then I poorly invested (threw away) money into cloud mining and got like 10% back. At this point I was just pissed at everything, but I still believed completely in the benefits of BTC that I decided, "If I keep buying dips, I can lower my total investment amount". I did dabble in some day trading, and that was a bit profitable. But ultimately, I decided every month I will split my investment dollars 60/40 stock market/BTC until I achieve my goal. I will most likely continue to buy more BTC, but I am not sure what % split I will do for the time being. With the price this low, it is awfully tempting.

I don't have kids yet, and the way I see it is (assuming BTC continues to grow of course as we all hope) my future kids will think I was crazy not aggressively getting at least 1. I don't know what it is about the full number, but it sure feels good accomplishing a goal.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:30:41
It is a start!
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:24:23
LOL, that is a pretty fair interpretation. I was pretty excited when I wrote it :)
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:02:38
Thanks! When I say it to people outside this sub it requires explaining. So thanks for partaking in my individual celebration :)
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:09:09
Absolutely, my investment portfolio is quite diversified, I like investing in the stock market. I see BTC as a startup that is trying to create the AirBnB or Uber of money, I know that isn't a perfect comparison, but it works for me. As it becomes more popular, the technology improves, I now wait and support it grow.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:16:07
LOL I've been doing the same. When people were bitching about the low price right now I've been thinking, "It better stay this low for a tiny bit longer, I want my integer!!"
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:23:37
It does, took a bit of time and a lot of scary buys, but no regrets.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:20:13
Many people will probably say this is terrible advice, but I still use Coinbase because of exactly what you said. It made the process quite easy, and ultimately I just wanted to buy BTC. You can create an account there and you will need an Authenticator app installed on your phone - if you've never done that before it might be a tiny bit confusing. Once you get those 2 steps done, it is like buying anything else online.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:17:43
Well congrats to you too, amigo!! It has put me in a good mood.
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:45:12
I think there is a lot to be meaningful but to each their own. I set a goal to achieve, and today I did :)

It isn't just the potential of attracting hodlers, it is all the benefits that BTC could bring. For example, using BitPay with a flat 1% transaction fee (compared to the 2-3% of standard cc processing). If you have a small company that does $250k a year in transactions, that 2% savings is $5,000 dollars a year. Sure, it might be a long time that they do that much processing, but maybe $50k, that is still $1,000 more a year that a small business could save.
There are cities that have seen increases in international tourism following their adoption to BTC. It opens the door to a new industry. Very rarely in history has that led to a downturn in an economy.
\*EDIT\* Also, haven't done a single thing yet. This idea is less than a day old :)  Just looking for a good conversation to weed out bad ideas. Thanks for the post though!  
\*EDIT  Sorry, your post has me thinking even more. In regards to the HODLers, I see it like big businesses. Local governments will often provide incentives to motivate big money to move in. Low taxes, grants, stimulate education programs to give better workers, etc. If a city did the same thing to motivate people with money to move in to spend it locally, I see that as a concept that isn't practiced the same way.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:13:22
Definitely, I rarely tell people what I have; but I do talk about the technology to many. I was just so happy to achieve my milestone goal and wanted to share somehow!
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:03:57
Took me a year essentially. Keep chipping away, this price point is wonderful time to get in (at least better than my start!)

LOL, *bows down*

Ah, but I am not suggesting tax breaks, nor government spending (and if any spending, it would be TINY amounts). What I am looking/hoping for is government support. If I walked into a local business and said, "Hi I am here with no affiliation to anyone and I want to get you setup on BTC." my concern is that I would look sketchy as hell. Whereas if I were to say, "Hi I am here with Local Government's Small Biz accelerator and am working with companies to get setup with BTC payment processing." I suspect it will be better received. Any money spent by the government would be in small amounts of labor that would be used to discus this topic. I am not expecting, nor asking for any direct funding.  
How do you consider local government non-organic? If we were to all go to Hydrogen instead of fossil fuels, the local governments would need to be involved to adapt an infrastructure. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 02:56:39
Nope, trying to help BTC get adopted.
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:17:37
You are a breath of fresh air. The success of BTC will need said purchases to continue to expand internationally, it is frustrating to see how many in this community fail to understand basic economics. My post was an optimistic attempt to create the opportunity for BTC to become apart of a local community. I am pleased to say that not only has the Mayor responded, but the Head of Economic and Business Development and the Technology Director have also joined in on the conversation. Cheers to a (hopeful) future where digital currency can become mainstream.

Simple, capital gains tax. For easy numbers let's say Bob bought 1,000 BTC for $1 each years ago, today his net-worth is 6.5 million USD. The day he chooses to cash in on that he will have to pay taxes on his earnings, and that will be very costly. One of the MAJOR benefits of BTC is tax evasion IF, and ONLY IF it is spent. So rather than cashing out his BTC for USD, he starts to buy things with it he normally would buy with USD. He no longer has to pay taxes on those gains. He can continue to convert USD to BTC and avoid taxation. The only taxes paid will be sales tax, which he pays anyway.  
This is a win for everyone but banks. Local government will see a potential increase in revenue because businesses will have more revenue that they pay taxes on. BTC users can finally reap benefits without having to pay large penalties, and these businesses would avoid higher processing fees with banks.  
I'm amazed with how much flak this post has gotten, this is basic economics and a MAJOR reason BTC is getting popular in the first place. Without these perks it offers no value.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:15:51
I totally agree with you on it should be a choice made by companies. I do a lot in the local business world, and many small companies are family owned and a bit old school. I have no affiliation to any specific processor, I am just a fan of BTC and am looking for ways that I can contribute.  
My hope is to create a non-threatening method of educating the small business industry how they can become apart of this currency.
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:20:24
Exactly. So pleased to find these new comments today. BTC needs more people buying it and **with it** to continue to grow.
@_date: 2018-10-19 21:11:54
Lol, I guess we won't be neighbors. We are all Doge.
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:56:15
What makes no sense is not trying to increase adoption. It is a **currency**. My post is about working with local businesses to adopt BTC as a payment **option**, my point is there is 111 billion dollars of BTC in circulation, if a local town (including the government) encouraged the adoption it could potentially stimulate a local economy. This is already happening around the world ([here is a link to an example]( I'm not saying that everyone BTC holder out there will flock here, simply pointing out that like other places it could increase tourism and trade.
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:19:03
Thank you for doing both. For your purchases, is most online or have you found many in person stores offering the exchange? If the latter, do you have any opinions on which payment processors have been better for BTC and the consumers?
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:15:48
I am not sure the relevancy. What I am proposing is a group of people (preferably sponsored by the local government) assist in educating and setting up small local businesses to accept BTC as a payment option. I am not inventing anything new, simply trying to help educate and increase adoption.  
Could you elaborate on your concern?
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:07:30
But that isn't at all what I suggested. I am not trying to do anything but educate the public. There are many cities in the world that are doing exactly this and have seen increases in commerce and tourism. Local government is so much easier to change policy than federal level.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:23:00
The reason was to eliminate fear, many small businesses are a bit old school (especially family owned). Accepting BTC is a cost savings, it should be a no-brainer. However, there is still fear. If adoption is critical to the success of BTC, then I figured it couldn't hurt to bring all parties (business, consumer, government) into a conversation.   
This entire talking point is about doing exactly what you said: it is about education. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:12:28
I don't think I understand you comment, or maybe you don't understand mine?  
I'm not suggesting that any HODLers just give their BTC away, nor am I asking them to convert back to fiat. I am suggesting that the local government recognize that currencies are becoming more adopted and endorse it. In my \*perfect state fantasy\*, 100% of businesses in said local city would accept BTC. This way, any BTC HODLer in the area could purchase food, clothing, rent cars, etc. using BTC. People could also continue to pay with the dollars if they chose. It is just the epitome of BTC adoption, you can spend it anywhere. Benefits to a local economy, is when people are spending money (BTC or USD) it stimulates growth of the local businesses.  
The only reason I contacted the Mayor was in hopes that if there was a BTC outreach program started by non-partisan, non-government people that the could potentially have the local government's "blessing" so it doesn't come across shady.

Great question, I went through a similar phase at one point. The thing that made it "click" for me is the current cost to transfer money and taxation structuring. A few examples:
1. At my grocery store they advertise on a sign charging $5 to send $50 to Mexico. 
2. To accept a credit card as a payment option businesses pay between 2-3%.
3. Taxes are currently paid when one converts any commodity back into the currency of the country. When you sell a home, a car, stocks, etc, once they turn back into dollars you then pay the IRS.
Now consider BTC, if you can transfer money to other countries for nothing (or near nothing) you now open international trading options. Or if you are a business that does 1 million in revenue (not profits, just even basic transactions) that is 20-30k a year in fees. The current banking model is expensive, we are just so used to it that it is ignored by many. But as this adoption continues to grow BTC becomes harder to acquire, thus supply vs demand will increase the perceived value of BTC. 
Lastly, let's say you were paid 10k for labor, the IRS takes 1k of that in taxes. You then move the remaining 9k into BTC, and then BTC eventually grows to 12k, the IRS can't tax you on the new value unless you go back to dollars. The greater the adoption of BTC means that transactions can occur more regularly, and the users will not have to pay taxes on the growth of value, only the sales tax (which would exist in any case) of the transaction.
Consider the buildings, advertisements, and the millions of people that are associated to the banking industry. All of them are paid through the expenses of our current currency. That is paid by the fees that we pay. BTC doesn't have that.

I am in my mid-30's and my liquid portfolio is around 10% BTC. My overall portfolio (business &amp; real estate) it falls much lower. At your assumed age, 10% is totally fair. All about how well you stomach risk. The older you get, take on less risk. Time is money, and when you are young you have a lot more time to recover monies lost. I would highly recommend (if you don't already do so) chart your portfolio and monitor growth/loss. Best of luck with your investments!
