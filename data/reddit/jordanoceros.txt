Why does everyone have hate for (insert your hated crypto here)? 
Can't we just agree that crypto currency is the future of the world? I don't see why people think that crypto currencies are unable to coexist; yet the real world is always juggling fiat between pounds, euros, dollars, and a fuckton of other currencies already.
I love bitcoin and while *my personal belief* is it will always be the king; I think diversity could bring more good than harm.

Winston is **nowhere close** to the racism shown in that 2016 film. He is a voice of reason for the team, and even if you think he's the weakest character in the original (he's not) his monologue:
 "I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor. I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I joined these men, I've seen shit that'll turn you white."
....is written better than **any** single sentence in the script of the reboot.
I am not talking about "Hollywood" over-sexualizing. Attractiveness is a general trait of most actors/actresses in hollywood as they grab attention. The problem is when that sexualization applies to the characters themselves. It's less about him being attractive to the audience and more about him being the sexual attraction to the female characters in the film.
The original wasn't a children's movie. My own parents enjoyed it as well as many others I know far older than myself. This was a timeless family classic that spans generations and holds up well to this day.
This film was so far off the original I feel uncomfortable even comparing them even with a simile.
As much as I dislike Big Bang Theory even those creators show nerds more respect than this absolute shit show.
Quite frankly, I believe to like or defend this film you'd have to be: sexist, racist, **and** have a uniquely horrible sense of humor; and an extreme dislike for anything about the first one.

I don't know why people beat themselves up over this one. Even if you bought bitcoin in 2009 you probably would have lost it with many other early adopters in Mt. Gox. 
Even if you had managed to get them onto a personal wallet you'd have to be borderline insane to hold through the ups and downs to now.
I remember being poor as fuck in 2009 and wanting to buy bitcoin. We didn't have all these easy exchanges and hardware wallets. It was just forums and mining. I know the block reward was big but mining on my parents old pc didn't bring damn anything. There were already dedicated miners coming out by third parties that were always sold out even then. No regrets, I tried my best to get some then.

I really don't see how anyone can defend this movie. It feels very sexist against males, with Hemsworth's main role of being sexual eye-candy for the female leads.
 The comedy was absolutely terrible; and on top of all of it they made the African-American [cringe-worthy levels of stereotype]( I am so glad this did horribly in the box office and I strongly regret ever giving it a chance as a movie. This may possibly be the worst reboot in cinematic history, and definitely the worst movie I have seen in years. 
I cannot believe this trash is now forever tied to one of my all-time favorite films.

Drop would happen if it crosses 10k. If not = no drop.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:44:55
Part of the problem is some only see bitcoin as a conversion to fiat. To me, 1 btc = 1 btc. And it always will. I am not trying to sell and I never want to, I want my btc to increase. I want to spend it as a btc when that opportunity arises, not convert. 
I have no moon.
It really sucks how expensive they are right now because although I have not changed my weekly fiat allowance to btc the amount I receive recently has been drastically reduced. I do consider myself an outlier and perhaps ignorant, but I zero out the usd value in my mind. That's what my usd checking and savings accounts are for. Btc is btc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:48:03
Set your stop losses on gdax, should be a big drop once we cross 10k

They already pay too much as is. I remember moving off campus was less than half the living cost of the dorms, and I got my own bedroom as well.

Aren't the big rise in fiat fees and time for transactions directly associated with how much a bitcoin is now worth in fiat and how many users we have? Isn't this a good problem to have? Why do we have such a sudden sense of urgency to solve this problem this past year? I didn't even hear about the lightning network or segwit until this past year and now everyone just bitches constantly (your hated exchange here) did not instantly adopt them.
Did most people here seriously just see recent articles and buy at $10k+ per coin and that is the cause for half the threads panicking 24/7 this past few weeks? wtf are some of you thinking putting your life savings into this? Those of you wanting to profit in $$$ have to be detached enough from your ~~investments~~ gambles in cryptos where it's not a big deal if it drops straight to 0 or hits $1,000,000,000 a coin.
Further note why does everyone insist on referencing exchange measures of fiat when 1 btc = 1 btc and always has and always will?
I know bitcoin has issues, but I've witnessed that for a long time. I thought the whole point was Satoshi developed and named bitcoin core appropriately with v0.1 so the fundamentals were there so we could gradually tweak and perfect it over time; not rush everything at once for this pipe dream of perfection. I don't expect to use btc for average goods or services until 2030 at the earliest (and that's being optimistic), and I'm perfectly fine with that. 
I guess I'm alone here, and I feel like the last person in this sub that actually still likes bitcoin.

If you're getting an external graphics card dock with it none of those qualities will matter anyway.

I still bet anyone who bought into bitcoin cash heard about it on this sub before anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:45
This happens every hour of an ath. This shouldn't be a surprise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:11:12
The more you talk about it the more you show its influence.
Honestly I would've never heard about bitcoin cash if this sub hadn't given it so much damned attention. Even negatively.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:27:59
Me. As far as I'm concerned I don't currently care much about the fiat, I care about having more btc. To me it's worth way more than $20k and I think anyone currently buying it for under $50k should consider themselves lucky. Nothing will change for me; I keep investing the same amount each paycheck I've done for years.
I also think we will see a crash down to ~$5k levels before we see a rise $50k, but I do believe we will see it a lot sooner than people think; and I still won't sell then. I'm pretty young, time is on my side. I've seen highs and lows since it's infancy, and both of those waves keep getting bigger; it's just a matter of timing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:18:57
That's not even including the price of the external graphics card. ~$700 for the dock + a decent one.
At that point you're already on your way to a decent dedicated gaming desktop. 
Given the ~$1600 for the gaming laptop he spent we're looking at cost upwards of $2300.
That's a hefty gaming desktop or an amazing gaming laptop, or even both at fairly high specs each.

I mean yeah there's dips and climbs but I remember plenty of months of bitcoin doing absolutely nothing. It was a boring time.

It started off with her being genuinely happy for me months ago. With the recent spikes and articles about it; her tone shifted from asking about me to asking about bitcoin. I'm less her brother and more of a bitcoin guy when she talks to people and to me. She will be genuinely pissed at me if it goes down; and I don't want to imagine our relationship if it keeps going up at this rate. 
For the record I love my family and will be more than happy to share wealth with them including my sister when I feel the time is right. But I do not want that to become the basis of our friendship.

I hope he doesn't. That's a pretty big waste to keep that much in a checkings account. He should put it into a Roth IRA or even a decent savings account would probably double the interest from shitty checkings.

I don't agree with a lot of what coinbase does or their support. 
But they are the ones that got me introduced and started buying bitcoins. Because of how big they were and how many used it it helped me feel a little more secure in purchasing. As I educated myself I moved my coins to a wallet but for getting started they really helped.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:48:27
I was just wondering. Kinda considering the same situation myself.

That still doesn't rule your bank out as fault. Contact the bank too.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:42:46
I definitely am. I've become confident in many of my investment strategies. The real mistake was revealing how many bitcoins I had to my family to begin with, and then once news came out when it hit $5k they couldn't stop talking to me about it. I've been buying in steadily since the ~$300 mark. Just a solid bit each paycheck for the past few years. This quote has saved me from making many stupid mistakes in cryptos, stocks, and options.

Don't ever stress about not getting in early. It was difficult to buy bitcoin back in the day. We didn't have proper exchanges and trusts used by thousands of people on a daily basis.
I was in high school and thought it would be big; but I couldn't care about it because I didn't have any money anyways. Mining was still expensive for then as it is now. Also many early adopters lost a lot of money to mtgox and other shady businesses.
Don't beat yourself about it and treat it like what it is. A currency. I try my best not to see it as winning or losing dollars, but as in gaining or losing more bitcoins. Don't buy at all time highs and don't sell on big dips. Even better just fork out a bit every paycheck into it and forget about it. Write it off in your mind as a bill and check it maybe once a week. 
Bitcoin is going to go higher and higher, it is just a question of time. It could be a dollar tomorrow or $10k this weekend. It could be a dollar in a century and $10k in 40 years. The point is that has the potential to reach higher and higher. We will see ups and downs always. There will always be records it breaks.
I don't really know my point to all of this. I just hope everyone can relax during these highs and lows; because it is not going to change.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:02:10
At current rates bitcoin is dropping 15%-16% every 24 hours very consistently the past few weeks, I don't see a stabilization happening until $2k.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:31:18
Nothing. 
Especially because the mining gear is such a niche item; why not sell your ~~used garbage~~ stuff on ebay and then invest the profits into crypto?
Most people on here are holders. When we do spend bitcoin for a good or service, it's usually because we're doing it through a trusted website and not some random redditor.

That's pretty standard out of college with a decent bachelors and solid job (good 401k) right after. That's ~8 years of work thrown into it.
