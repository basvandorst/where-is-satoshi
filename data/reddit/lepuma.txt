Although it would be a nice side-effect
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:54:07
Ah okay never mind.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:07:24
Thanks for clearing that up.  So if I buy a bunch of coins on coinbase, I can remove them from the site immediately, correct?
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:49:59
I hope you are joking with "defiantly"
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:19:10
Now it's at 450 lol.  I'm worried it's going to keep crashing
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:56:26
Coinbase it is
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:56:43
I'm gonna buy a bunch soon. still waiting for it to go closer to 500
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:37:06
If you read what he said, he was actually on point.  Its value comes from the method of transporting money, and he goes on to compare it to other forms of transferring money.  That, he says, doesn't give it much value in his opinion.  I think that's a reasonable thing to say, even if you don't agree.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:22:14
lol I don't care about a .3 BTC spread when I'm here to invest long term
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:23:37
Did all the people with money in Gox just lose it?
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:54:15
Not going to work or happen.  I use facebook as a web application.  There's no way following people on the blockchain will replace years of engineering talent building out a nice messaging and social media platform. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:56:22
yeah, for something that's advertised as being basically free
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:19:04
Now it's at 450.  Glad I waited lol but now I'm kind of worried it's going to keep crashing
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:04:12
I have a theory that Apple is not accepting Bitcoin transfer related apps because they are integrating a wallet into their phone, and don't want any competition when it's launched.
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:57:11
yeah, for something that's advertised as being basically free.  that's good advice though.  Although I'm not trying to day trade
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:00:45
Pretty sure you can easily with Coinbase
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:39:04
Really?  I thought what he said made sense.  What specifically do you disagree with?  It's all in his quote.
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:43:44
Personally I like stuff like this, because it drives the price down, and I'm trying to purchase 10 more BTC
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:38:29
unrelated question: why couldn't the Gox people just take their bitcoin elsewhere?  Isn't it supposed to be decoupled from banks? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:38:34
what do you mean? the price dip?
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:30:42
Pretty much loses credibility when you say "lets" instead of "let's"
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:12:32
Yeah, I feel like these stories are going to screw some people over...
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:28:03
You seem to have taken offense to my response. We are not talking about how fortunes are made, we are talking about what bets people are willing to take with their livelihood. Of course the answer is inherently subjective (objectively), because it is up to the individual to choose what to do. And I am not talking about the $1 scenario - I am talking about the 100k scenario. Different people have different standards/preferences on lifestyle and happiness, so I think you are being shortsighted and naive saying taking the bet is "objective reality". Can you seriously not see how some people would not want to risk losing everything at the expense of potential infinite wealth? What about a family that depends on you? You would risk making them homeless at 50% odds? You must be young.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:24:12
You are an idiot.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:27:42
Lmao you are slinging ad hominem attacks at me! Of course that's offensive! And yeah...I do, along with CS, from a top school. You are barking up the wrong tree.
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:45:58
Lol I started this conversation by comparing the expected return with conventional wisdom. I have a degree in math and know what "objective reality" is. Clearly you do not.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:55:17
You guys are arguing about the statistical expected return without the context of how bad losing all your money is.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:07:46
No, I wouldn't, because there is a 50% chance I'm absolutely fucked, and a 100k situation is fine. Money also has diminishing returns; how much better is 1T than 1B, practically? Compare that to the difference between 0 and 100k...
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:51:02
I can't believe I'm still engaging with you, but alright, here we go. The expected return for 2:1 odds on $0 vs $1T from 100k is (.5)(-100,000) + (.5)(1,000,000,000,000) = 499,999,950,000. Mathematically you take the bet. In the real world, many people wouldn't.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:13:26
Dude did you read anything I said? Mathematically you are right - the expected return is better for taking the bet. I said that. My point is that losing everything is not worth it to some people. Also, you have no idea who I am or what I have done. Honestly, you are just embarrassing yourself. grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:59:07
Buy a lot of bitcoin 5 years ago 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:33:46
Every time.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:21:23
I wouldn't be so sure about it being random. There is a fair amount of uncertainty about what's going to happen in the next couple months, and investors don't like that.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:21:01
Isn't gdax controlled by coinbase? Why would the 1.5% fee not apply there?
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:02:49
Okay I was just responding to


@_date: 2017-06-27 12:10:55
So is this good or bad? Seems bad tbh
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:24:42
The article you mentioned literally says 


It is not saying that Bitcoin will reign supreme; it is saying that blockchain technology is great, and there will be some currency that it works with. In a sense, the article you posted agrees with Mark Cuban (though yes, he is a moron). The fact is, blockchain can exist without Bitcoin. Blockchain is just a technology; to say that there is no blockchain without bitcoin just means you don't understand it, or are speaking in hyperbole.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:57:33
I never said blockchain can function without the reward tokens, I said it has to work with "some currency". My point is the currency doesn't have to be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:46:50
But it's only at 40%
