What the fuck man, I want to light my cash on fire after reading this whole chain of comments...

Stop being a pussy and just double check their reviews and average escrow/communication times and well as making sure they have done over 100 transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:32:14
How do you feel about GreenAddress?
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:42:21
How will that effect transaction confirmation times? Do you think miner fees will increase due to loss of usual profits?

I don't care about this rabid fandom of certain cryptos over others. It's a fucking technology available to be replicated and made better, branding-be-damned.
Bitcoin has the most adoption of any other crypto in the world, giving it more media coverage and general attention for research. That is the only reason it has progressed as far as it has. I can use Litecoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other currencies in the same capacity as Bitcoin, but they are not as prevalent and have not been ADOPTED by enough people to be useful day-to-day.
A distributed public ledger is something that the general public has a hard time understanding why they should prefer it over their current centralized system
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:16:47
Because the major rub from people who are against Bitcoin and crypto in general is trusting in the blockchain technology over traditional system of handling currency transactions.
Right now adoption of the technology is what is needed most. Cell phones and the internet didn't boom with progress until it was in everyone's pocket.

True, I forgot to add that aswell, but even with a paper wallet you still need a client afterwards that recognize both chains and "splits" your coins for you.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:19:05
You also need to remember that this is not a stock. It's value is backed by people hodling and spending thier BTC, not cashing it in for USD. People who own bitcoin are not all investors looking for a fucking profit. This is the future and some of us see that vision and want to be apart of it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:06
Yeah if you are exchanging USD for BTC and vice-versa, but once you have it in your private wallet(which is what greenAdress is) there is no ID attached to it and you can send it on the network and no one will know or honestly care(unless you are Uncle Sam) who is sending that amount to another wallet. Let alone a vendor selling stuff for Bitcoin who obviously  believes in privacy if they even accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:45:43
Again that is only true if what you hold is a stock. It is not a stock. It is a store of value that can be transferred through revolutionary means, It's not perfect, but the fact that it CAN be made better through consensus, gives it It's intrinsic value.
In traditional investment you trust the company issuing the stock to do better. Here you are trusting the the network and, in essence, the "stockholders" themselves to sustain and grow the value. As long as no one small group or person CAN manipulate it from the outside(as proven with S2X), people will always want a solid, reliable hedge and store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:47:51
Fees are calculated in Bitcoin. The US isn't the only country using bitcoin so you can't calculate the fee in USD only. It's always FIXED in being calculated in BTC.
As the previous person said, it's not that they are charging MORE bitcoin. It's just the SAME amount of bitcoin that was always used is now worth more USD now than it was before. That's not the network's fault.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:02:37
YOO I went there as soon as I found out there was a place in the Orlando area with dank food that accepted bitcoin!! It's a really fun time since I had never done Korean BBQ before. It's right off of colonial
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:29:57
The miner transaction fee? Of course not, I pay that when I send my transaction on the Bitcoin network, as with any other bitcoin transaction online or otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:13:05
Because until scaling issues have been solved for faster and cheaper transactions, hodlers are the ones keeping Bitcoin afloat. The strong belief behind the idea of Bitcoin, is what gives it It's value. It's internet gold right now, and it's in the process of becoming internet cash.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:03:06
Good question. I've made transactions as low as 14 Sat/byte fee and they still go through after a day or two, but I honestly don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:06
Another redditor used a similar analogy so I will use it to explain.
Stephen King and Donald Trump is writing a book called Bitcoin and Stephen is mostly writing due to his skills, but they both have input in what goes in the book.
They get to chapter 20 and Trump says, "I can do this better and by myself" and uses the story written so far to start writing writing his own version of the rest of the book in crayon. So everything before chapter 20 of BOTH versions of the book is the same, title and all. Everything after chapter 20 is wildly different.
It is up to the person reading the books to decide which version is the accepted version and which one is a worthless copycat trying and failing to do better.
However, if there is consensus and people like the "forked" version and prefer it and accept it more, that version of the book will come to be called Bitcoin. 
Like say if the forked version of the book was written by Dan Brown instead of Trump and was actually BETTER than Stephen's version, then people will call Dan's version of the book Bitcoin.
The idea being before chapter 20 you have the same book with the same value. After chapter 20 the readers decide which version is more valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:07:37
Nope, as soon as they see the transaction on their side show up, it's considered good. They just bring a little tablet to the table with a BTC wallet QR code with the balance due included.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:53:13
It's hard because he thinks of bitcoin as a stock. Have him think of it as a foreign currency on the Forex.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:58:05
You act like the blockchain is an entity.
It's just a ledger. A massive book of transactions that EVERYONE can see and verify.
You can hack Paypal cus everything is in one place, but with Bitcoin there is nothing to "hack" because nothing is hidden from anyone, ever. And if you are unsure if a transaction is a fake one as you said before, just wait! The longer you wait the more validations you get from others on the network.
Even if the fake one gets confirmed once or twice, it is literally not possible to mine a fake blockchain and make your wallet believe it to be true unless you wallet itself is compromised.

Use a cable with your phone to hook up to a mobile wallet thats compatible with the hardware wallet. In all honesty tho, hardware wallets should really be just a savings account and is a pain in the ass to use for daily transactions. Mobile wallets = walking around money
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:53:46
[This]( is the best and most thourough explanation of the ins and outs of Bitcoin while keeping it simple enough to understand.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:39:38
[This]( is what you want if you are on a PC desktop. It downloads, the blockchain in It's entirety, and turns your pc into a node. This puts you in total control of your Bitcoin, but It's a little advanced if you have no idea about what you are doing.
The next best thing would be a hardware wallet, but those cost around  $100 more/less so that is only viable if you have a lot of money in Bitcoin you wanna make sure is safe.
If you absolutely HAVE to keep it in an Online wallet, I suppose GDAX will make it easiest for you to access B2X coins, but you are, in the end, putting trust in GDAX/Coinbase that they will follow through on thier previous statements.
P.S. incase you weren't aware GDAX and Coinbase are the same company.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:59:16
Then just use green address to spend it wherever accepts it. No you dont need fucking ID, It's a pseudo-anonymous currency, one of the main reasons people use it is to maintain thier privacy when purchasing shit online.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:25:40
It's a problem if the majority says it is, that's what consensus means. Saying it wasn't meant to have lower fees sounds like you're too lazy to want to find a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:14:43
I thought about this, but we will just make new stickers linking to new addresses once a month or something
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:33:10
I thought about this and it is an idea, however I find it awkward asking to pay up front, before they sit in my chair, if they are using BTC. Although someone who is paying with BTC probably understands and would work it out with me.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:45:16
Nothing, keep your coins in Coinbase until after the S2X fork in November, sell off the Shitcoins they give you for USD and buy more BTC with it!
THEN transfer everything to your ledger.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:44:12
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:17:17
It's too late to claim any BGold that was forked yesterday.
If you don't care about the upcoming S2X fork and don't want to claim your B2X coins then YES go ahead and transfer everything to your Trezor and forget about forks.
If you do care, then keep it in GDAX and follow my original instructions.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:09:48
So when I export my private keys, you mean the keys of the single address(es) that I plan on keeping my Bitcoin in, in the future? Cus Bitcoin Core wallet doesn't have an xpub address, to my knowledge, I can only access individual private keys for each address generated for my wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:24:10
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:34:28
True, I think as long as I see the transaction coming through, I'll call that good enough.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:34:53
If Bitcoin takes over the other currencies, then Bitcoin will be priced as BITCOIN. 
The USD at that point will be so worthless that asking how much USD is BTC worth in that kind of world, is like asking how many grains of sand are worth a single USD in today's world.
People will be paid in Bitcoin and based on that will come the average bitcoin cost of goods and services. 
However as people before me have said, that will most likely never happen and if it does, you and I will not live to see it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:11:55
Depends on how much I decided to "cash out" on at an exchange by the end of the year. As long as it's in BTC and not in my Coinbase wallet then, as far as I'm concerned, there are no taxes to be paid. You think barbers/waiters report ALL of thier tips? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:05:45
BGold is a whole 'nother mess. Idk who supports it. I know damn well GDAX and, by association, Coinbase do NOT support it. Idk how to get your BGold, I would again exercise your Google-Fu skills and find out.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:12:10
It will be called "B2X" and you should be able to sell them for USD following the fork. 
The dates for the fork are always estimates as it goes after a certain block is mined. I've seen estimates put it on Nov. 15th and 14th so take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:35:03
But i mean what if the governments of the world all adopt BTC and all fiats and cryptos are literally worth nothing and merely relics of the past.
It's something I haven't been able to figure out. The basic answer is that the market would decide, but I can't even wrap my mind around how a market in a world like this would even function like.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:26:33
Please read this as things have changed a bit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:35:41
Coinbase IS GDAX. Both under the same company which is why transfers between GDAX and Coinbase are free.
So yes GDAX will also give you B2X coins after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:56:12
It was just a personal suggestion because Coinbase makes it easy for you by splitting them.
You should be able to split your coins in your Trezor but Idk how to because I don't own one and never researched it.
If you really want your S2X coins When it forks in Nov AND have all of your funds in your Trezor then just look up how to split forked coins on a Trezor.
Your coins will be safe either way you honestly don't need to do anything when it comes to the fork if you dont care about it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:13:44
Im not talking probabilities. I'm just saying in a theoretical world where bitcoin is the only thing traded as something of value for goods and services.
At one point in time someone looked at gold and said this is shiny, this is rare, this will hold great value in a barter. The only thing that gave it that value is that everyone has since agreed to it. We then realized that it's rarity meant it could not be divided in a scaling population so we distributed more readily available resources(less expensive metal coins and paper) whose value in mint alone would be tied to gold.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:58:15
If you also research exactly what a fork is in more detail I think you will understand more why you don't need to take any action unless you support the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:27:44
This is the most sensible answer to me. thank you
