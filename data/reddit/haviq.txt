Could have at least got someone other than a second grader to try and make a passable copy.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:45:55
I've never seen a group of people that try so hard to fuck themselves over. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:17:36
The only people that wait are the people that owe.  People that are expecting a refund generally file ASAP. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:30:32
Entitled and TOS. Words that never belong together.

Christ dude I really don't give a fuck.  I picked a pronoun at random you could be a 50 dicked tentacle monster for all I care.

Dude I'm not new to this sub I know exactly what goes on. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:58:39
Or gmail
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:14:20
Well that didn't last very long did it?
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:45:32
Yeah just keep pumping money in to lower you cost basis.   What could go wrong? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:02:15
You do realize bitcoin is currently inflationary and will be for awhile, right? 
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:59:26
This apples to oranges bit again?
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:45:48
This sub isn't known for being very bright. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:37:35
Don't be I was just curious. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:23:11
Thanks for this it's nice to see actual numbers. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:27:29
They already have his money from those items I doubt they would give a shit. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:49:36
Nope. You are not missing a thing.  The only people that will tell you different are the people that already have a stake in bitcoin. Admitting that the rest of the world outside of their small niche has no interest in making them the new elite would in effect also be admitting that they are just wasting their time and money. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:38:26
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:05:23
You seriously and he hasn't seen that? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:36:16
No self respecting human being is going to admit to playing a zynga  game. Much less paying to play one with  bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:03:45
Lol, it's a bitcoin conference as if there was any need for a +1.
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:51:29
On what planet should someone be comped because their too stupid to buy a fucking surge protector. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:52:03
This sub is one of the biggest treasure troves of comedy on the net.   wishes it could manufacture the gold that comes out out of most of these people's mouths. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:59:11
Sad?  Angry? Are you serious this place is the biggest repository of comedy on the Internet.  Half the time I can barely post because I'm laughing so hard. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:09:53
Not true you can sell up to a certain amount

What I want to know is what he planned on doing before bitcoin blew up in price x10?  Just imagine the quality of work he would have obtained back then. 
Edit: spelling error

@_date: 2014-01-09 20:17:25
Yeah whats with redditors and bitcointalk complaining about mtgox and butterfly labs.  These guys are the pinnacle of customer service and quality.  Now scurry back to your holes you unemployed rats.

You'll save more money by just dumping that iMac in the garbage.  No joke.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:31:50
True it is unfair but vast majority of the community is pretty toxic and is one of the biggest problems that bitcoin faces. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:12:46
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:47:11
Isn't this the same bullshit argument you guys use when it comes to miner rewards?
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:50:41
Did you guys really think bitcoin was going to solve the human problem of greed and self-serving behavior? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:09:19
Pretty easy to take care care of.  Just claim that everything was "hacked" make up some standard apology and just like 99% of the other bitcoin scammers they are home free
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:33:44
Bitcoin would profit yes. Blizzard? Lol no.

At no point did I ever claim the wild west had things that did not exist. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:42:50
Wouldn't surprise me.  Most of the thread so far is just warning op not to tell anyone because their probably going to be robbed or murdered if anyone finds out. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:49:08
Since when?
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:07:32
Is it really that hard to believe that someone might have a stake in something and think it's stupid at the same time?   Seriously this community is so easy to scam why wouldn't someone take advantage even if they think it's stupid. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:12:40
But if they did that how are they going to get more suckers to deposit bitcoin/usd. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:12:43
You shouldn't have to repair anything.  Name me any other product that breaks after a week you repair it yourself and that's deemed acceptable.

Trolling was around before bitcoin.   I know bitcoiners have a massive persecution complex but trolling wasn't invented just to fuck with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:45:01
Well in bitcoin land we can hand wave a lot of real life things away.

@_date: 2014-03-17 01:37:57
If you plan on making a game with a limited money supply then you will have to put artificial limits on everything.  Equipment resources etc. Otherwise it will just flood the market until everything is worthless.  Also how do you plan on dealing  with the massive amounts of coin you are going to lose when players quit the game. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 12:02:35

Even with education a vast majority of people just don't give a shit.  They have no reason to jump through a bunch of hoops to use another form of currency and most people don't need to send 20 grand to Zimbabwe every day. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:26:47
Because they just want the whole thing to blow over and hope everyone just forgets that an account that is less than a week old and just so happens to be a buddy of one of the mods on here came in swinging his dick and swung it a little too close to the blender.
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:59:26
Someone already made a 100% accurate bitcoin game.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:49:48
Most people with a brain wouldn't just leave that money sitting in a checking account they would have put their money in bonds etc.
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:32:36
So bitcoin and doge are the same thing one group just takes their fun bux way more seriously. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:54:21
Post in obviously. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:42:01
Yeah except this is like the third different one in the last week. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:07:32
What a self-important twat.  Also the blob was an X-men villain not an Avenger. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:36:37
We have been warning these kids for the last year and every time a single bad word about Gox was spoken the bitcoin circlejerk defenders would unleash the downvotes.  Well hope they enjoyed that karma that came around.  They deserve every second of pain and anguish. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:29:16
Oh, but I thought government couldn't do this?
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:48:47
Yeah why didn't they just use the same middleman everyone else is using? ie coinbase,  bitpay
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:23:16
Yeah because it was totally ground breaking just a few months ago when they were allowed and had been for awhile.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:31:23

It wasn't specific it was a standard moron customer blow-off. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:44:18
Well most people would just do the smart thing and head to Vegas and not waste their time  with mining
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:41:38
It's also the shitty community. Granted it's not everyone but 90% of this sub is full of up up up, to the moon, now is the time to buy cheap coin horseshit that's always perpetuated in this circlejerk community.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:43:47

Do this please.

Probably because you won't find a sub with more comedy than this one. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:49:50
Look at the hypocrite right here. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:38:41
Pretty sure the point was to show how batshit insane most of the community is. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 23:46:17
Tigerdirect is well known for their shitty customer service it isn't just with bitcoin.  Seriously just look up some of their reviews.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:26:44
Because every minor celebrity or mom and pop store that says something about bitcoin is like Jesus Christ coming down the mountain and delivering a sermon to this sub.  They don't have much else to grasp for.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:45:58

@_date: 2014-08-20 00:01:53
Maybe we could somehow integrate a contract into the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:51:07
This is pretty much standard practice everywhere regardless if you use bitcoin or not. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:00:19
Most of the distaste for bitcoin comes because of the community. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:41:44
I can't help it if other people don't value their time.  I do.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:48:23
Being able the  pay bills with it is probably one of the criteria. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:24:47
They just froze withdrawals they will be happy to still accept your money of course. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:38:58
Just throw them on the pile with the hundreds of others. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:49:32

No one that has bitcoin is selfish or greedy, no sir. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:14:23
Lol welcome to the bitcoin community.  Isn't it lovely? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:27:12
This douchebag whined and cried because I spelled his stupid ass name wrong and here he is doing the same thing.  What a hypocrite.

Your wasting more money running the laptop than you will ever see mining. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:14:45
If they go above the other exchanges we can stop pretending we are angry and get back to bobbing on the Gox knob. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:58:14
Yeah most cash exists as numbers in a database and has for awhile now.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:37:41
Transfer the money out of the wallet obviously. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:18:28
It's already forked multiple times.  What a beautiful disaster this is turning into. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:51:21
Yeah this is brought up in every topic and we all known good and damn well they aren't holding any bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:45:13
It's brought up all the time how a vast majority of the community just hoards and doesn't spend anything because they think every coin is going to be worth a gazillion dollars.   This is always met with downvotes because no one can put their money where their mouth is. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:40:44
Sorry I'm an idiot it was Eric not gavin.  I will get back to you with a source when I'm not at work on a smartphone.

That's like saying an autopen does 256 times the writing of the top 500 writers combined.
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:23:28
The people that have that kind of money aren't going to leave it sitting in a bank account they will have it invested.
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:28:42
Trump Hotel might host it one day that must mean he's going to invest.  
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:15:28
I'd love to know the exact numbers.  Was most of the transaction bitcoin to CAD or vice versa?
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:55:40
Along with free energy do you guys also plan on creating time machines and holodecks ? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:19:38
No man if it wasn't for the government we would totally be mega rich and getting laid every day.
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:14:53
Then I say. "Excuse me.  Waitress.  Could we get the bill on separate checks please?"  I'm not kidding, I swear to you it works.
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:16:43
You want to live in a specific country because a convienence store takes a certain currency?  You must lead an exciting life. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:53:01
This sub loves to pretend that everyone on the planet is just buying shit and issuing charge backs.   It's a pretty rare occurrence.   Abusing it will get your shit taken away real quick. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:17:01
Which do you think is more likely.  Hey I'm going to give these guys a 2% discount or hey I'm going to keep that 2% because people have shown they are willing to pay that little extra already.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:18:15
I don't give a shit if the entire world can see who I voted for.  Selling 1 vote coin $100.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:44:05
More than enough spending just a drop in the bucket. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:15:09
Yeah, the top post is a guy comparing it to gambling and then finishing off with but  I encourage everyone to buy in anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:08:08
The way this thing usually goes is that only these small businesses making trinkets and t-shirts and shit keep bitcoin.  The ones that pull in real bank convert to fiat. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:21:38
Exactly it's like going into and asking them to take a survey on their own religion.  Maybe post this to a few other subs such as @_date: 2014-01-10 20:52:14
Kind of like the 90's when everyone was buying comic books and baseball cards thinking they were all going to be billionaires. 
Has anyone every bought into something thinking it wasn't going to be the greatest thing ever?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:51:41
Pretty sure I didn't mention a thing about programming. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:20:43
Remember the time Jesus accidently spread a plague to a few cities and was like whoops sorry guys loooool
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:48:16
You are correct but this sub seriously subscribes to the theory that everything is good for bitcoin.  It could be announced tomorrow that somehow the blockchain is spreading Aids over the Internet and this sub would still try to find a way to put a positive spin on in. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:00:55
Any reason you can't just use step 3 to buy shit like everyone else? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:25:56
Yeah I have the downvotes to prove it. Anytime something bad was said about Gox it was met with a torrent of downvotes and circlejerkery. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:47:11
Oh like how he told everyone that things were fine at Gox right before it all imploded. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:49:41
I imagine the judge will tell you this isn't elementary school and we don't play pretend when we are adults. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:10:02
And people wonder why journalism is such a fucking joke in this day and age.
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:33:30
I don't think the laughing has stopped
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:42:44
Maybe you should.   How long has it been now?  
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:45:20
Bitcoin may be backed by math but apparently sales are not.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:39:50
You might get a hit shortly before the heat death of the universe 
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:13:21
You need to grow some balls and tell the branch manager you aren't paying a transfer fee for a transfer that didn't go through.  I swear every time I see one of these bank complaint threads it's always some spineless quivering jellyfish either too lazy or too dumb to follow proper channels.
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:16:55
Keep the laughs coming please. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:32:03
Because of some random shit mmo no one has ever heard of? 
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:21:04
They might not be FDIC insured but at least you could initiate a charge back.... Oh wait.. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:58:42
No that will be the ignorant poors that didn't hop on the bitcoin rocket ship to the moon.   All of the captains of the industry will be living in the Capitol. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:46:59
Misleading topic.  I've never met anyone that has asked about bitcoin, especially friends. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:31:17
According to most bitcoiners it's because they can send thousands of dollars to Zimbabwe every week without paying fees. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:03:01
A bitcoiner accusing other groups of being brainwashed.   That pretty Godamn hilarious 
@_date: 2014-02-15 13:44:11
They can make 20 new accounts in the time it takes a mod to block one. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:57:53
Not really.  Merchant adoption means nothing if you can't convince everyday normal people to use it. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:00:24
Pretty much all of it. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:27:59
I seriously doubt Gox is going to attack themselves. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:40:54
And the judge will look at you and say the guy told you he was using it to buy stolen credit cards and that he nor anyone else in the court was born yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:17:57
Fast and the furious was entertaining this was just embarrassing. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:38:29
CoD's, government securities, MMA's, fixed annuities.  These for the most part are essentially guaranteed to bring returns.  Can you say the same for the bitcoin roller coaster?
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:27:27
You know damn well he is referring to the btc community stop playing stupid. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:30:34
Not t sure surely have you are being down voted as you are correct the average person doesn't give a shit about any of these reasons.   Most of the reasons given in this thread are for very niche groups of people. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:42:11
I think we should also revoke voting rights for women and blacks too.  Go back to the good ol days. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:37:03
Pretty much every guild and player I know would quit playing if the game became pay to win. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:16:36
Yeeesh look at this guy here trying to low ball the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:38:17
Yeah who would mock a place that had to have the government come in because it was such a disgusting rat infested shit hole. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:53:43
Nope, the sooner they are blocked the better. Nothing more annoying than some asshat spamming a bunch of pennies at you. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:48:36
It's that easy folks.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:36:01
You are a perfect fit for this sub. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:03:05
You guys do a good enough job on your own,  you don't need any help from buttcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:53:01
Professor Scott Steiner Typography: 
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:31:29
I think you got those swapped around bud.
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:38:06
Yeah I hear you can get away with rape by covering your eyes and doing the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:33:36
Holy shit I can feel the energy coming from that number.   I see the equilateral triangles and everything.   Wait no sorry I just had the  fart. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:49:37
No they were investing in a company. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:08:27
Hope who gets the hint? 
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:27:32
Being an idiot would be my guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:15:14
Yeah like we need them manipulating card prices... 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:50:49
Time is money friend. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:30:45
So how would you rate the chargeback feature of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:05:30
Yeah the guy suggesting carrying around the laptop to buy shit with is the sad stale mind.  But if we just wait it could get better!
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:15:47
Woah what just happened? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:01:06
No need to give them an ID just all your bank account info. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:08:19
Whatever you want they are all equally worthless.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:32:03
But don't you see bitcoin is sooooo much better.  If the bitcoin atms needed to be upgraded it wouldn't be a big deal because there's only like three worldwide. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:15:33
This is why no  one can take bitcoin seriously. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:46:58
And he is right.  It is funny. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:25:40
Only difference is this one doesn't get laid. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:20:23
Because some people are just assholes you can't pretend that everyone is a rational actor. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:15:19
Bitcoin users uneffec... Oh wait. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:13:56
No because they only receive USD.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:12:01
Most people generally tighten things back up after loosening them. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:16:19
It will go on next year's taxes if you are only getting paid now. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:34:09
I'm pretty sure you can use Google just as well as anyone else in this sub.
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:48:06
Good question. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:57:22
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:17:47
Cue butthurt in 3...2...1...
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:26:10
I don't care how he was raised it doesn't take a brain surgeon to notice that no where on the Internet does anyone converse by adding a  line break after each sentence. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:11:25
Don't you need a character first in order for it to  be assassinated? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:57:06
Well in order to buy it they have to actually give a shit first.   Still have to tackle that problem. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:28:43
I'm willing to bet I could get someone to accept it in lieu of payment before I could with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 14:58:19
Wouldn't buy a smart watch either.  Mainly due to the reasons above.   I might consider one if I could get one at big lots for 5 bucks even then only as a novelty item. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:19:58
This looks like a site to buy WoW gold.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:13:00
Right and they would have done this had they not been promised another phone?  But hey it's not about the money.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:53:44
Prove it
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:58:11
So they just need to tighten the money then? 
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:52:53
Let the indoctrination begin.  All are welcome into the open arms of Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:12:37
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:28:45
On paper.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:02:08
Stick around for awhile just to see how cult like this sub is. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 05:04:28
Instead you should get all of your nutrition from the inhalation of your own farts.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:45:20
Do people still fall for this scam? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:43:25
And here I was thinking about how this was going to be the first month of 2014 without a bunch of laughs.  Glad those guys didn't let me down. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:50:40
Waiting for another treasure trove of hilarity. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:27:26
Same here, as would most people.  Still not everyone would. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:26:00
Just a drop in business? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:16:26
Of  course he is.  Like I said earlier in the thread he can't ban people from here like he does on twitter whenever someone calls him out
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:44:28
Who? 
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:43:51
Dunning-Kruger effect
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:46:49
Get to it then. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:17:15
Unfortunately stupid people are still stupid people while on drugs. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:09:15
Yeah he has a special edition slammer.  I know all about the pog market. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:56:48
She is right. This is a perfect time to try and once again try to  shoehorn bitcoin into whatever the current trend is on the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:19:11
Exactly and as I have pointed out many times it will be the community that kills bitcoin before anything else. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:40:57
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:44:31
Anything greater than zero. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:33:42
This is totally going to be the year dude. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:46:58
Because it gets real old seeing every mom and pop "business" coming in and saying 'my business where I sell my farts in Mason jars is now accepting bitcoin'.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:49:22
No, no, no, no and no.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:09:42
I can. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:38:34
Yes you wouldn't believe the amount of spam that has to be reported in new. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:04:11
Says the guy who just did the exact opposite.
@_date: 2014-07-11 22:34:03
Mt. Gox says hi.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:27:32
Yeah I'm sure the media is ready to hop on a story about Apple losing tens of customers.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:02:10
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:44:19
99% of this sub doesn't understand basic economics I think it's a bit of a stretch to think they would understand politics. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:47:46
There's literally 4 posts just on the front page of new. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:10:06
So no reason other than its not fiat? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:05:06
Hurry and act now.  Only 16.99 for shit you can just google.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:30:59
This is how the observers of this sub have felt for the last month or so. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:27:36
How much longer do you think that will be necessary though? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:01:08
This sounds better suited for a high school class project as opposed to a TED talk. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:12:59
I bet he wouldn't turn down a freezer full of bacon either. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:38:32
So his message is give to charity to try and make bitcoin look better.   What a douchebag.  I'm sure we have plenty of people in here ready to tongue his asshole because they are just as one minded and just as big of a shit heel. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:53:00
So yeah, all they they are doing is redirecting people to the website. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:31:53
Could have sworn you said you "blocked"  me. Couldn't stay away huh? 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:47:16
He isn't going to see them why would he give a shit.
Oh the merchants the merchants, let's all cry for the merchants.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:51:05
Are you going to answer the question or just sit there with your thumb up your ass?
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:55:40
Only took them 3 days to get to it. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:11:01
It's not that they are living in the 20's it's the fact that they are literal manchildren.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:35:14
So a bunch of past technologies had something happen to them which caused them to be replaced by better things and this is good for bitcoin because
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:56:36
It's one of the first circlejerk techniques learned in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:00:07
This is a repost but I also just wanted to say everytime I see Robocoin I initially see Robocop and it's really annoying.
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:51:56
They will be so ashamed that they ban totes from the sub. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:53:19
Close your eyes and bend over. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:37:31
They see me holding, they trading. Patrolling they tryin to catch me hiding money.
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:25:30
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:09:03
Is there any way we can shoehorn bitcoin in to it? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:32:07
Pirateat40 says hi. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:00:12
There goes poptartopolus taking his ball home again.  I wasn't trying to debate anything but I guess he wanted to preemptively block me in case I decided to. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:01:38
Yup right after I bought a bridge from him. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:54:55
Basically nothing.  Honey badger went viral and the bitcoin community said hey instead of coming up with our own idea let's just steal this one and shoehorn bitcoin in somehow. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:10:37
Except profits aren't realized until you cash in. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:53:06
Remember when Overstock had it's biggest day on the first day.  Remember then how it took 2 weeks to barely pass the first day of sales?

While still listed on the main roster he was just sent back to NXT. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:11:23
They aren't allowing pre-orders this time because unlike with the miners they can't run these for months for a profit before shipping them out. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:24:51
I'm pretty sure every one of the mining companies fall into that category. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:56:26
Oh I'm getting down voted. I must be wrong it's obviously the fault of the bankers and their evil fiat.  The US government most likely ran a super secret op to steal your precious bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:39:33
They offered to pay her in Linden dollars which is probably worth about 4 bucks right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:42:50
Lol bitcoin exchanges cant be manipulated? I really don't even know what to say. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:21:23
I remember when good ol' Mark withdrew all the money from Gox.   Bet they wish they only had to wait until the next business day for that to be corrected. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:55:05
By merchants you mean egifter right?  
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:40:23
Don't forget how he was hyping up a bitcoin stealing piece of malware. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:09:41
You must be talking about some sub other than @_date: 2014-08-12 09:13:33
Yet both examples I gave were ended due to government intervention and not because society is so wise and all knowing.

I don't know generally when I go shopping with people we all have our own carts and don't share.  But sure I guess.

You realize eli5 doesn't mean to explain it with 5 pages. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:32:32
Quite frankly they can stick their pay walls up their ass.   Doesn't matter if it's in usd or bitcoin.   Pay walls are lame as shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:21:34
Be sure you do like most bitcoiners though and lie out your ass.  List it as like new even though the card probably already has massive amounts of artifacts and will probably only run a couple more weeks. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:10:35
They only ask because to them it's the same as asking how much WoW gold you have saved up.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:59:02
You people act like this is a new thing Apple has been doing.  It's been going on for years and only when they finally do it to you is when all of you pretend to be butthurt.
@_date: 2014-09-16 04:23:38
When used for money laundering it's generally expected to lose some value.

Couldn't have happened to a better group of people.

As if needed any help manufacturing batshit insane posts.

When is the last time ol' Lord British did anything relevant? Late 90's at best? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:23:15
I think you are confusing me with hating bitcoin and hating the shit community. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:26:38
Explaining something to a 5 year old shouldn't require multiple pages of text and charts.
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:55:10
Ah good ol' log graph

Opening a pizza box and not finding pizza is pretty cruel joke. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:53:28
You might want to look into what entrapment is as opposed to just assuming. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:34:28
That would make bitcoiners Ralph.  It all makes complete sense now.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:17:13
Short of murdering most of the community there is nothing that will help. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:03:01
That gives me a great idea maybe we can somehow use a bunch of old mining equipment and use the blockchain to power the vehicle. Any devs and engineers want to help out I'll make the wiki. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:38:45
Rebels,  cultists.  It's all the same. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 07:19:35
It's cool he just cuddles in the warm loving embrace of his miner. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:24:08
Yeah... It's totally Gox's fault that guy is alone on Valentines. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:32:41
This is dumb and you are dumb. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:50:51
Why would we want to stop that though it provided so many laughs 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:38:04
Yeah I'm sure the 40 bucks they would have got in bitcoin donations would totally save them.

Hello I am Nigerian prince.  I have many millions of dollars to give you.  Please send me all bitcoin so I can begin process. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:04:48
I love how mining is still used as a con to get people to buy in.   Yeah let's convientley forget to mention it takes a 5+ figure investment to even hope to turn the smallest of profits. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:00:12
I've been in this sub awhile there is no need to try and pull the wool over my eyes. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:11:30
Theymos. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:38:21
Considering how terrible the Kings are doing none of this would surprise me.   They would do anything to stay afloat at this point. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:37:36
None because only an idiot would trust any of these shady ass exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:20:41
Lol thanks for the laugh. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:06:17
Poke his stomach and see if he giggles. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:06:11
Can't happen?  Or aren't supposed to happen?

Like his future political career, it doesn't exist.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:36:49
So the beauty of bitcoin is that it made you feel like a retard.  Got it. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:42:48
Yeah we just know how eager businesses are to raise pay in compensation for lowered hours.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:38:25
Oh I wouldn't have known.  I somehow missed the other 47 posts about this.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:03:03
No bitcoin is perfect in every way.  Bitcoin can't fail us only we can fail bitcoin.  All praise Satoshi and bless his only begotten sons Roger and Andreas.  All hail Bitchrist. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:14:18
So you think bitcoin is going to change the nature of man and that none of the bullshit they pull now would happen if everyone used bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:42:03
If you specifically type in a search query asking for it then yes that's generally how search engine work. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:46:16
Yet somehow bitcoin  is immune? OK. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:20:31
Astronomical? Really?

Everytime he buys a property he has to recalculate the exchange rate.

As if that makes any difference whatsoever. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:27:45
Why would you want to buy a poster that's designed to make fun of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:46:07
It's in the wiki, so it's essentially solved.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:52:29
Yeah dude everyone is just clamoring to get in on a currency where half of it is already distributed to a bunch of people that "worked" so hard by turning a pc on and letting it run

People that have enough money to gain interest on usually don't leave it sitting in a saving account unless they are completely clueless.  They invest it.

Coinbase seems to be the general go to around here.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:39:07
Good question but I would imagine most of the value is derived from the coin itself thus assuming both coins are identical outside of the btc stored then you would go with whichever address had more btc. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:28:28
Good news.   Chinese new year is coming.

Nah we actually know who the crooks are.

They could destroy it without taxation what is your point?

Yeah nobody controlled it there are no fees and it's anonymous.

It's not so much about Applepay as it is pushing NFC.

They could just make it illegal, or they could just buy it out.  The market cap is pretty much a joke when you are referring to the US government. (Which I am in this case)

In that case should probably start an AMA about what it's like living with brain damage
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:34:41
Pretty huge drop off after that first week which comes as a surprise to virtually no one.  This will probably be the last time we hear their bitcoin sales numbers because from here on out its going to be ugly

Whatever it is I bet it's pretty scary. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:01:47
In that case you have the FDIC to cover your losses. That's why you don't see people encouraging others to leave money in their mattress.  There are consumer protections when you go through the banking system unlike bitcoin where your only option is to go to reddit or bitcointalk and beg someone to try and get your money back for you.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:10:31
The power of begging.  So amazing.

Holy shit, thanks for the laugh.

Use the coin map and randomly call up those businesses.  There are posts in here weekly about how someone went somewhere from coinmap and the business no longer accepted bitcoin.

Yeah dude, don't question anything just trust them. I'm sure they have nothing but your best interests at heart.
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:41:47
Perhaps bitcoin will be not bitcoin but a different, improved crypto-currency. That's very unlikely, but most importantly - even if bitcoin would be replaced by a superior crypto-currency, this story would remain exactly the same except for the word 'bitcoin'.
But yeah, keep throwing those downvotes this way illiterates.

Nope,  never tempted.  I follow bitcoin for the bat shit insane types it tends to attract.  Buttcoin posting quality has indeed been on the decline this last year.   But there are a few gems every now and again.  I'm in it for the laughs.

The average person doesn't give a shit about sending money to Zimbabwe or saving the merchants money on fees or handing their personal info over to strangers when they do it willingly on Facebook.   They want to spend their money period.

That doesn't exist.

That's the problem with  this sub.  Valid criticisms are met with a torrent of downvotes and you are labeled as a banker or someone that uses dogecoin for some reason.   I don't hate bitcoin because that makes no sense what I do hate is the circlejerk community that lives in some bubble outside of reality.  I've said it before there are good posters on here and my tone is drastically different when I'm talking to someone such as yourself.  The people that get the attitude and snarkiness are the ones that live in the bubble.

When their price was floating 200 bucks above everyone else this sub couldn't be pried off Gox's tit with a crowbar.  Any post talking bad about them would be met with a torrent of down votes.  As soon as their price tanked this sub started acting like Gox's bullshit was some kind of new act. Now all of the sudden Gox is the antichrist.

It doesn't but I think we all know it's going to be right up there on release. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:55:50
You actually need a believeable premise to  have a debate.   The morons claiming bitcoin is going to be worth a bajillion dollars each might as well start claiming everyone will ride unicorns in the future.   There's no debating fanaticism.  Not only that most people don't want to debate while typing on a phone.

Steve Stockman has a campaign that has no chance of winning.  He knows it, we know it.  Why not make a last grasp effort and siphon off a bit of free publicity while bitcoin is enjoying a bit of media spotlight.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:33:57
I don't know the fact that bitcoin rockets or craters at random whenever someone farts?
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:24:27
See that's the problem.  Libs have this thing where they assume for some reason that everyone is a rational actor when it just isn't true.  Just because you leave people alone doesn't mean some crazy asshole isn't going to rape and murder you just because he feels like it. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:33:35
This sub is full of people that doesn't do shit but wait for other people to fix problems or innovate.   So join the party. Grab your coins and wait to become the new 1%.

What idiot hides their money under their bed instead of investing it?  The point of controlled inflation is to motivate people to use their money in some fashion not horde it.

It will cause people to buy bitcoin much in the same way that seeing the Discover symbol causes people to cancel their Visa and get a Discover card.

Nope that sounds like your average bitcoiners train of thought.

Just because some moron goes through with it doesn't change the fact that it's still a retarded idea.

Someone in this sub went to NK and was giving people bitcoin.   I told them that those people were executed or put in a labor camp but noooo bitcoin was going to make great leader see the light.

Oh right I forgot each bitcoin was going to be worth eleventy billion dollars in the future.

Be sure to run your wallet on a 1994 dell that has never been hooked up to any network and only runs some tiny linux distro no one has ever heard of.  Once done be sure to epoxy any ports you won't be needing such as the ethernet port.  The next step will be to locate a secured underground bunker preferably at least a couple of miles out into the wilderness.  
Bury the laptop in a 400 pound steel safe in your underground bunker.  Install a complete security system with motion detectors, sound and temperature sensors.  I also run a full biometric scan to even enter the facility . Fingerprint, eyescan, saliva, and dna test.  
When you know that bitcoin is not only going to the moon but going to plow through every planet and celestial body in the solar system like it was Sephiroth's final summon, then there is no end to the amount of effort you should put into securing your guaranteed future trillions.

They don't even have to run they could just claim they were hacked,  make an apology, and the idiots would still line up to hand over their money.

You would think they would be kind of used to that by now.

Well since normal money can do all of those it would probably be best to focus on all of the them. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:37:01
They were selling them at a 17% markup to an agent that told them he was using it to buy stolen credit cards.
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:33:10
Perfect comparison. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:30:09
Only in the land of bitcoin would attacking your own network even be considered.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:15:31
This is a good idea we could all use a repository of laughs. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 11:47:19
Yeah because there isn't a consistent history of the foundation being involved in criminal activity right? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:49:01
That's ok no need to put you out just give us the store number instead so someone can just call and verify.  Sounds pretty simple.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:35:43
The bitcoin community is convinced that anything that happens is a buying opportunity.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:40:59
Now we just have to wait a couple of years for it to be invented. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:06:16
It must be tough for bitcoiners having separate restrooms and water fountains. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:12:04

You can make $10 fast in just 5 minutes you know. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:12:46
What a tool. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:13:04
Or we could just go with the obvious choice that no one was using it. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:46:22
It can be done but if blizz were to find out you can kiss that account goodbye
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:49:48
1/3 of an acre.  Should be able to put a beautiful garden shed on that property.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:09:13
You could probably get her a toy too.
@_date: 2014-04-19 12:21:00
It should replace @_date: 2014-12-21 19:13:56
What a surprise coming from the guy who tried initiating a penny stock pump and dump. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:14:16
You left a little bit on your chin. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:34:58
I don't think it can beat the minecraft theory but I would love to hear about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:29:25
If you had so many choices why did you skimp on the one part you aren't supposed to skimp on? 
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:05:04
They could but since it's not going to get them media attention or raise the price of their coin it isn't going to happen
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:34:56
Nothing personal but I hope that bot becomes sentient and somehow kills you. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:40:20
If true i wouldn't doubt this "hack" was just an excuse to run off with the money they already have.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:51:26
At least the doge users have one foot in reality.  Can't say the same for actual furries . 
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:25:09
Even more fun is 90% will be mined in the next 5 years.  98% over the next 10. The remaining 100+ years will be for scraps
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:16:26
That's the joke. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:03:24
Nearly everyone in buttcoin will tell you the protocol does have some value.  Your coins are worthless though, sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:20:19
Is it going to turn me into a bazillionaire from me doing nothing but putting some change into it? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:59:43
"jumped by tens of percent." and then what happened?
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:27:44
Sounds like a generic blow off answer to me.   Hi will you accept payment in bacon?   Sure that's an option we could consider in the future. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:55:40
But daaaaaaaad all the other kids are doing fun projects! 
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:30:13
The fun part will be how much they bring in from real customers in a week or so, after this post drops off into obscurity and she is no longer getting random "tips".
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:05:44
It would be way easier to ban the assholes from the store.
@_date: 2014-01-04 13:24:34
From their laundering operation. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:07:01
Stop spreading facts u dislike.   I'm sure he walks the path of Christ.   I know for a fact he does because I saw him sing the 'I can change' song from South park.   No way in the world he cares about the price.   What? He does?  I can't hear you lalalalalala. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:36:40
So basically he is a good shill? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 12:28:39
If you wanted to take a 6 month vacation you should have just done that. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:29:24
He isn't going to make money regardless.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:59:17
I don't see how it could possibly get any easier short of reading your mind.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:04:24
They probably won't be able to keep them in stock for a few weeks but I'm going to suggest a fleshlight.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:48:11
Probably because cause they are a scam. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:39:53
My karma in this sub would suggest otherwise sorry if I don't jump into every circlejerk this sub tries to get going. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:44:14
What if...
Bruce Wayne was going to accept bitcoin at Wayne Enterprises.
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:02:56
Nope, nothing against bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:58:32
That's a 2011 reprint of a 1998 card.
@_date: 2014-06-26 11:44:26
Have to find a bright side somewhere I guess.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:40:13
Even funnier is when he was saying nothing was wrong at Gox right up until it went bust. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:59:18
He was asking about bitcoins though not gift cards. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:58:59

If people put 50% of their money in to anything the price would go up. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:20:21
So you don't like the fact that I don't participate in this subs circlejerks and you decided to just mosey into this topic and try to bring up post history.   OK hypocrite. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:39:30
This community would follow Satan straight to hell if there was a chance it would raise the value of their coin a few cents. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:32:53
Oh but your honor it wasn't theft, we were hacked you see.  How were we to stop them from getting away with all the bitcoin?
Believe me I know that Gox is nothing but a giant tank of bullshit but this thread we have here is the exact shit they will try to pull.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:48:03
It apparently isn't just bitcoin going up up up.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:49:28
If this album is any indication he should have paid us to download it.

Hey at least it doesn't require semen and blood samples right?
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:38:14
I'm interested in getting paid where do I apply? Do the banks and NSA just advertise on Craigslist or what? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:57:37
This thread has convinced me that no one in this sub lives in reality. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:23:42
This is it.   This is the next great bitcoin catalyst. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:19:15
@_date: 2014-07-20 12:06:03
To thank them? They should be thanking us for keeping them in business. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:48:15
I love how bitcoin is always compared to successful ventures.   You never hear oh but people laughed at the Segway or people laughed at the Ford Edsel. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:03:02
What is it like being completely deluded? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 01:16:11
What year do you graduate high school?
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:38:13
Dude we were telling people for well over a year that Gox was a scam and Everytime it was met with downvotes and bitturds defending them.  So fuck everyone that lost money in Gox they brought it on themselves.

"The foundation is involved in digital money but unlike Bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money. In Kenya M-pesa is being used for almost half of all transactions. Digital money has low transaction costs which is great for the poor because they need to do financial transactions with small amounts of money. Over the next 5 years I think digital money will catch on in India and parts of Africa and help the poorest a lot." -Bill Gates

No idea but he was pretty pissed with the way the bitcoin community was acting when he vanished.   It's only gotten worse so no  wonder he never came back. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:34:52
Amazing.   There had to have been at least $20-$30 traded around. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:27:15
So technically you are receiving donations in fiat and the processor accepts bitcoin.  Are you going through coinbase?
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:43:43
No but I think that maybe you should consider asking for one on your front lawn. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:35:27
Won't stop this sub from posting it 900 times today though. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:19:27

@_date: 2014-07-23 19:40:50
I concur.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:48:42
Well people are always whining about Wikipedia not accepting bitcoin so there should be plenty of people willing to donate and create a new bitcoin wiki. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:16:58
A bitcoiner consumed and driven by nothing more than greed. Next your going to tell me the KKK hates non-white people.

I wasn't going to buy that 2 headed dildo because the statement would have went to my moms e-mail account after I used her CC.  But thanks to bitcoin I no longer have to worry about that problem.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:44:04
Yes. There's always some dumbshit that thinks he will be a millionaire by mining with a GPU.  You should be able to get a nice upgrade

I'm a wow billionaire maybe we can get together and both pretend to be rich.  I'll have an easier time cashing out though. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:55:00
Yeah there are no starving children or anything that need the money let's give it to some  autistic sperglord so he can buy more trains for his mom's basement.

Chinese new year is gonna be some fun shit.
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:23:18
Oh?  Did you take the class? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:44:28
Probably shouldn't have used a lawyer that accepted bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:56:57
Atlas Fawkes? Is that you? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:56:08
Scam them off other people. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:03:44
They decided to replace one form of spamming with another I guess. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:02:40
So what exactly do you hope to accomplish here other than bring attention to yourself? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:16:31
Manta e-mails see more spam boxes than human eyes.

These assholes won't resign until they slip up and the laundry list of bullshit, scams, and illegal activity are brought into the light like their other buddies. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:51:26
Other subs don't have entire web pages dedicated to the stupid shit they say and do. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:55:07
Bitcoin is pretty smart.  So smart in fact that I have to create a topic on an internet forum asking how I get paid with it without fucking myself over.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:34:35
Hope you are ready to buy a new hard drive. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:03:38
So it was just randomly rejected? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:00:39
Lol the daily mail. Jesus Christ dude why didn't you just link The Onion. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:55:02
This is exciting, it won't be much longer until that 12 months gets pushed out a bit further.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:05:51
No, the problem is he doesn't have a case and no one is stupid enough to take it without him paying beforehand.  But really who cares this guy was caught as a scammer yesterday so you are defending nothing.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:45:57
Bitcoin happened.
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:18:22
The community
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:46:49
Pro tip: No one gives a shit.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:19:01
Do this little expirement. Go up to a random stranger tell them to buy a bitcoin and sit on it and they will become a millionaire.  See how serious they take you. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:02:30
This makes me laugh so hard every time. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:50:56
No I think it has more to do with being a single 4 page long paragraph. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:57:36
Yeah if anything it should be re-purposed to randomly visit other subs and evangelize for bitcoin and maybe throw fractions of a penny at them.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:50:54
How dare you question our Lord and saviors divine plan. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:00:35

@_date: 2014-04-13 22:01:13
Yeah go learn about something that might not even come to fruition. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:47:15
Bet none of that money Thermos got went to putting that up. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:27:48
In that case all he has to do is make about 50 tip worthy posts and he has it covered.
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:49:00
Breaking news. Man heavily invested in thing says thing will succeed. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:35:02
What about his right? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:10:57
Probably because they are heavily invested in Bitchrist and it makes them cry inside whenever someone slights their savior? Just like any other cult. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:45:00
So yeah nothing since the launch of Ultima Online.  I guess if you count the massive failure of Tabula Rasa he has sort of done something in the last decade 
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:57:58
Psst the scammers are coming from inside the house. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:57:12
For one I wasn't wrong.  He told me a species of ant as if that mattered at all concerning weather if it was a drone or not.

It will be a tiger direct gift card. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:20:32
The stoners finally don't have to jump through as many hoops to buy their weed and  along comes bitcoin to bring some more hoops back 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:18:10
They love to spout things that are utter and complete bullshit.  Anonymous, no fees, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:13:34
If you love it so much then why don't you marry it. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:52:28

@_date: 2014-02-23 21:50:41
This doesn't even make sense. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:52:51
She obviously didn't have a problem cashing those SSI checks. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:43:20
This is one of the shittiest communities on the net so not very likely. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:24:50
Maybe, but that's not what happened.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:04:14
Yeah he will totally go for giving up his sponsor and shit loads of cash so he could get some pocket change worth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:04:40
You realize Google wallet can pull directly from your bank account correct?
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:07:30
There is a bitcoin kickstarter site that has seen a whopping zero projects funded.   If the nerd niche can't even fund video games I doubt they will fund science. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:19:12
This is better than a wallet how? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:54:02
Yeah if you want to wait days or weeks for confirmations you can pay no fees. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:40:45
No they didn't. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:47:34
No reason for you to lie also no reason for anyone else to bother that poor manager.   We don't need this to become the next battletoads. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:27:19
My favorite part was how this circlejerk of a sub was drowning him in downvotes when he made that post. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:13:31
I'm the guy that thinks only "money"  is required to launder money. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:14:36
Pretty sure they unfroze and reanimated Walt Disney and he said they wouldn't accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:51:09
Like every other legit problem and concern with bitcoin however the community will just handwave it away and claim that some other unknown person in the unknown future will somehow fix the problems. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:47:21
First and foremost of course is how did he pronounce doge? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:09:42
Everyone sees 'zero conclusive evidence'  of the bitcoin foundations legitimacy. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:08:48
Your surprised no one is buying newspapers?  A form of media currently on its deathbed?  Even discounting that why would you pay to use a website when you could get the same info from literally thousands of other sites for free?
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:22:57
I don't think this sub has the first clue about government one minute  they tell us the government is coming to murder us and take all our shit and the next they say the government can't do anything. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:37:03
Yeah it is to put more money in their pocket.  Not sure why you guys think that accepting bitcoin is going to suddenly cause companies to not try and nickle and dime you to death
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:09:51
You don't care if I believe you or not so why even bring it up other than to try and impress someone?  As far as pocket change goes you are  right it is pocket change but I would bet you I use far less electricity and make far more than these dumbshits mining on gpus and shitty eruptors.  I also really don't care if it "ruins the game" for people.  You said it yourself it's a fucking video game.   Now you are going to white knight all those people that should stop playing video games and do something better with their life? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:06:18
Bitcoin.  Inventing solutions for problems that don't exist. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 13:56:26
Fleshlight was the first item to sell out when they started taking bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:23:24
You won the game! 
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:21:58
No I just don't feel like spending my next month citing examples.   I just thought a mod of this sub would suffice. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:04:00
Not to be an asshole or anything but a bit more proof would go a long way.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:36:00
Translation: no
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:48:28
Then those people go wherever they want and buy things and aren't just limited to beef jerky and e-cigs. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:31:38
Few years I guess, haven't kept track.  And from the hundred or so of unclaimed tips probably about 8 cents worth.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:13:29
One will send you nothing, the other will send you shitty equipment which will break within a week and if you are lucky won't burn your house down.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:50:36
Oh right I forgot calculating hashes were curing cancer or solving complex scientific algorithms...oh wait that's right they aren't.  It's just what I said.  Busy work,
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:16:47
Now if they can just convince grandma to jump through a few more hoops.
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:28:03
That's the good side as well.  The other side is much worse. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:14:36
This is a great idea hopefully it can keep this sub clear of all the stupid "oh hi my used dildo shop now accepts bitcoin" 
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:31:17
Why am I not surprised that teaching a child about bitcoin was compared to religious indoctrination. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:37:02
Yes we know, close enough for it to get some press yet far enough away to back out when they realize they are complete fucking idiots.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:38:03
It is to show you how much of a "fee" this community charges to do an in person transaction. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:50:43
Well there are way more people that use WoW gold so it would probably be a better option.
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:45:36
Take preorders from a bunch of gullible people.  Mine on the preordered hardware for months and then finally ship out the unit.  Profit.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:25:26
They are essentially the cheapest and shittiest manufacturer of motherboards.  I imagine they are probably another company in financial trouble that that needs a decent media boost so sure why not. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:41:07
Yeah because had this been a banker we all know you would have been vehemently defending him as you are Shrem.  Witch hunt indeed. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:26:48
Or in this case, FYGY.
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:53:57
Take your computer and throw it in the garbage you will save more money that way. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:07:01
And...no picture of said ad?
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:37:25
Maybe, it's hard to tell around here when literally everything that happens is "good for bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:28:01
14 hours for a whole 30 bucks? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:59:19
Look at that wealth being evenly distributed.  That looks pretty fair to me.
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:07:20
Hey pal that lunch money is enough for tens of thousands of tips in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:17:10
Run a ponzi and advertise it as such. There will be plenty of idiots lining up to give you their money
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:59:56
There's pretty much no way in hell I'm wading through the shit stream of to find that.  Stick around new for a couple of weekends and you can see it with your own eyes.  The front page is just a titty flash of the craziness you will see in there. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:51:21
Nah he would say bling it on. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:18:53
Next time maybe read the paper you are signing? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:10:01
Paging Shrem.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:24:58
Your more likely to see the heat death of the universe this same question is posted at least ten times a day and has been explained many many times.  Bitcoin has a lot of faults but this is not one of them. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:08:28
Hit a new high what? 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:45:02
Probably not.  RES might be of use to you.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:58:02
A lot of the people in this sub heard of Moores law and think it literally means everything gets twice as good every 18 months. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:29:23
This was what I was looking for. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:16:14
Both groups are equally incompetent.  Both think they are smarter than they are and both make perfect targets for scamming. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:58:37
No one ever said it was. Then again no one ever said it wasn't either.  Blizzard did however state wow gold is only for use in game. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:24:37
Yeah there's also no fees* and it's super easy to use*. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:41:58
I was referring to the word mark as in someone your  would scam.  Not mark the name. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:43:50
Why would they need to buy more coins to get out the ones they Gox already has hostage? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:17:57
More like BFL shows up to CES with more bullshit to lure in the suckers and idiots. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:23:19
Do we really need the moon crashing into earth? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:10:07
Or your brain apparently. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:30:18
The $100 drop in price btc had an hour ago.
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:27:54
Yeah there was no war at all before government or fiat.  Everyone lived in peace.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:25:50
You conveniently forgot this one.
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:35:04
I wonder how many people are going to be excuted now? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:05:31
Why would he go somewhere for a real debate when he can stay in his nice and safe sub and participate in the echo chamber.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:42:56
The great Wall of text. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 13:32:17
Seriously if you are comparing efficiency bitcoin doesn't even come close to the bank system.  Do you have any idea what you are talking about? 
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:05:39
Ha! Good one.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:56:01
Sending all my money immediately! 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:21:12
Bitcoin meetings filled with misogynistic asshole neckbeards?  Why I never!
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:33:01
You should worry more about your own community fucking each other over.  They cause more damage than any "outsider"  could ever hope. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:24:43
Like the guy that calls the homeless "criminals and assholes" is going to have any transparency. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:07:45
Wut 
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:39:28
Fuck you got mine.
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:33:48
You are going to need a full time staff in order to keep up. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:55:41
Yeah a currency that won't be bitcoin if we use your example. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:48:11
No, you're confused.  No one gives a shit what YOU did.
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:15:14
Uh... Why? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:18:10
Blackberry has been garbage for at least a decade.   
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:44:42
Maybe he was exaggerating a bit.  He should have said that virtually no one shops there, like K-mart or Sears.
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:01:17
He is a low card heel he doesn't make nearly as much as you think. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:59:47
This sub really loves to bring up the strawman fallacy and generally seem to have no idea what the fuck it means.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:19:03
Yeah I'm pretty sure whoever is overseeing this investigation doesn't give two shits what wants or thinks. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:51:30
Transfer a Satoshi out of that wallet. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:11:21
Dayton beat Syracuse yesterday and Obama farted in the shower. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:11:30
It's 1 AM and I never claimed to be immune from the stupidity either. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:47:25
I haven't seen too many yard sales with stolen credit cards up for sale.
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:16:55
Don't be mistaken that quivering isn't fear it's him trying to hold in the laughter. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:17:34
This is it ladies!  Look how far you have come. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:14:26
Also be sure to jump into any van with a stranger offering candy. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:23:41
Go give and homeless guy a penny and watch his reaction.   Now go give him the same thing but make him jump through multiple hoops to claim that penny.   If it isn't worth their time why the hell would it be worth ours? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:24:48
Don't forget the links to the cp. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:47:40
Yeah it's called block rewards.
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:23:11
With the way his career is going and after being sent back to developmental he needs all the help he can get. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:58:13
I'd imagine he was just trying to be creative and use it as a word for transfer.  Looking at the rest of the song, this is most likely the case.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:41:18
Go find a post with someone talking about addiction,  replace whatever drug they are talking about with bitcoin and post it in this sub.  Guarantee no one would even notice. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:26:40
Joke is on you.  When you return your broken shit are you going to get store credit?  Hell no you're just gonna have to get your money back and like it.

It's just NFC which has been on most Android phones for awhile. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:54:35
After taking miner subsidies into account how much is it per transaction again?
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:49:01
They already bought the phones how exactly did they stick it to Apple? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:05:26
FYI Sacramento is the next most likely team to either move cities or collapse completely. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:03:09
Well at the rate they are being busted it wouldn't be all that surprising. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:49:23
How so?  You guys good buddies or something?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:25:28
That's not a crash that's just the weekly "price correction".
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:03:23
They forgot to mention the links to the child porn. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:15:38
I'm here laughing not making headline worthy topics. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:14:10
Well you forgot that bitcoins will be worth about 7 million dollars each by the end of the year.  So he is actually shooting a bit low as overstock should be bringing in about the entire global economy before the year finishes out.
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:43:10
That would include the actual BFL site. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:16:23
I'm sure you will totally get a fair and balanced reply in @_date: 2014-01-24 16:52:16
MtGox is shit and most likely a scam. So possibly never?
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:50:18
I guess this sub should stop using it so often then. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:26:30
How is this PayPal's fault?  It seems to me it's more the fault of the shitty scamming bitcoin community.   I guess PayPal was mind controlling these guys when they were putting in charge backs. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:03:59
If it weren't for bitcoin then nothing would exist. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:57:11
Not really, the people that actually pull a profit from mining already know how to acquire their equipment.  Tigerdirect is only marketing to all the idiots who see bitcoin on tv and think they are going to be millionaires by buying shitty gpu's and outdated, shoddy mining equipment. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:03:38
That's generally how word shortening works so yes.
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:45:01
And just like the restaurant that made their employees wear QR codes on their shirts, this place will see a couple of tips/donations until this drops off the front page and then they won't get a single satoshi.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:43:08
What about the donations given to Theymos ? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:04:27
He should have played pacify on his attacker and he could have avoided being put in the graveyard 
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:22:14
Better idea have BFL sponsor it and watch as it bursts into flames after 2 laps.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:56:40
1 customer in 4 months.  No slowing this train!
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:55:51
What? 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:38:31
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:59:01
If by quickly you meant the second they opened their doors then yeah.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:34:29
It's Tuesday.
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:46:10
No one ever said it was illegal I'm just saying maybe you should brush up on your reading comprehension.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:16:06
Spot the guy that doesn't have a girlfriend. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:24:29
Bitcoiners calling altcoins a cult is pretty damn funny. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:37:45
There has been many stories in this sub about people going to visit a coinmap business and they no longer accept bitcoin or never accepted it in the first place.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:51:44
Just because you haven't met one doesn't mean they don't exist.   I've never met a leper but I know they are out there. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:09:51
^ Captain obvious
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:24:51
The problem is that 99% of this sub is only here to become the new 1%.  They don't give a shit about the protocol or anything other than the price of their coin.  
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:09:08
That btc was cashed out immediately.  There was some idiot on here who thought he was chasing the actual coins but it ended up being some exchanges wallet. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:22:56
It sounds as if of have an unhealthy infatuation with this other person.   Is it part of the reason you are where you are? 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:32:10
You guys are lucky you thought to register as a business before all this went down. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:33:00
That's the thing though the overdraft and maintenance fees aren't hidden in the fine print they are front and center and literally impossible to miss. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:13:10
:/ He got his tinfoil hat out for nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:31:31
That "customer" is a douchebag. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 11:38:10
I guess if you operate under the false assumption that buttcoiners are in it for anything other than the comedy.
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:25:54
Stating fact and being an ass are in fact not even remotely close to being the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:32:20
No idea.  I tend to avoid the children's subs. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:02:36
"What you envision will become a reality soon if someone hasn't done it already."
Should be the rallying cry for this sub.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:00:13
Playing friends off each other.  You are a perfect fit for this community. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:36:39
Yeah I'm sure all their buddies aren't first on that list to be paid back. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:10:50
That's great news for the none of us at CES.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:35:49
Your friend should have also told you that no one likes a begger.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:33:23
Woah there.  This is an ideas sub not one where anything of importance actually gets done. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:43:30
Since when is the mainstream media the voice of public opinion.  If the TV is your only interaction with the community then I could understand but again no one was saying the Internet was a passing fad outside of a few clueless people in the msm. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:53:13
I was referring to
"They can't ban it if they want to sell it."
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:45:14
As opposed to just fleeing the country?  What other options are there? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:43:08
Good luck raising that 500k for a tiny sticker that no one can see without a magnifying glass. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:50:16
They aren't going to report bad news. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:01:10
There are no subversive forces. this community  posts the same shit over and over and eventually a few of the turds float to the top. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:19:43
They are literally smashing their phones because they can't use their Internet money and yet there is more to life than money..... Ok
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:03:41
With bitcoin being notorious for being rife with scams and cons why do you feel that no further regulation is required?
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:17:20
Except for the ones that stop accepting it right? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:20:35
It's one of the best subs for pure comedy. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:31:01
Shouldn't the title be "Why Cryptocurrency is here to stay."?
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:42:17
As this will only delay or rush said customer to not buying from Overstock again.
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:45:40
Well they definitely have a longer legal history regarding shady business practices that's for sure.  Perfect company to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:59:14
There are going to be a lot of excited hands and grooms in here. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:34:37
Except that isn't even close to accurate. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:10:20
I dont have any opinion on tulipfutures. I'm not in the habit of stalking other users. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:34:44
Already in the wiki
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:24:52
Or you could just adopt the standard bitcoin mentality of FYGM.
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:05:54
Murder 95% of the BTC community.  You really won't find a bigger bunch of misogynistic assholes.
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:12:34
Sending you all of my money now. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:51:30
Right, so next time I see a Japanese person I will ask them if they are a samurai and if they own a Katana. I'm sure they will have a good laugh. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:15:00
No charge backs lol
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:31:29
The call is coming from inside the house! 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:05:54
Samsung doesn't provide that service. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:26:49
You are going to fit in around here just fine. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:16:25
I still invest in beanie babies.  One day they will rise again.  :(
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:45:29
Old news is old. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:48:49
Oh another asshole trying to get a pump and dump going.   The stupid shit in this sub never seems to end.. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:50:19
No I don't underestimate a vast majority of grannies.  Anything short of sending them them to a week long bitcoin and basic computer course is just asking for disaster. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:38:47
They will still be assembled by a kid in middle school.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:12:36
TIL we should give credit to people for writing shitty and sloppy code.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:24:31
They didn't mention it being easier than Applepay or anything else because it would have just been a lie.  Bitcoin doesn't make anything easier. It's an extra step in the chain of sending money to vendors. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:39:51
Apple probably does have the best computing experience if you know nothing about computers. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:04:14
Community rules:
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:22:11
I'm all for you guys attacking your own coin. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:08:32
Don't these people realize that the proper mining case is a milk crate with a few fans zip tied to the side.  Shitty and/or non existent cases is the bitcoin way. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:24:14
Now how is this sub gonna pretend to be persecuted by Apple? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:56:50
Not bad looking but smart watches were dead out of the gate. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:13:17
But then the circlejerk to real post ratio will drop like a stone. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:25:20
Lol bailouts
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:29:40
Because most of this sub is full of get rich quick asshats. Most are so scared about their Internet monies going down in price they will lash out at anything they perceive as a threat. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:08:58
What do you expect from a guy that allows ads for ponzies on his forum or who took donations for a forum upgrade years ago,  claimed to have hired some devs to work on the site months ago and still has nothing to show for it.   At this point I'm expecting the holodeck to be unveiled as the bitcointalk replacement. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:52:32
Do you and the rest of this sub use the same dated book of insults? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:58:25
Oh boy we should start an online petition too. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:04:24
No you still need a team that places somewhere higher than last in the division. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:20:48
The number of people that care only about a profit and not the bitcoin ideology is much much higher. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:30:07
Because its not being used for its intended purpose. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:29:01
In what way is it too late? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:10:49
Yeah that amazon 1 click buying button is pretty difficult.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:00:46
No this is a "service" in the free market.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:56:56
Guys this Nigerian prince is offering me millions of dollars. Does this sound like a good investment opportunity? 
@_date: 2014-09-26 14:16:00
It's like saying train tracks have value but the handcar you use on it is useless, yes.
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:56:02
Are you really comparing some regulation to segregation and homosexual bigotry? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:22:20
Definitely not serious. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:51:27
A vast majority of people don't travel the world. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:37:44
That's a steal considering each coin will be selling for 30 million bucks any day now
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:11:23
You know what else we should do.  Boycott gasoline for a day.  That will show em.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:44:28
Difference would be the the lady would just call the bank and let them know and any fraudulent charges would have been reversed as opposed to just getting your shit stolen. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:05:53
That or just leave the exchanges alone and let the criminals continue running them into the ground like they are already doing. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:52:42
If someone is buying a used iPhone they are obviously on a budget and if the phone they want isn't available they would just buy another model.  Why do you assume that they will buy an iPhone come hell or high water?

As the joke goes.  What do they call Hunger Games in France? 
Battle Royale with cheese.

Not really it's just semantics.  Both groups have the delusion that their coin is going to break out of their niche and take over the economy.  When at best they could hope for is to have as many users as a decent mmo. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:14:35
Nah doge is just as stupid as bitcoin.  It's basically two sides of the same coin.

So is the person who pulled this "prank" in police custody?
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:05:49
No one ever claimed you did.  Not all bitcoiners are shit either.  There are a few good critical thinking individuals in this sub such as the op.  The problem is panning through the shit river trying to find these individuals. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:08:28
Well see merchants will be so excited you are paying with bitcoin they will gladly give you a 66% discount
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:50:09
The real question is who will rate the bitcoin foundation?

The same people that buy fleshlights on Overstock with bitcoin I suppose.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:04:49
Well they need to pay off that fine for bullshitting their prices somehow.

@_date: 2014-02-16 18:24:08
Yeah well he wouldn't have been able to buy 90% of that shit with bitcoin so there is that.

Is that it?  Some bullshit story about how you are sooooo rich.   You aren't fooling anyone.   Who the fuck has to play wow to make money?  You do realize there is an amazing technology known as botting.  The difference between me and you is that I don't pretend my Internet money makes me one of the financial elite.

Yeah I remember hearing this same spiel with Gox last year.  Funny how that turned out.
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:36:16
Yeah because no one ever gets scammed when it's just btc involved.
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:59:32
As with most people in the bitcoin community it isn't about helping bitcoin it's about making yourself richer.   Sometimes the two mutually coincide. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 12:52:30
What does that have to do with anything?  
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:11:38
You just said the players had to bring bitcoin with them.  No one in their right mind is going to spend 5 digits for mining hardware so basically you have to spend money on bitcoin in order to play the game. You say you can sell shit on the ah for bitcoin but as someone who bots multiple auction houses I can tell you the only people that will get rich are the people that are already barons.  A normal person doesn't make shit on the ah.

No I'm not wrong.  I just know it's useless to argue in the echo chamber.

Of course trying to convince them how much revenue they are going to get is going to be virtually impossible.  Just look at that restaurant from a few weeks ago that made their waitresses wear stupid QR code shirts for tips.  Everyone was claiming how much money they were going to rake in and the one waitress got a few tips from redditors but as soon as it dropped off the front page she hasn't seen a single satoshi since.

It isn't like bitcoin is free. The only people who will aquire it is the same people you are bitching about.  The guys that already have the money and power are the ones who would buy it up in bulk.  Righteously obtained... Ok

Gee why wouldn't he show up to accept an award no one has heard of? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:11:19
I for one think banks should have a wider variety of flavors of lollipops. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:20:14
Because someone hasn't tried shoehorning bitcoin into it yet.
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:52:27
I don't remember Obi-wan spreading malware.  Also he looks a bit more like helmetless Vader than anything. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:13:37
Yeah this is all your fault for using the exchange that the bitcoin community sucked off up until the second the price dropped below the other exchanges 
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:12:55
Why not the bitcoin community  is all about stealing old lame ass ideas.  Look at the stupid honey badger shit for instance. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:11:04
Breathing is the only real requirement for a bitcoiners dream girl. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:16:35
You're leaving out the part where the guys selling the bitcoins is selling to an agent that straight up told him he was using it to buy stolen credit cards.
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:51:23
Myself and many others would tell that website to go fuck itself and go elsewhere.

Chicago has some of the most strict gun control laws in America yet it's the murder Capitol of the country.   Washington DC also has strict gun laws and is right behind Chicago  in murder.   Please explain to me again how gun control is good?

I don't think Facebook likes is in any way a valid metric for usage.

Cool, now I guess all wikileaks has to do now is, well, actually do something.

I would love to meet the financial genius that decided to invest in bitcoin because they saw the news reporting on some old man who liked to play with toy trains. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:47:08
Only the spergs. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:11:59
He vanished because the community was becoming an embarrassment that's why we should leave him alone. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:20:58
I don't think that word means what you think it means. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:49:47
herp derp you arent paying 40 dollars in fees its spread out through the network who cares herp derp.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:10:40
The fact that you have replied to him like 4 times already shows that you do in fact care... A lot. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:22:46
is full of do nothing idea guys? Who knew? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:55:27
People don't own bitcoin and they certainly won't go to coinbase, sign all the form to get some just to buy shit.  Now what?
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:37:44
Breaking news. Guy invested in something believes that certain something is amazing.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:43:57
His attitude is the same as 95% of the people involved in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:46:27
Still no black Friday numbers?

Oh now we aren't going to be internet friends? :(

Anything that requires multiple pages to explain probably isn't for a 5 year old.

It's never "locked in" until the deal is done.  That's assuming you don't get scammed or just straight up robbed of course.

You should have evangelized to the minimum wage customer service a bit more.   Everyone knows that's how you get things done.

So I should have went with the Japanese samurai stereotype as per the op then?

Bitcoin save me from the difficulty!
@_date: 2014-08-20 01:42:10
Not knocking your idea but you're basically hoping to spread knowledge via people's laziness and ego.   People like the ice water thing because it requires zero effort zero money,  pads their ego a bit and let's them show off how altruistic they are.  An educational bitcoin video I don't think is going to fill that same niche for them. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:39:58
Yeah, if by interesting you mean theft.
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:19:03
Yeah but generate money from pirated movies how?  I don't understand how creating a bitcoin address and labeling it for a movie is going to cause people to stop pirating.

Holy shit it took long enough.  Couldn't happen to a better bunch of people. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:31:07
Just go take a look at their entry on wiki.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:08:28
85k businesses in the 50's was a much larger percentage of the market than it is today. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:58:59
So I would like to see an update from Mr.  Shattner on how that whole bitcoin thing is going. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:25:58
Most of the population would make the argument that bitcoiners make the best marks for scams because they think they are smart. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:51:12
You're the one inferring republicans have no comprehension you tell me.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:01:55
She never got offered in the first place.  Lily doesn't know the difference between Linden dollars, bitcoin,  isk, or WoW gold.   In this case she is confusing Linden dollars with bitcoin.

I think you meant to use  the 10 guy meme. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:27:05
It also apparently took days of research to figure out how to use. Because typing text into a box was such a massive undertaking for the uneducated moron. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:25:34
So if I had never used robocoin and someone steals my ID what is stopping them from claiming to be me? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:18:03
Because in this sub decentralized can mean anything you want it to mean. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:15:59
Gee I wonder what's going on? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:19:10
Yes that is exactly what happened.  Your carrier pushed the update on to you. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:08:18
Must have taken you awhile to come up with that one. You did it though, good job. You can resume licking Andreas balls now. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:45:28
Had they made available the app that they submitted for review it wouldn't have been removed.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:55:22
Try downloading more ram.

Hmm posting in Wonder what kind of responses we will see in here. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:26:54
Paying to beta test a game.   Could this sub possibly get any more retarded? 
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:18:24
Nope, you found the right circlejerk.
@_date: 2014-08-19 07:50:25
Yes this could definitely help those poor people.  Obviously the best way to get rid of remittances and fees is to instead charge a hefty markup. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:03:22
Don't forget North Korea has essentially banned the entirety of the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:35:58
There is a lot of stupid  thinking in this sub it isn't just related to taxes that's for sure. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:28:29
This sounds way more interesting than that lame bullshit living on bitcoin documentary. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:52:17
Did establishments stop splitting the bill on request? 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:52:57
Where is the part where they got scammed?
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:35:29
Any poor individual that can't "afford" justice.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:26:33
Because bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:13:33
Reword your topic to this.  "I found 20k worth of bitcoin. Should I throw away 3/4 of it?"
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:53:17
Good luck finding a whore the takes bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:32:15
That price is a joke right? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:15:02
That's the thing though.  He only claimed to block me.  Unfortunately in the end he couldn't overcome his own ego and was replying to me anyway. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:45:46
Hell at least you gave it to them, can't say that about 95% of the people in here.
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:26:18
Here is something that has nothing to do with bitcoin in any conceivable way so let's try to smear our Evangelical feces all over it anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:09:44
So basically everything. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:20:07
No I'm aware of how much this sub can donate when there is a chance it will get bitcoin some media recognition. I'm also aware how greedy it is when there isn't a media opportunity. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:52:32
Right but to the casual observer (the average joe that just wants to buy things) there is no difference.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:16:00
Hey pal.  There no place for facts in this here sub forum. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:17:30
Pin and chip is coming October 2015 in the US.   Guess we can cross that one off the list. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:58:10
And like the retailers currently accepting it I'm sure they are just top notch. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:59:41
Yeah this asshole may be a shitbag scammer.  But the good upstanding people of this sub will defend his scamming ass until the death only because he's pretending to go after the big evil paypal.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:16:10
Because bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:06:34
Jesus Christ dude, you might want to consider dusting.
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:40:21
Yeah the mainstream media is definitely a gauge on the overall public opinion.  Next are you going to link me some media pieces on how video games turn kids into trained killers? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:31:46
A crater. How appropriate. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:19:30
Nah no one in buttcoin hates bitcoin just its pants on head retarded community. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:06:21
Yeah be sure to come back and let us know how that turns out.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:39:24
Gox has been known to be full of crooks for ages.   The bitcoin foundation is full of douchebag banker types that everyone in here bitches about nonstop.   Fuck Gox and the bitcoin foundation. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:26:29
If this had been the creator of doge or whatever you would be hearing a completely different tune around these parts.  It's hipocracy at it's best.
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:08:09
Love the prepaid card ads.  They definitely know their market.  Just need a few cash for gold or payday loan ads and they will be set.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:08:17


BFL is the prime example for this.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:56:13
They can do that because they are a money laundering front.   But yeah sure bitcoin is the second coming of Christ. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:14:14
Why did you kill Harrys parents? 
@_date: 2014-11-15 14:06:45
You can buy hard drives that fit in the pci-e slot. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:58:09
Which is nowhere near as difficult as you make it seem.  That's what? Two pool operators? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:02:59
They removed it because the app they submitted for review wasn't the same as what they had for download.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:14:23
Just like everyone else.  Ideology and as a get rich quick vehicle. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:26:01
Welcome to the free market.  Those were "services"  the Gox provided. If you don't like them you are free to use another exchange.   Who needs regulation? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:16:36
Sounds like a lot of time invested for some couch change.
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:16:51
And now the circle is complete.
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:37:40
So he's saying it could fill the role as a money transmitter and beyond that not much else.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:41:19
But...but...but my karma.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:35
Who is going to arrest him? The bitcoin fund recovery task force?

Deploy the death blossom. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:55:34
Satoshi hasn't sang to anyone anyway in a long time
@_date: 2014-08-19 05:50:32
You must be new here.  Everything is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:05:29
If anyone thinks they do anything other than try to further their own agenda they are deluded. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:46:25
You must be new to bitcoin because this laugh train has been going for years and this year is shaping up to be the best yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:44:51
C) Have more than 2 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:40:17
People in this sub don't spend bitcoin they only horde them. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:19:49
He is right instead I should have just said "fuck you no one cares , how is this making my coins worth more? ". There is that a bit more in keeping with the spirit of this sub? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:28:18
Bitcoin is guaranteed to hit a billion per coin easily now. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:43:35
Sounds awfully familiar. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:34:34
Lies. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:42:58
Because haven't you heard in the future each bitcoin is going to be worth 75 bajillion dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:47:15
Sorry I just can't help myself. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:13:26
That's worth at least 15-20 cents.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:33:37
So easy it only took two paragraphs to explain. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:17:56
That will not get ratings/viewership.  No chance of that happening. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:56:28
You don't even know what  the word means tard222. What exactly am I shilling? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:11:15
Hello everyone I know we are here for the soon to be wife and groom but if  could just have an hour of your time to proselytize about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:52:57
I'd trust a banker over some unknown sperglord pool operator. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:39:27
It will stand out because we have a stake in bitcoin and we will will be loud, obnoxious, and try to shoehorn bitcoin into everything possible. Soon we will be the new 1%.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:11:49
Preparing for government assassination/blackmail/whatever is pretty rational I guess.
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:48:22
Your standard top notch BFL quality.  Seriously that entire board looks like it was put together as a high school project.  What a fucking joke.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:18:15
Since the media has the spotlight on this sperglord a few days the bitcoin community will try to piggyback on his 15 minutes to increase the value of their coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:26:43
The broken English was the first clue. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:39:08
They still make these?
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:29:14
No it will be the community 
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:33:58
I seriously want to know.  If people are ordering this stuff online for a 2x premium I don't see how a 10% discount in internet fun bux is going to help.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:06:39
So what your saying is that criminals don't give a shit about the law. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:43:22
They are vending machines.  Not sure why people keep calling them atms. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:55:03

@_date: 2014-01-04 22:29:25
Only if you call it douchecoin

Tell that to all the people stuck in Gox. lol
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:56:06
Your own tardbox community does more damage than any "troll"  could ever hope or dream. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:57:57
I just want to know how much he hates the bitcoin community now since it was them that pretty much made him throw his hands up in disgust and vanish. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:42:29
Good thing you were here to warn us.  We some how missed the other 700 posts about this. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:14:50
Was already at capacity before that was posted.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:05:27
Don't you have anything better to do than argue and try to dissuade people from posting here? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:47:33
Was day 6 and 10 single donations?   Also was day 6 the day you posted here last time? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:14:43
Oh I agree. I was just pointing out that they have said nothing at least twice now.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:57:18
They hate on Gox because now they are dragging down the average price.  There wasn't a problem with their lack of communication or any of the other bullshit they were pulling when it was $200 over the other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:28:32
Realities. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:36:32
You say that but it's literally been said in this sub.  Multiple times.  There are some bat shit insane people in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:28:52
Betteridge's law. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:25:31
Lol no they aren't. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:32:23
It's basically a protection racket.  Seriously look it up they pull some ridiculous shit.
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:14:16
Someone has made this post the last 2 years literally every week. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:20:06
Hi I'm the average bitcoiner and I will tell you anything you want to hear as long as it leads to pumping my investment. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 07:14:00
He seems to think that it takes more effort than closing your eyes clicking a random post in here and laughing. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:02:38

I doubt they are going to get overthrown by something that has less users than a small mmo. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:16:15
What if Obama decides to send drones to blow up my house because the government hates bitcoin so much.? 
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:16:41
That's the bitcoin way. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:52:00
That or he took comp 101.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:29:19
And what exactly is it they believe in?
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:28:40
No because that's just a waste of electricity. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:58:32
It's way easier for this sub to deflect on to other bullshit as oppose to trying to defend their own positions.
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:58:49
We have had multiple meet and greets in buttcoin talking about our various banker and three letter agency employers.  Now much of a conspiracy when it's literally out in the open.

Ver and gavin both are under investigation. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:14:53
You told him not to post it which is the same as ignoring the issue.  Out of sight out of mind right? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:53:08
Relief fund for morons. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:06:58
Why would that be a huge buy signal?  A company barely hanging on after amazon curb stomped them?  A company that just got fined for shady business practices?
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:38:02
Also how does this show he isn't anti-goverment?  
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:15:44
By saying someone else will fix it. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:09:56
Just FYI your landlord is most likely going to charge you for any outrageous power bills. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:14:06
It is a sunk cost but he was talking about a scenario where we had moved on from sha256 and this was the scenario I was playing in. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:00:12
They bought in.  That's it seriously. They have a stake in bitcoin's future so obviously it's nothing but up up up
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:02:17
Yeah it just sounds so likely and believable.
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:21:24
Replacing credit cards with laptops.  The future.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:56:26
50 cents?  I don't think we have those kind of big spenders around here. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:43:35
Hopefully,  it is a repackaging as you say.  I can't even remember the last time I saw him on TV.  Probably right before Ryback got surgery. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:28:17
I'm also like to point out the entire market always followed and reacted to Gox. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 09:35:28
The places that sell these "embarrassing" items already know people don't want it to be obvious on their statement .  You aren't going to see Bob's discount dildo emporium on your statement.  It will be under some generic nondescript name. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 12:32:58
It is one of the worst possible groups of people you could ever think of putting together. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:29:03
Pump and dump before the 31st.

2 cults one coin. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:22:53
Yes you will know the signs when someone starts talking about how bitcoin will bring about the end of human greed,  wars and disease. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:22:29
Yeah let's listen to the guy that said everything would be fine with Gox. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:57:07

Oh boy, more log charts. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:51:31
Sorry I should have said Libertarians.
@_date: 2014-08-22 21:48:49
So unaware that he handled all of this particular case personally.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:29:17
Neckbeard confirmed. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:56:16
A convicted felon spouting off a load of bullshit. Color me surprised. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:45:56
Long story short to make busywork and protect the network.  But if you read the front page you should see how that is working out.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:39:43
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:53:22
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:54:45
Nope but it's not too hard to look it up.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:10:21
A whole seven people.  I guess yeah that is pretty good for a form of media that is essentially on its deathbed.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:38:51
I'll trade you some farts in a jar for it. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:42:07
There were multiple threads yesterday with people wanting to airlift him out and shit. This is the kind of community you are dealing with.   A guy gets outed and the first thing bitcoiners want to do is chopper him away before the other bitcoiners try to murder him. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:59:14
Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:06:34
See that's the thing you think people are defending him when it doesn't even matter. Everyone else just blew him off. Bitcoiners are the ones that has the unhealthy infatuation with the guy. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 14:55:27
PGP... But with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:32:09
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:10:13
If by you people you mean the mainstream media then yeah. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:34:56
How would you rate the bitcoin consumer protections? 
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:11:46
No its not the logical equivalent or anything even remotely close.   Your comparing buying into a beta testing environment with hardware recommendations. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:35:48
He didn't ask about buying coins though he asked about setting up a server farm to mine and take 51% of the network. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:59:42
I don't have to know their lives.  Their crying because they can't use their Internet money on an apple product.  This isn't some huge mystery. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:29:09
Have you actually looked a trade volume the last few months?  No one  is buying anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:37:33
Yeah the cult thing isn't a joke unfortunately.  
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:13:41
They aren't subsidized enough already?
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:05:34
But they do have debit cards and the question still stands. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:14:23
So if everyone happens to switch over to bitcoin can you explain why a merchant would give a discount to use bitcoin?   Adoption rate means nothing. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:51:07

Tell them your time machine is in the shop for repairs. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:11:30
Funny how before the crash when Gox was 200+ above the other exchanges it was the go to price to quote for bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:50:14
Lol free market all the way until we get screwed then we want to run and beg the big bad government for help.
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:18:08
No I saw it.  Taco Bell didn't fit the joke however.

Hi I'm an idiot please send my stupid ass money.

Not sure if stupidity is a valid excuse for a right off.

Your advice is worth about as much as a fresh turd.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:10:29
Are you the bitcoin hall monitor? 
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:35:02
So basically you're just talking out of your ass. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:38:43
They submitted the real app for review as opposed to trying to pull one over on Apple.

How many people are realistically doing that? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:09:11
I really don't see anything in here that would be considered a possible solution to piracy. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:41:59
Yeah its almost like they have a stake in dark coin.  Kind of reminds me how bitcoiners post nothing but good news and downvotes anything else. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:34:05
You are one of the tragic few that has a head on their shoulders. A lot of these people are like children.  No matter how often you warn them they won't learn their lesson until they get burnt.   Even then you still have a few that just won't learn and keep sticking their hand in the flame. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:50:07
Making it awkward. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:33:00
It could be infinite and you would definitely avoid all the problems I previously mentioned.  I thought that you were talking about a finite resource to replace the standard mmo currency.

What is your point? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:10:17
Ok explain to me how all these poor people are going to get bitcoin and what stops the current wealthy from buying into bitcoin and becoming bitcoin rich.   Where does this transfer of power happen? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:50:54
Haven't you heard bitcoin ends human greed,  ends all wars and cures all diseases? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:21:04
Lol as if anyone in this sub has credibility. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:40:16
You'll have to ask the libs about that one.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:58:07
Nope but I'm willing to bet it states they can add new items to their terms which you can be rest assured it will be in there soon. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:44:21
We kind of figured that from the previous 60 posts on this.
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:55:57
So you failed to read the terms you agreed to.  Nothing we can do about it. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:22:37

Wow from calling for his head to sucking on his dick in the blink of an eye.  Amazing how fast attitudes change around here.

We need people that are not easily scammed?  How then is bitcoin ever going to progress past the small niche phase?  There are a lot of grandma's out there.

All of the obstacles to adoption with regards to bitcoin and it's totally the units of denomination and naming conventions that are keeping this rocket ship from reaching the moon.

My favorite part is how they portray him as a scumbag.

At that point though you have a whole lot bigger problems than what kind of money you are going to be using.  In the US anyway.

Oh thanks I wasn't 100% sure from the first hundred people that told us.

People would probably prefer not to have their battery completely dead after an hour.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:18:43
The tl:dr is that people would just hoard money and not spend.  You can't really have an economy if no one is buying anything other than necessities. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:28:09
I'm pretty sure he is just an alien wearing a human skin costume.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:50:31
Yeah this idea is what will cause bitcoin to break into the mainstream.  Nothing like making something as simple as a price display needlessly complicated and stupid. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:31:10
So is this your way of telling me this topic was created solely to try and start one of those famous circlejerks? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:04:49
Yeah convenience is such a terrible thing.   I know I just love going through a Rube Goldberg machine just to buy something.  The work I put in earning that money obviously wasn't enough.

@_date: 2014-01-10 00:00:34
I'm pretty sure it just rips the image from their latest post.
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:36:28
You make more money selling the shovels not digging for gold. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:57:32
Lol yeah like he is going to do anything but keep that money.  People have been bitching for ages and he will just handwave it away.  Thermos doesn't give a fuck what you or the bitcoin community wants. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:49:49
Do you really think people will stop using Adblock all for the chance at maybe getting a fraction of a penny? You would make more money per hour clipping coupons and redeeming them for their 1/1000 cent value. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 01:41:17
These people are heavily invested in bitcoin that alone is the reason nothing else could possibly overtake it.

Isn't this the guy that already has his seat pretty much guaranteed and doesn't even need donations? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 11:28:03


Sweet they can even accept buttcoin , WoW gold, and bacon.
This is good news and should increase adoption for all of these forms of payment.

Check out the documentary called Idiocracy.

It isn't just doge that thinks this community is shit it's pretty much everyone.

Like asking the the Wolf to watch over the sheep. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:24:51
Actually it's not proof of anything other than extending a promotion.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:35:25
It might be an embarassment to the tiny world of bitcoin but to everyone else it was just that. A prediction on a barely existing market.  
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:26:04
Just think how grossly undervalued it would be had the Gox bots not pumped the price back in November.
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:10:16
Yeah I'm sure it will be a top priority for them. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:23:30
Yeah I want to know how buying gift cards with Internet tokens is even remotely the same as buying something on credit. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:58:04
It's actually worse because at least carving something into the tree takes effort. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:21:54
What reason does your average Farmville player have to use bitcoin instead of the method they already have set up?  Can you really see grandma saying "Oh boy I can buy my pretend crops with bittycoins now!"

You guys realize he isn't talking about a space elevator, right?

Thieves usually don't give a shit what the victim wants. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:18:31
Clever is just another word for shady. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:59:48
I'm sorry you took the word nobody and took it literally when I should have said only a miniscule fraction of people said that. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:24:26
Yeah I'd say just about anything as well if balls were in the government's wringer.   Peace love and flowers everyone! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:37:11
It doesn't even indicate that.

Even the most ignorant person would realize this isn't even in the real of feasibility.

One shady company acquiring another, no surprise there.
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:31:36
It's not surprising half this sub thinks that people's time is worthless.  Stupid shit like this topic or when these idiots think tipping someone a few cents is going to cause them to spend hours learning how to setup everything just to spend their penny. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:14:48
One dollar.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:30:12
No that's what it looks like when you step outside of a cultish community that's only a tenth of the size of World of Warcraft. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:20:43
Can you link me to something important you have done other than go to a forum and give your mom and dad's money away? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:25:40
Anything that doesn't get contributed to the circlejerk is removed.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:35:03
It's a good thing that you don't have to worry about shitty security practices when it comes to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:11:37
When it comes to the MSM this sub will flip flop depending on the tone of the last article that was written.  So if someone does a pro-bitcoin article this sub will slobber all around their knob.  If it is anti-bitcoin they will be calling for their head. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:29:30
Thing is Giraffe Lewis will most likely be further off than bitcorn was.

No they didn't.

Am I missing something?  What great results have come from spamming Amazon? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:49:41
A vast majority of bitcoiners don't spend or donate.   This is a common theme here and it's common knowledge that most are only involved to horde and become  trillionaires.

And if you live in reality don't forget zero.

Yeah the world of big business generally has big buckets.

Hashing is only good for hashing. A couple of months after the hardware is released and made obsolete the only use it has is being dumped into a landfill.

@_date: 2014-01-26 17:48:18
You are right it isn't a threat however it is seen as so by many people in this sub.   What else could explain all these ridiculous posts with people acting like every altcoin broke in their house and raped their mother. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:46:54
This is the best you could come up with? Sorry kid you will have to come harder than that. I'm still waiting on an answer as to what I'm supposedly shilling. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:26:13
Oh so I guess you guys know for a fact he has the misprinted coin. My bad.  If that's the case then yes you can get a bit more money out of it.  However if it's not the misprinted coin it's value is exactly what I told you. 1 btc + scrap. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:20:15
A magnitude larger than anything the bitcoin community could scrounge up. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:39:20
You have a bank account but no debit card? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:37:05
That and it would be more efficient to just to buy a heat pump. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:34:36
Is this just a cheap attempt by the parents of the would-be Satoshi Bitcoin to cash in on Bitcoin's popularity?
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:00:45
Wow can we get a comparison to Tom Green as well? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:50:26
Yep that sure is a guild name. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:38:34
Also trading volume indicates nothing of the sort. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:09:30
With a dollar you can purchase goods without having to first buy a gift card. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:09:18
No they aren't playing.  That's how 95% of this sub is.
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:47:01
Right it could and does happen and you would get your money back.  But I was asking you to rate the consumer protections of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:48:34
Yeah we just know all these future Donald Trumps aren't going to abandon ship the second they get a chance.

@_date: 2014-03-01 20:36:54

Other bitcoiners can't deny...
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:09:19
The idea that bitcoinstore is a competitor to anything is pretty funny. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:21:08
Credit cards such I have to give them my address and phone number fuck these statist banker assholes. We should all use bitcoin instead we only have to give picture ID, Palm scan,  urine, semen and stool samples.   Can you feel that?  That's the feeling of freedom and privacy.   Oh wait no that's just a finger up my ass. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:42:44
Don't both people have to use bitcoin to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:06:34
I was referring more to the cost effectiveness.  Shitty wording on my part. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:36:14
Yeah but saving an African village isn't going to raise the value of his coin.   Duh. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:05:11
As stated above it is against he tos. Besides that why would you want to transact in bitcoin?  Wow gold is a much more stable. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:00:34
Or buy a heat pump which would be way more efficient and cheaper than trying to heat your home with a shitty overpriced ASIC
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:07:22
Right I forgot that anyone that doesn't bow to the great Satoshi and offer fiat sacrifices to his only begotten sons andreas poptarts and Roger Ver you are labeled as a troll and heretic.   Go fuck yourself sheep. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:54:27
But you will give it to exchanges and coinbase?
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:43:58
Really depends, they aren't going to go after a guy that purchased a few shitty phone cases and a fleshlight.  It's not worth their time.
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:12:11
They were right it seems. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:55:09
You must be new to this sub.

You don't need a credit card to use Applepay either just a debit card and NFC has been available on Android for quite awhile now.  Basically the only argument here is that Apple will fail for not marketing to an audience that isn't their target demo? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:40:38
Probably because it's accepted nearly everywhere and he doesn't have to first buy a gift card online to use it. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:53:38
No but a title that admits that he stole does make him a thief. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:47:01
It's like watching Elmer Fudd step on the same rake over and over and it never gets old. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:56:23
Isn't that going to vanish as soon as they make another post?
@_date: 2012-09-22 18:00:11
How many people are using the USD compared to BTC per month?
@_date: 2012-12-05 16:53:15
They do understand it, they would just rather spend 5 seconds putting in a credit card number than jump through 57 different hoops to make a $10 payment.
@_date: 2012-09-08 18:51:03
Yeah, this probably has nothing to do with the whole Romney Tax thing.
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:48:23
Don't worry this will get downvoted into oblivion.  These idiots were being laughed at and mocked while it was happening so it's easy to see how short sighted the people in this sub are. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:35:29
So if I called Starbucks corporate and asked if they accept bitcoin they would say yes? 
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:32:31
Pretty sure the only people it's under attack from are just more bag holders cashing out to save what little money they have left. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 10:25:26
So we are supposed to just make shit up? 
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:45:05
Bitcoin offers me a chance to get the rich by doing nothing.  I am already heavily invested into it hence the reason it will be successful. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:40:18
OK again.  If I were to call Starbucks corporate they would confirm that they accept bitcoin?  If not then they don't accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:49:34
Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:25:23
Why would anyone want to use this over NFC. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:46:00
It makes for cheap advertising and publicity. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:20:28
Why am I not surprised that line was uttered by the one piece of shit that does literally nothing in the group. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:55:38
The best part of that documentary is how almost all of those businesses have closed and most of the people in it are in prison.

You mean you can pay with foldapp. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 16:50:54
The real question is why would customers choose to use bitcoin over cash? 
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:41:04
It's a bit different in here.   Downvotes are for suppressing dissenting opinions and any news that could destroy the short-lived pumps that are such a common occurrence nowadays.  Upvotes are for obviously fake stories,  e-cigs, tea and bong store openings, and businesses accepting fiat via bitpay. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:27:05
Name a single person that has invested in the last 2 years that has gotten wealthy from investing in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:54:42
Yeah Somalia being the shining example. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:22:56
It will be added to the wiki and for all intents and purposes that problem will be considered solved. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:25:33
Probably around the same time that bitcoin becomes relevant. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:08:34
How could we forget one of the biggest "it's happening" events for bitcoin.  One of the many events that forced Bitcoin into mainstream adoption and not just another poor pump on Bitpays part.

Bitcoin,  the comedy goldmine.

I have the other 7 million.  I won't offer up any proof though because I'm afraid of the batshit insane community.

@_date: 2015-04-27 16:01:36
I wonder just how many people ordered a product,  say MDMA, and ended up with fucking baths salts or some other bullshit RC. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:02:05
Are we still pretending Bitcoin is anonymous? 
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:33:37
How about we just fight tobacco?

Six years is a long time to be staring at a blank canvas.

That's where the  big money is.  The kids living in their mom's basement. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:27:04
The day overstock started accepting Bitcoin they sold out of fleshlights so I think we have a clue. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 22:50:58
Take that fiat bitcoin did that in 1/100 the time. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:23:15
Maybe you guys should go in there and open their eyes.
@_date: 2015-04-26 16:04:55
What stock symbol was email trading under? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:33:45
For example? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:33:02
Yeah he shouldn't have been called a dick.  If anything he is just a big diaper wearing crybaby. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:28:00
Pretty sure he will just stick his fingers in his ears and say "LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!  LA LA LA" It is the entire point if his sub after all. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:30:32
Most people in here would suck off every member of ISIS if it would pump their coins a couple of bucks.

@_date: 2015-04-07 04:31:37
Yeah they could have just said convicted felon Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:24:50
But more than likely it will just send you to the poor house. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:59:59
If we put Apple and Bitcoin's timelines together side by side Apple would be coming out with the Mac soon.  Meanwhile, 6 years in, Bitcoin still doesn't have even an eighth of the users World of Warcraft has.  Yeah this is totally an apt comparison. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:39:59
No the only people that "win" are the bitcoin bagholders as the price of their coin gets pumped up a few cents for a couple of days.
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:43:30
Most people call their bank to let them know they are traveling out of country so the bank doesn't assume the card was stolen when it starts seeing charges halfway across the  globe. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:04:28
Maybe if this were the 70's but this is the 21st century.  Technology moves at the speed of light now.  6 years is an eternity in this day and age.
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:01:30
Did you try swapping the chart to LOG.  Also did you even try putting it up against the rainbow table?  If you had you would have seen that this is just another opportunity to grab some more cheap tweetz.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:50:54
I bet you could settle more debts with those that you could actual Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 09:47:21
Because this is one of the few actual use cases for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:04:57
That's a whole lot of words detailing a whole bunch of nothing other than saying government... but with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:16:12
My boss would not be pleased if I was, we have a separate department for that.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:15:39
Because it's easier to bitch and moan for days on a forum as opposed to making that 30 second phone call.  Right? 
@_date: 2015-04-14 07:14:54
Most people that get refunds don't wait until the deadline.   They file as early as possible. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 18:40:50
Let me know when they accept bitcoin and not fiat from a middleman. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:40:17
Doctor Shipman and Senator McCarthy say no it is not good enough and is largely irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:13:05
Downvotes yet not a single solitary answer.  How surprising. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:14:09
Banks won't let people buy bitcoin.  This is why it hasn't taken off.  Sounds legit. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:04:30
Never go full Bitcoin.

In Satoshi's name we pray. Amen.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:52:12
Um... Yeah you call them give your name and tell them you are traveling out of country. It's pretty simple. If you Google travel tips damn near every page will tell you this. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:48:12
Good thing this didn't happen last night.  Count your lucky stars. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:32:48
Who exactly is this "many"?
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:58:45
If you asshats are going  to downvote me how about you speak up and disprove  what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:55:53
Kind of like how bath salts are labeled NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  It has nothing to do with getting high,  right. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:43:46
 I'm sure that will be helpful for all future investors with time machines. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:09:53
What's really sad is that will still be less users than World of Warcraft has.

If your goal is to disappoint your father then the answer is yes.
@_date: 2015-03-09 02:27:10
You don't.  You fend off women with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:03:49
So, how is this working out for you?
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:39:42
Pretty sure he already knows gift cards work. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:28:58
Most of those guys cashed out long ago. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 03:19:57
Yeah good luck with that. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:29:52
I keep seeing people make accusations like this and every time I ask for any proof whatsoever all I ever receive is downvotes.  Let's try again.  Please link a single solitary instance of this otherwise all you are doing is blowing smoke up peoples assholes.
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:40:47
Then it will be shit on and downvoted and treated as if it was a slight against bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:53:16
Well to be fair it's been around over a century longer and people actually use it.

@_date: 2015-03-23 19:23:37
So you are basically claiming they are interchangeable?
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:19:25
I saw this one too.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:40:55
Looks like I'm with good company then. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:59:16
Yeah, ghost town would have been more fitting.

The best part of that movie is how most of the businesses featured have already closed and most of the people featured are criminals. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:17:53
tipbybit, charles_changetip, bitbytip, Bitcoinsantaclaus are just a few off the top of my head.
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:31:48
So if i were to e-mail Disqus then they would confirm that they have integrated changetip into their platform?

Since when did prisoners start carrying around phones to use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-03-15 00:54:51
Amazing.  Almost enough to fill an averaged sized theme park. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:07:51
TIL Bitcoin can now cure people of gambling impulses. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:00:18
You mean besides all of their accounts that have been shadowbanned?
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:04:13
Yeah its pretty easy to save when most places don't accept your fun bux. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 03:14:17
About a year ago some guy posted about his restaurant and his servers had qr codes on their shirts so they could be tipped with bitcoin.   Can you guess how that turned out?   The server that was in the picture he posted got 20-30 bucks from the euphoric posters in this sub and after it fell off the front page she never received a single Satoshi. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:04:29
At what point in time has it been profitable for anyone not running the scam?

In what way does a legit ponzi differ from one that isn't?

You were the kid that started fights and then ran in the house to the protection of your mommy. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:36:48
On a similar note can we get numbers when you remove the changetip sockpuppets like bitbytip, bitcoinsantaclaus and the multitude of others that have already been banned or shadowbanned by reddit?

@_date: 2015-02-22 01:02:14
I don't know of any casinos or coin shows that require you to meet in a parking lot to trade or "cash out"  those venues generally have security.

@_date: 2015-02-03 09:11:24
Why is participating in a scam a requirement to question it's glorious leader?  
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:46:12
Looks like Cabal. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:39:10
Why would we want bitcoin to die? It's far more fun to watch all the new scams popping up everyday.  The rabid fanaticism and delusional bagholders.  This is more entertaining than anything Hollywood could ever hope to produce. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:22:34
The future has been here for awhile it's called Adblock. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:17:10
Fun fact.  Bitcoin has been more inflationary than USD. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:12:37
Thanks, I knew I would blend in around here eventually. The best part is the most upvoted post is about "making money while learning a language" 
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:31:45
Yeah I'm the op acting surprised a network advertises their own shows.

Morgan Spurlock a major journalist.  I laughed, good one.

Wow he didn't even have to wait 10+ minutes.
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:31:13
100? Not even close.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:18:05
Yeah they already have micro transactions with WoW so this isn't exactly new territory. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:02:59
You all can keep pretending to be stupid all you want but you damn well know most of Megas use is for hosting pirated movies and games.

Can you provide some examples of this since you have seen it happen so often?
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:19:27
Hey pal, we aren't looking for obvious answers here.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:45:12
Mass transit barely even exists in the US.   Most people don't seem to realize that generally just one of our States is bigger than their entire country.  Things are spread out here.

So basically people that already know the language can just buy loads of them.  Do them all and make money for doing high school homework?
@_date: 2015-03-29 11:44:18
Where was the first one? 
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:23:19
Yeah they should definitely become a customer of a company that pulls in a fraction of a percent of their own business. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:38:01
Super weird how networks advertise their own shows.  Can you guess what they did last week?  And the week before? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:28:53
Yeah don't have to pretend with me friend. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:25:58
A narcissistic twat with a white Savior complex that expects to save the world by sitting on his ass and letting other people do the real work.   Sounds like the perfect bitcoin representative.

Somehow the most common one isn't on there.   It will make you rich. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:09:23
Let's start keeping track of new startups and technologies that pop up in the next two years that will blow past bitcoin in terms  of user adoption and growth .   That should be a fun game.  We can start over and do it again when the dates get pushed back again in 2017.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:59:08
When overstock first started accepting bitcoin they almost immediately sold out of fleshlights.  I imagine today was another big day for that product. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:13:53
Make up some stories about bitcoin in the wild or about how your family is hip to bitcoin.   Make some shitty product and slap a bitcoin logo on it and then post about it in here.   You should be able to clear tens of cents per day from the tipping. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:30:21
For something that makes up 99.9999999% of money usage that sounds  way more efficient.

You can't?  Take a look at DPR and his my_criminal_diary.txt and tell me how a criminal couldn't possibly be so stupid.

If there was a bitcoin monopoly half the spaces would be go to jail spots.   The other half would be chance spaces that randomly increase our decrease your holdings by 10% or just make you lose all your coins.

If you think that was easy you should try buying literally anything else with cash.   It's amazing how easy it is. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:03:59
USD.  You can basically use any map and randomly point to a spot and it will be accepted. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:38:33
Nah its cool.  They even recommend it to kids around here.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:18:48
We are talking about a guy that kept my_criminal_diary.txt on his laptop.  It's not hard to imagine just how stupid he is.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:26:30
Yeah no doubt someone paid 4 million bucks to advertise bitcoin for 30 seconds. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:27:24
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:36:16
So first it was much quicker now it's about the same.  Which is it? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:44:59
I agree.  For now they are only petty criminals.  They have the potential to be a world wide criminal conglomerate. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:40:58
Coinmap is laughably out of date and full of misinformation. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:01:51
The real irony idea that with the dollar they can spend it immediately and literally anywhere.   On the other hand they would have to spend God knows how much time trying to learn to use bitcoin and then the almost impossible task of finding someone that will accept it.  Time is money friend. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:37:44
The dog has found the bone.  I repeat.  The dog has found the bone.   About.   Abort.

It's good to see adoption going up.

Another shady operation using Bitcoin. This is what it was designed for its a perfect match.

Wait so you are telling me a single bitcoin isnt going to be worth a milliion billion filthy fiat dollars each.

Im on the boat that they should be getting paid but if one does they all need to.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:37:37
I guess you are just stupid.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:07:52
I have a better idea.  Since everyone on the planet is already aware of breast cancer from everyone shoving it down our throats, how about we take that money and use it for researching a cure instead.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:40:35
Wold probably be cool if I didn't need a magnifying glass to read the second half.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:48:24
Bitcoin could only wish it had runescape numbers.

You have no idea how deep this hole goes.

Ok without saying "it's a scam" or "it's a clone" explain to me what makes bitcoin better than dogecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:23:42
That's a lot of extra steps just to play a video game.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:39:49
I guess now we know how the rest of the forum feels when you evangelical cultist assholes come into other subs with your internet play money and start spamming people with what amounts to pennies worth of tips.

Comparing internet money to living in a concentration camp.  This is bitcoin.

Thats like half the posts in this sub.

If you read this sub with any regularity you would find that nothing is ever bad for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:08:45

What does this have to do with bitcoin?

How is this any different for a digital currency?

I always toss my faith behind what random internet posters have to say.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:04:12
It was all most likely a publicity stunt anyway as someone in the previous 35 threads about this has mentioned.

Not just you it's pretty obvious

@_date: 2013-10-18 15:49:55
Yeah, well I think most of us would prefer the truth as opposed to tricks.
@_date: 2013-08-30 08:39:18
So what is this showing again?  They traded BTC for a card loaded with USD.   How is this any different from going in with any other item such as 20 pounds of bacon or a stack of video games and trading for a card?

Oxford basically is urban Dictionary.
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:29:48
What does this have to do with bitcoin?

You are right, I was referring to the guy who was hyping non-reversible transactions as a positive.

As if bitcoin tips are that much better
@_date: 2013-08-01 16:20:54
94 transactions in 9 months.  Bitcoin supporters sure seem to love pushing it on to other businesses but when its time to put their money where their mouth is we get a whole different picture of what is really going on.
I'd love to see any evidence of a business accepting bitcoin and having it make an actual dent in their payments received.  Preferably a business that pulled in more than some random kids lemonade stand.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:50:44

All those Paypal refunds are telling a different story.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:23:46
Merchants dont give 2 shits about bitcoin. They do it to get their face in the public while bitcoins are enjoying a bit of limelight. It is working too because I thought overstock collapsed years ago.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:49:26
Seems that way until you just end up back where you started.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:03:04
If you consider pennies a tip then yeah I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:59:31
Thermos probably got burned by the same fucking unpatched exploit for the third time.

Yeah its totally not the malnutrition and diseases. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:08:32
No not in the slightest.
@_date: 2013-09-20 19:00:42
Yeah they have been doing that for the last year.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:04:07
Almost as if they were pogs or something.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:46:24
Yeah I still don't see how that matters in the slightest.  If he called it shitcoin it is still a complete non-issue. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 22:46:23
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:43:06
Think i'll just put some thought into my gifts instead of trying to further my own agenda.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:22:15
You are correct and I have no doubt a vast majority of the site was used for illegal goods but assuming every person that went to the site was using it for illicit means seems a bit shortsighted.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:11:32
That is pretty funny coming from one of, if not the biggest circlejerk communities on the net.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:59:01
Yeah feigning interest instead of calling the customer a twat is generally the recommended method that corporate prefers their employees to use. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:31:53
Their original business model was shit in the first place as MTG online already had a decent built in trading engine.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:35:13
Yeah can't get enough tipbot spam.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:38:48
That would be you downloading the 12GB blockchain.
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:59:03
They said they were going to liquidate.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:36:59
Nah you are the model bitcoiner.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:23:33
How was this any surprise to you?  Reddit, humblebundle, Bigfishgames.  The list goes on and on and on.  Bitcoiners could give two shits about actually donating or spending their precious coins.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:25:20
Lol.  Mining is a perfect way to send yourself to the poor house.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:03:18
Thats the part everyone seems to leave out.  
@_date: 2013-08-09 03:54:46
This seems to be the case with just about every business.  People talk very loud on how they want to use the coins but instead the horde and never spend.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:51:33
So only athletes that play and perform at a certain level get paid?  Sounds like bullshit to me.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:44:04
Lol, no.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:35:37
Yeah tablets havent solved any problems.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:07:03
once you get the bitcoins do you plan on converting to doge?
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:27:40
It's perfect because it makes it seem like you actually care and instead of spending the time buying an actual gift that took thought, you can just send them a fraction of a bitcoin and then claim it back later as the chances of them actually using it on anything is virtually nil.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:52:29
Did you guys know that water is wet?
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:24:17
About as many as an average size mmo. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:47:57
I've been needing to give something to my family to prove I put no thought into a gift.  Thank for this.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:26:33
Ive been running around town all day and have yet to see a single merchant taking btc.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:05:03
I agree put all the asshats on a few ships and send them off.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:56:41
If your "money" is able to be manipulated by a small forum then maybe your money needs to be rethought.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:33:25
Then I have no qualms.  A lot of the breast research funding doesn't go to support the victims in any way and it really pisses me off.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:18:39
Asics have been around for a few decades.  Almost every piece of electronic equipment has what would be considered an asic.  So no bitcoin isn't contributing to anything.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:48:00
Just as annoying as any other evangelical.  Hello friend, that was an interesting comment you made let me introduce you to our lord and savior Bitchrist.
Woah!!! What just happened???
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:27:52
Yeah. Don't be that guy.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:57:32
I do not have more information and I don't have an opinion about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:47:31
Well you should have known from the start that unless you were giving bitcoin a reach around it was going to be downvoted to hell.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:34:08
Yeah the Forbes article showed what kind of gems people were leaving.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:06:31
We would all get a laugh at how stupid they are.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:07:13
You are one of the reasons he is in this predicament in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:57:19
There is.  I dont think a single project has got off the ground.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:10:54
What am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:29:38
Looks like the standard quality for a mining rig to me.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:39:09
He bought it off the original owner, you aren't missing much.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:54:25
Unfortunately true.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:51:04
At least owning gold can get you laid.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:13:10
If you have to ask then yeah it probably is.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:27:59
When did you get in?  Because the last 24 hours it has dropped from $81 to $68.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:07:29
No see you forgot to put it on a log scale and then flip it upside down and shake it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:27:45
If you are talking about some lame ass online petitions dont even bother.  Nothing has ever come of any online petition
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:23:21
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:58:56
No, you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:43:40
About as good as a Tandy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:00:24
I have read this book and it also addresses how crowds of people can be really stupid as well especially when it comes to trying to nail investments.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:10:56
-Refunds will be paid out in BTC only, ie. if you buy 1 share at £150 and request a refund, you will be refunded 1.2 BTC into a bitcoin wallet address of you choice.
lol wut
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:45:57
Do you also have to send in urine and semen samples? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:19:47
Yeah i imagine most college grads cant wait to enter into the world of slave labor.
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:41:32
They already stated they were going to liquidate. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:06:32
The Rocky series is my all time favorites I was just curious who was playing the role of Clubber Lang.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:44:28
A guy gave something (bacon, bitcoins, a giant turd) to a third party who in turn gave usd to the car dealer.  Nothing was bought with bitcoin.  Bitcoin was exchanged for usd which in turn was used to purchase a vehicle.
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:07:10
Shouldn't be too hard most of the personal stories in here are already fictional.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:52:49
Well i called around town and no one accepts that.  I can already order shit online by clicking a single purchase button.  Still doeant solve the problem that no one in town takes btc.
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:18:11
Yes. A very very long shot. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:44:40
With that definition it still doesn't come anywhere near being close to the top though.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:01:13
You will have another 30 day wait once the initial 3 day wait is over.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:50:16
You can donate to me instead.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:16:37
We could give them semen and urine samples as well.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:50:18
No one would give a shit. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:35:14
You can do it, just witness for our lord and savior Bitchrist.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:49:40
Well he already came out and admitted he was fucking with bitcoiners so it's not really that much of a stretch. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:16:53
This would make for a hilarious episode of Shark Tank.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:06:37
Also that guy donated most of the coins to himself.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:51:54
Yeah this is the first time we have heard a single word on bitcoin on CNBC ever.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:21:28
So has this.  
What's the point here?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:51:51
Are you seriously asking a sub who thinks each bitcoin is going to be worth a billion dollars as to when the price is going to stop dropping?
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:27:46
No chargebacks. Lol
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:05:19
Why do people say they bought something with bitcoin when they used a gift card.  Hell I could sell my wow gold and get gift cards.  Hey guys look at all this I bought for 500k gold.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:38:35
This guy is at the most 9 years old.
“hey computer geek, who control this address,” writes one FBI “tipper.” “‘Ross Ulbricht’ is not the bad guy, you are a bad guy. Please open your eyes, dont be brainwashed, and think your self!!!”
@_date: 2013-09-18 22:58:18
 If your computer miner pays for itself, then you can start saving up for all your geekiest workshop desires.
By this they mean never and confirmed by their mining link.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:57:48
Pretty sure that only applies to the casting cost.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:55:19
You will get a lot of upvotes but I doubt you'll see any BTC.  BTC is for hoarding not spending.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:20:41
These people will spread their ass for anything that might make the price of their coin rise.  
Nazi Germany embraces bitcoin.  Hey guys this is it!  TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:31:56
Bitcoin raped my mom.  This is good news guys.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:30:01
Hey guys my shitty home business is accepting bitcoin.  Now watch as my post gets 1200 upvotes, slides off into the void , I gain not even a single sale and you never hear from me again.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:11:18
The Encyclopedia Shitannica if you will.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:06:46
Unless you are dealing with huge amounts of cash then irs isn't going to give a shit.   Bitcoin or fiat they don't waste their time on small fish. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:42:50
About as much as ISK.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:28:32
I don't know it could be the shitty foreign products they sell it could be how they fuck over any other manufacturer that doesn't meet their price points.  Walmart is the shining beacon of business practices. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:37:12
Why regulate a bunch of shitty coins no one will ever use?
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:24:37
Lol.   Right.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:30:11
Yeah just keep on them until they are homeless and have nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:44:23
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:45:03
Because these people don't give a shit as long as it makes the value of their coin rise.
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:17:53
They are not taking bitcoin.  The merchant could care less if the middle man is taking bitcoins, lollipops, or dog turds as long as they get usd in the end.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:52:17
Isn't that what the up and down vote buttons are for?
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:33:17
They can't.  MtGox for instance can only dole out 10 grand a month.  These guys are millionaires in the same way you are a kingpin if you play drug wars on your phone.  It's all on paper and doesn't really translate to shit in the real world.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:04:52
So all we have to do is sit and watch exchanges all days and perfectly time our purchases.  Yeah sounds totally awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:30:00
Literally every person that has invested in something has said this about whatever it is they are investing in.   Why the hell wouldn't you? Otherwise you wouldn't have invested in the first place.   This is basically white noise. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:31:12
You would obtain the same results by taking the money you were going to spend on an ASIC and setting it on fire.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:15:56
No you and literally everyone in this sub thinks they are going to be the new 1%.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:01:33
There is a lot of that in this subreddit unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:08:52
The dealer didnt see a single bitcoin correct?
If i gave 100k dollars worth of bacon to my friend and then he buys the car with fiat and gives it to me can I claim that I bought a car with bacon.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:43:50
HEADLINE: Why everything is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:51:42
No it's not.  Almost every pizza store takes that delivery charge.  It almost never goes to the driver.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:53:34
This happens pretty damn often.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:48:14
Manipulating the market.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:14:11
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:36:50
So technically you could have sold virtually anything to get fiat and done the same thing yes? 
You could have traded in a Nintendo to Gamestop or whatever and accomplished the same thing.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:07:15
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:38:23
Hell you might as well have thrown some confederate dollars and a WoW account with a bunch of gold in there as well.
@_date: 2013-08-30 08:56:30
So being an honest, decent human being is worthy of hero praise now?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:28:04
Nope somehow after 3 days no one noticed that bitcoin was mentioned on a tv show.
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:40:59
If you hate money you should get into it.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:43:49
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:24:09
Yeah just what we need Walmart fucking  over the little guys even more. But hey whatever makes my coins worth more so I can hopefully be the new 1%
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:48:45
 all of that money came from one or two addresses so yeah....... 
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:10:16
There has been a massive wait for quite awhile now.   Gox is shit. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:15:51
People hoping to be the new 1%.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:28:29
This forum would still find a way to spin it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:53:21
I guess the important part is how much he takes in after the honeymoon. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:05:49
You have been lurking awhile but somehow missed the faq on the side bar and the 30 daily posts where people ask how to obtain bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:31:06
Yeah I'm saying you could have sold anything in your area for fiat and still deposited dirty filthy fiat into her bank account same as you did with the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:28:24
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:08:20
The whole e-mail comparison thing is beyond stupid.  Your comparing something that took days to do (send a letter) to something that happened instantly and free (e-mail).
Bitcoin in no way takes any such leap forward over what we currently use.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:45:43
It's ok I still love you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:25:09
Myspace did as well.  How is that doing now?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:57:54
A few hours ago, yeah.
@_date: 2013-09-16 13:03:28
Yes, he is also a fucking moron.
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:05:26
I wonder how many people said that about the housing and dot com booms. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:46:03
Seems you never have to wonder too far from bitcoin to get a big ol whiff of that scam stench.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:29:40
Biggest workforce?  Yeah, not even close.  Most motivated?  Somehow I doubt that as well.
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:10:48
He's pretty heavily invested, why the hell wouldn't he say that?
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:21:18
That's pretty much a 100% guarantee.
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:18:05
If they spend their half a bitcoin  how will they be the new ruling elite class when each bitcoin is worth a billion trillion dollars? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:21:51
So will their paper be half off tomorrow morning?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:12:34
Oh boy I hope those catch on then we can just have groups of people flashing qr codes and begging for money all over tv.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:04:36
No this subreddit only allows positive bitcoin news.  You either join the circlejerk or get out.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:22:48
It drives up price in the same way making drugs illegal raises price on the street.  It does rise a little but the overall effect of the artificial barriers thrown up cuts way more into demand.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:48:57
You cant do anything.  No chargeback suckers.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:26:20
Th exchanges are most likely already doing this.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:37:46
More idiots buying in.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:06:15
It's still there because surprise surprise despite   PayPal being absolute shit they would still rather use that over bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:22:22
What if they cause panic sell offs instead.  Far easier since it doesn't take much to move the markets.  Seems to have worked out well for Gox in the past.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:07
Might as well take that cash you were gonna spend on any mining equipment and just toss it into a fire.
@_date: 2013-09-19 20:11:36
They listened to you, doesn't mean they gave a shit.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:45:31
Whatever someone wants to give you for it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:36:48
Yes.   They do it to get a bit of publicity while btc has its 15 minutes. You also have places like overstock that are using it as a last grasp before amazon plunges it's sword right through their chest. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:47:53
It might have been but it's really hard to tell in here sometimes.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:11:56
The superb history of bitcoiners being the avatars of virtue and honesty. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:06:14
Takes 5 minutes outside of the couple of days you have to wait for them to make deposits into your account to verify it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:57:28
Somebody needs a nap.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:43:07
His form was terrible.  2/10.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:19:28
Fuck BFL.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:42:03
You are right.  Someone is sitting at CNBC and was waiting for ol Ben to pop on the TV to display shit about bitcoin.  The very thing that has been plastered all over msm the past few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:15:20
I'm totally sure she cared while being swamped with further help requests.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:08:36
Not a gang.  Evangelical cult is a bit more accurate. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:19:21
Heat stroke and brain damage.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:09:08
That's not even counting the fake walls that are put up and pulled all the time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:16:09
That is like 95% of this sub.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:30:02
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:11:07
I will also be sure to come back when it drops right back down.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:49:36
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:02:02
Yeah I guess all he has to do now is hop into his time machine now.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:01:43
Hope you have fire insurance. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:19:37
Nope.  Just as when they announced it, it is still a useless waste of good electronics.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:07:17
That poor child...
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:42:51
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:20:10
Yeah we just never see people pulling those walls do we?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:42:49
My bank hasnt stopped me from buying anything.  What the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:06:50
1000 years?  I havent touched paper money in at least 10.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:13:33
Walking into a store and being able to use them would be a nice start.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:59:25
No, but let's just keep pretending.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:32:09
That's a lot of assumptions you make there and I'm sorry your parents were complete assholes and wouldn't let you spend your own money as you please.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:42:01
I think it has more to do with just swiping a card to buy shit as opposed to jumping through 50 hoops to buy a pack of fucking gum.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:58:12
Who exactly was trying to crash it?
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:21:42
Misleading title.  I read about the Jonestown Massacre doesn't mean I was involved.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:56:23
Dont worry 99% of this forum is drove only by greed.  You are in fine company.
@_date: 2013-08-13 13:13:34
I'm pretty sure he would like to do this without looking like a tinfoil hat wearing douchebag.

If you spend any sort of time here you will realize that hoarding and becoming the new 1% is all that matters to a vast majority of posters in this sub.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:43:17
That was literally the first thing he mentioned.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:47:44
I don't recall jesus being a convict.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:25:10
Do you know anything about China?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:02:55
Really because im pretty sure this is how relegion keeps being spread.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:00:36
I place 1 bitcoin at around 100 hundred million bazillion dollars.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:02:31
So do your parents know or are you just fucking them over on the power bill?
@_date: 2013-08-09 17:55:11
They aren't going to take it.  The BTC community in general attempts to persuade merchants to accept Bitcoin and then once they finally break down and do it they proceed to not spend Bitcoin on anything.  The humble bundle was a perfect example.  Bitcoiners spent the least per purchase and not only that purchased way less than Linux or Mac users (both of which cant even play the games they bought).  The thought of a Bitcoiner giving away Bitcoins for free is quite honestly a laugh.
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:30:49
Sure it does you Opie dead eyed fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:29:55
Wow what a surprise.   I'm sure we will hear about how easy it was for Johnny high roller to cash out his half a bitcoin shortly. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:15:25
He specifically asked about people that were buying LEGAL goods and her response "“There is not likely to be retribution in this case,” she said. “If they’re knowingly buying something illegal, they can’t get their money back.”
No where in her statement did she answer the question about people buying legal goods.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:32:16
Because it's lame as shit?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:07:19
I'm gonna take your advice so
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:54:48
It goes on the pile of wish-I-had-time-for projects.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:32:17
So a chain letter/pyramid scheme type deal?
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:18:12
Apples to oranges
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:13:20
She spent 15k on btc instead of...oh i dunno....using that cash to go to school.  I think we all also know walmart drones typically have 15k just lying around.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:36:08
Sooo is this like pulling for a sports team or something?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:16:48
Sure, the reddit price manipulation crew will get right on that.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:13:01
You do obviously.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:42:09
Woah! What is this?
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:35:19
Of course they would.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:09:42
Aka virgin badge. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:43:03
How did the other 99% fare?

Floating Hamsterdam.  What a shit hole nightmare this place would be.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:46:28
Why doesn't the lazy ass kid just get a job.  Problem solved.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:03:48
I would like to get involved in an orgy.  Still doesn't mean I was involved.

I gave my friend 100 grand worth of bacon yesterday.  Afterwards he went and bought me a tesla with usd.  I am the first person to buy a tesla with bacon.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:53:44
You mean $2250.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:24:38
Misleading title.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:50:01
Yes.  Just you.  Somehow amazingly the price isn't zero.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:46:16
India will be next.   This sub will spread their legs for anyone until they no longer have a chance of raising their coin value.   After that it's all fuck you got mine. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:30:53
Thanks for being completely out of touch with reality.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:18:50
Hamsterdam II
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:19:20
It was off by a factor of two by the time he got the shirt.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:26:50
No chargebacks.  What a great "feature".
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:43:01
It's been over a week since it aired not really a spoiler anymore.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:26:59
Walked right into that one.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:51:49
Now I can finally ascend to become one of the financial elite.
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:26:16
Yeah I'm sure he's looking to add more time on to his sentence.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:35:36
Yeah I imagine living it up large and not filing taxes wouldn't be suspicious at all.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:46:35
Why not, everyone else does.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:58:44
Im sure the idiots here will find some way to spin this in a positive light.
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:54:48
After watching Breaking Bad I looked up Ricin on wikipedia.  Doesn't mean I was about to start using it to kill people.
Oh hey I wasn't the only one.  I guess we are going to see a whole string of new poisonings here soon.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:34:42
Unless you count all the power required to run the network and all.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:43:51
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:29:18
I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.

Community rules
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:12:49
Lol spending bitcoin?  When has that ever happened?  Not on this planet that is for sure.  Hoarding is where it's at.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:09:23
As with most government officials, she totally ignored the question.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:53:25
No see losing 30% of the value in a couple of hours is normal.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:55:41
So there are multiple torrent clients and multiple internet browsers.  There MUST be one cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:13:17
Shit dude, sounds like you already have a better source of info, why come to this circlejerk hoping to get any serious answers?   Maybe you aren't looking for serious answers just a few stories to give your buddies a giggle.  If that's the case then I approve.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:58:04
A shitty meme?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:02:04
What planet do you people live on where you think a passing mention to bitcoins on a cartoon is going to have any effect on the market.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:45:31
Like these people give two shits about anyone else but themselves.  99% of the people in here would vote to open concentration camps if it meant the price of their coin would rise.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:06:56
It's about as close to a penny stock as you can get. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:41:27
OBAMA!  *shakes fist*
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:05:06
Free market.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:04:29
Yeah a bit different from shipping explosive devices.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:04:51
So i can just set up a shitload of bots and bs accounts and I'll be rich. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:05:37
That or he could just be trolling you like he has been for quite awhile now. Seems to be working. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:46:57
Yeah I usually go out of my way for a few pennies worth of magic internet space credits.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:47:53
This.  Most of the people in here would rob their own grandmother to increase the value of their own coins.  
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:08:41
People preordered mining rigs well over a year ago now and are still waiting on them with no end in sight.  BFL has been pushing dates back and back back.
BFL is not giving any refunds.  So people getting fucked over by a company not delivering products had to result to this 
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:14:35
It happened because its bitcoin.  It doesnt need a reason to double in price over a day or lose 90 percent of its value in an hour.  This is the future.
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:00:45
Can't fault you for profiting off of others stupidity.
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:52:31
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:36:57
Goons why do you hate freedom?
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:36:52
Does your job require you to burn through your own gas without compensation? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:48:47
Yeah I don't know a guy running an online drug bazaar could possibly even consider hiring someone to murder a person for threatening his illegal business.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:39:10
So the name.  That's a solid argument there.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:01:14
TL:DR It would take like a billion suns or some shit to power a computer that could find anything worth looking for.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:02:26
There is probably a lot of shady fucks that have amassed a good fortune.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:13:15
Yeah that's nice and all but throwing someone a nickel every now and then doesn't prove shit.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:43:41
Jfc this community. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:43:58
Because bitcoin
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:13:05
Sounds like standard BFL operating policy to me.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:40:43
He could be referring to anything that comes out of BFL. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:09:35
Hahahaha.  Jesus fucking Christ.  He say's that word for word and the BTC  downvote cult is out in force already.  Maybe if we close our eyes it didn't happen right guys?  Right?
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:59:52
Yeah seems to be working out well for the guys getting fucked over by BFL.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:51:02
No you are right.  I'm sure every single one of those automated tickers are choreographed to the second.
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:34:20
Ok well there's nothing about bitcoins there's nothing about crypto-currency in fact outside of them talking about "online" there is really nothing here that could tie bitcoin to this story in any way.  I think the problem here is that some of you are just pants on head retarded.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:35:38
Seriously a fucking grammar error.  That is what you are going to call him out on. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:47:24
Loooooool what?
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:30:55
At random times do you lose half your points?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:45:35
yes mazza
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:49:13
Because they will do anything to increase the value of their own coins.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:20:14
Yeah, I'm sure the Chinese citizens going against their governments wishes would be a great thing for them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:18:38
Because every shitty part about dogecoin can be applied to btc and it pisses them off someone might be trying to elbow their way in to the game
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:46:36
BFL considers having no product to ship the same as selling out.
