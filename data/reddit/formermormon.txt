• Weary = tired, exhausted
• Wary = cautious, on the lookout, the feeling of expecting trouble
• Leery = Wary based on reasonable suspicions
It's a really super common mistake, by the way.

I'm now launching Bitcoin Ass, a protocol for tipping people negatively, to share your disdain for their contributions! All you have to do is send me BTC in any value, and I'll disapprove of someone for you! There's no way you could go wrong with "Bitcoin" at the front! /s

I was curious and found this: 
Sounds like ramblings of a mentally ill conspiracy theorist,  but on the other hand I'm predisposed to believe in the government's ability to not only make decisions that are ethically questionable, but to do so even when those decisions fly on the face of science and logic.

No, you've created a strawman by involving the Constitution. 
Let's review the conversation. The initial position I supported was that it's a basic human right to use currency to pay people for stuff, with the implication that governments aren't needed for currency transactions:


Now, I agreed with this concept of the *human right* to engage in transactions, and suddenly we're specifically taking about the Constitution? No, you won't get away with reframing my argument. Humans have a basic right to engage in a contract with whoever the fuck they want, up to and including governments. Too imply that the right to make fucking human decisions is somehow limited by *made up human laws* is what is insane. Your argument places man-made systems above free will, you goose!

You too! Thanks for showing me you aren't willing to take the time to actually discuss this, I've flagged you as "more interested in being right than understanding the discussion" in RES so I don't have to invest this much effort on you next time.

Not conflation; difference in philosophical perspective. I personally believe we have the right to do *whatever we want*, and the consequences of those choices are inevitable. I have the right to murder, but I choose not to because A) that's not something I even *want* to do, for a variety of reasons, and B) it's something that has consequences I'd rather not suffer. Just as I have the right to be an incorrigible asshole, even though it's rude. Just because something is taboo, illegal, rude, proscribed/prohibited, etc. doesn't take away an individual right to do it. Rights are not *given* by laws or governments, they are inherent. 
Edit: Let's keep this simple:
YOU CAN LITERALLY DO THINGS EVEN IF THEY ARE ILLEGAL. THEY ARE CALLED CRIMES. YOU HAVE THE ***RIGHT*** TO COMMIT CRIMES AND BE A CRIMINAL.

You literally told me that humans don't have the right to make bad decisions:


@_date: 2018-07-01 18:43:47


Sure you can. It's just illegal. But humans have the basic right to make bad decisions, and exercise it all the time.
