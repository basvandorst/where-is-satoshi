That's just crazy talk! You mean to tell me that if I invest long term that the bumps won't matter? Next you'll tell me that investing in get-rich-quick schemes fail more often than they work.

Look at the numbers. Real GDP is inflation adjusted. I think you may have a slight gap in your economics understanding with you look at something like  and still stick to the inflation argument.

Not only that but if major economies make a move on bitcoin, it will take a huge hit. As great as it is for adaptation that the occasional merchant is accepting it, they're not going to continue to do so in the face of major political bodies and all of a sudden bitcoin prices fall, volume falls, etc.

Look at the link I mentioned:
Or this one:
Very clearly real median wealth and median income have been increasing

I'm asking why inflation is bad in the long run for the economy as a whole (and by extension everyone)
Sure, hyperinflation is bad for everyone for obvious reasons and of course inflation forces you to invest instead of tuck money under the bed but that's kind of the point.

I think may be a bit immature and unwilling to accept criticism.
Thank you for being level headed and actually trying to have an intelligent conversation on inflation vs deflation.

But it's currently a fair way away from being on the same level as a major currency. When I feel as safe holding BTC as I do CAD, then it will be major and I don't see that happening any time soon.

Comparing simple math to economics.
That's like saying of course the e = mc^2, it's so obvious because the universe is based on matter and energy.
Relate supply and demand to a healthy and growing deflationary economy in a fraction of words it would take to prove 2+2=4 and I will be beyond impressed.

I'm not denying that the effect of deflation on people. That's a fact.
What's also a fact is that an inflationary economy has lead to the increase of median wealth and income for as long as it's been measured.
Economies are hard to model but there is no doubt a deflationary economy would lower total GDP and since the current system is leading to an increase in real wealth, why is it a bad thing?

Could you explain [this]( to me? 
Everyone in this subreddit is always focused on nominal money and I just can't understand why that's the factor that matters.

Of course not. Housing is a completely different thing. A house in downtown New York does not increase in value as a house in the outskirts of LA.

The responses to this question really speaks volumes of the mentality of this community. You all want nothing but to get rich and the top responses are "HODL!" and "No brainer. Cold storage".
A while lot of good that will do bitcoin and the economy at large.
I don't have any bitcoins because every last bit of it I've spent so I would probably buy myself a new laptop from Dell, donate to Wikipedia, and in general buy cool shit.
