Does anyone know of other little docos like this? Besides *Banking On Bitcoin* etc. Really interested in all the early day stuff.

I think you are conflating "value lost in BTC" with "value lost that was held in exchanges". The whole point of BTC is to NOT hand it over to a third party. Anyone complaining about losing BTC to a third party only has themselves to blame.

I agree that an all or nothing approach wouldn’t work, but I’m not sure anyone outside of hardcore anarchists are going for that.
Bitcoin means many different things to many different people. But for myself at least, it gives the options to hold money that is my own. I live in a country with terrible politics, and with a weakening currency. To know I can hedge against that when I need or want to, is very helpful. 
Also regarding loans there are plenty of crypto loan services, ranging from institution backed to purely peer-to-peer.

Firstly, thanks so much for this reply. It's super helpful and addresses so many of my questions.


Yeah I' afraid that's the best description I can give. He's not exactly an orator :/ 


So Raw, really means raw? Like, the most barebones version of something available? Aka, a Bitcoin transaction in it's most basic format without any other programme's helping you with it. 










Yes, having spoken with certain people close to the situation, I believe this was at least one main part of the purpose. It was so David Kleinman and Craig Wright could either both contribute coins OR both sign off on it OR a combination of the two previous statements. 


I'm struggling to get my head around how this works. Can you please elaborate? Probably ELI5.


For the first time in my life I'm a bit worried about being doxxed. All I can say is the intention was pretty straight forward. Nothing suss or weird about it.


Interesting. However if this was the case in the Tulip Trust I imagine the current legal battle wouldn't be underway. Unless to provide some sort of false flag innocence in the case of one party having the keys all along.


Thank you. I didn't know any of this.


My understanding the USB was purely to transfer the data via cold storage. So that Phil would receive his "third" of the promised Tulip Trust, which I believe was meant to be the raw transaction. However he says he never received it.   
As for how the actual trust is meant to be executed I don't quite understand. I thought it was meant to automatically execute on a certain date via the Bitcoin blockchain. However, now I'm beginning to think I got that wrong and that it becomes AVAILABLE on a certain date, to whomever has the raw transaction data?  
I'm really out of my depth with the technical stuff here, so again, all help is appreciated, and I really thank you again for taking the time out to write such a helpful reply.

Yes I believe there were two signatories and contributors to the trust. Given that one is now dead, and the other is a megalomaniac, I would expect the latter to have taken control by now if there was any floor in the system they set up.

So does that mean the date of trigger be pre-programmed, or does it require human intervention? I had always thought the trust was purely programmed but now I understand it's actually registered with some sort of body in the Caribbean (ie, a Caribbean tax haven state). So does that mean there's actually lawyer/programmers at the other end who have to trigger the raw tx by the contracted date? 


So as mentioned above, does that mean the trust is actually in physical human hands, who after a certain date CAN move the coins as instructed? Is the receiving address set in stone, or is it malleable? For example, if Kleinman or the Wright estate wins the court battle, how will the movement of coins be enforced?

I feel you. Someone else said "It's either the greatest fan fiction ever written, or it's poorly communicated truth"

Fair enough, a lot of crypto writers still appear to be grasping the concept of objectivity.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:14:30
I disagree that changing blocksize devalues the network. Can you point me to somewhere that explains why that would be the case?

Make sure to read the full article. He actually makes some additional really good points about how badly it has damaged the community, in turn, damaging the desirability of the chain. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:14:45
Haha really? Not even Ethereum?

"Neither is US dollars, and how big is your cash position?" Totally nailed it!
