In 15 mins here in Arnhem,the Netherlands I found 3 shops accepting BTC !
And I'm not even trying hard looking
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:27:42
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:45:14
Aha. I got them too. So cheap
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:12:50
I did not use BTC, I did use cash which otherwise I would've sold for BTC..so in a way yes
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:50:27
30 euro for an excellent Ledger wallet is not exactly expansive,  is it?
@_date: 2016-01-08 11:25:41
Numbers and values are different things😉
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:34:09
But I'm doing from some time the same(200-500euro per month)
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:33:49

@_date: 2016-01-07 16:13:57
Actually that's sound quite right
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:55:26
Oops !
Hopes goes well
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:34:09
Thanks from here too. Yesterday I was explaining to a complete noob with crypto how to use it. He got it from one time seeing the process! He said was easier than a online banking app! I personally use it on a weekly basis.  ������
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:37:29
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:15:52
No you are not.
That pizza story was significant because was the FIRST ever transaction of bitcoin in the "real" world.
You can still buy some..and bloody HODL!
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:53:36
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:00:04
I like to do it "manually". I might be into bitcoin, bit I still like the old school sense of control 😉
Even though it's just an illusion 
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:53:44
Rumors on Reddit...
Priceless! !

Truth is :
In our present economics if you have a buisness and don't SPENT than you are seen as crazy and pay higher tax.
I find this mad!
With inflation and value of fiat going lower every year didn't made sense to keep savings.
This has all changed.

U mean 9.995😉

Debit card yes,but credit card...well that's what the current financial system is about isn't it?
@_date: 2015-11-16 07:13:25
So"dutch"of you to post here"because there are a lot more bitcoiners "😉
@_date: 2015-11-20 08:06:05
Check date before posting..of course if your goal is not trolling 😜
@_date: 2015-11-02 10:00:25
But credit card is different than buisness credit.
I live in the Netherlands and here most of the people get credit card only when they go abroad.
No need of credit cards.still businesses can take credit😉
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:46:18
Only in btc world 5% is insignificant 😜

Today I had to wait 3.5hours as well 
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:53:39
I keep mine Not in an exchange but when the price was 445 euro per BTC(480usd) I went on btcdirect.EU and was unable to sell some.the website was on but not functional.
Then it started plummeting. 
Not fair game if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:10:06
Almost 3hrs!
Still nothing
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:45:51
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:06:53
My silly mind
@_date: 2015-11-20 09:08:18
Worst way to "spend"  btc I ever heard .
Pay your CC debt!
One day remembering that you had 5 btc and spend them for this might be something you wish didn't remember.
But glad you had that luck.
Mostly likely won't repeat so dont make more CC debt on that😉
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:52:12
Right you are...
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:14:56
There's need for a bite on every hook😉
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:39:09
I agree that getting some btc for exchange of goods,waiting hours for confirmation while the value goes down 20% is a bit awkward 
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:22:41
All blockchain is public,but..but..but 
I thought bitcoin was only for criminals😜
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:03:21
@_date: 2015-11-21 12:49:17
92% are against the bill!!!
Whe are they trying to full?
If our rights are cut that means those terrorist..are actually winning.
Also they were using unencrypted normal sms for coordination!
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:35:36
Is HODL (not selling)some better😉
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:08:01
You're about 5-7 years late with this budget.
Good luck though!
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:43:54
Ok,giving second thought of it I realize many people have lost money.
I will take responsibility(not delate or edit)for what I wrote ..and apologise.
