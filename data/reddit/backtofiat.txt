I'm genuinely not evading taxes or doing anything illegal. I intend to pay exactly what I owe on these profits (taking the necessary deduction or however it works for what I put in to buy them in the first place - will talk to my accountant about this.) 
I'm fine with sacrificing personal information. I've given my full name and address to Bitstamp, for instance. It's just my SSN that I'm concerned about. Can I trust Bitstamp with my ssn? Will they actually turn my btc into cash for me?
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:39:29
This is disrespectful because it's mealy mouthed and pretends to be neutral. It's insulting the intelligence of the BTC community. 
With that said, I was referring to their other conduct.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:22:32
If push comes to shove I will probably give Bitstamp my SSN, it's just something I'd prefer not to do if I can help it - especially since I have no guarantees they will actually fulfill the transaction smoothly (has anyone gotten US dollars out of Bitstamp lately? Can you tell me your experience?). I don't understand why I can't give them the EIN of my personal LLC - it's still a valid tax id number. I guess I could email them about this.

I took the 12 word seed directly from bc.i using the method you described.
The alternate method seems to just be the sweeping thing I already tried? I think. 
Direct BCH support would be nice - I just wish there was a timetable for when they're going to add it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:42:23
12 world seed does not work.
Thank you, but I tried this but it still reads 0 btc. I definitely did not use capitalization in the seed phrase / tried this multiple times to be sure I wasn't making some sort of typographical error.
When I look at the addresses in bc.i it actually does say "Not backed up by your Recovery Phrase. Transfer into a wallet to secure funds." I don't understand what this means. If the coins are on the address, they should be in my wallet, no? And sure, I could transfer them, but at that point I might as well just move them where I need to - and this doesn't help me access my BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:15:52
Yes. It has coins on it, I promise. "Final Balance" is positive.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:35:15
When I'm logged into my blockchain.info account it definitely says I have a nonzero dollar amount in the top right corner of the screen.
It's possible I imported a private key to blockchain.info at some point, sure. You're probably right. If so, why won't importing the private key of that address into Electrum work? Another user said that blockchain.info's privkey export "has been broken for quite some time" - this worries me. Is my BCH just lost forever (or until blockchain.info decides to offer support for bitcoin cash)?
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:54:55
Sure, but I tried that and it just said "No inputs found."
My understanding is that sweeping just creates a transaction anyway - but, in any event, yes you're right I could do that and normally it would make more sense but I ultimately want to split the bitcoin cash out of this wallet using a bch electrum fork. I'm first testing the process with the btc in Electrum proper. If I can't get it to work this way then I'm clearly doing something wrong / missing something, right?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:38:24
But there's only one address with unspent coins and that's the one I'm using. I tried adding the ones with 0 coins as well but it didn't change anything.

Do I create the new wallet with a new seed? Doing it this way, if I go to "wallet" --&gt; "Private Keys" --&gt; "Sweep" I am then prompted to enter the private keys and an address at the bottom.
I assume the address at the bottom is just the destination for this wallet, so I paste in the single private key for the "Imported Bitcoin Address" with the btc on it from blockchain.info, and click "Sweep". It then says "No inputs found. (Note that inputs need to be confirmed.)"

Because they refuse to implement mandatory replay protection, it's extremely likely that a lot of not-so-technical people are inadvertently going to lose btc whilst trying to use their s2x. The issue is that a transaction on the s2x chain is going to be equally valid on the btc chain. I'm technical and I don't even want to touch this shit with a ten foot pole because it seems so sloppily implemented right now.
Any fork that doesn't implement mandatory two way replay protection is a bad-faith attack on Bitcoin. Fuck these people. If they want bigger blocks so badly, they should just mine Bitcoin Cash (which I would consider to be a good-faith fork of Bitcoin due to the fact that it has two-way replay protection).

actually I'd argue they're even worse than IOUs since their legal page literally says they aren't obligated to redeem your USDT for fiat money


the whole argument about whether or not they're "solvent" (have enough money to back each coin) seems asinine on its face since they come right out and say they don't have to pay you back. what does it even matter?
basically I don't understand how tether is substantially different than saying "I am now the federal reserve" and printing your own FunBucks and asking people to give you USD for them
it's like a shady premined altcoin that's skipped the part where they premine and instead just said "lol hey we are the only ones that can mine this, wanna buy it?" -- isn't this this exactly the kind of thing that Bitcoin was created to get around?

There are other explanations. You can be greedy and still get bamboozled into supporting the price of of something which is inherently worthless.
Your average Bitcoin user (like most people) may lack intelligence. Or, like most people, they may be easily manipulated, especially by people who can afford to buy out control of the media, hire behavioral psychologists to figure out the best way to package an idea, and pay through the teeth for all sorts of insidious attacks against Bitcoin (imo S2X is little more than one of these attacks).
I'm not trying to be all doom-and-gloom here but fiat money isn't worth a god damn thing but people have still valued it for centuries just because some prominent wealthy families insist those little green notes mean something. Protecting Bitcoin from these people is not going to be a simple thing.

The worst part is that this seems to be the most trusted / most secure BCH wallet out there. So if you happen to be holding BCH or want to sell it or otherwise use it, you're just shit out of luck on security and you have to either deal with Ver's borderline scam wallet or some hastily slapped together piece of shit like Electron Cash (with an anonymous creator, no less).
Seriously, look into the BCH wallet situation if you haven't -- it's a mess.

I have some idea of how to opt-in (mostly from reading stack exchange, etc) but have never done it before. Didn't Bitcoin Cash have only opt-in replay protection at first, but then they changed it to have mandatory replay protection? Hopefully the S2X guys pull their heads out of their asses and add mandatory replay protection. Without it, it feels like more of an actual attack on Bitcoin than any kind of legitimate-grievance fork.

The reality is that the State is eventually going to realize that Bitcoin - or something like it - is a threat to the current banking system. Whether we like it or not, governments will get involved with this stuff, they will try their damndest to regulate it, and in the end it doesn't matter if someone is "tattling" or not because we're going to have to deal with this stuff either way.
I'm not saying you're wrong, but it's naive to think that people won't run to the government to try to protect their investments. They will, even if you chastise them about it. The only question that matters is whether or not the system is resistant to government interference.

I've said it before and I've said it again: Coinbase is hot garbage. If you use Coinbase just because it's convenient, you are doing a disservice to Bitcoin and to yourself. It'll be convenient for awhile until they freeze your funds for no reason, with no explanation. It'll be convenient for awhile until their site goes down for like five days and you lose $10000 because you wanted to sell and the price got massacred. Good luck getting in touch with their support for any kinds of problem - you might get a response in a week or two if you're lucky.
Coinbase is Paypal for Bitcoin, and it comes with all the draconian evils of Paypal and more. In fact, it's worse than Paypal - because it's brought a plethora of fiat-style problems to crypto.
Trusting Coinbase with your money is stupid and reckless. Use an exchange. Use ANY alternative. Don't move a single satoshi through Coinbase unless you are prepared to lose access to it, perhaps permanently, due to either their incompetence or malice as a company.
