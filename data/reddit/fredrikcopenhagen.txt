I found this post on Coindesk, and since i´m not from the states, the service is not yet open for me to test. Has anybody tested it? and is the service first of all legit?

I have been experimenting, paying my programmer in Bangalore with bitcoin using UnoCoin, and so far it has worked like a charm.
All i did was to have my programmer verify an account with UnoCoin, sent coins to the adress they provided, wait 6 confirmations and reguest a payout to an indian bankaccount. 
From the time I sent the coins, till the INR was available at my programmers bankaccount, took 13 hours.

Hi BillBurros,
Try  there you dont need to create an account but simply punch in the bitcoin address you want the coins delivered to, specify the amount you want to buy for, and then pay with your credit or debit card. The service is however only available to non-US clients.
You can also setup a "donation link", but please ask their support for further details. This might be a good solution for your need.

By paying with Visa and Mastercard, you are ensured of delivery through their chargeback rules. Yes i have used it several times myself

I got a Bit-x debit card through their partner ccedk.com when i met them at a conference in copenhagen denmark, and it is working fine!.
After 30 seconds on bit-x.com, i found this page:  it states that you can order a card after you have set up an account.
