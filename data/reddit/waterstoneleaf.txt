done properly paper wallets , armoury software  or hardware trenzor wallet, are safer than a web based wallet. Common recommendation is to only have small amounts on web based wallets.

mm I no longer seem to be able to login , perhaps I'm blocking something I shouldn't be, but I don't have anything to click to sign in with youtube.

oh , all I can think is if you check the 4 addresses which sent to this one maybe it will refresh your memory, or could it be a change address from whichever wallet you used.  
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:37:49
 400 bits
@_date: 2014-11-28 09:24:09
Ahh thank you
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:26:04
I went to downvote this bit rude response but then I saw your username and thought fair enough.  
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:18:16
something like the coinstar machines , except of course paying out bitcoin   
  
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:57:45
when I've used bittylicious it was a UK account I sent my money too, I had the bitcoins in my wallet address within 10 min. bittybot is not a wallet.

I'm not sure about card payments but if you can do a bank transfer   is really easy and fast 1bitcoin for £255 at the moment.   
 will give you a list of prices for uk sites.
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:17:31
That's a multisig address.  
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:29:27
Why does he want to dissolve it?
Is this the guy that does the 3d printed gun?
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:34:25
this is a technicality for sure , as I understand it no bitcoins are moving he is more like receiving permission to spend some.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:53:13
reading it but still would not know what to do with it, surprised one of the bots haven't picked it up yet.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:37:42
I use this mycelium seems pretty popular around here
@_date: 2014-12-19 08:16:45
Make your own  
  
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:02:37
if you create an account they increase the limit, If you verify yourself they increase it more. I't can be a steep learning curve bitcoin be careful of moving too quickly and not understanding fully what you are doing, don't want to go wrong and loose money, there are plenty stories on here of people doing just that.
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:40:09
  
electrum is recommended a lot here , its small and fast 
but it does depend on your needs and security considerations.
You might find the web based    easier if it's just for a one off , some people  can buy via circle with UK cards , though it did not work for me
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:13:07
missed it but this is quite fun , hope someone doesn't just write a bot to crack it.
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:24:50
Never been a miner so little idea what this means.  
Does it mean mining will become slightly easier because there is less miners?
If that's roughly true what happens if after the drop lots more big miners switch on ? 
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:31:05
No that was me, thanks never figured out before how people did that.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:23:09
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:03:27
How did you notice this OP?
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:32:43
I'm running a full node , how would I query the stored blockchain I have?
as a non programmer are there tools out there to do this?
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:36:44
yeah finally figuring it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:45:47
Thanks I'll take a look.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:31:55
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:29:02
Good points you raise there, It would be good if there were simple to follow guidelines for groups and companies accepting bitcoin on how to overcome each of these hurdles, are there any groups working on this?  
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:33:10
looks to me like that last transaction returned to the original address where the 35BTC came from, the again I could be reading this wrong hard to figure it all out.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:44:15
I second that , never had a problem always quick longest it's taken was half an hour. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:27:40
was the last time you took one when it was $130 also
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:28:41
This looks good , however I'd really like to search by country, as mostly I like to buy from within the UK due to postage costs and time taken for item to arrive.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:53:40
So you got an advertising site and you are advertising it by giving folk bitcoins. ok
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:20:50
pretty sure you can sell small amounts , where the front page normally says buy it's a drop down menu you can change to sell, as in not the bit at the bottom that says become a seller , that's for large amounts I guess.
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:14:26
there's 
can do a bank transfer of funds have your coins in 5+ minutes if you got internet banking and your bank does faster payments (most banks do)
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:09:20
why not?
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:01:36
I think you just got the answer.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:54:08
yup all synced both latest versions.
This is the transaction  
   
still no confirmations on armory
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:01:03
That's what I thought too
@_date: 2015-02-20 09:43:23
play with anagrams  
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:06:19
and from here on we don't even know what that name was
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:42:39
Ah I see Armory is behind blockchain.info on the latest block number
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:55:41
I've carried out my first transaction with the new Armory, The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain (20 confirmations) but still shows as unconfirmed/unspendable  on Armory . Have tried restarting it but still no confirmations?
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:25:43
what size are the files, maybe just pick the biggest.
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:52:42
so I shut down Armory and ran bitcoin core on it's own , got it synced restarted Armory  , says it is synced but it's really about 50 blocks behind.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:27:37
Thanks , got that running now sure takes ages but hopefully will sort it out.
