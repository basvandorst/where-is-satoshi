I'll defer to Poon &amp; Dryja's napkin math in the lightning network whitepaper:


(tps) on its network during the 2013 holidays[2], and currently averages
hundreds of millions per day. Currently, Bitcoin supports less than 7 transactions
per second with a 1 megabyte block limit. If we use an average of 300
bytes per bitcoin transaction and assumed unlimited block sizes, an equivalent
capacity to peak Visa transaction volume of 47,000/tps would be nearly
8 gigabytes per Bitcoin block, every ten minutes on average. Continuously,
that would be over 400 terabytes of data per year.
That is a conservative estimate if the goal is to become a currency with true widespread adoption.  That only covers you buying coffee, lunch, and whatever dumb shit you bought on amazon.  It doesn't count the weekly payroll that funded your checking account to use that debit card or credit card, you paying your monthly bills, the stores you buy that crap from paying their employees and suppliers, etc.  
Following that figure anyhow, you would need an NAS with a dozen high end 5TB hard drives to run a node for just one year.  You most certainly wouldn't be running a node at home.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:02:34
Yea, I checked the [graph]( and you're right.  I had only seen BTC difficulty graphs as looking like steps, no volatility up and down at all, so I didn't know that.  Interesting.  So the only reason mining consumes so much power is because of the rat race to mine more than everybody else.  If by some miracle everybody agreed to go back to GPU mining, the difficulty would just adjust back to where it was years ago.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:27:09
Avoiding being too specific.  Less than OP, but still 5 digits.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:14:01
In the context of the original post that implied that is the driving force behind BTC's value.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:55:07
At some point to become a usable currency the price will have to stabilize.  Anyhow, that's why I said I don't see it being a problem for the vast majority of users anyhow.  Those who will want to use BTC like it is paypal, will need it to be as simplified as paypal.  That does not include hardware wallets and running full nodes.  More like a paypal or coinbase type payment service they log into and call it a day.  THEY run the full nodes, as do the serious investors with $10,000+ invested.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:49:28


Except right now its useless as a currency.  Plus most of the bull run is not from people using it as a currency anyhow.  
People here like to poke fun at "weak hands", but those weak hands are what bought people moon lambos.  If they all decided to exit, you'd be back where you were a year ago or two years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:05:51


So that is somehow correlated to an increase in BTC value?  Rather then the simple explanation that what was a relatively small user base experienced rapid growth as more and more stories emerged about bitcoin millionaires buying lambos?


BTC can lose value just as easily if enough of the demand came from people just trying to get rich.  If that were not the case, it would be much less volatile.  That's why the phrase "market correction" exists.  Not "market I have no idea why its dropping after suddenly being on fire"

@_date: 2018-01-06 03:13:35
Exactly it got flooded too quickly to adapt to the increase in volume, and none of the surge in volume is even using it as a currency.  If nothing changes this is very bad. What will be interesting to see is what happens if/when it can stabilize as a currency rather then a bunch of speculators.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:25:23


Its slightly off subject in regards to lightning.  The assumption when the block reward drops from 6.25 to 0 is that mining will continue for the fees.  If lightning supresses those fees by restraining the block size and fees, wouldn't that eliminate the incentive to mine?  I know its years away, but its something that needs to be solved before we get there not when it happens and suddenly no more blocks are being mined.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:55:38
You're speaking with the benefit of hindsight.  At the time, investing in the right company like Facebook would require understanding it, so he was smart to avoid it.
Investing in hype without understanding the fundamentals results in pulling a Yahoo and buying broadcast.com from Mark Cuban for $6 billionaire just to realize it's worth exactly $0 and shut it down years later.  Or pull a news Corp and buy Myspace for $580 million in 2005 then sell it for $35 million in 2011.
One day someone like Peter Thiel could take his place.  Since PayPal he's made most his money recognizing the future winners in tech.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:02:08
Because that was not him but his future replacement being allowed some freedom.  There has been plenty of talk about it because it was so unexpected.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:07:34
Actually, the more that I begin to understand the lightning network solution the less that I believe in it.  Why are we fixing the blockchain by introducing an entirely new layer on top of it that completely changes the way the whole system works?
The fundamental problem with simply automatically increasing the blocksize every time is that the blockchain will eventually become too large to run a full node on a home computer.  Lightning Network doesn't even solve that problem, it just prolongs it.  It seems like a solution that somehow truncates the blockchain over time is more ideal.  Do we really need to know every transaction that took place in 2009 when its 2049?  
If bitcoin were to see widespread adoption, even with the truncating solution or lightning network solution, it will eventually become impossible to run a full node without investing in commercial grade hardware for that purpose.  There needs to be incentive to do so.  You don't want exchanges being the only ones running nodes, that is going back to the centralized banking system bitcoin sought to avoid.
The other problem being ignored is that the blockchain relies on miners.  With no more new coins being produced in the near future, they will need incentive to keep running.  Supposedly they will just rely on fees, but even with the current crazy high fees it would become unprofitable to mine.  Again, lightning network isn't solving this issue.

Clearly it has never gone down then.  Everyone is just on crack.
Yes, adoption.  Most growth has not been in adoption as a currency, not even "store of value", but in "get rich quick".
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:04:56
The problem is that sending 10% (cold storage/hardware wallet) will still get hit with the same exorbitant fees, would it not?  
It sounds like its starting to emulate the current banking system where micro payments can be done quickly with debit or ach, and larger payments are slower and more expensive (wire).  Except you can only fund your savings account by wire in this case.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:26:22
Thanks for the honesty and keeping your head checked.  So many people think they were geniuses and knew the price would go to the moon.  Bullshit.  Even a lot of believers believed in it as a currency, not as an investment.

The proper answer is "hold them both".  It's called diversification.  If silver crashes for good, you'll be glad you had bitcoin and other holdings.  If bitcoin crashes for good, you'll be glad you had silver and other holdings.

BTC blockchain is 9 years old and 180GB. ETH blockchain is less than 2 years old and 337GB.  It is following the same principal as BCH by disregarding potential problems of larger blocks or more frequent blocks (In ETH's case the blocks are smaller, but so frequent that it surpasses BTC hourly size increase).  Personally, I'm not sure this is really a problem since most casual users wouldn't run a full node anyhow.

That's an interesting chart.  Insane number of abandoned or very low value addresses.  About 17,000 people currently holding $1M+ worth of btc.  Rather, at most 17,000.

@_date: 2018-01-09 11:41:02
Even more interesting.  That sounds like a fatal flaw that bitcoin (core) should have addressed as well.  I can see that in theory the hash power should be properly decentralized, and it could be considered a feature to retire itself for whatever the new consensus coin is.  However, there's a lot of hash power concentrated in China, as well as only a handful of people.  Rather than a consensus, it can be killed by force.  For example, if chinese government forces a sudden shut down of miners, or a countrywide prolonged power outage.

When the fork happened, everything up until that moment was identical on both sides.  If you moved your BTC off of coinbase BEFORE the fork, then you indeed would have no BCH on coinbase.  If you had 1BTC in your own wallet when the fork happened, you would have 1BCH as well.  The same private key would be used to access your BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:42:28
Ok, if I sold you a house and said "congratulations, due to shenanigans, you have an identical but lower value house on the side of town too!  The same key opens both.".  You go to your new house, but only see one house.  Of course.  You have to drive across town to the other house.  You have the key.
The same private key will access your BCH with a BCH wallet. 
 People recommend moving your BTC to a new address first, since its a shared private key. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:50:06
Not if that country is China.  There is so much concentration of hashing power there that a sudden halt could threaten to do to core what happened to segwit2x.  Except in segwit2x's case its ok because it was a consensus to kill it in favor of core or cash.  In this case it would be brute force.  There is already talk of Chinese authorities shutting down mining operations, and its not unheard of for totalitarian measures to happen there such as waking up tomorrow and hearing that overnight all mining operations were raided and shutdown simultaneously.  Confirmation times are already high right now.  Is there enough mining power outside of China to even reach 2016 blocks for a difficulty adjustment?  Sounds like a weakness in that scenario rather then a safety mechanism.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:20:06
Only if you're investing in volatile and risky stocks.  Otherwise, where are you putting that initial investment + 10% now?  A 0.0001% interest savings account? Storing value in BTC will be as trusted as storing it in the market once BTC is less volatile and has been around for decades without imploding.

What I saw elsewhere is there is apparently a bounty.  So much like mining, people can churn away trying to catch cheaters 24/7 for the bounty.  Its still mighty confusing, its like lets relieve the blockchain by creating another less secure blockchain off the blockchain.

I think both solutions are far from ideal.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:22:57
You would have to believe so strongly in bitcoin that you see no reason to keep the money elsewhere unless you need to liquidate for something.  I don't agree, but I can understand it.  
You're coming from the logic that I share, that this is way too volatile to hold forever.  It's not as safe as an index fund or bonds.  If I didn't cash out my holdings at $600 and stop paying attention to btc for over a year, I would probably have been cashing out 20-50% of it at some point soon after the recent ATH drop.  The rest let it ride.
Also, despite all the "HODL!!!!" talk you hear, long time holders cashing out is a very simple explanation for why you see wild volatility like this after a crazy all time high.  If you bought a bunch of coin at $600, seeing it dropping from an all time high of almost $20k sounds like a great time to exit.

That's pretty ridiculous.  Ideas evolve and pivot.  Its not even like Satoshi's work was 100% original.  He built off of the work of others at the time.  His primary contribution was addressing the double spending problem.  He didn't address how to scale.

I just know that I feel much of BCH support is only temporary because of the mempool and fee issue.  If and when BTC solves that, BCH is probably taking a dump.  I don't get why a consensus could not be reached to increase the blocksize as a stopgap measure while working on a longterm solution.  Instability helps neither coin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:56:48
No, it hasn't.  A year ago selling BTC took a few days to hit my bank.  Now I'm sitting and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  No money.  Nobody responds to anything.  About to drive out to San Francisco and demand a resolution, but they'd probably just call the police to remove me.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:23:03
No, that is like saying "I didn't login and check my bank balance, therefor I must have no money".  The wallet needs to download and parse the full blockchain in order to confirm your balance.  Not doing that does not mean there is nothing there.
If you had 1BTC before the fork, you have 1BCH you can access with the same private key.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:33:04

From the whitepaper


if one’s counterparty has broadcast an invalidated Commitment Transaction,
or delegate a third party to do so. A third party can be delegated by only
giving the Breach Remedy transaction to this third party. They can be
incentivized to watch the blockchain broadcast such a transaction in the
event of counterparty maliciousness by giving these third parties some fee
in the output. Since the third party is only able to take action when the
counterparty is acting maliciously, this third party does not have any power
to force close of the channel.
Its sounding more and more rediculous to me.  So the solution to scale enough for every common Joe to be able to use BTC requires them to constantly monitor the blockchain to see if they're being screwed?  That is more complicated not less complicated.  Or alternatively, they need to hire a bounty hunter to monitor the blockchain for them, and trust that the bounty hunter doesn't screw them too?

That is precisely WHY they make you jump through hoops.  The vast majority of mortgages since 2008 now just get flipped to the government (fannie/freddie).  
With an FHA you're putting next to nothing down.  For a "lender" that basically no longer takes on any loans or risk anymore, they get stuck with a whole lot of risk exposure if they miss one little detail that disqualifies your loan.


Again, same thing.  When you get a car loan, you're talking to the people actually loaning you the money.  When you get a mortgage, you're talking to the people floating cash for a few months on behalf of the government.  You're extra careful when you're basically loaning out somebody else's money.
I sold my house for $250,000 to a couple who together make like 1/4 what I do, and it was an FHA loan so they closed for basically $8000 down altogether.  Meanwhile, I got denied for my $500,000 house 2 months later despite having $350,000 cash on it because I didn't fit the government standards.  No traditional lender would work with me.

Nobody who shut down and/or sold off their S7's last year during the downturn is repeating that mistake.  I had a burned out fan and didn't bother replacing it, and sold off my BTC instead of following through with the next phase of my original plan to setup 10-20 antminers in eastern WA while I was living up there.  That turned out to be a million dollar mistake.  I know I'm not repeating that unless it turns into like a 12 month streak.

The current reward if you find a block yourself is 12.5 btc plus the transaction fees you get to collect, about $180,000 at today's value.
[However, your odds of solo mining a block are 1 block in 4129 days with an antminer s7](
[For shits and giggles]( if you bought 12 used antminer s7's then your small farm has better odds, 1 block in the year.  That's a nice $190k reward assuming today's BTC value, but would cost you $32,200 ($12,000 for the miners + $1,200 for power supplies + $19,000 for electricity assuming $0.12/kwh average power cost in US).  $32,200 is a lot for what is STILL a game of chance, when you could just mine in a pool instead.

CPU and GPU mining is no longer cost effective, you need dedicated ASIC mining hardware such as a bitmain antminer.
Mining alone you could go for a long long time and not get anything or you can luck out and mine a block and get the entire reward  some people solo mine and treat it like lottery, most mine in a pool like slushpool so everybody gets a fractional share of the rewards that the entire pool earns.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:42:25
If you react to corrections by selling, and rallies by buying, you are terrible at investing.  The only thing differentiating investment in bitcoin from the stock market is people have more justifiable doubts about the underlying value of BTC.  
If you tell me a stock that I follow just dropped 30% my response is "thanks, sounds like a great entry point for another $10,000!".  
That was precisely my reaction when I heard about the price drop.  I missed it and entered at 13k, now I am ~$1000 richer.

Yes, people fail to grasp the "intrinsic" part of that oft repeated statement.
If you have a company with $10,000,000 in the bank and 1,000,000 total shares exist, those shares have an intrinsic value of $10.  That $10 is not imaginary value based on speculative demand.  If its current market price is $100 per share, that $90 is extrinsic value and can disappear in a heartbeat because there is nothing actually backing that up.
The USD has **intrinsic** value because the US government is NOT going to stop backing it.  If you owe $100 in taxes, a $100 bill will always fulfill that debt.
Bitcoin has **extrinsic** value.  Sure, its selling for $9000 or so right now, but there is absolutely nothing backing that value and may just as well be worth $1.
For those that like comparing to gold, that is all extrinsic value as well.  Its industrial value is far eclipsed by speculation.  That is why even the legal tender value is imprinted as $1 on a freakin $1000 coin.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:23:15
How exactly does that solve anything?  
Did a more stable currency like the USD not exist?  Oh, it did.  
Did people holding more valuable currencies like the USD not devalue their own currency further and contribute to inflation?  It did.
Would replacing USD with BTC in such a scenario cause the same problem?  It would.
If BTC existed back then it would not solve the currency's hyperinflation problem.

These "bitcoin advocates" are either being dishonest (mccafee? draper? They're playing you idiots to increase their value as much as they can before they exit) or brain dead.  The very factor that makes you money holding BTC is the thing that makes it worthless as a currency.  Our economy is HEAVILY dependant on credit.  Consumers need credit to buy homes and cars.  Businesses need credit to buy buildings and sometimes to expand.  When the best thing to do with a currency is to hoard it, the economy would grind to a halt.

I assume you're referring to the 1920's economic situation.  Yes, declaring a war against most of the civilized world and losing might degrade you to third world country status.
You're also referencing an event that happened 100 years ago.  So what is it, a 1 in 100 year event? 1 in 500?  Giving up the benefits of state sponsored fiat currencies to protect against that rare of an event is foolish.  That's like somebody who earns $30,000/year spending $100,000 on "prepping".  Sure, if the apocalypse comes they'll be glad they did it, but outside that 1 in a million event they just gave up a hell of a lot for that protection.
 &gt;You've got it completely backwards. The United creates more currency to "prevent" a recession. It cannot do the reverse to save the dollar without literally destroying the economy. It's a one way street. Period.
**Controlled** inflation does not destroy the currency or economy.  It encourages spending and investment, which spurs the economy.  If the USD were deflationary like bitcoin, nobody would spend any of it unless they were starving, and the economy would grind to a halt.

It's more than just the fact of "advertising that you won".  Self made wealth is usually known to others by the time they get there too.  Yes, they've had time to adjust to the fact that everyone is after their money, but the fact is they were less likely to be surrounded by such people in the first place.  Someone who busted his ass from $0 to $500,000,000 probably didn't hang out with a bunch of bums or family with no work ethic in the first place.  Someone "suddenly rich" needs to make a lot of sudden lifestyle changes to avoid the pitfalls that most lottery winners find makes them miserable.  
Someone who is fit to retain their wealth probably didn't play much lottery in the first place also, and is much less likely to ever win.

Oh man, if only those children could have held a more reliable currency!  I know such a thing has never existed until Bitcoin.  (/s for the idiots, they could have just held the USD)
You realize that holding a different currency causes further inflation, right?
If everybody in a country jumped to BTC, their local currency loses value and inflates.
This is why other countries try to pressure people not to hold the US Dollar.
It is the same reason why they do (and will) pressure them not to hold BTC.

Ok.  So how would that work then?
Let's play a mind exercise.  Let's assume BTC has gained full international adoption.  You get paid in BTC.  You get 10 BTC per year salary.  Everything around you is price in BTC, and likewise the price does not fluctuate based on fiat conversion regardless if up or down.  
How would that work when BTC is deflationary?  Mining will eventually stop producing coins, if not already there in this scenario.  People will lose their private keys.  People will die and nobody knows their key.  The circulation will decrease, and thus value MUST go up.  Which means your salary goes down yearly, not up.  The price of houses, cars, and coffee must go down, not up.  So every year you are increasingly less able to repay that 57 BTC loan anyhow.

Oh, but, they can.  More in a moment.


That is what I alluded to when I said that government cooperation might not matter much in a failed state.  A first world country has significantly more power to keep that from happening.


Yes.  If/when that happens to Bitcoin there is no recourse.  
If/when that happens to fiat currency, the sponsoring state can manipulate the currency back on track.  The U.S. has done it multiple times now to turnaround recessions.  That is, they can do that if it is a first world country or world superpower.  In the case of countries like Venezuela, good fucking luck.
That is why Bitcoin has far more appeal to failed states or poor states.  It has far more appeal to poor people in the first world due to high risk/reward.  It has low appeal to the ruling classes.  Without their support it will not displace the fiat currency.  Everyone and their mother can accept personal payments in bitcoin, but if you can't pay your bills, buy lunch, and go grocery shopping with it then it is nothing more than a replacement for paypal/western union.
That is not a bad thing, though.  Just falls short of the "TAKING OVER THE WORLD!!!!" bullshit.

If you have a $500 giftcard that has an intrinsic value of &lt; $1 in materials.  Its worth $500 because of its acceptance.  
Bitcoin DOES have value so long as it is widely accepted to have value.  The problem with that is the government will not suddenly change its mind on accepting USD, but consensus that bitcoin is valuable can change rapidly and suddenly.  Hence no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:14:09
Its a matter of whether they need the capital or not.  During the subprime boom over 10 years ago all the banks were going nuts offering $100-200 incentives just to open accounts.  Now they all stick to strict rules on what loans they'll write because they turn around and just flip it to the government (fannie mae, freddie mac).  Which is funny when people here point out that they only need to keep like a 1% reserve... well they only hold on to loans for a few months before selling it off so who cares?

You are still applying your 2018 knowledge to it.  This is easy for you to say now, but why should it have been "life changing"?   Not many people realistically believed BTC would be worth what it is today.  Just like many today doubt it will be worth $250,000 or $1,000,000 in 7 more years.  Hell, if I knew that back then I would have bought 100,000 BTC instead of my first house with $120,000 cash.
The USD to CAD exchange rate at the time was about $1 USD = $0.88 CAD.  The BTC value was USD$1.08 or CAD$1.22.  He was asking $120 CAD over market value for his 4000 BTC.  Today's equivalent (06/09/2018 current price is $7604 per 1 btc) is asking $7800 for BTC.  You wouldn't scold him for "no upside" and the transaction not being "life changing", you would scold him for being greedy when you can get that your fucking self on coinbase for $7600.

Cool.  If you win, I still win.  Non-liquid assets like real estate wouldn't suddenly become worthless, and I probably hold a larger percentage of BTC circulation than I do USD cash, and I don't need that money so I can keep the trezor locked up and forget I own it for a while.

They also graph using long-term data. The spike in usage for mining has been rapid and short term.  Much like the typical response around here to the current bear market -- zoom out and it's just a blip.
if they actually did consider it, there's no reason to assume the trend will just continue.  If Bitcoin were configured differently there is already enough processing power to handle quite a significant transaction volume, it's just being artificially limited and wasted by increased difficulty.
Tldr: too unpredictable to assume mining electricity usage will continue to increase at that rate.

Dollars are no longer valuable if people stop perceiving it to be valuable, and the same goes for bitcoin.  Good enough?

When you claim a currency is "backed" by something, or that it holds intrinsic value, you are referring to a currency that is equivalent to a valued asset like gold.  Please take note that the article is even on a GOLD news site.
The argument that Fiat is not backed by anything is that Fiat currency holds value simply because we all agree to attribute value to it.  As compared to a gold backed currency which holds value because I own fucking gold.  Saying a currency is backed by math is... What the fuck?  I own math? What does that even mean?

If you're just shifting money around within paypal's ecosystem without using a fiat onramp or buyer's protection for purchasing goods, you can accomplish that with $0 fees.
The paypal fees come from using a credit/debit card (as just like exchanges, they incur costs themselves to do this) and/or buyer protection when buying something from a business and want to be able to reverse it if they screw you.  I don't know of the latter even existing in the bitcoin ecosystem, but the on/off ramps through exchanges certainly incur fees as well.

Timing the market obviously works, that's the entire idea: buy low, sell high.  What doesn't work is idiots with lack of patience trying to hit the exact bottom and top, and end up failing as they panic sell or fomo buy. This is what this common advice is referring to. Example, I recently bought TSLA at 309 as it was a low point on a 1 year chart. Then it dropped as low as 250 range.  Most people panic sell at that point and thus "fail to time the market".  I held on and it's now 340. Time to set stop loss triggers.

Oh bullshit.  The value went up because people saw all the "19 year old bitcoin millionaire" articles over the last few years and wanted their own moon lambo too.  The rapid increase in value actually destroyed its usefulness as a currency so much that people now call it a "storage of wealth" instead.
I mean, how many posts do you see about how bitcoin has changed the world versus "when next bull run??".
**Bitcoin will have potential to change the world when people no longer talk about bull runs and moon lambos.**


Nope.  I believe bitcoin was the first to address the double spend problem, making a decentralized peer to peer currency possible.
However, all technology is iterative for a reason.  We don't nail it the first time around.
I don't think satoshi was a master economist and his scheme of mining difficulty increases, reward halving, and finite supply were meant as a final solution but rather just to get the thing off the ground as a live proof of concept.  Much like the wright brothers' first plane to get off the ground was most certainly not the final solution to air travel, it just proved the concept and sparked the wave of innovation that did get us there.
I've said it a hundred times and I'll say it again.  There is a good reason that all fiat currencies to date have been inflationary rather then deflationary.  It forces you to spend it or invest it, otherwise it will lose its value.  If it increases in value just by sitting on it, then people will do exactly that.  Why invest in new technologies or companies, when you can just sit on your money until you're rich?  
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:11:51

If you invest your money, which is what it encourages, you outpace that inflation.  Deflation encourages just hoarding money aka HODL.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:32:07
Yea, not bitcoin.  Atleast not anything resembling its current state.  There are many problems, not just with user friendliness and scaling up to handle massive transaction volume, but right down to the core concept of decentralization.  Its already pretty damn centralized in China.  If it displaced fiat currencies like people here want to happen, state sponsored attacks become a serious threat.  What is to stop the chinese government from seizing bitmain and all those mining operations, much like the US government's current fear about china controlling so much manufacturing of networking hardware?
Then the whole core principal of deflation.  How many coins have economists on their team?  It has to do more than just technically work.  Economies boom when people spend their money, not stuff it under a mattress.  Even billionaires do not just sit on top of a massive pile of $100 bills.  They spend it (invest it) or it loses value.  Devaluation encourages everyone from the top to bottom to just sit on the coins, if all the HODL memes didn't make that obvious.  How can you have a thriving economy where you're better off sitting on your money rather then investing it into businesses?  Hell, why run a business or hold down a job at all?  If bitcoin suddenly displaced fiat today, Apple would be better off firing everybody and just sitting on their coins rather then doing anything productive at all.  Hyper-inflation is a problem, but there is a reason not a single country burns bills instead of printing more.

I own commercial real estate.  It has intrinsic value because even if the USD tanked, it serves a utilitarian function.  People need the space to do stuff, they're willing to pay whether that is in USD, gold, bitcoin, or galactic federation credits.

I own US dollars.  They have no (or very very little, ie toilet paper) intrinsic value because they are paper.

Replying again and quoting it to preserve the comment since it seems you edited most of that in while I was typing previous reply.
Let me clarify.   When I said 10-15&amp; I **was** referring to historical averages.  The 10 year average is weighed down to 10&amp; by the inclusion of 2008.  Any longer term average is basically just 15&amp; and yes going all the way back to the post-war period mentioned by u/deselby_III
I wasn't speaking to my own personal performance.  I've actually had good luck and outperformed in shit years like 2015 through trading.  Mostly dumb luck though.  For example buying RAI and BUD when I heard early merger rumors at trade conferences well before they became widespread, or CVX when oil dipped, or AAPL when it dropped in 2015/2016, or more recently FB when cambridge analytica blew up and the damn stock is already back to ATH.  I've had some shit trades as well of course, but net positive overall.


Sooner indeed, 2018 is halfway done and shaping up to be a shit year.  The Trump honeymoon is over, and the market does not like the shit he's been pulling.  I've made up for it so far with trades like FB as mentioned, and the TSLA I bought at 309 and just sold at 360 on friday.  Too bad I can't trade with the kids' 529 accounts in CA, that's basically a wash this year.

You are failing horribly to understand what backing a currency, or intrinsic value, actually means.
If I don't trust Bitcoin, why does it hold value to me? That you wasted power creating it, or suppressed it's supply, means absolutely nothing to me.
Saying a currency is "backed" by gold holds value to me because even if it's an Ethiopian coin I wouldn't trust to be worth shit, if it's made of gold your still giving me fucking gold.
What your saying is like me paying you with my autograph and arguing that I suppressed the supply to only five in existence so it's incredibly valuable. What? What the fuck does that matter to you?
In this case Bitcoin is no different from Fiat.  It is valuable to people only because that decided to agree that it is valuable.

We're talking cpu mining days. Seeds weren't a thing back then, nor was BTC a valued asset anyhow. It was easy to mine and sold cheap.  You didn't realize in 2010 that it'd be worth thousands per coin years later.  There was no precedent for that 


When I was mining it was profitable, you didn't have to speculate   I diversified OUT of it when mining became unprofitable and became speculation.  If the business were healthy I might have held. 
If you think you're better off at McDonald's rather then spending every waking moment fixing your unprofitable business that used to make you healthy profits and you know can again if you don't let it go bankrupt, then don't ever start a business.
I ho hum about the missed opportunity, but in reality I would've list the business and had to sell anyhow so no regrets.


Uh yes it did.  It did for two years.  Yes it took off after the segwit/bch fork, but that bull run was unprecedented.  Not that Scarlett and that quickly.


Wrong.  Investors look for good entry points all the time.  Ideally you buy when undervalued.  Gambling is "investing" in a non revenue producing asset like Bitcoin where technically even $1 is overvalued.  It is speculation through and through.


No, by the time i could spare the money it was already up in the thousands and I was waiting for it to cool off not fomo in.  That just ended up going way higher than I thought it would, just like the correction continues dropping lower than thought.

Except nobody wants it, nobody can use it for anything, therefor its value is null.  Unless I'm famous.

Oh Bullshit! You're speaking with the benefit of hindsight. If you really knew the 2017 bull run was coming, where is your $100,000,000?  Even those yelling "HODL!" didn't see that shit coming.  A $19,000 BTC was as pie-in-the-sky back then as McAfee's prediction is today. Hell, realistically we have just as much chance if not more so of $0-$1000 than we do $250,000+.  Bitcoin is not a business, there are no fundamentals, it is not INVESTING it is SPECULATING.
For  yes in hindsight I should have held onto the failed hard drive to recover the key once the drive was suddenly worth millions.  At the time, it was a failed hard drive with a few hundred bucks stuck on it.
For  yes in hindsight I should have HODL'ed and continued with my plan to setup 20+ antminers in Wenatchee.  At the time, my business was going through a rough time and it was fucking stupid to invest in miners that were LOSING money at the time.  Especially since it would have increased the chance of my business collapsing if I didn't divert the investment there, and would have probably sold out of desperation to keep my family from homelessness.
For  that is where your "investment" comes into play because my business has recovered and I'm okay if it goes to $0.  I bought the dip at $11k, $10k, and $9k.  I should probably buy a few more at $6k, and if goes to 5 or 4 I'll buy a few more.  Again, it is still speculating.  It is still chance, not "wise investing" if it goes to 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k.

No.  There are/were currencies backed by gold which is the entire point here and in original article. In fact the definition of "Fiat":
Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material from which the money is made
There is no difference between Fiat and Bitcoin as far as backing or intrinsic value.  The difference is it is not issued by any government.

I did not know that about the factor of 4.
So forcing one adjustment then shutting off just forces the network to suddenly have 40 minute blocks.  
However, with the power these dolts are talking about, that quantum miner can force that difficulty adjustment pretty damn quick.  It still would not take long to blow through enough difficulty adjustments that shutting it off would cripple the entire network.
Even in the more plausible scenario of all chinese hashing power suddenly being forced offline, china controls somwhere between 70% and 85% of hashing power.  In that scenario, it would suddenly take somewhere over an hour per block (too tired to calculate right now) for months before adjusting down if those miners never come back up.  That emergency adjustment failsafe sounds like a good idea.  I know that miners would then just jump back and forth between BTC and BCH to exploit them both going through emergency adjustments, but there has to be a better way to implement that to secure against such scenarios?

Stocks are fractional ownership of an actual company producing value. Stocks can absolutely be overvalued due to trading, but then so is Bitcoin. You still possess fractional ownership of a (hopefully) value producing company, whereas with Bitcoin not so much.


Bitcoin doesn't transmit value.  It transmits a token with no value unless we agree to perceive it as valuable.  Chuck e cheese tokens have like $0.000001 of intrinsic value.  They have value only because Chuck e cheese agrees that they do.  Why was Bitcoin $1000 a year ago, $19000 six months ago, and $6000 now? Because there is no intrinsic value setting the price.  It could just as well go back to $500 soon.

...what the fuck?
When you say a currency is "backed" by something, it holds intrinsic value, you are referring to it being valued based on an asset like gold.  If I pay you with a gold coin, it has value because I gave you gold.  If I pay you with a Fiat currency, it has value only because we both decided to agree to it.  If you decide not to trust my government's currency, I'm shit out of luck in the latter case but in the former case I'm giving you gold bro.  Even a failed state's gold coin is still worth it's weight in gold.
So saying it's backed by math... Wtf does that even mean? I own math? Why is that math of value to me?
Saying it's valuable because you wasted something of actual value creating it? Ok.. why would I care?  If you destroy your entire crop to create a currency note, that doesn't make it worth a whole crop.  You simply wasted a crop.
I see this is an uphill battle for you to understand, so let's try something else. 
 Let's pretend Earth is now a single space faring nation that has found alien species we wish to trade with.  We want some exquisite tasty crops that don't exist here.
First, we hand them a pallet of circa 2018 US dollars.  The aliens will look at you and say, "what the fuck is this?".  'its money. We all agreed that it has value' "maybe you did, this is worthless paper to me"
Next, you point to a screen and say 'fine, look, I sent you 5000 BTC, it's backed by math!!' "man you are one wack human.  What the fuck does that mean? I can trade it for math?" 'well, I wasted a ton of energy creating this currency!' "ok... And how does that help me? I don't care that you wasted energy, that's your problem."
Amid your stupidity, I jump in 'here are 1,000,000 galactic credits.  These are backed by dark matter.  Unlike my idiot friend here, I understand what that means.  At any time you can trade this in to receive 1cc of dark matter per credit. Better yet, here are some coinage minted out of dark matter!  Everybody accepts this currency because dark matter is a valuable fuel and resource, and thus holds intrinsic value.'

@_date: 2018-06-12 22:13:24
I am.
I've thought through this with people several times now.
Example: how would you obtain a mortgage if BTC were the dominant currency?  
If they loaned you 75 BTC right now for what is a ~$500,000 home now, and BTC value continued at same rate as it has the past two years, you would owe millions of dollars worth of BTC in 2 years.  
The "dollar value won't matter" argument is invalid, because the BTC purchasing power would still be increasing ie. you will spend 1/4 the satoshi for a gallon of milk as you did 2 years prior.
Your payoff amount would have to DECREASE over time, not increase, right?  They would just set it at a rate that outpaces the deflation rate much like today you pay interest that is supposed to outpace inflation, right?  So, if BTC is 4x the value in 4 years, instead of owing them 70 BTC (you paid off 5 in 2 years) you would owe like 20 due to deflation, right? 
What the FUCK would be the point in that?  They could just sit on the 75 BTC for those 2 years and make more money.  So you the 9-5 wage earner who can't just sit on 75 BTC and need to borrow money for houses and cars?  You get to go fuck yourself.  
Oh, and that 9-5 job assembling widgets?  Their money is better off being sat on rather then making and selling widgets, so you have no job either.  
In fact all anybody does is sit on their BTC and watch it grow.  
Please tell me how that economy would function at all?
Long term, something has to change.  This is not a sustainable model.

Um. Ok. You can also find posts from December/January who thought that rate of growth was absolutely unsustainable. You can also probably find posts claiming bitcoin was bestowed upon us by aliens.  What's that proving?


I did not doubt it one bit, and still don't. Nothing increases 600% in value in 6 months, then proceeds to increase another 300% from there in just one month, and stays that way.  Especially a non productive asset. No way.  I wouldn't doubt if we continue to slide down to 2.5k range, or even 1k.

Well yeah, you can't expect corrections, recessions, and bear markets not to happen. There's no such thing as short term investing, that is trading not investing. There's years with even higher returns too, but 10-15% is the long term average even including losses in recession years like 2008.
The original point was that you don't hold Fiat (cash). $10,000 kept under your mattress for 10 years will be worth $10,000, without even talking about inflation.  $10,000 kept in index funds for 10 years could be worth $40,000-$50,000.
Holding Bitcoin has potential for greater returns, but also has potential for greater losses.  Index funds are much safer.  Even if Bitcoin took over Fiat like people here love to say, you'd just realize gains in BTC instead.

How is that idiotic?  Paypal fees are incurred when using a credit/debit card, or when sending to a business with chargeback type protections.  You can forgo both by using funds already in paypal's ecosystem (which people do as well) and sending it friends &amp; family and incur no fees at all.  But we're not talking about padding their paypal account, or their BTC wallet, we're talking about sending fiat money from point a to point b.  And you're leaving the onramp from point a and offramp to point b out of the equation.  It is absolutely fair to say that for me to send $1000 in fiat to you, we will have to count exchange fees.

This is tiring by now but...
The reason \*\*controlled\*\* inflation is good is because it encourages investment.  Investment in government bonds.  Investment in loans to consumers to purchase houses and cars.  Investment in businesses, both via stock market and starting your own.  
Deflation is better?  Why invest in bonds? Why invest in loans?  Why invest in business?  You're better off just HODL'ing right?  So what happens when everyone in this future bitcoin utopia, from the homeless guy with only a few satoshi, to the whales with hundreds or thousands of BTC simply HODL?

I sold at $600 when it crashed from ATH and took 2 years to recover, and didn't buy back in until february.  So for me, if I have HODL plates and someone asks me about bitcoin, I can say "fuck no, bticoin cost me 40 grand, fuck that shit" as they look confused.  This time I'll HODL so if it bullruns again by 2022 or whenever Tesla delivers, maybe I will actually pay with bitcoin.

I think bitcoin sparked an innovation cycle, which is why you have so many damn altcoins.  They're either useless shitcoins, or they seek to solve a problem that bitcoin currently does not.  If Bitcoin never dies, its because it adopts these solutions that the *good* altcoins are basically beta testing.  There are a certainly a number of problems right now such as scalability, anonymity, and I think the deflationary scheme is one of them.  People are in denial about that because they want to get moon lambos.
The point i keep repeating around here is this:
Fiat currencies are all inflationary for good reason.  It forces you to spend and invest, or else lose value.  If the best use of your money is to sit on it and watch it grow, then people will fucking just sit on it.  No investing in government bonds, no investing in stocks, no investing in people with world changing ideas, no starting your own business... just sit on it until you're rich.  How would the world look with a bunch of people just refusing to spend their money instead of investing it in productivity?

Correct me if I'm wrong here..
Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks to get the average between blocks back down (or up) to 600 seconds?  
Unlike BCash, there is no emergency mechanism to adjust difficulty when no blocks can get mined?
You would mine at most 2016 blocks in record time, then the difficulty would adjust to match your hash power.  Now, you're mining a block every 600 seconds again.  Since the rest of the asic based network is now a joke, you're basically mining 99.9999% of blocks and control bitcoin.  If you shut your miner off, nobody is mining shit and you've destroyed bitcoin.

In that case cash has slow settlement too because most merchants have a return policy (in EU its legally required in fact).
In either case, good luck selling a public accustomed to a plethora of protections and recourse against merchants that they should switch to a "got paid, fuck you" currency/payment method
Are you senile?  Its not about trusting the credit card network.  People who accept cash only lose TONS of money.  Most merchants do like single digit percentage of their sales in cash now.  If they accepted bitcoin instead of credit cards they're fucking retarded.  Not because they don't like low fees and irreversible transactions, we all love that, but because it would account for 0.000000001% of the potential market.

Nor do you because its sure as shit not 6 months.  Authorization is nearly instant.  Settlement happens in batches, and many merchants receive the funds the next day after batch settlement.
There is the chargeback window which is quite large, but that's not settlement.  While lots of consumers abuse chargebacks, many more would are grateful the capability exists for legitimate abuse by merchants or fraud.

But its not a double spend with credit cards.  A double spend with credit cards would be if you had $100 on your debit, you spent $80, but before that merchant could close their batch you somehow spent $99 elsewhere and it declines for them.

Hey, I am **NOT** a fan of the current payment networks.  Just look at how they handled the EMV switchover.  Tons of vendors didn't get integrations done by the deadline.  Including one of ours, so we were a few months late to switch.  All chargebacks for card-present *swipes* after the cutoff date automatically rule in favor of the consumer.  A regular customer of ours did a chargeback on another merchant, but when their card issuer saw our transactions were all swipes it was easy pickings and they did a chargeback without their consent.  Automatic loss on like 20 transactions over months with that cardholder.  They called their bank right in front of us because I was livid, and they simply did not give two shits.
As a consumer, chargebacks have been extremely useful.  I deal with wholesale vendors who keep your card information on a fucking authorization sheet.  Sure enough every few months my card is hit with fraud and I need to do a chargeback and get a new card issued.  
The problem with that is "friendly fraud" seems to far outpace actual fraud.  Like, their address on file with bank has not been updated in over a year.  We shipped to that address on file.  The shipper does NOT redirect shipments.  It was obviously them that ordered.  Yet we get like 20 a month like this that report fraud.  Bullshit.
I probably will create a Lightning Network payment module when it rolls out and when I have spare time.  For us it will be great.  Yes, we'll still refund when we feel it is fair.  For all those assholes, we'll rightfully tell them to fuck off.  
But its one of those "do you lock up 10 innocent people to make sure 1 guilty person does not walk free?" scenarios.

Ok, well I don't want to say too much because I'll be teaching people how to scam merchants and become exactly the asshole pieces of shit that rip us off nearly every day.  However, it comes down to the reason code.  Different reason codes require different supporting documentation from the merchant to successfully fight it.  Certain reason codes are nearly impossible for a merchant to fight.  The sad fact is you are probably losing because you're being too honest.

Double spending isn't a thing with centralized or cash payments.
With BTC, yes it is absolutely possible with 0 conf.  Particularly a few weeks ago when it took days to confirm.  If someone accepted bitcoin with 0 confirmations (which out here in california a bunch of contracter's with sizable invoices actually do) you could immediately make another spend to yourself with a retarded high fee so it gets confirmed before your first transaction can.

BTC has a fixed supply, it can only ever be deflationary.  Unless population starts decreasing rather than increasing maybe...
I wasn't expecting this response, as this is exactly my argument against that "dream" so many talk about on here. Inflation is often used as an argument against fiat, but that is precisely what encourages lending and investing. If you stuff your money under a mattress, it loses value. If your money suddenly increased 15% in value every year you would never invest or lend it.  Nor would banks.  Nor would corporations.

Fair enough. If we lived in some Bitcoin utopia where everyone accepted Bitcoin, everyone had wallets, everyone got paid in it, nobody had bank accounts, and converting to Fiat was a pain, then a wire transfer would probably be inconvenient.
But we don't.  We're talking about real world application right now.  If I had to send you $50k, Bitcoin would be my last choice for doing so.  Current real world adoption agrees.  Wire transfers, PayPal, Western Union, MoneyGram, are all more practical at this time.

Hitting an ATH after 1000% gains in 3 months is a huge sell trigger.  Doesn't matter what those values actually are.  When it hit $1k ATH in 2015 after being $125 just a couple months prior, it corrected all the way to $200 before recovering. That took 10 months to hit bottom, and another 4 months to break $1k again.  
If you believe there is a pattern, I'll see you in several months when we bottom at $2k.

Ok, again a bull run from 1k to 18k in the span of months is unprecedented.  You can't see it coming if its never happened before.  You can be hopeful and extremely optimistic, but the odds are/were highly against that.  
I already said I couldn't spare the cash to speculate until it was already well into that bull run and I was not going to FOMO in at 8k or 10k when that was already overvalued.


I dabbled with bitcoin when it filled the void left by egold.  I wasn't into it for too long though, I had just started my business that year and like I said it wasn't particularly valuable or lucrative.  I got back into it after MTGox.  My memory recalls many of us were astonished when it hit 1k, and sure enough it went into correction for a whole 2 years after that.  Nothing in that statement suggests what ended up happening.  Bullshit.


Well I already basically said that.  I'm not good at reading public sentiment and hype rather then fundamentals and logic.  The former drives things to the moon because lambo.  AKA dumb luck.  The latter says 1 BTC should be worth what it cost to mine plus a small margin.  
If you had said that BTC became undervalued in that 2 year span, then I would agree.  Mining was unprofitable for anybody but Jihan, and that's not right.  But the prices it hit at the time it hit them in that bullrun were most definitely overvalued.  Antminer S7's were ancient by Dec 2017, and were being given away just a few months prior, and suddenly they were profitable again.
Right now S9i's are like $700 (which is far closer to reality than the $4000 bullshit they were pushing before).  At $0.06/kwh (meaning not everyone and their mother can mine, but you actually have to put in some work to drive down costs, which is how it should be in any business) it will take like a year to ROI at today's price and difficulty.  That is still profitable, but barely, and difficult increases between now and then are a significant risk there.  $10,000 is still within reasonable range.  $15,000 would repay the miner in less than 3 months, that's overvalued.  $5,000 is at very high risk of the cost exceeding output before repaying the cost of the miner, that's undervalued at this point.
Of course none of that factors in whether the cost is overinflated anyhow by there being too much hashpower in the first place.  In an ideal world it would be ASIC-proof and mining would be done by CPU's.

You guys realize that most banks don't hold mortgages right? They don't want to hold on to that shit for 30 years to make money. They write the loans then pass them off to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae who themselves turn around and securitize them. 
If you've ever actually tried obtaining a mortgage when you can't meet Freddie/Fannie criteria, you'd realize how few actually keep them on their books.  Those are called portfolio loans.  However, even those lenders expect that the borrower will refinance it as soon as possible to get a lower rate.

That's not what fractional reserve banking means. You've been listening to too many idiots on the internet.
If I am a bank holding $1,000,000 of deposits, that money is just sitting there doing nothing. So I turn around and lend it out.  However, my depositors still write checks, pay bills, and make withdrawals.  So I need to keep a certain amount in reserve to cover that.  Lets say, $100,000 or 10%.

Wrong.  There is a world of difference between say trading pokemon cards, and trading ownership shares of the company manufacturing and selling those cards.  Just because you and some others bought those cards for $1 years ago and now people are buying them off you guys for $6,000, does not make it as sound an investment as actual value producing assets.  Those who use the "but fiat..." defense, guys like Buffett don't "invest" in fiat either!
Look at it this way: even if bitcoin did replace fiat, you realize buffett's companies would just take payment in bitcoin and he'd suddenly become one of the largest holders right?


Those are traders, not investors.  Buffet is not a trader.  Investors buy in and "HODL".  
If you own half of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere, and 10 years later that "middle of nowhere" is the center of a booming industry and your rents went from $500 per unit to $3000 per unit, you're not just "selling it higher to the next sucker" when you sell your share.  You have an asset that legitimately is producing far more value than when you bought it, and is well worth much more than you bought it for.

They need it immediately converted to fiat because their purchase orders, electricity, water, sewage, waste removal, rent, payroll, taxes, insurance all need to be paid with fiat.  Many businesses do so with a profit margin that is slimmer than the day to day volatility of bitcoin.  If I sell you something for $20, its nice if your bitcoin payment is worth $25 by the time I convert it, but I'm out of business if everybody's $20 is worth $10 by the time I convert it.
They're doing it as a convenience for those demanding to use bitcoin, not so they can speculate on bitcoin pricing.

You're still not getting it.  How would that work?  They're going to demand interest on top of the original loan amount, when BTC is deflationary?  So its constantly increasing in value.  If 10 BTC buys a lambo today, it buys 2 lambos in 5 years.  So most people's pay would decrease annually rather than increase, because each BTC is worth more than it was the prior year.  Yet, they still owe the same amount plus interest?

Assuming the seller owns the property outright and banks with that same bank, its possible.  But its not imaginary money.  They still have $1,900,000 in deposits, $1,000,000 in the vault, and a $900,000 IOU.  Which makes that entire $1,000,000 their 10% reserve and they can't lend anymore.  They have to sell off that IOU to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac who then securitize it, which is exactly what happens.  So once they do that, they are back to $1,900,000 in the bank plus the fees they collected in the process.

If you shove cash under your mattress, it is not promoting employment or economic activity.  A savings account is the same thing, you just don't have to worry about people breaking into your house and finding it under the mattress.
That loss of value encourages you to use your money to buy real estate, start a business, invest in businesses, pretty much anything except just sit on it.  Only dumbasses just sit on their money.

Well, that is my point.  With a deflationary currency there is no viable business in lending.  Charging interest on top of it while people get pay DECREASES every year due to deflation would be so predatory only fucking morons would ever borrow money.  That's payday loan territory now. Decreasing the principal rather than increasing, just at a lower rate than deflation, would be the only way.  But why the hell would I loan out 3 BTC and expect 2.5 BTC back in 30 years (still worth more due to deflation) when I could just hold the 3 BTC for 30 years?
This is what the people saying "bitcoin will replace fiat!!" don't think through, or some seem incapable of thinking through.  Deflation discourages lending and investing.

Incorrect.  How would that even work?  Bank A has $10,000.  They loan you $50,000 to buy my house.  I cash that check.  How are they cashing my $50,000 check?
Did you bother reading the wikipedia link you provided?


What that means is in your scenario where you deposited $10,000, they turn around and loan out that money.  However, they can't just keep $0 when you decide to pay your bills or withdraw the money.  They need to keep a reserve.  Lets say 10% or $1000.  They can loan out the other $9000, and as long as nothing goes wrong they have enough funds to cover you paying your bills or making withdrawals.  The problem is when too many people demand to withdrawal funds that exceed their reserve, or the loans they made turned out to be toxic and they can't collect.
They are not loaning out imaginary money.  That is a very wrong, yet somehow very popular misconception.

Merchants are NOT impeding bitcoin adoption.  Volatility is.
Credit cards are ~90% of transactions at most merchants, and that comes with 2-4% processing fees.  That is HUGE.  If you take your average McDonald's franchise revenue of $2,600,000 per year, that is ~$50,000 in fees @ 2%.  Do you REALLY think the franchisee is opposed to pocketing another $50,000 per location per year?
The problem is **volatility**.  If you can't grasp this concept, consider that **gold** has been around forever and always held value.  Why can't I go buy burgers with gold bullion? Gold might go up 20% by the time the end of the month, or it might go down 20% by the end of the month.  If they operate on 15% margins, they would have been profitable but are now fucked because they essentially gambled by accepting gold.
Now consider that bitcoin can do that by the end of the **day** not month.
Even those most dramatic here claiming the US Dollar has some volatility and can decrease and increase in value too.  Well, shit, did my rent go up because of that?  No.  Do I pay employees any differently because of that?  No.  Do my beef costs go up? No.  Water? No.  Electricity? No.  Taxes?  No.
The only reason some businesses are still accepting it despite volatility is because consumer adoption is so low, and they are willing to gamble with that &lt; 1% of revenue by holding.

Exactly, prices skyrocketed on emotion not on fundamentals.  The fundamentals were NOT there to support $19,000.  Even if you ignore the fluctuations that make it impossible for a merchant that has 15% margin to accept a currency that can lose 50% value overnight.  It was and still is too difficult for the common user to obtain and make payments with bitcoin.  Its difficult for merchants to confirm payments.  Confirmations take too long.  Security issues are scarey as shit for the layman when "professionals" have lost millions.  These are issues that all need solving.  This "store of value" shit is an excuse to assign value to something that was no longer able to serve any purpose.

Bitcoin has a useful purpose, but not enough to eliminate Fiat.  It's best use case for illegal trade was already being done before speculators fucked it up.

Hi, here in the real world we rate "strongest" by stability not exchange rate.  Anybody can manipulate their exchange rate to change their trade deficit or surplus.

Given its volatility I sure wouldn't keep 100% of my assets in bitcoin.  If you eliminate this fanboy hype bullshit, it is just as likely to hit $0 in 2020 as it is to hit $1,000,000.

Merchants are **NOT** the ones impeding adoption.
These days some 90% of transactions are on cards.  Those eat up 2%-4% of all sales in fees.  Let's take your average McDonald's franchise revenue of $2,600,000 per year.  If everybody paid in bitcoin instead of credit/debit card that's another ~$50,000 the owner can simply put in his pocket.  Do you really think they wouldn't accept it if there weren't other really good reasons not to? Such as the fact it can drop 30% in one night when many businesses operate on smaller margins...

@_date: 2018-04-23 01:08:27
No, all you're doing is shifting the volatility problem off to someone else, but the risk of it becoming the merchant's problem is still quite present.  
Using arbitrary numbers because I don't know how many merchants they have, how large those merchants are, and how much volume they do (which is another problem, do I trust a big international acquirer to pay me, or some random crypto startup?).  
Let's say that they've accepted $150,000 in sales via btc in the last hour but the BTC value is dropping so fast that its now $60,000.  How am I sure they will pay me and the other merchants when they're now bleeding money?  
They would have to be able to receive and sell the BTC before even giving an 'accepted' response to the merchant or customer.  Given how slow BTC confirmation times are I can't imagine that happening.

For the lazy:
Bitcoin miners get a reward for every block mined.  It started with that reward being 50 BTC.  
Every so often at predetermined intervals (well, predetermined blocks, but difficulty adjustment is another lesson for another day) that reward gets cut in half.  We call this "the halving".
We've gone from 50 to 25 to 12.5.  In a few years another halving is coming that will cut the reward down to 6.25 BTC per block.
Miners are essential to the bitcoin network, so they have to make money or the whole thing falls apart.  Even Bitmain has a minimum level before they're losing money.
It also reduces the volume of new coins entering circulation.

@_date: 2018-04-15 09:47:01
Not necessarily.  It didn't last time.  Bitcoin hit an ATH at $1000 then dropped below $500 leading into the last halving.  It took two years before hitting $1000 again and beginning the bull run to $19,000.
If you care for story time, I was looking at getting $20,000 of antminer s7's (20 @ $800-1000 each at the time), but I waited until the halving to decide.  They became unprofitable to run and nothing but a worthless shitty paperweight, unless your electricty cost was literally $0.  I was glad I waited.
More than two years later, even the old s7's became profitable to run again.  Had I not waited and had I just kept them running at a loss, I'd have made at least a million dollars now.  
Had I waited as I did, but bought them anyhow and got a shit ton of them for $20,000 I'd have made crazy money by now.
But hindsight is 20/20, and what sound-minded person would keep worthless miners running at a loss for two years...  Realistically had I not waited, I would have shut them off after after a few months of loss.

You give your money to Johnny Bank to hold on to, because Johnny is big and strong and won't get your money stolen.  Lots of other people give Johnny all their money for the same reason.
Now Johnny Bank has all this money sitting around.  He figured out that he can lend it out to other people and they'll pay him back extra money on top of what they owe him.  He can make a lot of money, but he is loaning out money that isn't his.  Sometimes people come back to Johnny asking for their money back to pay their bills.  Plus some people that get loaned money just don't pay Johnny back.  
Johnny does this so much that he figured out almost exactly how much money he needs laying around in case you ask for your money back, or some people don't pay him back.
But then in 2008 Johnny ran into trouble.  He got greedy and started loaning out money to people he really shouldn't have.  A lot of Johnny's friends who do the same thing lost all their money doing the same thing.  Now the government told Johnny that he better keep a lot more money laying around in case people don't pay him back.
These days, Johnny and his friends don't even do that anymore.  They only loan out money to people that Sallie Mae and Freddy Mac from the government are willing to buy the debt and Johnny gets his money right back really quick.

As I just said to someone else, here in the real world we consider "strength" to mean "stability", not exchange value.  Plenty of currencies exchange "stronger".  That does NOT mean strength.
Put it this way: which world currency would you trust parking $1,000,000 for 50 years for your heirs to eventually enjoy?  
The Euro that is younger than I am?  
The UK pound, which was on the brink of collapse from two world wars just decades ago?  
Perhaps the Kuwaiti Dinar, that has the strongest exchange value in the world!  Oil! No chance in hell of collapse there, Saddam and Elon.
Maybe the Chinese RMB?  That was pegged directly to the USD only a few presidents ago, and was toilet paper only a few more presidents ago.  I can't imagine why they all like dollars and bitcoin over there.
In fact, I can't imagine why nobody in any country will turn down the USD.  I mean, its toilet paper, right?
Personally my choice for a "strong" currency would only include the Swiss Franc, because my idea of "strength" consists of not just value stability but "good luck invading it will never happen" and/or "good luck invading, we will fucking destroy you" to ensure continued stability.

Yes there has.  Gold.  That is why all the comparisons to Gold.  Its actual utilitarian value and rarity probably doesn't justify its accepted value by a long shot, but hundreds of years and many fallen empires later here we are.

In the hypothetical situation you suggested where somebody is able to attack and cripple our country's currency, you really think the secret service (it would be squarely their jurisdiction) would just sit there and go "aw shucks!"?
Yea.  Ok.

It's not a human, 2d barcodes can be faked.  There is plenty of motivation for said users.

If it cannot become a more attractive alternative to cash/credit cards then it will be.  Technologies with potential do die for not reaching that potential soon enough.  Stop acting like its invincible, people.
Merchants pay a metric fuck ton in processing fees.  You have no problem getting them to adopt if the user base and STABILITY were there.  Going from $8k to $250k is not stability, because that means it could just as well go from 250k to 8k.

I'd be happy to pay employees in bitcoin if they accept costs and fees out of their pay.  Finally get to collect credit card rewards on payroll!

Because when it's worth 6200 the next day it's irrelevant
