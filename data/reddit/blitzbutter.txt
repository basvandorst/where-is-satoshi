Oh, so the scamer unpacks, initializes device, re-foils it, and of course, no possiblity to remove a piece of paper or even better, adding new, scamed one saying it's totally normal...

There is foil one the box. All I'm saying is that putting a manual which explains what "proper content" looks like, can easily be manipulated.

90GB per block, roughly 10 minutes, gives ~25MB/s. Not that much in 4K streaming era.

Of course they do, they are usually partitioned into smaller VPSes or other cloud VMs, but machines are capable anyway.

You forgot one important point - the goal of such currency. If corporation create something, they do it for their own benefit - one way or another. Bitcoin has no master, therefore there is no intrisict beneficient. 
Look at pretty much every other alt-coin - they have dedicated teams, companies, investors, you name it, people who put their money and want something back. 
Moreover, if you want to target masses - you have a bigger competitions - like fiat and credit cards - that's what big companies whould have to fight with, to gain mass adoption - do you think they really can?

Hmm, this gives 175 699 transactions per second. AFAIK Visa claims to have 4 000 peak. Scaling this to your block size gives 178 512 MB. Adding this 1/2 for segwit gives 89 256MB, roughly 90GB. Most of the servers nowadays have more RAM, not to mention in 10 or 20 years.

Please also consider what would happen to your coins after something happens to you. 
Whatever technique you use, make sure somebody you trust have the recovery instruction. 
I would divide the seed and distribute it amongst people I trust + one part stored in something which can be inherited like a bank deposit box.

One of the very important thing to learn in life is to judge your decisions by the information you had available at the time of making this decision.
 There was no real reason to invest more then spare changes in BTC untill well, 2014 maybe, same as there is no reason to cry over lost poker hand, or feeling a genius when you call the right number on roulette

The same way they stopped piracy? People not paying taxes? Same way they killed owning gold in 1934? During Stalin times, people traded using USD in Soviet Union &amp; Friends, despite it being completly illegal (and few people got capital punishment)? How about prohibition period in US and many other countries thourghout the history?
