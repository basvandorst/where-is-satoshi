I understand that day trading isn't a safe way to make money, but with bitcoin doing what it's doing right now it's hard to pass that opportunity up. 
I mean just day if you bought low and sold high with one BTC you are looking at $1000 USD in profit. 
I understand the risk, i'm just surprised this isn't something people are capitalizing on. with the upwards trend of bitcoin combined with the daily fluctuations, it seems obvious to me that this can be incredibly profitable.

What makes you say that? genuinely curious.

Thank you for the input, something that I haven't really considered yet. I might just continue to invest at low points rather than selling to buy more at lower prices. 
The primary appeal to selling high/low is that you're working with a set value of cash and letting the trades build value, rather than risking more by investing more. I like the idea of not being able to lose more than I originally invested

Sorry, I wouldn't be using the $370 to trade with. I'd plan on purchasing a full bitcoin and flipping that between BTC and USD. the $370 was just to reference what I had discovered in my wallet after forgetting my $8 from years ago
and it's not like it's much work, just check values regularly and sell high/buy low. even if you're not hitting peak high/low points you're still making a substantial amount of money
