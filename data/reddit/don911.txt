Thanks guys, that cleared things up! Does each additional output add about the same number of bytes, i.e. my theoretical transaction above would be around 2.5KB (10x250 bytes)?

Regardless of your bad experience, I still think Coinbase is the easiest way to get into Bitcoin. I've been using them for many years and have never had an issue. And I trust them more than any other exchange. If you're a US citizen, your USD is FDIC insured up to $250K. So same deal as any bank in the US.
To get more favorable fees, buy your bitcoin on Coinbase Pro. Unfortunately they have recently raised their fees. Taker fee is now 0.25% and maker fee 0.15% (volume below $100K per month). But Coinbase Pro is still competitive. But it was incredibly sweet before when maker fees were 0%!
Also, Coinbase do have a customer support number. Try to call them in order to solve your ID issue. Their number is 1-888-908-7930.
I have opened accounts with all the major exchanges (including US exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex) and have never had any issues or delays. I think most of the time when people are having issues opening accounts, they are not giving the exchange exactly the information that they asked for. If you follow the application instructions to a T, you shouldn't have any issues and should get verified promptly.
Good luck!

In the USA, we write $8000 like this: $8,000.00. In Europe, they write it like this: $8.000,00. They use the comma for cents, we use it as a thousand separator.

Thanks! But here’s the part I don’t understand; even if those thousands of non-mining nodes rejected these blocks, how could they stop this from happening if the majority of miners decided to accept and build on those blocks with the bigger block reward? As I understand it, consensus here is about what the majority of miners decide. Since they create the blocks, if the majority of miners agree on a rule change, then it happens. Please let me know if I’m wrong. I really want to understand this once and for all.
Also, in what way do non-mining nodes with large economic impact, like Coinbase or Binance, have more sway?
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:43:33
That makes sense. But if Coinbase and Binance also decided to support the new chain, then the "fake" coins would become real? But I guess that as long as a few miners are still mining on the original chain, so that transactions go through, everyone could stay on that chain, even though it would be far between blocks until the next difficulty adjustment (since the majority of the hash rate would be on the new chain)?
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:50:45
Thanks. But if, after the chain split, the rest of the miners joined the new chain, but all the non-mining nodes were still on the old chain, anyone wanting to move their coins would be forced to join the new chain? But I guess what you’re implying is that in order for the miners to force such a rule change on the network, they basically would have to get 100% of the miners onboard? Because even if only 5% of miners stayed on the old chain, users could just keep using that?

Apparently the cost of mining Bitcoin in many western countries is around $4K-$5K. That means that there's a lot of incentive to keep  the price above that. Compare it to Gold for example. Gold is said to have an average mining cost of around $1,200 per ounce. And that's the area where price has found support for several years now. Hopefully the same is true for Bitcoin. If price goes back to $1,000, then all the miners have to move to Venezuela...

Only the biggest DOW drop in points, which is quite a meaningless metric. In percentage terms, though, the drop was just the 538th largest decline since 1900. Black Monday in 1987 saw the DOW drop 22.61%, for example.

That's what I though too! I couldn't find any mention about gains being tax free.

Sure, in that case it would work. But the more people that use Bitcoin (which is what we want), transaction volume increases. Then blocks will be full and transaction costs will rise again. Hopefully LN is the answer.

That's certainly a level that many people are watching closely. But the price can go anywhere in the near term now that fear is running the show instead of greed. And especially since we have a lot of inexperienced investors who are underwater. 
Just as the price probably overshot a lot when it hit $20K, it can easily undershoot a lot as well. Heck, even if it went down to $5K, Bitcoin would still be up 500% in a year!!! So lots of room to fall further if sentiment doesn't improve. If we hit $5K, then I think we will see a lot of buyers. My bet is that $5K is the lowest it will go.

Andreas said that you probably need several open payment channels in order to be able to rout your payments properly. If the wallet opens (and closes) these payment channels automatically in the background, couldn't that be very expensive if fees are high like we have seen the last few months? For example, I open my LN wallet for the first time to buy a cup of coffee. Now several payment channels are opened, each with an on-chain tx fee of $5, for example. To me it seems like on-chain tx fees still have to be very low in order for me to use the LN to purchase stuff and replace credit cards or Venmo etc. I hope I'm missing something.

Minimum wage in Nigeria, for example, is only $2.50 per day. Still, around 95% of Nigerians do have cell phones (30% smart phones). I don't think they can afford to transact in Bitcoin unless fees are measured in cents instead of dollars.
