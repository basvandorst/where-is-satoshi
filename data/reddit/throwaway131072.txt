You can have other people with private keys to your coins, the lesson is that you need to be aware that, for the duration you have coins held by others, they are now responsible for the security. And if they're a big, centralized service, they're a big, centralized target. This, like many others, is an education issue. Do any high liquidity stuff you want, but at the end of the day, move the coins back to your own private wallet. The private keys are like your credit card number, security code, zip code, bank account number and routing number, online bank password, and security question answers all in one. Do you ever give that to anyone? No, you only move out a subset of your money to play with, and keep the rest of your savings hidden.

Let's be honest, feminist types probably have more interest in the latest Cosmo edition than Bitcoin anyways.

Even if you hacked someone and got thousands of coins, it would be pretty dumb to sell them all at once, because then you cause a crash like this and you don't get as much money for the last of your coins. You would sell them over time to make sure you get a fair market value for your whole stockpile.

I mean, it is useful for sending large sums of money quickly overseas without significant processing times or fees. As for everyday scenarios, well, I guess bitcoin devs haven't been cultish enough to come up with anything particularly useful for the everyman.

You heard right, the developers say it would be trivial to extend that to 16 decimal places, which should give us centuries, even at this growth rate, before that unit would be worth more than a modern penny.

Isn't it weird how people who can't understand it feel the need to project the weaknesses of establishment financial systems onto BTC?
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:31:28
People don't get trustless systems. You also don't have to choose between cold storage and vulnerable services. There's nothing wrong with keeping a hot wallet with a private key that you personally generated, as long as it's not your entire savings. In fact, it's the safest way, as long as you trust your own computer more than random professional-looking websites.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:58:02
Here's a list of software and hardware wallets: 
Any of those should let you generate a new wallet on the blockchain that only you have access to, not your exchange, or even software developer. The public key/address will be a mixed-case alphanumeric string starting with 1 and about 34 characters long, representing 160 bits of data. Any decent wallet software, such as electrum, armory, and hopefully anything on that page, should also let you view and export your private key - the key that lets you send bitcoins out of the wallet. The private key is 256 bits, so it should be about 75% longer than the public key when using the same encoding. Once you have that, you don't even really need the specific software anymore. You should be able to import the private key in any other wallet software, and view and send the same coins.
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:59:04
You don't need a hardware wallet, you just need to create a new wallet on the blockchain with whichever software client you like and trust. I used electrum and just keep the private key.
@_date: 2015-11-26 02:05:52
Look at all these replies trying to keep the stalling and the arguments going. I still don't understand how people could try so hard to interfere with something so benign. Bitcoin will continue to grow, whether or not they want to waste their time trying to slow us down.

Not directed at OP, but what's the point of the hardware wallet if you still need the seed? Why not just keep the private key on paper at that point?

I consider this more ad hominem, you're just telling me how dumb I am for not seeing this blindingly obvious knowledge that is apparently impossible to objectively share with someone else, except with graphs that do not inherently demonstrate anything other than market principles that have been known for probably centuries now, that crashes are faster than growth.
I have not (and will not) spend a penny on bitcoin, I just mined some (then promptly spent most of them) a few years ago and I intend to hold onto the rest for at least a decade the way things are going, but if you have some kind of insider knowledge about their impending doom, then by all means I'll sell as soon as I can.
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:27:50
Why would I not be serious? Here's your opportunity to give me my glasses, and instead you're too busy attempting to prove what a circlejerker I am with more ad hominem than anything else.
e: That's not to mention that I still see the only point you've made that isn't ad hominem as evidence that bitcoin will continue to rise.
@_date: 2013-07-30 08:09:22
Just wanted to say it's 6 complete months, I just made the end of the graphs on the first day of the month after the last full one so I guess you technically get 6 months + 1 day of 2011, and, -4 days in 2013 (because it ended 4 days in the future)
@_date: 2013-07-30 08:04:45
Considering the fair amount of likeness between the two and the fact that in 2011, the price continued on a similar trajectory down to $2, a bit less than half of the lowest you see it in the pictured data ($5), yet the modern price is simply on a much slower descent, I think that as long as nothing big happens, I'd expect it to stay pretty constant around the current price (~$100), if not rising with new technology that makes adoption easier and the growing userbase. The next miner payout halving should be especially interesting since ASICs should be pretty commonplace by then.
(all personal opinion)
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:47:35
As a neutral party, you have yet to say anything at all about how bitcoin is an objectively bad investment, one which has risen in value by an order of magnitude for ~4 years straight now...
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:07:13
I've only taken a few econ classes here and there, but it looks like the April bubble caused some pretty serious trade volume, but the price still ended up a lot higher than it started. Same thing with the 2011 bubble if you assume someone who bought during the bubble had the patience to wait 2 years for the value to inevitably hit another new high another order of magnitude higher, and stay there. Why would we expect this to change in the future?
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:43:32
How is that evidence for anything other than "growth is slow, crashes are fast", which is IMO more objectively "pathetically obvious" than investor conspiracy? Maybe bitcoins really are worth something to some of the increasing number of people who are still learning about them, in which case the price rise is completely justified by demand outstripping supply?

someone with way too much coin (old miner?) could have bots to drive the market to slow to an uneasy crawl to encourage a panic sell, then lift it back up by force, encouraging everyone it was temporary and allowing it to rise back up, making huge profits along the way.

...unless you have a lot and want to cash out a little.
@_date: 2013-07-30 03:01:13
Correct, just so people can compare features of those graphs. 2011 does seem to have a small amount of predictive power, although the relative values are pretty divergent at this point, since it fell to 1/6th of peak bubble value by now in 2011, vs. 1/~2.5 in 2013. The trade volume in 2013 was 20x higher, and the value was 9x higher at the "pop." A 20-fold increase in volume in 2 years is nothing to scoff at.
tldr: I was fooling around when I put together the graphs and they make bitcoin look much more resilient now, so I shared them.
