Bitcoin failing to appreciate fast enough where the cost of mining becomes greater than the diminishing block reward combined with transaction fees.

When Mike Novogratz said bitcoin would hit $10,000 by the end of the year we didn't understand it was a warning, not a forcast. 
Buy some now. Buy some in a little bit. Buy a lot when it hits 9k.

GDAX has the price of BCH at 3:1 BCH, so either BCH is going to around 48k, or BTC is going to be around 4k before the night is done.

If your buying coffee with Bitcoin Cash then your buying something like Folgers or Starbucks.  Only Kopi coffee is good enough to be bought with bitcoin.

Back a few days ago when the whole BCH/Drop happened, people started disputing transactions with coinbase to "get their money back".

If it was due to shorts being called, then don't be shocked to see it dip back down into the 14000s or even lower.

My money is on heading back down in the next two days after all the margin calls finish.  (Still watching whales get called on short positions).  When LN comes online for beta, expect a small bump -- but that could already be priced in.

Someone(s) sold bitcoin on leverage, and were forced to buy in again.  Basically they were shorting bitcoin and their short was called. This forced-buy was rather large and caused the price to spike. This then caused other leveraged positions to be called against other short positions, and we end up in the mid 15k

Some day we will look back at this moment, chuckle awkwardly, then quickly change the subject.

Core is responsible for the lack of segwit adoption. If the reference wallet does not support segwit completely, how can we shame others for not implementing it?

So, your saying Sell, and wait for the next cycle to lambo.

FYI, it looks like the spike was from a large liquidated short.

The transaction should show up in ledger live, even if it moved to a new address on your ledger.

Most of bitcoins recent bull run momentum has come out of Asia. The bears focus on China, but the bulls remember Japan.

He is confusing bitcoin for Litecoin.

Definitely a scam.  The first red flag should have been that you got to talk to someone in Coinbase support.

Last year at this time people were talking about Bitcoin at the Thanksgiving dinner table. You could see the surge as people installed coinbase on their phones and bought in.   
Imagine the conversations this year.

Do Indian and South Korean bitcoin forums post articles about how the US is banning bitcoin?  It does make one wonder.

If you have the crypto keys, you own bitcoin.  If it goes up or down, you have not made or lost any money -- you own bitcoin.  Only when you exchange it for another currency do you 'gain' or 'loose'.   
Unless you are a day trader, hlod.  If it goes down, and you can -- buy, then hlod.

The Irony is that this was likely more profitable than it would have been had it not been for the proof-of-keys movement encouraging people to move their bitcoins off of exchanges and into wallets, such as electrum.
