Exactly the amount you own, plus one.

Shes laughing at the funny joke.

That's not how happiness, or relationships work. You find your own happiness, you bring that to someone else to share it with them, they do the same. You are not reliant on another person for happiness.

Easy there George.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:27:54
That's breath of the wild z. Totally different game.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:38:17
I dont think it's fair to laugh at a normie from however many years ago for not understanding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:05:14
Give it time.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:25:24
Don't be a sucker. Buy a cheaper ring, 3k or whatever you want. She either wants to marry you or she doesn't. Also, buy that Bitcoin, and keep that shit to yourself. You dont know whats gonna happen with Bitcoin, or your marriage, in ten years. Best of luck.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:00:56
My fucking neck I think I got whiplash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:10
Il pull out my initial investment at 100k, thats all.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:30:39
Bitcoin is my best chance at retiring 15 years early. If theres even a 1% chance of that happening, then I gotta take it.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:49:44
Its the dream. But I feel I only have one more year to accumulate before its priced beyond my reach. I keep averaging in the mean time, perhaps some of my alts will boom and I can swap them for more BTC. Fingers crossed.

I have 3 kids and no money. Why can't I have no kids and 3 money?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:20
It was at 10k€ on Coinbase so that counts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:16:48
Why would you say that about Bitfinex? Serious. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:33
Holy shit really? Ireland here, would love that to be true!
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:50:59
But not Ireland :-/
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:41:40
Sooooo.... I should probably get my XRP off there then. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:04:54
What's that in furlongs?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:38:03
Coinbase my friend. 
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:32:35
This is like when Neo asked for guns, except he asked to mine shitcoins instead.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:08:30
But when will now be then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:21
Some poster was drunk and misspelled HOLD and it caught on, or Hold On for Dear Life. Whichever you prefer. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:14
It's whatever you need it to be. 
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:46:46
Not true. New fools born every day.
@_date: 2019-11-24 00:28:01
So you're saying theres a chance?
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:50:05
Oh the ironing...
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:09:21
Wen banana?
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:35:23
That's a very low number, where did you get that from?
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:14:39
Dude, dont tell people how much Bitcoin you have. Definitely dont post pics of your wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:11:49
In this case it is. Price didn't start really ramping up until March. So lol yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-31 23:47:47
I do like the new meme format.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:25:42
Just move your buy in day to now! Sorted!
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:30:58
I sure hope so. Friday is my average in day.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:57:28
You made me quickly exhale through my nose in the coffee shop, thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:38:35
Its 3 for 3 so far, he called the bottom as well.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:11:43
Metal strength? Forged in the fires of 2018.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:58:46
If it shoots to 100k in 2022, its dippin way lower than 50k.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:58:37
I feel like I would lose all my sleep over that.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:50:01
God speed brother! Whats your target and time frame for MGW?
@_date: 2019-10-05 07:46:56
So close to my house!
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:53:39
Now get greedy!
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:13:34
Where do I put my 10k? All in Bitcoin or 50/50 Bitcoin and alts?
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:09:52
Hold til 35. Retire.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:21:05
Bring it on. I held all through 2018 and I'm still here. I can take it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:16:31
OP, dont trust this guy.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:45:06
I think we need a crypto bullrun Spotify playlist.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:48:01
It's a funny. OP is implying his electric bill is as high as Willie Nelson. I like it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:49:59
Ever seen a grown man naked?
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:31:11
Calm down there Dave Grohl.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:15:22
If you're not splitting the seed into 5 separate parts for 5 separate silicone encased underground burials.... then what are you even doing with your life?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:42:55
Most people on this sub?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:33:58
Gabe has already done all the work he is ever gonna do on HL3. Let it go dude.
@_date: 2019-10-10 09:11:12
@_date: 2019-12-25 21:56:29
Hows your friend doing?
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:03:37
And down we go, $6000 here we come.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:58:06
Whats Youtube? Never heard of it. You sound panicked, invest a little too much did we?
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:37:33
