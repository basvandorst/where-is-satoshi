It's just so weird that almost 100% of the money moves from one address to the next, it's then emptied and never used again. If you keep clicking through from one wallet to the next the transactions are seconds apart!!! 
also    looking at that address I followed it back up more and came across this wallet, Wow!!!!

But if I have a raspibolt and a casa node. They both can't use 8333 correct? I'm using both as full nodes. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:20:22
Yeah, I'm up for it! 
I personally don't like the idea of no holding your own keys but I understand it makes lightning a lot easier. 
I think CoPay is a great BTC wallet but lightning is not fully there yet... Not for a novice anyway. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:30:36
But it's not possible (yet) to both send an amount of money into the channel. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:37:27
Is it possible to open a channel with a parter 50/50 deposited that way the channel is balanced from the start without having to spend something?  
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:14:11
Now I need work out how to make the raspibolt use different ports. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:14:28
I think setting that up would be a great idea!   
It's a shame a saw on a website that Los Angeles had loads of bitcoin-related activities but I am unable to find any. Keep me updated if you do want to go somewhere and help people, I would be happy to join. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:15:58
I spoke with Casa and they said their node can only accept port 8333 currently so I'm going to look at changing the Raspibolt to run on 8332 and 9734 maybe? let's see haha!

I'm still pretty new to Lightning but trying to keep up to speed. I've been playing with this BlueWallet and found the 'Refil' option a little confusing. I've got a channel open and working so when i clicked the Refil option i assumed I would be adding more funds into the existing channel. But it seems that's not the case. 
Basically my question is: When I click Refil, what am I exactly doing, Lightning is channels not wallets so does Refil create a new channel??? If anyone can help I would much appreciate it?

So I have been following this guide : [   
But I seem to be stuck on the 'Bitcoin' section of the guide. 
* *Copy* *bitcoin.conf*  
 *to user "admin" home directory for RPC credentials*  
*$ mkdir /home/admin/.bitcoin*  
*$ sudo cp /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf /home/admin/.bitcoin/*
* *Restart the Raspberry Pi*  
*$ sudo shutdown -r now*
I followed the command and shutdown the Raspberry Pi, it then auto restarted as it does, but I'm unable to shh into the Pi. OSX Terminal simply returns :
*ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.101 port 22: Operation timed out*
Im not sure why this would be, I can see on my IP Scanner the Pi is still located at [192.168.1.101]( 
Please help! 
@_date: 2019-01-03 02:20:21
Yeah, you are right!! 
Lncli is the main command it seems. 
I managed to connect to a peer , open a channel and publish an article on y'alls. Woop 
On the guide I followed there is a link to the 'lightning API reference' that helped a lot to decide what I needed to enter. 
I'm also currently using the testnet as I don't want to loose funds based on a stupid mistake. If anyone else is doing this one major thing to have in mind. All commands usually just start with lncli but testnet means you have to type lncli --network=testnet otherwise you'll get an error. 
Good luck everyone keep trying, you can do it!

Okay so help me out with lightning. 
From my understanding the 11k sats would have to be mined into a new wallet (lightning) I then spend the Bitcoin. (Cheap/free) then when I close the channel it gets mined to the place I spent the BTC. 
Would that not be two miners fees vs just moving to to a new wallet. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:33:10
Thank you so much !! 
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:59:54
Sorry for the stupid question. What's SmartOS ? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:30:14
Where is the full-length video or how do I go about finding it? 
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:16:53
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:26:14
How does it work. 
Do you have to download something ? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:50:08
Is it possible to do something so there is a gui? 
What made you choose rasberry pi vs osx or linux. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:05:59
Is that easy to setup with a Rasberry Pi 
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:44:31
Forget it I sorted it! (Y)
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:49:13
Is there a mobile wallet where I can use my own node to verify if the transaction has gone through??
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:08:33
Yeah, I still need to find someone I trust who can audit it! 
Im currently risking it because I dont know anyone. :(
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:52:22
So I've pretty much finished downloading the blockchain. (November 2018 now woop!) 
I don't have the Pi yet but I'm curious for the future, how do I move the chain from my mac to the Pi hard drive?
I've watched some videos so I have a rough idea of how Raspiblitz installs, but I'm unsure as to how / when you would remove the hard drive and copy the chain? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:51:02
Okay, so I have everything I need, I have my Pi set up. It's just asking if I want to download the Blockchain or copy it. Ive coped the 'blocks' and 'chainstate' folders from my Mac to a second HD ready to copy to the Pi HD. 
When i plug the HD in and select copy block chain on the Pi it just errors. 
I formatted the drive as ExFAT but I'm not sure if it should be GUID Partition Map or Master Boot Record, both allow me to select the ExFAT. (does it make a difference?) 
Basically my question is: what is the best way to formate the second HD on OSX Mojave? 
Here is the error the Pi gives incase it helps, 
 
\*\*\* Check 1st HDD \*\*\*
OK - HDD as sda1 found
\*\*\* Copy Blockchain form a second HDD \*\*\*
WARNING: The RaspiBlitz cannot run 2 HDDs without extra Power!
You can use a Y cable for the second HDD to inject extra power.
Like this one: 
If you see on LCD a error on connecting the 2nd HDD do a restart.
You can use the HDD of another RaspiBlitz for this.
The 2nd HDD needs to be formated Ext4/exFAT and the folder 'bitcoin' is in root of HDD.
\--&gt; Please connect now the 2nd HDD
If 2nd HDD is connected but setup does not continue,
then cancel (CTRL+c) and reboot.
OK - 2nd HDD found
\*\*\* Mounting 2nd HDD \*\*\*

try ext4 ..
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,

In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try

try exfat ..

Do you get any sort of gui or is it just command line. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:12:03
Yeah okay that makes sense. I have a Mac laptop which has a fedora partition on it. But I think the Pi would be a good way to run a node and learn more about code. 
Im just trying to buy all the parts I need online now! 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:10:24
Magical! Thanks I'll look into it now! 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:13:17
I think I might go for a Rasberry Pi node. Seems as difficult but much smaller form factor ?? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:55:02
I can't even get linux to install :
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:38:48
I totally agree with "trust nobody" but yes, I am like you. As much as I've tried, code is not my think. (I've not given up) 
So I try to apply logic, never use private keys that still hold crypto and look for well supported software. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:58:20
That would be amazing. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:47:26
Sorry I'm pretty unaware at all this stuff. Trying to learn. Github means it's open source (safe) right? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:03:53
Yeah, I saw I would need all that. What setup do you have?
