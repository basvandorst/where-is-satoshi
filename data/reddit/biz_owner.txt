Why is a pc less safe than iphone?
@_date: 2016-04-10 00:06:09
Haha like that AssBurgers episode of South park

Eh, not buying it.  But..... if you want to talk wildly fantastic scenarios for a 51% attack on BTC, here's one:
After worldwide adoption of BTC in the financial sector, a rogue government develops a financial weapon of mass destruction, whereby deploying a super computer powered by a nuclear facility that engulfs most mining in the world.  Changing transactions and funding itself further amidst worldwide financial chaos.

The core is fine to use, the bitcoin wallet is stored on your hard drive, rather than an online wallet.  Only issue is you have to wait a very long time for it to update.  Can take over a day.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:18:37
Exchanges can't do that. The miners can.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:51:52
Did u adjust the fee yourself?  Did u see the fee before going ahead with transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:48:06
Yeesh.  Coinbase wants $30 for transactions now.  These fees are out of control.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:36:18
How is that possible?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:56:11
Nope, I've had over 3 weeks before.  Had a small fee tho
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:16:24
Bitcoin following in Dogecoin's footsteps.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:42:36
I think we will want the government to get involved somehow.  Otherwise, if there is theft of your Bitcoins or a huge scam that occurs, who is the authority that will help you?
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:52:32
But what if he decided to dump all that investment on the market?
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:01:40
I'm laughing too hard at this.  Did this scam happen to him on all those days and then twice in a day?  I'd be frightened by two girls having sex in my car forever after that

Please note that I said "average consumer"
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:24:01
What video?
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:57:43
Eh. I honestly thought that bitcoin was viable because you can move it anywhere for practically free.  But now that see there is Money gram that charges only $5 to have money where I want it instantly.  Bitcoin requires recipients to convert it back to their currency at a variable price.  
What benefit does the average consumer get from bitcoin over what is available now? 
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:35:29
I think it already has come to grips.  Rather than exchanging the btc for cash, u can buy commodities online, like overstock.com
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:28:01
Why not stationary bicycles with alternators that mine?
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:52:49
Not in NY :(
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:00:28
Seriously, what about dogecoin?  There is unlimited supply and transactions happen much faster.  Isn't it better suited for every-day expenditures?
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:48:49
Dude u don't need to pay fees.  I had a 0.1 btc go through without any fee.  Only took a little over 2 weeks to go through.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:08:57
No idea.  Although I wasn't alone.  I saw someone else on reddit had the same issue.  He had to wait weeks too.  
It just stayed in "pending" on core.  Actually, the "pending" transaction went away one day and my transaction seemed to have disappeared. Then a couple days later the transaction was there again, still pending
@_date: 2017-01-28 14:58:08
What was weird is I sent .01 btc first to make sure everything was working, no fee.  It took a few hours to confirm.  Then I sent the .1, no fee.  Took more than 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:15:39
Just don't stick bitcoin fork in it
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:00:51
You forgot Doge
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:24:43
Okay cool.  I'm just glad it eventually will go through
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:08:25
Nice, short read.  Simple explanation of how the USA and soviets are screwed, China will be screwed, and so will bitcoin due to leveraged trades.  
Any idea how many of these leveraged bitcoin trades are going on?  
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:19:15
Hey, u ever get a solution to this?  I have the same exact issue right now
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:11:26
Cool... unless you're in NY.  Then they won't work with you.
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:28:13
Haha. Look your comment got removed. I guess u got censored
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:20:10
Sooooooo.  What do you guys think.  Is there lots of censorship in regards to bitcoin?  Are negative news and occurrences about bitcoin being censored from this subreddit? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:58:12
Welp, they did warn people to pull their btc before the fork
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:28:02
Can use the Bitcoin Core wallet, too. Gotta wait a really long time for it to update once you first install it though. But it's a really safe way to store and can back it up.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:58:43
Do we download a new bit coin core wallet?
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:13:46
It is refreshing to read an article about successfully using bitcoin in industries other than dark markets.  All this eth talk just gives me a bad feeling about cryptos.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:23:08
This is interesting.  How are taxes to be paid?  Isn't bit coin considered a commodity by the irs?  Can u "trade" for bit coin rather than "purchase"?
