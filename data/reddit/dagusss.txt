They've charged that fee forever.... All they have done is raised it from $10 to $12.... But yeah, big news here....
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:13:32
They can all imagine....
But don't invest. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:13:12
Exactly, why is this top page?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:15:29
Yeah, they are greedy assholes. 
We should've seen this coming.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:43:26
Everything follows it, and the yen. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:51:26
That's been my view. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:03:27
It's literally called "Free Bitcoin" on the app store - Unity had a part in creating it. (long standing, well known, video game company) - It's just watching ads for 5-50 satoshi at a time. Basically makes a bitcoin a year with daily use.

Co-worker said today my 9K floor (lowest sinking point) prediction was probably false.
Going to be fun to point out that was about 5 grand ago tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:44:58
You know shit's gotten real when Uncle Sam finally comes for his share. In a weird way - this is great news. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:41:52
The new 1% is going to be the true change in this world. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:41:17
Then go buy one you troll. You literally know nothing more than anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:27
Wtf dude? Is this part of the FUD attack? This dip is healthy....
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:22
This is part of the attack.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:52:34
No but seriously. THIS
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:08:05
Glad I moved my 1K penny stocks in weed to bitcoin (at 8K). Going to be fun to buy back in and make even more bitcoin off of marijuana. 
Goddamn the future is amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:59:41
 to a Milly and beyond!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:17
You'll get the same fee with BCH dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:44:25
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:44
buy more today - average out your investment
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:03:36
And BCH gets added and jumps 5K for 15 minutes....
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:49:10
Trying to stay two steps ahead though. I am also assuming the feds will soon outlaw private wallets under some bs "crime/terror support" cover. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:38:26
So you're an expert aye? 
Does someone need to remind this guy even the most respected financial advisors were dead wrong??
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:28:11
Edit : almost south of 16K - fuck off BCH troll.

Content was "If this makes it to the front of the subreddit we know the attack is over."
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:11
I have dreams of waking up to 1K - oh to own a whole bitcoin....
I've bought at 8, 10, 12, 11, 14 a couple times, 17, 15, and now again at about 14.1 today.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:41:37
Read the news. I made my investment at 8K due to reading an article about Korea liquidating a shit ton of cash - and it pointed out how tied into bitcoin that controls the majority of bitcoin. 
I suggest to learn. It's how I learned about the stock market. Try, fail, correct - repeat. Also, I'd suggest setting up limit purchases. Feel free to DM me for more detail. It's an easy way to not miss the buy-ins on dips and cash outs on rises. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:28:39
Your a fucking idiot if you don't get why the fee is high, moron. IT'S PRICE. You want cheaper fees? Keep buying your shitcoin or go on Binance and get some alts. But this is BCH bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:51:26
Dear Bitcoin vets,
I'm a newbie to this space. Is there no dark web lurkers to find this kidnapper and destroy him?
Our community, and this space will truly be the new 1%....
Can we please use it for good? This is a sign of human greed. Which is not what Crypto is about. Viva La Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:05
Nice try BCH trolls. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:06:46

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:38:56
Again - literally NO ONE knows for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:05
It's beyond insider information. Coinbase should be up for a lawsuit. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:31:21
can you get a print of this anywhere??
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:19
1K USD in pennies - I was a top investor in a couple. Guessing you're a 17K bitcoin buyer that day trades now? lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:51:12
Happy to know I'm not the only one in the middle of all this BS.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:25
So needed this today. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:35:58
Want a cookie?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:35
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:20:57
Trying to send a positive msg about bitcoin is spam? Have you seen the sub today??
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:52
This sub is truly my xanax for these dips. Been buying in since 8K - ya'll vets are awesome. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:30:37
You should all panic sell now. It's for sure doomed. Fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:19:44
Wish I could upvote more.
What was your approach? What sites can we buy with bitcoin (or part of) right now? This is pointing out basic economics and more than correct. This currency currently is worth literal internet gold right now....
Why are stores not accepting it as such?
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:21:21
Website looks shady AF
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:44:07
downvote. Christ how amateur hour is this?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:56
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:02:23
This should be meant for a general crypto page? This is literally support and info about other cryptos that don't relate to BTC???
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:12:50
Killin' it! I'm an Nov. 2017 investor. So still very much a newb.

Based on the comments, OP is truly the Bitcoin success story. 
No Lambo. But has successfully acquired awesome family and financial stability for them.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:19:17
Anyway to get a print of the middle one?! That is awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:14:19
fun to watch this the karma fight. Stay strong my friends. 
  
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:18:04
same. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:40:02
lol. Well known in the community for a while I think. Really been my own main use of crypto
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:49:01
Now that is crap. Sorry to hear friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:16:54
New investor here - totally feel the same! Bought in last week right before the big boom and "crash".... which I've learned in the past week is nothing but a common trend in bitcoin. Sat there yesterday saying, "idgaf if it goes down to 50 bucks.....I'll just buy a fuck ton."
Sad I didn't get involved sooner... Can't wait to tell my kids how I mined their college educations from my phone faucet.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:23:49
"The bank is Hancock Whitney"
Huge name we got there - so surprised they aren't open minded to crypto purchases. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:52:35
This is BCH right? Not a BTC fork??
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:00:17
Wtf is turing?
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:29:00
psh, my state is looking to be the US king of BTC. 
Welcome to the future ya'll.

So I'm going to be medieval rich? Thanks satan!
