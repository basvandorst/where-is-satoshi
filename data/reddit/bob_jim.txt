Assuming you don’t have a record of your transactions, I think the best you can do is...
Use [99Bitcoins]( to find the price on a certain date (select a date range for the chart and click on it to view a specific days price).
Enter your purchase and prices into an app like [DELTA]( to calculate and track your portfolio value, average prices and profit/loss.

I said people who bought bitcoin and DIDN’T SELL (you know, hodl and all that).  Fact is bitcoin price has only been above the current level for roughly 4 months out of 10+ years.
I also didn’t call it interest, I said the “increases in value” are far greater than any potential interest you’d get from a bank.
If you still believe that there are no costs associated with bank transactions then to quote SN “I don’t have time to try to convince you”.
I can give you a clue though.... just because you don’t see a transaction fee like you do with bitcoin doesn’t mean you’re not paying for it elsewhere.  
I would also encourage you to read up on economics and how monetary systems work (spoiler alert = banks make money).

The vast majority of people who bought bitcoin &amp; didn’t sell have seen the value of their purchase increase by far greater than any traditional financial savings product interest rate.
One example of an exchange = Coinbase Pro who enable trades with very low fees (0.15% maker &amp; 0.25% taker) and they only charge €0.15 for deposits/withdrawals (on any amount).
With greater adoption you will eventually pay bills directly to suppliers with Bitcoin / LN (no need for an exchange) and pay low transaction fees of less than 1 cent.

OP clearly got scammed by a Phisher not by Binance.

Falling for the scam &amp; blaming Binance then posting this on Reddit is unnecessarily damaging to newbie confidence in Crypto.
People joining in this Binance bashing on Reddit without qualifying the suggested evidence is equally as misjudged and misinforming as falling for the original Phishing scam.

No fees if you buy/sell on Coinbase Pro.

It’s a shame you seem to have had a negative experience with CB (not sure how many times you’ve used their platform as you haven’t said).
I’ve used this approach every month over the last 18 months (certainly not investing anything like at institutional levels) and it’s worked without issue 100% of the time.
Calling my post “false” is inaccurate and very biased and the exact kind of negativity that puts newbies off getting into crypto whether they were considering using CB or not.
I’d be interested in learning what you did instead and how you acquire your crypto now - this would also be useful for other people who may experience similar issues as you?

I do wish more people bothered to do a bit more research &amp; were more careful about being negative about crypto related things on Reddit....

1.	⁠Open a CB account
2.	⁠Transfer fiat funds to CB
3.	⁠Buy BTC (using limits) on CB Pro

You can also sell on CB Pro (using limits) for free - but I’m all about HODLing....

Quick update.  After using BlueWallet to send sats to I found it far easier than the others - not having to worry about channels etc makes it so much easier.
Yes I know it’s a custodial wallet so not perfect but I only need it for keeping a small amount of sats on in case I get the chance to show off how easy this is to others :-)
For now this will do for me - it’s actually super fast and easy - I’ve been messing about with Lightning spin and the payment is immediate!

Revolut have always been custodial for crypto and I’d never suggest using them for crypto.
In May Revolut replaced all users sort code and account numbers with ones unique to each individual account holder (different previously).
These changes meant any existing payments/transfers previously set up with the old details stopped working.
You can connect your new Revolut account details to Coinbase just like a traditional bank account and use for deposits/withdrawals.  
I did this in May and have been using regularly with no problems ever since.
I figure this would be better than Wirex+PayPal.

So, I think you need to do 3 things:
1) Go to “Banking” on CB Pro and link your bank account details (you will receive a unique reference code during this process which you’ll need for step 2)...
2) Go to your online banking and add CB Pro’s bank account details along with the unique reference code (received in step 1)
3) Send a small ($,€,£, x5) test payment from your bank account to CB Pro - then withdraw (from your $,€ or £ wallet in CB Pro) back to your bank account to test both ways.
This works for me, usually payment arrives same day, hope it does for you too...

I’ll ignore Starblocks then (not sure what zap is but probably still the cause of my issue).
I’ve also created another lightning wallet (this one on bluewallet) and sent myself some sats which has freed up some capacity on the original lightening labs wallet channel :-)

I’m into BTC and I bothered to do it.  Just found the whole dealing with channels too complicated.  
I just wanted a way to store a very small amount of sats (200k) in case I ever have the chance to buy a coffee and cake.....
Blue Wallet (I know custodial etc) is the easiest of 4 Lightning wallets I’ve tried (because no need to deal with channels) and I’m not worried about $25 enough to try any more than I have.
If in future non-custodial is easy enough, I’ll make the move, until then, I’ll wait to find somewhere that accepts lightning....

Demand is what will cause this.
BTC exists.  Methods of accepting BTC are a reality that some of these establishments are already using (albeit a minority at the moment).
If your country (or the world) enters recession and banks remove access to fiat (see Venezuela, Greece etc etc etc) I can’t think of any other method of transacting that makes more sense than a global, digital alternative that’s already well established.
People own Bitcoin.  People can and would trade services and goods for Bitcoin off other people.  The only thing that’s missing is the middlemen, the banks....... they’ll be sat waiting for another bailout that maybe this time won’t come, or more likely, won’t work.
.... let me flip your question over - what makes you think more establishments won’t start accepting Bitcoin?  
I’m happy to hear alternative outcomes or solutions, I’m genuinely interested in what you think would work better than Bitcoin in the scenario where banks aren’t providing services due to recession?

Sorry, I didn’t realise your using basic Coinbase (that’s for newbies), no wonder you’re unhappy.   Both fees and prices are too high on there.
Get on Coinbase Pro. Tiny fees, strong prices and grown up tools like stop loss / limit orders that mean you never have to panic sell whilst an exchange struggles to handle heavy demand.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:14:20
The Coinbase app automatically notifies users when the price changes by 5%.
Users click the link in the notification or go online to check out the price action
In the hour before the dip the price went up by $1k to hit the highest price in over a year. (I got 2 alerts).
In the hour after the price was down by over $2k. (I got 3 more alerts).
Price movement up AND down causes interest and drives traffic to Coinbase.
Coinbase did not cause the dip.  Other exchanges also had issues too.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:12:36
Taker fee only 0.15% / Maker fee only 0.25%.
Withdraw &amp; deposit fee = just €0.15
Price updates in real-time &amp; a fair market spread
Stop loss &amp; limit orders can be set for piece of mind
As a Coinbase user you can use the same login details - some people send money to Coinbase and transfer to CBPro but I recommend linking your bank account directly = same day transfers.

Sorry to break this to you,  there's definitely no such thing as "normal fluctuation" with BTC. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:50:06
You could just as easily compare BTC from the lows of 2013 ($180) to the lows of 2018 ($4k) and report a &gt;2100% gain over the same 5 years.
Comparing an earlier ATH with a current low is obviously going to result in less favourable returns - are you really that surprised?
That said, despite that intentionally negative comparison (some would say worst case scenario) the result is still a 300% return... not bad for “table scraps”!
Do you think putting money into a bank/stocks/property would earn a better return in 5 years?

The whole point of BTC is that it’s different to traditional banking.  
With all new stuff, it’s best to read the instructions first otherwise you might end up thinking something doesn’t work just because you don’t understand how it works.  
Worse still, you could end up giving other people the impression something doesn’t work just because you don understand it properly.
With BTC there are loads of resources online to help people do their own research.
For this specific misunderstanding about high transaction fees, I’ve found the following video that should help you avoid paying too high fees again....

1) No need to pay exchange fees ever (do some research on limit orders &amp; find a decent exchange).
2 &amp; 3) Bitcoin goes up as well as down.
It’s not a question of someone buying BTC just to pay for coffee, it’s about enabling people who decided to buy BTC to pay for things with it.
This is commonly referred to as “adoption”, something many people regularly criticise BTC for lacking (poor BTC simply can’t win).
Bakkt provides a platform for people who appreciate, support &amp; own BTC to “spend and replace” on smaller everyday purchases.
Also worth pointing out that as Starbucks stand to save tens of millions in merchant fees currently charged by banks there could well be financial incentives for people paying using BTC, although that’s conjecture not fact, they could just as easily add the saving to their profits.

Localbitcoin is a third party charging you fees for their service - that’s not the BTC transaction fee and you don’t need to use them (you can use some exchanges to purchase any amount of BTC without paying fees by placing stop orders, look into it).
The other fee is the transaction fee, there has been a lot of development over the last 12 months that have improved this with Segwit being the most significant.
Last year you probably paid over the odds for a couple of reasons - (1) you didn’t know you could choose your fee by selecting a priority/speed of transaction. (2) Segwit wasn’t an option back then. (3) You transferred during the crazy bull run that saw networks overly busy and miners able to charge higher fees.
 
Good news is now (1) you know (2) Segwit exists (3) the networks and exchanges have significantly increased capacity since last year and you can choose to transact when it’s quieter.
BTC is still pretty far off being ideal for being used for smaller everyday transactions but there’s loads of improvements coming (Lightning  Network being the most exciting for me) and more credible 3rd party solutions than ever before (Bakt for me is really interesting, although not a favourite of many die hard BTC fans).
Hope that’s useful...

LN is developed and run by the same developer &amp; user community as the BTC network.   
It’s a second layer, a feature and an improvement that will (in time) eliminate all current “issues” with speed and fees on small transactions.
Satoshi even detailed the probable need for such a development in the original BTC whitepaper.
LN is one of the most significant developments in BTC history and the one that has the biggest potential to drive future adoption.

I humbly suggest you consider some more detailed research in addition to asking on Reddit (forgive me if you’re already doing this as you don’t mention it in your post).  
The reason I say this is that your current understanding of BTC failings sound a little outdated....,
Eg. 
“astronomical fees &amp; speed”.... you can send over $10,000 in BTC anywhere in the world for less than 10 cents and within a couple of hours (pay a little more if you want it faster).
“credit cards...free of fees”.... businesses pay roughly 3% fees across all card transactions (credit or debit) to the payment provider = costs are built into prices and passed onto the end customer.
Also, there has been significant advancement and development in BTC over the last 12 months and so much is currently happening too.
Your interest in BTC sounds genuine and you appear to be open minded about its potential - in which case I’d suggest checking out Andreas Antononpoulos YouTube channel as the best place to get some very informed answers to your original question and a whole lot more...
Hope that’s useful &amp; helps you find the answers you’re looking for.

The reality is you can pick any date prior to this time last year (so 9 years worth) and be in profit.
It’s only people who bought in the last year that are out of pocket (and not all of them are).
That’s not the majority of people who own BTC.

Unfortunately you, like many others are misinformed about how both banks and BTC work. Which is totally OK, because crypto is all still relatively new really.
I’ll try to explain what I mean and hope this helps clear up a few misconceptions.
Banks would charge far more than $7 for moving the same sum of $600m.
Also, BTC doesn’t charge $7 fees for all transactions, the fee is based on the size (not value) and the person sending BTC can choose the speed/priority which means choice to pay less (banks don’t give you a choice).
Banks provide below market rates for foreign exchange transactions (about -2%).  BTC doesn’t  charge more for sending across boarders.
Businesses can take payments using BTC for just a couple of cents.  Lightening network allows thousands of smaller transactions to happen super quickly and just as cheaply.
Not forgetting that banks charge businesses monthly fees, transactions fees, paying in fees, and also around 2% for processing purchases by card.  All these costs are eventually passed onto customers as part of the prices they charge for goods and services (so you do pay in the end).

Inefficient miners closing = BTC difficulty automatically adjusts = less difficult and more profitable for the remaining miners.

Interesting interpretation - personally I didn't think the market sentiment nor the trading volumes where even remotely similar at 10k as they where at the undeniable 20k ATH euphoria....
As for stablecoins, I think people use them to facilitate trading of their preferred crypto and that without Bitcoin/altcoins the demand for stablecoins dramatically reduces - I've also not seen a truly decentralised stablecoin so for me they fail deliver on the key fundamentals/ideals.

On this day 3 years ago price was circa $600, same day 2 years ago $4k and last year $5k.
Bitcoin price has only been above $10k for a total of 5 months out of your 36 month timeframe (3 of those are the last 3).
Factual conclusion: Your statement is false.  
My guess: You actually bought the ATH, sold at 80% loss and are basing this statement on your own weak handed experience.

I didn’t say buy Bitcoin in Revolut (NYKNYB).  I said open a Revolut account (the OP wants a bank account to use with exchanges).
Revolut provide bank account services that can be used with exchanges = crypto friendly.
They also provide multiple accounts in different currencies and don’t charge exchange fees.    This is useful if you use an exchange like Coinbase Pro because CBPro charge $5 to deposit USD but only €0.15 to deposit EURO.  So send USD to Revolut and exchange to EURO (all for free), then deposit EURO to CBPro for just €0.15 and buy BTC with just 0.15% fees.

Average Joe can already easily open a wallet, send/receive money quickly then close the wallet and not have to do it again..... this already exists by using custodial solutions (that are almost free to use too)...
If I can do it anyone can.  Plus, here’s a video of a dude (who’s even older than me) demonstrating how easy it is with Blue Wallet. [The Crypto Dad does Lightning]( 
And before anyone starts crying about custodial being everything BTC is against (1) Average Joe doesn’t care (2) custodial for spending $20 worth of BTC (not storing your stack) is low risk and increases  use of LN today (whilst we wait for a non-custodial user friendly option).... (3) doing nothing is your other option (not so great for adoption)....

We’re on a journey and there’s a long way to go.  
Custodial solutions for LN solve each and every one of your issues/points (apart from the last one obviously) and they work right now, today.
Don’t misunderstand me; I’m not suggesting custodial solutions for BTC in general (I use 2 hardware wallets backed up with my Crypto Key Stack and am very much my own bank) but, LN is very early days and as you point out it has issues.
So we all have a choice, we can wait for the inevitable non-custodial solution that at a not too distant point in the future will be developed.... or compromise today and use a custodial solution in the meantime (risking just $20 or so)....
My choice has been to choose the custodial solution today (as an interim fix) and I believe that actually using it to promote, engage and encourage adoption of LN and BTC is far better than sitting on the sidelines doing nothing - LN is more likely to improve quickly if more people are using/accepting it.  
I ask every store, bar &amp; cafe I go into if they accept BTC or not and I always have $20 worth of BTC in my LN Wallet (custodial though it might be) so that if they say yes - I can pay with it. 
The other choice is to do nothing and complain that it’s too hard...
.... seriously, even Andreas Antonopoulos uses a custodial Lightning Network Wallet (Blue Wallet)... [SOURCE = AA Video (at 2 mins 56 seconds) ]( ... so if it’s good enough for him, it’s good enough for me.

I recently tried 4 Lightning solutions and for me the routing &amp; dealing with channels was too complex.
That said, I can still use LN, I just have to settle with a custodial solution (Blue Wallet), at least for now... this is fine for me, happy to keep $20 topped up in there for the ability to buy things with BTC and help promote/encourage adoption.  Blue Wallet also allows me to look after the routing/channels myself if and when I’m confident I’m able to.
LN transactions are instant and practically free (even with a more pricey custodial solution like Blue Wallet = a couple of sats per transaction).

No news?  Where are you looking?  As BTC is not mainstream yet you need to proactively seek out what’s happening.  
Forget price for a minute - focus on development (see github) and BTC/Crytpo related activities (plenty of crypto news sources out there) I suggest finding 3 you trust, 1 that is known for being positive, 1 that is known for being negative (get a rounded perspective) and 1 that is mainstream (so you can tell when BTC is back in the public eye)...
Also following this and other reddit subs (include r/btc, r/cryptocurrency r/bitcoinmarkets as these give an alternative viewpoint to the mainly positivity in this sub for balance - although I’ve personally found it healthy to be sceptical of anything in r/btc).

You don’t need any hardware to use the Lightning Network.  
You can literally download an app (there are a few now), move some BTC to it and spend it.  
If you don’t want to do channel management simply use a custodial solution that does all that for you (I use Blue Wallet as I am a complete technophobe and struggled with channels).
Eventually channel management will become easy enough for someone like me, in the meantime custodial is fine as I’ll only ever keep $20 worth of BTC balance in there for spending.

I think charts have their place but should be used along with lots of other information, not on their own.  
If it helps, check out CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, CrytpoNews  and see if you like their content.  Again, a good rule is to not rely on just one media source as it’s difficult to be certain who has an agenda or an incentive to push certain topics.
Also a favourite of mine is to set up alerts for keywords like “Bitcoin” and “Cryptocurrency” on sites like Google News (a large pool of articles) or even the BBC (a very mainstream media)...

I do use LN yes, I’m personally happy to wait for more merchants to adopt it and because I use LN I mention BTC to every merchant I can to help encourage that adoption.
I last bought a beer using LN just over a week ago, my current balance is 120,498 sats (just under $10) and I top it up $20 when I run out.
I use Blue Wallet which is custodial so I don’t worry about channels because that’s all managed in the background - kind of like using a debit card for fiat, I just pay and forget - not bothered about what’s happening in the background.
I can move as much or as little BTC in or out of the wallet as often as I like for just a couple of sats - which is the same cost for the transactions I make, so it’s all pretty much free.
Blue Wallet also lets you look after your own channels (non-custodial) but I’m your average Joe technophobe who likes things simple - maybe I’ll try channels again in the future.
I’m surprised to hear you’ve had so many problems and difficulties using LN - I tend to find if I can do something anybody can.  I suspect your attempts where more than 6 months ago (it’s improved every day).... maybe this video (by a dude even older than I am) will help you....

I have to disagree:
Wasteful of energy?  BTC uses energy (everything does) but it doesn’t waste it.  All banks combined currently use more energy globally than BTC (premises, systems &amp; servers, staff travel etc etc) and BTC mining promotes greener low cost energy use = already using &gt;74% renewable energy and rising [SOURCE]( 
Wasteful of time..?  You can send any amount of BTC anywhere in the world within a few hours (less time if you choose higher fees).
Higher costs...?  You can send $100k for under $1 fee - and have the option of choosing to pay higher fees for quicker transactions (under 1 hour regularly less than $10).  Plus if you’re sending internationally you won’t get stung by unfair exchange rates (banks typically make 3% on foreign exchange rates compared to the global market rate of a currency).
Scales shockingly.... this was true in the past but is quite harsh today.  Whilst scalability remains a weakness, that’s because it’s still relatively early days and BTC is improving all the time.  A year ago I couldn’t go to the pub and buy a drink with BTC, today I can (albeit in only a few pubs in mainly city locations) and using lightning network is instant &amp; practically free to use for both me and the merchant (who would otherwise have to pay for payment processing services which are usually a combination of an annual service fee + 2-3% of transaction value).
If BTC was already perfect and adopted globally it would be worth far more than it is today.  
Ignoring price action, if you focus purely on development and progress as a technology, BTC is constantly moving forwards, it does not rest, it does not slow down.  Eventually price always catches up.

Coinbase fees are very high and only for people who either don’t want to or can’t learn how to use Coinbase Pro (newbies and people buying small amounts).
Coinbase Pro fees are only 0.15% (used to be free) so you’re better off buying there if you’re going to be buying these sort of amounts regularly (you use the same log in details as regular Coinbase &amp; you’ll just need to take a little time to work out how Pro works, it’s worth it).
If your total investment is likely to be worth more than $2k, it’s probably time to get a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger are popular because they’re good and cost $100-150).
