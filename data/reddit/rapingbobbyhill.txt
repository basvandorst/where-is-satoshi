So, like TOR, except not like it at all. The only similarity is that there are multiple "secure" hops in between you and your destination.
TOR is an onion router. Every TOR payload that you send is wrapped in multiple layers of encryption, and each relay before the open Internet (or a hidden service) peels off one layer. Your client establishes via Diffie-Hellman key exchange an ephemeral shared secret between each relay, and each node can only decrypt its layer of encryption. It is truly end-to-end encrypted to each relay, including the exit node. 
Also, each relay in TOR will be exchanging other people's traffic besides yours, and each relay has no idea who the traffic originator is. It only knows that it's a link in the chain. It may be the first node, or the second. If it can see decrypted content, it knows it's the exit node. That's it.
Your scheme is not end-to-end encrypted. There is no mixing of traffic to obscure where you're connecting from. At best, you'll be one of maybe a few people running a VPN connection through other VPNs. You'll be very easy to deanonymize. Plus, the whole thing really makes no sense, because your innermost VPN tunnel might be the one compromised, and it wouldn't matter how many VPN providers acting in good faith are wrapped around that.
So instead of blowing your money doing that, you might as well just go out and buy whatever it was that you were going to torrent, or maybe pay to host some TOR nodes to make the network faster and better for everyone. :-) 
**edit:** Oh, and, no matter what, do **not** torrent over Tor. Ever.

Are the carts going to have little QR code screens on them too?
