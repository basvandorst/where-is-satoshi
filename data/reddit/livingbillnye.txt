You woulda only had 3.3 million at the top if you invested 1k. 
If i had a time machine i would go back and win a few lotteries, then invest atleast a few million in when it was 6 bucks. Then I'd come out with 11 billion when it was 20K.

This is something ive been struggling to understand lately. What happens when fiat crashes? What will bitcoin be worth? It could force us to adopt crypto, but will we just start deciding 1 Apple = .000001 btc? And just give up on converting btc value to fiat before making a sale?

If we never sell and just keep waiting for the next bull run will we ever make money or just hodl til we die? I agree with you, I'm just curious as to what the strategy is for long time hodlers who actually want to enjoy some of the money during bull runs. Cash out a percentage during peaks and then reinvest a smaller percentage during the dips? Keep the difference as profit?

I'm buying as much as I can, (not much) but I still feel good about it. Even if it dips past 3500, im not too worried. 
The only way you lose money is if you sell when its low. HODL

Why are you not happy with coinbase? I mean it's smarter to hold your own keys for sure, but any other reasons why coinbase is doing wrong by you?
As a beginner, I am really loving the ledger nano, it was super simple to set up and use.
