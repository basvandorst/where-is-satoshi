It is mentioned that


Can some one explain how this arbitrage would work since mtgox didn't have a large reserve of bitcoins.

Just not true at all. Take any econ 101 class and you will realize that consistent predictable inflation is good for growth and deflation actually causes recessions.

Lets say MtGox is insolvent there is still no way users lose all their money. Btc-24 which had their bank accounts seized and a trading glitch over a year ago just got to processing payments out a month ago and they were giving everyone 70% value. MtGox kept most of their bitcoins in cold storage anyway. Though I think they are stalling to try to gain more revenue through the trading frenzy going on right now.

Yes but this only works if the price on Mt.Gox is greater than than of bitstamp or another exchange. 
The post says he leveraged the depressed Mt. Gox price. In order to make money this way he would have needed to take bitcoins from mt.Gox and sell them on other exchanges. The problem is why would you do this if you are already short on bitcoins and they only way to get new ones would be from other exchanges. Making it a break even trade and they would end up with more liabilities/losing money if the price of bitcoins went up as a result of their arbitrage transactions.
When the price of bitcoins was around $130 before Gox shut down it would have been a better strategy for them to  buy bitcoins from their users with their users cash because the cost to get them any a bitcoin is much greater. It would have reduced their liabilities significantly maybe to a point where they could have kept it a secret a little longer.

Right the only place to get new coins would be through other exchanges or user deposits. However the users who where putting sell orders on their "IOU" bitcoins that low would be among the first people trying to withdraw if Gox had opened it up. That combined with buying bitcoins from other exchanges could have kept Mt.Gox afloat a little longer.

Mine from bitcoin24 didn't show in mtgox even after 30+ confirmations. I was able to find it on the blockchain though.

Im just wondering is there any benefit to doing this or is it most likely a bot that just does it in the smallest increments.

btcjam could be used for short selling but not on a large scale. I think with prices going up and down so quickly like right now it would be a cool idea.

How did you find this info?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:22:24
Check the blockchain
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:29:09
Is there anyway of telling if they transactions were from an exchange or just individuals

The trades are not what is causing the ddos, it may increase lag a small amount but as someone who watches the depth charts it can make it seem like more people are buying to drive the price up.
