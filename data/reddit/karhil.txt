They mean: people borrow money at fiat Banks to put in to Crypto. But that isn’t based on research, because of the simple fact that only for the last two months bitcoin has reached A little bit of attention at the dutch news agencies.

And more important, one of the first articles about crypto that isn’t FUD in The Netherlands. Just an article giving a short insight on what Crypto and BTC  are. Even our ministers don’t know sh*t about crypto when I saw a brief item on PowNed. I’am ashamed to see that those people run our financial system.

The platform is excellent. Easy and friendly to work with. I hope you don’t have a day job, because with this kind of trading you must be focussed all the time.
