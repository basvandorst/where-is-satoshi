The patience of everyone in that room dealing with her juvenile anarchist arguments is impressive.

I need confirmation from the Executive Director of Bitcoin before I believe you.

That's a relief. You should create a GUI in visual basic to track his IP just to be sure.

That is a normal correction for bitcoin, historically speaking. [link](

Starbucks is making money selling you a coffee for $4 that you could make at home for 25 cents. Value is not the only driver in business, you have to consider things like convenience and know-how. Crypto mining has gotten big enough that people want to get into it and fruitcommander filled a market gap, good for him.

There's that word again: "heavy." Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

When you deposit money into bitfloor it is in USD until you make a buy.

I also jumped ship from coinbase to bitfloor when I wanted to buy @ $51 and couldn't.

BitEventually doesn't have the same ring.

I see tons of orders flying through all for .02 BTC. Looks like bot spamming to me.

The best way to mine Litecoin right now is with an AMD graphics card. A quad core i7 will get you ~50 kh/s whereas a single 6870 will get you ~320 kh/s.

To run SR from inside the US seems incredibly irresponsible. Not sure why he wouldn't move to a non-extradition country and start a new life with his 83 million.

Sad but true, alliteration or a terrible pun will get the news to run a story.

OK, good point. I've only bought LTC with BTC.

Yes, Litecoin uses scrypt. May I direct you to @_date: 2013-03-26 16:52:49
My understanding (which may be somewhat dated) is that ASICs for LTC are under development but none have proven to be more than vaporware.

That is exactly the reason they are scared of Bitcoin. Those in power wish to maintain the status quo.

I think we'll be OK, HSBC laundered $881 billion for drug cartels and they just got a fine!
