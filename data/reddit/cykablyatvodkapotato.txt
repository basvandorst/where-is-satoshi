Holding doesn't make you alot of money if you start a little like $700

So you are telling me that btc, the one with 100x more fees and way slower than bch is somehow the 747 in this situation ?
The truth is, what Satoshi had in mind is to upgrade the 1 mb to 8 mb. And this was intended from the beginning, btc segwit failed to do anything.

Haha, look at the fees and transaction time and then tell me the real shitcoin

Lol you are a redditor for 2 days and bought btc without knowing anything about it, btc is driven by people like you who fomo, can't wait till everyone realizes it's a shitcoin

Sad your shit btc went down, cry me a river, btc is a shit coin that refused to upgrade to 8mb as intended in the whitepaper, and bch is testing 1gb blocks and it's possible to have 1tb blocks which would be WAY more than the amount of transactions visa and PayPal Handel. Oh and Roger verr is amazing and one of the early adopters of btc, he even gave away btc to help people get into it. BTC is not a currency and the lightning network is a joke. If you truly researched the technology you know that Bcore is shit.

You deserve it for buying a shitcoin

Mmmm that printed tether and fomo in action. VERY HEALTHY

Btc fees skull fucked people and then gave them aids
And the transaction time gave everyone malaria
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:05:33
Did you buy it using cash ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:09:00
Btc price got pumped because alot of tether has been printed to buy the dips. And when it goes up people fomo. Alot of people are fomo in bch I admit, but certainly not as much amount of fomo BTC has received in it's run to 20k

BCH is closer to original btc than Bcore

I just don't get people who buy into fomo, why can't just wait a couple days
