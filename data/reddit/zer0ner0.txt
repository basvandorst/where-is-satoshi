Ass for me I was thinking it is a trick as the info about donation is also emphasized here

I am sure it won't drop til $300 and actually I predict it is going to reach $1,000

Stated this a while ago:
When all rules and regulations are placed on bitcoin, it will be no different than fiat.

My Frappucino is not ready but I still wait to hear something NEW I mean something good from MtGox cause there were too much bad news before
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:11:02
I agree, they do it cause thye don't know how to control bitcoi so in case they can't hold it they are trying too ruin it

So you think that it won't work if we make an open transaction the situation won't change? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:02:27
True, but paying at least a  small txn fee helps the protocol.

I totally agree that we need decentralized exhanges but it seems to be impossible to have it decentralized.

Will it ever end? Everyday I read news about btc - there is always crashes or spoiled lives or suicide ! When it is going to stop?

Who are using this breadwallet thing? Is it ok? Any experience or what?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:06:04
That's because mtgox topic is the most interesting this week. There's a lot of noise about it cause nothing is clear about their future.

I can write a list of thing he should do but as if he is Mark Karpeles he won't do that. no hope 
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:05:52
Buying bitcoins should probably be quicker.
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:39:06
That's CNN whatever bullshit thwy say it is "true" and we can't do anything with this. That's not only about bitcoin that's about everything which is not easy to inderstand.

Would not want to be the lead software engineer for Mt. Gox right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:50:43
Congrats!!! That's always nice to read that you are going to be rewarding by BTC. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:06:38
The fees are only payable with Bitcoin.
