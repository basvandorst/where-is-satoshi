Hmmm the us has been bankrupt since 1933, but you are saying they cannot go  bankrupt and we are u der a bankruptcy right now!!! The dollar is a private institutions script. The Federal reserve is no more federal than federal express!!! 
They are going to foreclose on the bankruptcy very soon and the dollar is not going to have any value.

You don't have to renounce your citizenship, they can only tax their Federal Reserve notes. Know your status reclaim your sovereignty!  Do not be bullied by their statutes and codes!! Reclaim your strawman and not have to worry about tax or debt again. Give this a gander if you want to break free

I was laughed at and ridiculed I told everyone I knew that Bitcoin will become this planets currency. And now at 40 years old I'm a Bitcoin millionaire. With Bitcoin that I mined with my gaming PC when you could mine that way. You are not late you can get back in. By the end of this year Bitcoin will be pushing $7000!! Next year $10,000 plus. Watch!!!!

income tax is based on what "you" worked for. when bitcoins are mined "you"  are not working for it so it is not taxable to you! the coins that are mined are rewards for the miner solving the problem and the coins are in turn gifts which are not taxable under u.s. tax code! so all this talk about how bitcoins are a way to evade taxes, it is not, bitcoins are not taxable by u.s. tax code! and taxes are supposed to be used for things i need and use in the american populace. so show me where the government is using my bitcoins gifts back in society for me to use? they cant , the government has no hand in the creation of bitcoins, the government vaults that give the u.s. dollar its value is not used to back bitcoin, so why does it feel that it should collect taxes on something it did not use any of its resources to make it?  correct me if im wrong , i understand why we pay taxes on the use of the u.s. dollar because we are using their money and their resources that they used to create said money!

Trade bitcoins and if we meet at the tempe co-op we can actually spend it there. That is how the exchange in ny started bunch of people posted a meet up and traded coin for fiat etc.

Now the irs and the treasury are over the currency they create and maintain correct? Bitcoin is not issued by any central authority or bank right? 
So why do we feel that we have to report to the irs? We are not using their currency? We are using our currency, and that $10000 is for u.s. currency. 
So keep your coins and not exchange it for u.s. currency or any currency that has a government attached to it. 
Is it that simple? Once we are not using centralized currency there is no reporting to that central authority que no?
Does it not make sense that the irs/treasury can request these forms for their currency? 
All of us have been brainwashed for all the years we have been on this planet to believe the only option is the dollar and we still think that way hence why we get all scared and talk about going to jail etc. 
You notice that they seized dwolla account that had over said 10k value in U.S. currency because they have no jurisdiction on bitcoin.
All these rules regulations have to do with the currency the central authorities produce. And that is fine it is their currency and we as a community need to stop having the fiat mindset!

Yes but we are not breaking any law if you have bitcoins in your account, those laws are for government issued currency. Now you have over 10k in u.s. currency and not fill out your proper paperwork then you are breaking the law

This is awesome! I want start a bitcoin subreddit for arizona. And start growing the community here I am convincing the owners of the restaurant I chef at in glendale to start accepting Bitcoins we have a new location that will be opening in downtown phoenix as well right in the heart of things. In the fall I am consulting for an upscale pub downtown and I am selling the whole accept bitcoin idea to. Them as well.
