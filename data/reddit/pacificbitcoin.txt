Clearly you guys havent done your research with the company! Before you guys post negative comments i recommend you to do your due diligence.
Bitclubnetwork is on the blockchain
Also you can see here how many blocks they hit within couple days:
Heres another place:
Also if Bitclub just sponsored the event in Korea.. the global bitcoin convention.: scroll to the bottom and you will see them as a sponsor. 
 
also heres a video of the mining facility they have:
I strongly suggest you do your research and find out first hand before making negative assumptions.
Theres nothing wrong with MLM groups, it makes more millionairs than any other business. The Legitimate MLM companies.. 
As far as scams of course you have to be careful with them...and find out if they are legitimate or not.. 
Pyramid scheme or Ponzi Scheme is a company that DOESNT make money on its own.. the only way that company makes money is by its members who purcahse into.. Thats the legal definition of those words..
Bitclub on the other hand MINES Bitcoin and its clearly proven through Blockchain.info and BlockTrail.com 
Also the company is lauching ATMs :
I understand a lot of people dont like MLMs but thats their choice, but please dont make negative accusations on legitimate businesses.

It will only help the blockchain. =)
