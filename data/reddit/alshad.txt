Think about it for a second. What value does Gold have to the average joe? Paper weight.  Value is given because people “agree” that it has value. 
A long time ago there was no gold or currency. People simply bartered. 1 sheep for 10 chickens. 1 camel for 3 sheep.  1 bundle of wool for 1 vase of wine etc. 
Being that it can be difficult to trade a portion of sheep for a glass of wine, it because necessary to assign value to object. Due to the scarcity (and beauty) of gold historically people used it as a universal value assigning mechanism. 
The issue is that we’re in a digital age. When China sends money to the US they don’t send gold (or even physical fiat for that matter). They send them a wire. Because of this all of the physical money in the world is estimated at 4T, yet the cumulative governments funds is 80T. 
The funds seems to be increasing without restriction. Hence the need of a digital, unhackable, unreproducible, decentralized form of a currency. 
Bitcoin gets its value based on its trust that the community gives for being so secure. The technology is not going anywhere. Anyone who thinks this won’t change the world is simply ignorant.

Simply put, demand increased, but supply remained static..?

I guarantee that this is not the all time high.

Given the volume of transactions vs. the mining reward, i feel like substantially more than 12.5 Bitcoins could be fraudulently created / taken to make the ability tempting-  can you please explain why otherwise?  Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:47:22
In fact we can make a smart contract on Ethereum to bet that this isn’t the all time high... now “that’s the tech I’m takin bout”

Your 30$ worth of bitcoin is safe on Coinbase for quite some time. I wouldn’t stress it till the value gets over a grand.

God Bless you man. Wish I was able to do the same, however I’m barely part of the 21M club.. 
Type 1 Diabetes (JDRF is the charity). 
Unlike type 2 diabetes, type 1 is purely genetic. Unfortunately my brother has to give himself numerous shots / pricks every day just to stay afloat. He is / was always active and ate healthy- just bad luck. We’re not far from finding a solution to make these people’s lives normal again with an artificial pancreas! I’m sure every dollar they receive will help bring it 1 step closer!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:08:22
just so i understand - how would the other full nodes know that the transactions are fraudulent?  Is there  a built in script that basically says if X number of other nodes simultaneously disagree with the longest chain that it would be reverted?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:43:03
Anywhere from -500 through 1500. If you believe in the technology then with time you will make money. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:21:44
Only challenge to that would be: Why do they only have a balance of \~3000 coins?  doesnt that seem small in comparison to the 8.5M moved?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:41:49
Nope. Better to buy and hodl

That was going to be my question. I deem them fraudulent now.

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:14:10
Very personal question... regardless if you're using coinbase the fee is flat for the first 205$ so I'd probably try to make 205$ be my minimum buy.

More like 25k by Christmas if this continues.

1-Transactions can take a few seconds to take place- (meaning show pending on another’s wallet), but takes time for 6 people to verify. 
2- learning curve. Teaching your Grandma how to use a computer seems like an impossible task, yet a 5 year old is a wizard. As bitcoin becomes more relevant in the world, the learning will become natural.  It’s actually not hard at all to secure your coins. Just need to do a little homework. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:23
Personally If you only have .01 I’d probably just keep it in coinbase. They have 14M+ users, so they really don’t want to screw up their reputation (I guess I find safety in numbers). I’d probably look into a wallet once you get .1!
Fees will be explained in the video! They can range from 3$ -12$ on coinbase depending on the time and demand. There are ways to dramatically lower your fees but that’s for another day!

Lastly, what needs to be done in regards to the fork to get my free coins?!

Hardware wallets will run you about 75-100$ if that’s all you have in your coinbase account I think you’re probably fine for the time being. 
Coinbase is an exchange. When you “buy” a bitcoin through them it’s not actually yours until you transfer it into a wallet. Much like if you purchase a stock without a marginal account - it’s not actually yours (immediately at least).
Having a wallet gives you the security to know that what you have is yours, and gives you the ability for safe keeping.

Thanks for the quick reply. Do you know what wallet service defaults on Trezor? Basically once I set it up on Trezor.io, I saw the recurve address, and sent the coins to that address using coinbase..
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:43:52
Excellent reply. 3.64 usd last transaction I made. 
If Trezor goes out of business, I'm assuming I'd be able to use the hardware wallet on another Ui... correct?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:55
Done! Great idea.

As much as we all hate coinbase, their transaction fees are minimal for companies. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:28:50
Always spend when given the chance, however immediately rebuy (plus some extra if possible). Only way bitcoin will grow as a currency.

Your 16, is you lose it all then you still (assumingely) have clothes, a roof, and food. 
Now you work really hard for your money I’m sure. Save a few hundred for your impulse desires, and put the rest in. Your 25 year old self will thank you. 
In your situation the risk is worth the reward imo

What wallet service can I use in conjunction with the hardware key?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:24:42
So if i decide to go with a hardware wallet, and for whatever reason the thumb drive goes bad, is there a way to recover my key?
EDIT** Quick search lead to "you have a recovery seed that you manually write down when you first setup your Ledger Nano S. So you can recover all of you wallets safely by re-configuring a new replacement Ledger Nano S. Also if it's stolen, the security feature is to wipe the wallet clean after 3 failed pin attempts. I've test this feature out and it works pretty well. I configured my Nano S, saved the seed. Loaded a small amount of coins in there. Purposely failed the pin 3 times. The Nano S wiped itself clean like we expected, and forced me to input the recovery seed to recover the wallets. My coins were back without any issues"

I litterally stopped what I was doing and bought Bitcoin souly because of this post. Zero sarcasm. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:34:44
Of course. However with a pyramid scheme, you don't reach a point where nothing additional is being produced, i.e. when the last coin is mined.
Also, money is a tool. It's a way of providing a universal platform for the ability of trade for goods and services. 
Fiat money in and of itself has no worth. It's value comes from the government dictating what it's "value" is.  Government also being in control of when they can create more (out of thin air).
To an average Joe, even gold has minimal value. It can be used as decor or a paper weight.
