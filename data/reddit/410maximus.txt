Except bitcoin is a bad recipe lmao. That’s why they are trying so desperately to upscale it. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:39:26
Is there even a .000000001% chance that one bitcoin would ever be worth 10 million USD? I find that hard to believe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:32:09
Edit: oops, someone beat me to it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:03
I'm just buying more every time it drops below $16,000. We all know this is a temporary drop... so let's benefit from it!

Some random dude enthusiastically told me about bitcoin several years ago and I dismissed it as pure bullshit. At that time I had recently been approached by several close friends who had fallen victim to obvious pyramid schemes, and they were trying to get me on board. So naturally I was automatically on the defensive when this stranger started telling me about this magic internet money that could potentially turn me into a millionaire. I hate myself for not researching his claims and realizing it wasn't some get rich quick scheme. Nonetheless, like you I recently decided to purchase some bitcoin (a small amount, but I plan to do a little bit with each paycheck). I do not think we are too late.... certainly we missed the initial "big bang", but that doesn't mean the ride is over yet, perhaps it's just getting started? I sincerely wish the best of luck to all bitcoin believers!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:28
Yikes.... I currently keep my bitcoin in coinbase, this is terrifying.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:04:35
Just because you thanked him for calling you out, doesn't mean you didn't get called out. Multiple people said "repost" and posted the original link and you told us we didn't get the joke. And why would you assume people on the bitcoin subreddit are also visiting the jokes subreddit? That's absurd logic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:42
It's not too late, the train is still boarding. I just bought a very small amount of bitcoin 2 weeks ago and already made like $60.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:21
I'm just using this as an opportunity to buy more while it's below $16k.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:23
Please explain how that is an anti-BTC post? Even his original joke incorporates an increase in value, not a decrease. Just because some ignorant people in the comments are trashing bitcoin does not equate to it being an anti-BTC post. Also, we both know you weren't even going to credit the original source until you were called out in your previous post that was subsequently deleted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:38:26
Have you no compassion? Or are you not able to comprehend the amount of stress you would feel from potentially losing $1.8m?? If you are getting tired of these posts, don't click on them, it's really that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:51:01
How is snorting BTC any different to snorting cocaine?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:24
I think if those were your truthful intentions you would have linked the original post from the other subreddit before being called out. You're just covering your tracks now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:11:20
LMFAO! I didn't notice that xD

I understand how relativity works... thanks for being the 5th person to comment with the same reply lmao
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:58:47
I see were discussing the important things here today.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:43:47
It's only dipped by $260ish, everybody can calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:42:41
Nah, it was just a bitcoin joke that consisted of about 12 total words, and you're imagining the rest to justify the existence of this repost. You simply reposted the same joke with different values in the bitcoin specific subreddit to elicit a response from people who didn't see the original joke. Congrats, I'm sure you'll get plenty of upvotes for this minimal effort.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:53:42
Ok. Bye.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:09:46
Why though?

Sooo you hate yourself? Gotcha!

You better ask for that .1 ASAP boiiii

lmfao this is going to be epic... RIP OP's throat
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:52:51
Nice repost. At least wait a day lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:53
Wow, this is so exciting. All my friends said it was too late to get into bitcoin. I didn't listen and bought $115 USD worth of bitcoin 2 weeks ago, and I have already made $50+. I know it's not a lot, but it's still "free money". I am going to continue to buy small amounts with each paycheck.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:45
No, trust me, we got it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:55:14
thank you for the answer!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:36:50
Why would you sell? If you own a single bitcoin, you are very lucky. That is going to be worth a lot more within the next few years. Selling now would be foolish, unless you absolutely need the cash ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:04:24
Is it too late to invest in Comcast?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:03
The guy casually said “cool, I have one bitcoin, how do I get rich?” so it doesn’t sound like he’s depending on this money. That’s why I would not recommend him to sell at this time. I’m not saying I know anything will happen for a fact, so why don’t you GTFO with your negativity. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:33:39
Lmao wtf were you thinking bro? Maybe you can nicely ask her to stop bringing it up. Tell her to think of it as a savings account lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:20:32
Naw, B, Naw.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:55:11
Good job, OP's wife!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:20:04
Wait, what? I'm literally on the cusp of buying "a lot" (to me) of Ripple.... how is it a scam?
EDIT: Why do people downvote others for asking questions on this sub? Isn't that the entire point of us gathering together, so we can learn from each other?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:21:07
I read it. I asked him a question and made a valid prediction that it would be worth more some day. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:08:01

Same. I hope it is the right decision!

Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:58:03
By a lot, I mean like $50. I think I would be alright if I lost it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:07:57
Nah, no pass. This is  shameless same-day reddit plagiarism in a sad attempt to get karma. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:17:00
Surely the best way to encourage &amp; educate new people about using bitcoin is to make fun of them.... yep, that's gonna work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:55:13
I like this approach very much.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:57:22
when I dip you dip we buy
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:36:01
A "substantial" amount of money? That is the understatement of the century! $1.8m is a life changing sum of money. I would be shitting literal bricks right now if I was OP.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:00
We shall see!
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:07:41
Wow, that's awesome! Congrats, brother!

Okay, Donald.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:55
Wait, like a physical bitcoin treasure hunt? As in, I don't have to know the in's and out's of complex mining processes? Count me in! I still lose sleep on some nights, thinking about the 20 bitcoins I almost had in my possession back in 2011, but I just didn't understand it enough and I had myself convinced it was some pyramid scheme on a grand scale.
I'm over here in Maryland... any chance this hunt will make its way to the east coasters?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:23
Who said anything about their feelings being hurt? lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:12:28
I wish I could buy one bitcoin.

You’re a clown.

What kinda vitamins are they feeding this kid? I probably couldn’t memorize half of that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:45
I keep seeing so many comments &amp; posts warning about coin base, but nobody seems to offer the better solution... I'm not really sure what we are supposed to do with these warnings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:50
Thank you, kind sir! :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:24
I'm sure I will be laughed at but all I could afford right now is $50.... I plan to invest more when I get paid. Hopefully I'm not too late to the party!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:50
Based on what I have been reading (new user here), yes, now is an appropriate time. I get paid tomorrow and plan on converting a small chunk of $ myself.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:56:41
Just stop. I’m not here to prove anything. You’re acting like a damn fool. Good day, sir. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:48:01
I'm sorry, are you intimately familiar with the history of my company's technical difficulties? No? Then stop talking out of your ass and find somebody else to harass. Stop trying to "win" an "argument" that you only have half the context for. I'm not going to reveal who I work for, so this conversation is pointless. Good day, sir.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:59:45
Thanks for the info. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.... but will my bitcoin amount continue to "grow" when I move them to Exodus?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:49
This. I only bought $50 worth of bitcoin, and I find myself checking the app every 30 minutes because I'm so anxious lol. Today is my first day though, so the excitement is high.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:54
Wait, my bitcoins aren't safe in Coin base?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:12
And currently 0.5 Bitcoin is equivalent to around $5,500 USD... correct? Regardless, thanks for the info because that puts everyone else's investment amounts into context for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:40
I would definitely eat my left ball for 100 BTC. My right ball will pick up the slack.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:20:04
Oh god... coinbase is going to crash tomorrow. Calling it now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:45:09
Because Trump literally said this about his presidency lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:06:39
Why was Coinbase awful for withdrawing? Can you share your experience?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:12:47
Wait.... I don't get paid until tomorrow and I was planning on converting $50 over to bitcoin. Is Big Bang Theory actually going to mention bitcoin on an episode tonight? Because if so, I don't want to wait until tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:52:57
thank god
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:30
Why did you feel the need to do this...... I just.... wtf man :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:35:28
Yes, we have actually. Just dealt with a similar situation (but worse) in September, and we had several hundred transactions unaccounted for. Also, nowhere did I say it is "the same" - you created that comment in your own head.... of course it's not the same. Cheer up and have a nice day, pal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:28
Most norms don't even know what reddit is.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:29:21
What is the minimum amount of money a new adopter should invest right now to expect a significant return?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:33:17
So then why do so many people mention &amp; recommend coinbase? It's the 1st thing I learned about Bit Coin, and now everyone is saying to avoid it. So many mixed messages.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:23
Oh wow, I wasn't aware there was a documentary. Thanks a ton!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:27
Hmmmm.... that's a good idea. I wonder if I can sell my washer &amp; dryer for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:35:55

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:59:55
Dude, so then what the frick are we supposed to do? You all keep telling us to stay the hell away from Coinbase &amp; Gdax, but nobody offers the actual solution. What is the most efficient way of converting fiat into bit coin? Is there even an app that completely eliminates the need for Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:40
Ah, that makes total sense. Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:18
Do you watch Saturday morning cartoons? If so, which is your favorite, and why?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:20:24
Ok so not that I will be thinking about doing this anytime soon, but when I’m ready to sell, beforehand I definitely need to transfer my Bitcoin to a “3rd party vendor” such as gdax, in order to avoid larger “withdrawal” (sell) fees on Coinbase... gotcha. Thanks so much, sorry for being a pest, my friend failed to inform me about any of this when he convinced me to give this a shot, so this is a learning experience for me. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:25:47
Ahhh, gotcha. I will look up some YouTube videos on the subject as suggested. Thanks again!! :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:53
If I shouldn't be using Coinbase, what should I be using? Is there a better option?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:30
Took me about an hour to even create an account and log in.... soooo many error messages.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:59
Thank you so much for the detailed reply, it’s really helping me to understand all of this. So, based on your last sentence, I’m assuming people have had issues trying to sell their Bitcoin for $ on Coinbase? Did they lose all of their $? I’m just trying to make sure I properly understand the risks with Coinbase. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:04:48
I'm not clicking this video, but I am curious... does he literally just cut his ball out and eat it? No sedatives, no medical assistance? Couldn't he have bled to death? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:04
It's more or less about directing the traffic flow without any "impacts" or "accidents" taking place at the intersections. It's not just about the sheer volume of users. A website / app like Coinbase requires thousands of complex connections to be communicating simultaneously, it's obviously way more complicated than just an HTML website with basic data fields - Coinbase has to account for thousands of users from multiple fiduciary institutes depositing and withdrawing, it's a constant influx of data transfer and some things just don't line up sometimes. It could be as simple as an un-optimized piece of code that wasn't being implemented until a certain volume of traffic was detected. Soooo many factors tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:50
