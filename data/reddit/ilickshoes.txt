And back it up after each trx, or else when you recover from backup your change addresses will be gone. Sounds like this guys parents are going to get a lot of emails.

I love BTC, but your statement is incorrect. Starting a business is different from accepting payment. In the UK at least they still would be unable to be a company director,  register for vat, etc.
And as for accepting payments thats hard for everyone to secure a merchant account, not just children.

Excellent post higghlinhting the real dangers of trading btc today. Im afraid that people wont learn until they are greeted by 502s at their favorite exchanges, but at this point there has been a fair amount of warning on various forums.

expect  people here to tell you its a ddos, for some reason its now verboten to post images of bot activity and speculation on these boards. you just get modded down to nothing if you do.

@_date: 2013-04-16 17:54:48
except mtgox wasnt ddos, there are stack overflow posts out there proving they are just greedy incompetents. the HFT bots dint bring the ngynx 502, its a different interface. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:54:05
no shit! they suspended to cash they perso coins. mtgox is the real winner here. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:25:00

spoiler alert: now that the get rich quick stupids have been scared to death, theres no one left to prop up the price. the 125 you see are speculators with tons of cash doing their thing. theyll get bored. its going to see saw for the next few month on a downward slope, and stabilize at 30
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:53:19

@_date: 2013-04-18 06:52:53

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:55:28
the fact you are getting downvoted to oblivion should tell you everything about who is running the show here. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:20:11
good idea! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:23:32
