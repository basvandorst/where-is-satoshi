That's definitely true. But while individuals on this sub can be greedy and short-sighted, the whole premise of BCH is a greedy and short-sighted attempt at resolving the scaling issue in a destructive and divisive way to me. The latest behaviour of its figurehead only serves to reinforce that perception.
Where some users on this sub do behave like dicks, the leading figures of bitcoin seem to me to plead for patience and progress. Whereas the users of r/btc are similarly constituted to those of (most of them dumbasses, including me) but BCH's leaders are vile and vitriolic figures trying to divide the Crypto Community rather than build upon what's already there.
Personally, I want Bitcoin to succeed. I don't really care about price that much: I'm a long-term hodler, if BTC lost 90% of its value tomorrow, I'd still have made money but the current price isn't enough for me to just fuck off to a desert island. In a way I'm in a sort of sweet spot for clarity. But I also want other coins to succeed at the same time! Everybody benefits from having different functionalities and trade-offs on different chains if they can communicate with each other. BCH can fuck off though. Regardless of the merits of a block-size increase, Ver's tantrums are disqualifying to me.

I mean... If they want to subsidize our freedom...
I'd rather everyone be free, but I'd also rather be free than not.

We've got  on Bloomberg to look forward to at least but yeah, a Core PR team would be great!
How could we go about setting up a fund to that end?

I've always understood the animosity towards BCH to be reserved only for BCH. I don't see attacks against ETH or LTC for example. I think it's mostly the dishonest, greedy and short-sighted behaviour that comes with BCH that's attacked. Not altcoins in general.
Also, Reddit is made up of individuals, and two contradicting messages can coexist on a sub if there isn't a strictly enforced dogma.

More like exchange killer. Atomic swaps are insane.

I'm like 90% sure most Nigerian scammers aren't Nigerian but I have no source on that!
But in any case, you can't judge 170 million people on a few thousand scammers!
Plus it's good for Bitcoin

There's no risk in either options. You don't stand to lose anything in that situation.
I'd bet you wouldn't be able to find anyone anywhere who would take the second option as described here.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:54:53
Okay, maybe not nobody. Nobody with the ability to understand that money can be exchanged for goods and services. The only reason someone would not take that offer is if they don't believe it because of how good it is. That's definitely a possibility. 
You're underestimating survival instincts at that point. If humans weren't able to recognize this offer as a must take opportunity we'd never have developped tool use.
If we can find a way to design that experiment I am ready to bet 1XBT that nobody will refuse that offer in any statistically representative sample.
I would even be willing to bet that at such an incredible risk/reward ratio you'd find an inversion in risk aversion. Because that's basically how the lottery works

How much money are you ready to put on the line that anyone would take the second option in that situation?
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:17:50
Yes, I have read AI to Zombies, and I am aware of the studies on risk aversion. My offer still stands.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:27:37
No, no one would take the second option because the downside of taking the first option isn't even close to proportional to the upside.
Your offer can be reformulated as : If you give me $10 you'll tell me heads or tail, I'll throw a coin, if you're right, you'll get $1M, if you're wrong you'll be $10 poorer. If you don't want to play I'll give you $10.
Nobody would refuse such an offer. The standard risk aversion prevents someone from taking a statistically advantageous proposal  if the loss is between 1.5 to 2.5 times less than the potential gain. If the loss is 10000 times less than the gain, nobody would pass that up.
