If you can redeem from Tether for USD from the company itself, it is actually ponying up the USD and this makes for a much better indication that they actually have the reserves to back it up. If you can trade USDT for USD at an exchange at close to 1:1, it merely means that other investors have not lost confidence in the peg (yet).

This is not really redeeming tether, this is just trading it on the secondary market and is functionally no different from doing USDT -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD.

All bitcoin. $1,400 is not a life-changing amount to me and since I feel bitcoin has greater upside, that's what I'll go with.
Now, if I had a million dollars to invest, it would be a totally different story. Then I would probably do $100,000 gold, $800,000 bitcoin, and $100,000 cash. (Assuming those are the only three options; otherwise I'd definitely put some in altcoins and stocks.) Basically, nothing changes the fact that bitcoin is still going to be the most profitable investment IMO, so I'm still betting most on it. However, I'm keeping some in cash because it's the most liquid and useful for paying bills, and some in gold in case World War III happens and makes cash worthless due to hyperinflation and bitcoin worthless as Internet connections between countries go down and cause forks in the blockchain.

That's intentional. There's a big difference between a prediction futures market like InTrade (and this one) and a mere weighted betting website like [BitBet]( Here, you might go long at 5 mBTC and then sell at 9 mBTC before the event occurs. So basically if the event is "Bitcoin to be over $600 on 2/21" and it's almost time and Bitcoin is at $700, it will probably be trading at 9.9 mBTC or something. So betting in and winning will get you only 0.1 mBTC, while you're risking 9.9 mBTC if something catastrophic happens.
Think about it this way. (For simplicity, ignore fees.) On BitBet, let's say you bet 1 BTC on YES, and someone else at the same time bets 1 BTC on NO (not required, but just making the two scenarios as similar as possible). As it gets close to resolution and it looks likely to happen, 9 more BTC come in on YES. The event resolves as YES and you get 1.1 BTC. On Predictious, you long 1 BTC and someone shorts 1 BTC to you at 5 mBTC/share. As it gets close to resolution, 9 more BTC come in on YES (notice that this affects the current price, but not what your payout will be in case of successful prediction). The event resolves as YES and you get your shares back at 10 mBTC/share, or 2 BTC.

Self-regulation is a good way to prevent the government from getting involved. When the MPAA created the rating system, it wasn't doing so out of the kindness of its heart. It knew that if it didn't regulate itself, the government would step in and likely impose disagreeable terms on it.
Just as the MPAA can't prevent you from making whatever movie you want, the Bitcoin community can't prevent people from using bitcoin for drugs or money laundering. But sending a strong message of disapproval is necessary to convince governments to regulate us less.

Bitcoin is not ideal for small amounts. In fact, the transaction fees are intentionally there to prevent the blockchain from being clogged by small amounts.

This is why I don't understand why many scholarships send a check addressed to your university, rather than you personally. Currently, I receive partial need-based financial aid, and my university has an odd quirk where you can only bring in $5,000 a year of outside scholarship money and any amount over that is deducted from your financial aid. (If the outside scholarship money is so much that it even exceeds your financial aid, then it starts to count again.)
Why can't they just verify your enrollment status, and then send you a personal check? I understand that your reason for providing the money is for my education, but money is fungible. A dollar off my tuition is a dollar freed up for whatever. Tax reasons? I'd gladly pay 30% in taxes if it means not giving up 100% of it.

Yes, BitBet screws over early betters. Predictious does not. Let's say you are absolutely positive that Mt.Gox is insolvent. If you bet early, you could get a share at 5 mBTC (if the market at that time believes in a 50% default probability) and resolve at 10 mBTC, making a profit of 5 mBTC per share. If you bet later when really bad news has come out, you would probably need to pay 9 mBTC for a share, earning only 1 mBTC for the share.

Here's another place where this could be used: academic research. Suppose you want to share a paper privately with a few others before sending it off to publication. You write up a paper and proceed with the steps you've described. This prevents others from claiming your work as their own. Even if they write up a paper from scratch on your idea, you could still announce your file and real name and prove that your blockchain entry occurred earlier than their paper.
Or there might be some idea that you want to share with the world, but cannot share the details until a later date. You simply create a file, follow your steps, make your announcement, and then at the later date reveal your file.

2 and 3 are both addresses that the sender controls. They were combined to produce the transaction. 4 is a [change address]( also controlled by the sender. Basically, in Bitcoin, when you spend your coins, you're actually referencing previous transactions, and you have to use all your coins (from a particular previous transaction) at once. If the amount of coins you put into the transaction exceed the amount you want to send, you send some back to yourself in a change address.

A zero-knowledge proof is where one person is able to prove to another person that they know something, without actually revealing what it is. In this case, it would entail convincing us mathematically that the brainwallet does actually consist of three OED words followed by a number. Obviously, he can't actually reveal what the brainwallet is, or else someone would be able to trivially recover the private key.

It does, marginally. There is a concept known as [velocity of money]( which measures how often money spreads relative to the amount of money in circulation. If it's too high, there's no way the network could handle it.
Let's suppose for a minute that 1 BTC is worth $0.01. That would put its market cap at $125,000. Is it really possible for a currency with a market cap of $125,000 to gain worldwide adoption, without an increase in market cap? You can't even buy a house with it.

Indeed. Now for scrypt, it's become increasingly unprofitable to mine ever since the December Litecoin boom and the Dogecoin halving. However, if you get a GPU, it acts as a good hedge against falling scrypt coin prices (as opposed to using the same money to buy scrypt coins). That is, if the prices of scrypt coins fall, some people will call it quits and sell off their GPUs to people who actually need them to play games, run CAD software, etc., reducing the network difficulty.
But with SHA-256, an ASIC isn't really useful for much other than mining, so people will keep mining as long as it covers their electricity costs. Hence it's always better to just buy Bitcoin outright than trying to buy an ASIC, unlike the case with scrypt.

@_date: 2014-03-05 01:34:02
Depends on the amount. Under $10 = no confirmations required, up to a few hundred = 1 confirmation, more than that = maybe 3, 6, whatever.
Remember that the difference between 0 confirmations and 1 confirmation is much bigger than the difference between 1 confirmation and 100. In the first case, all you need is a regular computer to carry out a double spend. Once a single confirmation hits the blockchain, you either need a lot of hashpower or an inordinate amount of luck to orphan the block.

In your specific case, all 300 BTC get spent. Instead of thinking about your address holding coins, it is simply an account number on a ledger. The balance is not stored on the system, but rather calculated from the transactions that go in or out of it. So technically, you don't spend coins, but rather past transactions. When that amount adds up to more than the amount you wish to spend, you still have to send each unspent input in its entirety, but you also send the remaining coin to yourself in a change address.
So to answer your question, 100 * 14 + 200 * 7 = 2800 coin-days are destroyed.

It's true that their real name probably isn't Satoshi Nakamoto, but it's even more unlikely that a random person would be called Satoshi Nakamoto.

Again, there is no foolproof method. DPR encrypted his hard drive and everything but got raided by the FBI when his laptop was open (and it happened so quickly that he didn't get a chance to close the lid, causing the encryption to turn itself back on), so they got to his personal stash. (All bets are off when your attacker gains physical access to your computer. At the very least, even if they can't get your data they can still destroy it.)
But a normal user would most likely be subject to attacks from the Internet. And in such cases Linux provides comparatively more security than Windows, and is also less used so fewer viruses are being written for it.

Arbitrage based on markets' slow reaction only works if trades are automated. (I'm using the term arbitrage loosely, since technically it isn't arbitrage if you can't move USD into Mt.Gox. Nonetheless there is no reason for GoxUSD to be worth more than realUSD.) Currently I believe all this GoxBTC to realBTC trading is done OTC, so the buyers of GoxBTC won't actually buy it at their published prices now that they see where Mt.Gox is at.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:57:51
Not exactly true. Previously, when Gox USD was 20% more than regular USD, that reflected the credit risk of holding USD in Gox, since 1 Gox BTC was essentially as good as 1 real BTC.
Now, both Gox BTC and Gox USD are at a discount, but Gox BTC more so. So the difference actually represents the difference in credit risk between holding BTC in Gox and USD in Gox.

The point is. it's constantly dropping, but you're also constantly earning coins from mining. If you mine more coins than you lose from the price dropping, then you have made a profit.
Effectively, if you buy GHS shares, you are taking a short position on the increase in network hashrate.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:24:24
Yes to the first question.
Let's say the current price of real BTC is $600 (real USD). Let's also assume that there is a 60% chance that Gox BTC is worth nothing (and 40% chance it is worth 1 real BTC), and a 20% chance that Gox USD is worth nothing (and 80% chance it is worth $1). This is obviously oversimplified, because in a liquidation you typically recover a percentage of your money as opposed to an all-or-nothing situation, but I'm just making up some numbers to prove a point.
Anyways, now 1 Gox BTC is worth $240, and 1 Gox USD is worth $0.80. So 1 Gox BTC should be worth 240/0.8 = 300 Gox USD.

It's different. People understand fiat currency much better, and it's obvious to both the merchant and the customer whether they've paid or not. A person paying in Bitcoin might not be aware that they need to include a transaction fee for the miners to accept the transaction quickly.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:39:13
It doesn't matter whether you call it 2.1 million or 210 million, as long as you scale everything else (e.g. block rewards) appropriately. All of those values are above the point at which 1 satoshi will ever be worth anything in the real world.

First of all, the merchant could simply refuse to accept a transaction with no fee attached and not give you your product.
To solve the problem of people forgetting to include fees, you could have people use a hosted wallet like Coinbase, which pays transaction fees on their behalf, so they won't have to deal with technology. Most of the public will choose convenience over ideology (i.e. Bitcoin being decentralized) or security (i.e. Coinbase getting hacked). And that's totally fine. For example, I prefer to use open-source software. I'm not going to actually look at the code, but it boosts my confidence to know that I *can* look at the code if I wanted to. Similarly, although the Bitcoin network is decentralized, you can choose to use a centralized service while reaping some of the benefits of decentralization.

He is talking about marginal cost of production. You are thinking of average cost. Let's say it takes me $1 million to develop a software product, and I spend $1 per copy to make the CD and ship it. Then, if I sell a thousand copies, my average cost is $1001000 / 1000 = $1001 per copy, and if I sell a million, my average cost is $2000000 / 1000000 = $2 per copy. However, in both cases, my *marginal* cost is $1. That is the cost it takes to produce one additional copy.
Now, with the Apple case, it gets tricky. How much does a single additional app purchase cost them? Zero. But if there are a billion more app purchases every day, you can imagine them upgrading their servers. So technically, I am talking about the amortized marginal cost.

Technically, it's not Mt. Gox making up the prices, but investors (rightfully) suspecting there was a credit risk of holding fiat in Mt. Gox, thus driving BTC up. When BTC withdrawals were stopped, Gox BTC plummeted to $150 as people believed fiat would be easier to recover in bankruptcy, making the credit risk of BTC higher.

When trading between two coins, it's hard to define what "profit" exactly means, because it depends on your objectives. So let's take a step back.
In traditional stock trading, you're of course looking to maximize your amount of USD, not number of shares held. Let's say a stock has been bouncing between $40 and $42 for a long time. You think, great, I'll just buy at $40 and sell at $42. You do this 3 times, each with 100 shares, and you've made $600. The next time you go to do this, you buy at $40 and watch the stock plummet to $30.

Given the format of Judge Judy, this is the most fair outcome possible. Not having to pay the judgment himself, the Bitcoin seller is flat (having sold the Bitcoin for a fair price, and not gained or lost anything after that). The truck buyer has received his money back as well. So the net effect of this is that the producers paid the the scammer $2,000.
If Judge Judy had ruled in favor of the Bitcoin seller, the net effect would be that the Bitcoin buyer / truck seller successfully scammed $2,000 from the truck buyer.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:48:34
Any evidence of this occurring?
@_date: 2015-11-13 05:14:22
No, the seller does not have to give the money back. If Judge Judy issues a ruling in favor of the plaintiff, it's the producers who pay, not the defendant. Those are the rules for Judge Judy.
So let's see here:
* The scammer received $2,000 from the buyer. Net gain of $2,000.
* The Bitcoin seller gave $2,000 worth of bitcoin to the scammer, and received $2,000 from the truck buyer. No net gain or loss.
* The truck buyer gave $2,000 to the Bitcoin seller, but receives $2,000 from the producers. No net gain or loss.
* The producers give $2,000 to the truck buyer. Net loss of $2,000. (But actually, they're the big winner here, taking in millions in ad revenue.)

Always hold your own private keys. Don't trust normally reliable exchanges like Coinbase, who sent away customers' ETC coins to other people because they regarded them as worthless.
As long as you have your pre-fork coins in an offline wallet, just wait. I'm sure convenient user guides will come out in the days following the split. Then you can transfer, or better yet, leave your pre-fork coins untouched unless you need to.
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:00:56
That is still a live transaction and theoretically could still be confirmed. If that happens then they have your coins and you'll have to contact their customer support to demand a refund.
If you don't want that to happen, you need to create a double-spend transaction with a higher fee and send it to yourself. You should use a fee of 0.001 or more (yes, that's $2.50 but it's simply the way it is until the scaling debate is resolved).
