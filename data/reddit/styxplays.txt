Yeah Citi were my first choice but their "normal" current account is unavailable to new customers :( A £25/mo fee is just too steep for me at the moment. 
I was wondering if anyone had used HSBC or Santander or one of the larger banks.

Thanks for those and especially thanks for the bitcoinuk sub-reddit, I didn't know it existed. 
However, I don't think any of those methods are the cheapest. E.G. Speedy Bitcoin is right now at £201.76 whereas on btc-e it is £184.4 and Kraken it is £191.

Any suggestions on banks to use for the EUR account?

For some reason FirstDirect don't advertise it on their site but they 100% do offer EUR and USD accounts. Here is some information about their EUR account I managed to get from them:
Our foreign currency accounts are holding accounts with HSBC Bank and do not come with either a cheque book or card.
INTERNATIONAL PERSONAL ACCOUNT (CURRENCY INSTANT ACCESS SAVINGS ACCOUNT)
- in order to open an International Personal Account, you must already hold a 1st Account
- no minimum balance is required 
- any payments made from an International Personal Account are subject to our standard charges
- any deposits or withdrawals of cash from an IPA are subject to a 1% commission charge
- statements are issued monthly
- where interest is payable, this is paid on the whole balance of the account at the Currency Deposit Rate which in turn is linked to market rates
- where interest is payable, then this is credited half yearly in June and December or quarterly in March, June, September and December for euro accounts
- if an account is opened and not used for six months, you will receive a letter asking whether or not you require the account. If after a further two months we have not received a response from you, the account will be closed automatically
Please contact us on 03 456 100 100 (or +44 113 234 5678 if calling from abroad) ext 50015, to complete the account opening 
I phoned them up. There is no opening/maintenance fee, but the £4 SEPA fee is still  there.

That article mentions a "hard block-chain split". I don't know a huge amount about the workings of Bitcoin but does that mean that all Bitcoins mined up to that point will become invalid and unusable?
