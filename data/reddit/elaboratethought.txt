BitWage is our payroll solution and it is not a wallet, we just need a US bank to fully legitimize our business and pay LLC taxes from.

Really because 7 days ago Capital One official said they are not approving any transactions for any customers to Coinbase, also no business checking accounts, also BOA is not accepting business checking accounts for btc business.  right totally a joke...how about legitimate concern.  Thought this community would be helpful...maybe anyone out there that has actually started a business based around btc/crypto.  Whatever.

Way to go Mom!  For xmas I am setting up a Wallet for my mom and giving her $50 in Bitcoin to get her started.  She is 70 and very interested in Bitcoin.

they must have went for a coffee break because it just dropped $30

It is still progress.  We are in the beginning stages of everything.  I am glad that Coinbase is attempting this.  Always keep moving forward and innovate.

does this have something to do with their employee bunker and water and toilet paper rations?

I wonder if buying an El Camino would drive it to the moon?

this is great news, thank you to everyone who shared their experiences!

"Mysterious and complex technology" - sounds sexy

where is that guy that says "welcome to bitcoin motherfkr"?  we need him
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:56:22
Bitcoin doesn't care and will find a way without Wall Street and centralized banking entities - that's the point.  Who cares!
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:16:13
Exactly about everything you said.  When did the bitcoin community ever give a !!!! if bitcoin would have an ETF? Seriously people we are getting way far from the fundamentals of crypto.  This time the price didn't dump as much, soon it won't matter at all.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:09:56
Exactly, aren't most into Bitcoin to move away from the financial giants, including paypal?
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:15:46
yes, why not just fade away from it rather than publicly causing potential harm to Bitcoin? If I had spent that much time on something I would not speak badly of it if it did not work out for me anymore.

Very cool! Thank you!

They can try but they won't win.

For any emerging technology to move into adoption and acceptance there must be some form of regulation, like it or not.  Bitcoin/crypto needs this right now.

This is your grandma, watch yo mouth.

You all realize that people with real money are buying all the way down right now...right?  They love the panic and will profit off of your loss, unless most of the people fudding on here don't even own bitcoin.  Who knows?
