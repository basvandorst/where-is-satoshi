Well done.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:05:26
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:05:19
It is.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:10:31
What about Nick Szabo?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:12:46
Satoshi is dead because he is Hal finney. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:49:13
This guy hahahahahha
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:10:40
No he’s definitely a troll, look at his comment history.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:50:09
So just to be certain; you are not being sarcastic?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:01:00
Thanks for your explanation. What about Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:00:58
Until I read this I literally thought Bitcoin.com was the official site.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:29:18
Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:14:46
A very good point it is.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:36:28
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:50
Yeah indeed. I've been using it for some time but a lot of people don't seem to like it and saw no one giving a good reason for it. That's why I was asking in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:09:10
Remindme! One year
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:18:53
Wikipedia says he is an early Bitcoin adopter and received the first BTC transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto. He denies that he is Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:36:40
Could you explain yourself, and what is a better option then?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:27:47
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:44:27
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:13:14
How will this affect the price?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:03:19
Even not Monero or Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:11:28
For the record, I was serious. Why can’t Litecoin or Monero replace Bitcoin? I don’t want to bash Bitcoin or something, but just want to learn something. 
Has BTC only the luck that it’s the first cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:12:51
RemindMe! Two weeks
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:42:22
He means blockchain.info, which is an online wallet provider.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:53:54
Kan je uitleggen waarom?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:01:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:39:58
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:01:49
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:14
Who is the owner of Bitcoin.org then, Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:46
But why would OP wait till after 18 because the price will rise because of this, right?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:40:24
Can count them on 1 hand, why?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:26:11
Did Satoshi gave someone permission to maintain the site?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:36:42
What is at the 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:21:38
Damn I feel so sorry for you man.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:10:34
Since there is no real evidence of who Satoshi is, all of these names are speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:26:05
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:31:29
Ahahaa just had exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:52:16
Yeah, I have a Blockchain.info wallet and it's possible for me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:30:56
Can't you change the fee?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:57:27
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:49
Yeah I was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:31:37
Because you sound like a 13 y/o that has nothing to do.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:02:10
So Segwit2x is not definitely cancelled?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:14:37
This is what I've been wondering too. Can someone explain?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:06:08
It's both I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:33
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:33:44
Yeah I meant the blockchain.info wallet. Anyway thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:29:16
How old are you?
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:22:43
Hahhahahahaha no but seriously which anime is this?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:51:50
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:31:33
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:53:48
Read the title. It says with value over $100. The author clearly never attended economic class since value depends on circulating supply.
