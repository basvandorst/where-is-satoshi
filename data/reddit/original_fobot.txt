no. the new address posted on mtgox.com, this is the link
that address is a company that does virtual offices, ie they rent out their address to people that want to use that address for a business. the person the O.P. is referring to called the business on the telephone and was told that the name in the mtgOX address "MtGox Co.,Ltd." has 'rented' a 'virtual office' with only snail mail services, this was done a week ago and the only instructions left were that 'they (MtGox Co.,Ltd.) would send a courier to pick up snail mail once a week. i was in the chatbox when all this was posted, i verify this info was posted as stated by the O.P.

we have the mtgOX snail mail drop address in tokyo, what could possibly go wrong?

they bugged out, the new address is a snail mail only drop where a courier will pick up mail once a week/month

i would try it again
and again
and again, until it stops doing that

people will eventually realize they are gone and things will start to move where 'er they may go, without mtgOX influence

i am surprised more development hasn't been put into a nice friendly wallet, the news of eBay doing something with a multi-currency wallet is the best thing that could help

they bugged out, there is no one left. it is all gone

Hudson: That's it man, game over man, game over! What the f*ck are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?
Burke: Maybe we could build a fire, sing a couple of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?
people are still in denial, once they move to acceptance then bitcoin can move on to new exchanges
