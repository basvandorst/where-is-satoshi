They were one of the main entities behind the failed Segwit2x hard fork that tried to co-opt Bitcoin. They also started forcing people to pay their invoices using BIP70, without a fallback option of providing an address.

Segwit was a block size increase though.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:02:29
Yes they are. 0.1-0.13 nodes would all have considered a block that exploited this bug invalid; while 0.15-0.16.2 would have considered it valid. That is the definition of a hard fork.
EDIT: Also said that the bugfix was a soft fork; which necessarily means that reversing the bugfix would be a hard fork, which also necessarily means that when it originally was introduced, it was a hard fork.

Define "guarantee".
Unless the miner has a large stake in the outcome of your bet, yes.
You could also salt and hash the blockhash yourself, and use that. This would eliminate the scenario where the miner has a large stake in *some* other bet that would interfere with yours otherwise.

The sum of two dice does not provide a uniform distribution even without the modulo.
With some reasonable assumptions, the blockhashes interpreted as integers, between 0 and the difficulty target, are uniformly distributed. Hence, the only skewing the modulo will do is due to the usual reason: near the boundary, the cut-off is not exactly where you would want it. So smaller numbers will be a tad more likely, but it's negligible. You could specifically handle the case if that happened (that the blockhash is *just* below the target), but it's very unlikely.

That's not what I said. In any case, actually p2sh segwit takes up more disk space than legacy or native segwit. Native segwit uses roughly the same disk space as legacy. Note that I am talking about disk space not weight.
Thanks to the weight calculation logic, segwit txns have less weight than legacy, and hence the disk space/bandwidth requirements of blocks are larger.
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:35:53
You are conflating two different meaning of "new blocks".
Post\-segwit fork blocks have two different "versions", one without witness data \(which is what unupgraded nodes see\) and one with witness data. These two views of the same block of course contain the same number of transactions. A transaction without witness data takes up less space.
Before segwit fork, every transaction had to include witness data in the single view of blocks.
Before segwit fork, the 1MB limit applied to the single view of blocks; after segwit fork, the 1MB limit only applies to the OLD view of blocks \(without witness data\).
So, the point, because witness data does not count in the 1MB limit now, a single transaction takes up a smaller chunk of the 1MB limit, hence more transactions can fit inside the limit.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:50:39
You are forgetting that segwit transactions do not have signature data in the scriptSig but in the witness. That is the key point. That's why they are smaller according to the old counting.
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:40:45
What happens if the counterparty broadcasts an old commitment transaction? Is breach remedy implemented?

No. Unless he privately came up with the idea of seeds and started using them, they were invented after he was gone.
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:34:39
Segwit, among other things, increased the max block size. And before one starts going into semantics; the number of transactions a block can fit increased.

Electrum is good. It's easy to use as a newbie, but also has a myriad of advanced features that makes it useful for a power user too. For example, it supports cold storage: offline signing wallet combined with online watch\-only; or multisig; or you can even use it with hardware wallets. The server code is open source too, so anyone can run a server; meaning that if you care enough, you can run your own and hence connect to your own full node. So, Electrum can be extremely safe, if you want it to be. The only "drawback" is that it only supports Bitcoin; I'm fine with that though :\)
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:13:28
Forget about the market... who cares... Altcoins drain developer resources!!
Just look at e.g. the trezor or ledger subreddits. There is a post every day where people are asking about support for their shitcoin. There is only a limited number of developers, and when they work on tools that claim bitcoin4x\-gold\-super\-diamond, then they are not working on bitcoin features.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:03:35
Of course there are downsides. Segwit is among many things, a block size increase. Just as the picture in OP shows. The hdd in my node is filling up faster since it was activated. My monthly data use has been increasing.
I am glad it got activated, but segwit *is* a block size increase, and as such, it has the downsides of a block size increase.

I told you what the definition of a hard fork is. Clearly you have a different definition that you neglected to clarify.
First, it does not matter if there is no chain split after a fork. It's irrelevant. There was no chain split after segwit either, but it still was a fork. Don't say that that's because it was a soft fork; that's not the point; there could still have been a chain split (specifically Bitmain was claiming beforehand that they will create one, but then they ended up creating BCH instead).
Second, everyone would have followed the inflated branch if there was an inflating block during the one+ year while essentially the whole of the network validated with the "broken" rules. Clearly it was a fork of the rules (because the OLD nodes would NOT have followed!).


I see we are now down to kindergarten arguments.

@_date: 2018-10-17 00:27:48


lol. no it is not. both require significant changes for proper support. they are actually very much comparable.
~ bcash txns are signed the same way as segwit (bip143).
-- with bcash the difficulty calc changed.
++ with segwit the txn structure changed.
-- with bcash there is a new address format (further UI difficulty that scriptPubKey -&gt; address is not even a function anymore)
++ with segwit there is a new address format
-- with bcash, there is a whole separate network of nodes and chain to keep track of
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:22:19


Do explain. The block subsidy halves. The hash power has been almost continuously increasing since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:22:03


This is unlikely to work. Maybe you should try your own advice...
Electrum seeds are [versioned]( using the first few half-bytes of the hmac512() of the seed. There is a 1/256 chance of getting a valid "standard" seed with your method; also 1/256 for a "segwit" seed; and 1/4096 for a "2fa" seed.
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:04:38


I wish that was the biggest obstacle for anonymity... You can broadcast transactions over Tor already. Dandelion is coming too.
The value of transaction outputs being public, and chain analysis in general, is a much bigger issue.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:44:14
Ok, yes, those work. Electrum accepts them as "old" type seeds. It's because both words are in the [old word list]( and those seeds are not valid according to the new rules. "least" is [not even in the current word list](
Try "abandon ability able about above absent absorb abstract absurd abuse access accident" which are the first 12 words from the new word list; it won't work.

You will need to create a new wallet (with new seed words) that has segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:24:44
- Create a HD wallet in e.g. Electrum using a secure/trusted machine. (Consider creating a multi signature wallet)
- Backup the seed well.
- Setup a watch-only version of the wallet on a laptop/tablet that will be placed in your store.
You generate new addresses for each customer in the watch-only wallet, and display the QR code for them to scan.
If you are using this for larger purchases, consider setting up your own Electrum server and pointing the customer-facing wallet (that you use to check if funds have arrived/have confirmations) to that.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:29:39
But I just want to pay for my latte with zero fees, and have the transaction replicated across thousands of nodes and stored until the end of time!!

@_date: 2019-08-28 12:36:31
The article says it's real gold, only the markings that would identify where it came from are faked.
Who cares about the markings if it's real gold? I guess gold is not fungible then... 1 kg gold != 1 kg gold
As such, this problem also affects Bitcoin. While you cannot fake the on chain history of a UTXO, you can try to obfuscate it via e.g. coinjoins, and at the end of the day, in the eyes of KYC-crazed governments and bankers, 1 bitcoin != 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:12:46
Oh no! You just broke the system. How come no one thought of this before?
The block hash is the hash of the block header. The header contains a bunch of stuff. Version, timestamp, nonce, previous block hash, merkle root of included transactions, and also a field for the current target (related to difficulty). The header indirectly commits to the transactions in the block through the merkle root.
It is expensive to fork the chain and mine blocks because you need to bruteforce the nonce (and some other stuff) such that the block hash is below the target. It's irrelevant whether there are any transactions in the block.

@_date: 2018-11-05 03:26:12
If onchain fees start rising, the initiator of the channel can send an "update fee" message to create a new commitment transaction. If the initiator does not do this or if they do it but the counterparty does not sign the new ctx, the only thing to do is close the channel. If you don't close, you risk not being able to get your funds back, as on chain fees might never go back to the previous levels. AFAIK all implementations force close when fees rise too much if they failed to negotiate a new commitment txn with higher fees.

Ethereum is a centralised shitcoin where this was possible to do. In Bitcoin there would be no rollback as no one would have authority to say so, which is the whole point.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:00:34
Yes, Satoshi did that in 2010. Satoshi is gone.
But really it depends on the type of issue. If there is no bug, just ordinary doublespend, there would be no rollback for sure.

Yes, it's not privacy friendly. BIP37 is not private at all either. That's long been debunked. BIP157/158 on the other hand would be private; but still slower than Electrum.

There are different mechanisms.
With Trezor One, you type it on the host machine.
With Trezor T, you can choose to type it on host machine or device.
With Ledger Nano S, you type it on device once, and attach it to a PIN; so the device persists it.
With KeepKey, you type it on host machine.
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:32:06
You misunderstand. Electrum is doing SPV. Simple Payment Validation just means verifying that transactions you receive were mined using merkle branches, and tracking the chain of block headers for the most work chain.

Oh wow. Didn't know. After all, this is only like the 5th post saying it so far.

Ok. That you haven't said before. However you could have included that bit in any/all of the other posts. Instead, you wait until the previous ones leave the hot page, and then instantly post again. This is desperate PR. It's getting annoying that every day there is a new post about breadwallet, essentially about the same thing. You have implemented full segwit after 15 months, congrats.
In more seriousness, is there any other wallet that can recover all UTXOs from that seed? Let me guess, there isn't! Mixing output script types is horrible for long term compatibility. People are bound to lose coins. If you are here anyway, at least detail what derivation paths are used along with what script type there.

That is true, assuming their absolute hashpower stays the same. The difficulty goes down because the total hashpower decreases, so then that means he has a larger percentage of the hashpower, and so a larger expected chunk of the block rewards.

Sure... but you could have used 2-of-3.
Well I guess you save some block space with 2-of-2; about 33 bytes per tx (discounted to 25% of that but nodes need to store 33 bytes none-the-less).
Anyway, your exchange looks good, so good luck! :) I hope you succeed because the model is better than most current alternatives.

Miners don't "need" full nodes any more than any rational participant. For example, it's trivial to SPV mine empty blocks. But it is also dangerous assuming many others are running full nodes, see July 2015 splits.

Like BitMEX who uses 3 of 4 legacy p2sh multisig with uncompressed pubkeys and no batching at all, 1 tx / user withdrawal? Lmao. What is that, like 40x less efficient than batching p2wpkh? :D
They are not even publicly shamed as - I would guess - people still think "3.." address means segwit so why change? After all, they only use like 3% (!!) of the available blockweight.
I mean really, who uses multisig with uncompressed keys?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:09:07
Yes you do. Well, depends on the market. But junior software engineers are mostly hired based on potential.
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:36:37
Yes it works differently. So? It has the same security properties. And it's faster. And both conform to the definition of SPV, which is what I originally replied to.

Does it connect to a centralised Insight Block explorer and trust that server?
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:33:32
I know that the host machine is untrusted, I just answered your question. :)
Again, on the Trezor T, you can choose between both options.
I have no idea how the Ledger works internally. I would guess it probably persists the root xprv (or something practically equivalent; e.g. bip32 seed) in the secure element in plaintext.
EDIT: actually, it would probably make more sense if it was encrypted with KDF(pin)

10**8 satoshi = 100 million sat = 1 BTC

So it's 1-of-2 multisig, where one key is held by the seller and one is by the exchange... ? How is that escrow? How is this "safe trading" for the buyer?
How is this safe for the seller, even? The exchange can "exit scam" with the funds locked up in on-going trades. Sure, it probably would not be worth it for the exchange; "custodial" exchanges can make lot larger exit scams.

Well last I checked was ~2 months ago in Ledger Live. The transaction it sent did not opt in to RBF. So it was not only that the app did not have GUI options to do the replacement, but you couldn't even replace that tx using other apps.
I think the Chrome app did opt-in to RBF for some time but they reverted the change claiming users were complaining that some merchants did not accept the unconfirmed transactions (can't find a reference now though).
