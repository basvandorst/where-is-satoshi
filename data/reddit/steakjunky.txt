@_date: 2015-01-19 02:15:09
Fucking hell! Stop asking and trying to convince us. You clearly already made up your mind and aren't interested in advice at all. 
Please send them your money. Really, go do it. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:32:22
Why don't you post news about electricity? It's needed for mining. Or air. It's needed to cool the miners. Or the newest math findings. Or keyboards. Those are needed to get stuff done on your computer. Which you need if you want to use coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:06:56
Can you show us where he predicted the Bitstamp hack please. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:50:55
Please explain to me why the elections in Greece will be interesting for Bitcoin. I fail to see any connection whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:52:28
Why would anybody there move to a pretty much unusable currency that lost 80% of its value in a year?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:23:09
Someone explain me why this is on top of the mainpage. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:52:39
I don't think there is a battle. There are just a lot of bat shit crazy cultists here and they like to make fun of them. Can't blame them. As a Bitcoiner i hope my friends and familiy never find out about this sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:54:59
Yeah, let's cut off 99.9% of your potential customers. Sounds like a great way to run your business. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:33:12
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:34:07
Look, i'm not even gonna explain why the world won't turn to an escrow system. Use some common sense man. Get out of Bitcoin fantasy land for a minute and your brain. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:28:06
Nah, not really. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:49:15
What risk is low? You're not talking about investing in Bitcoin i hope. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:31:09
Every day 20 people post non Bitcoin related stuff because they think it's relevant. 
I (and the rules) don't care what you think is relevant. I come here for Bitcoin news. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:29:17
Thanks for the cringe. 
Bitcoiners spamming pennies and claiming how it will be worth 100's in a few years. My god...
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:25:42
If you can't see the difference between the 2 then you must have an extremely low IQ. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:54:49
If Bitcoin wpuld do so well tons of people would be interested and buy coins. Which isn't happening. 
Your logic doesn't make any sense. 
Imagine a product. Windows 7 for instance. And nobody would use it and Microsoft can hardly sell any copies would you say they're doing awesome, they just need to find buyers? 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:34:11
Yes, that should be no problem. Maybe by then you can afford an i7 :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:33:55
Haha exactly. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:16:59
I can't find any mention of Bitcoin in the article. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:53:46
They are oblivious by not moving to Bitcoin? What?
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:39:12
The Bitcoiners cult logic. 
The world should turn to a system where everything goes through escrow to prevent getting scammed. 
While the current system simply allows instant payments which you can charge back in case of fraud. 
Let's take something that works and turn it into a slow outdated system just for the sake of cult. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:47:10
Yeah it's crazy when you think about. They will only buy when it gets more expensive. 
This is also the reason why nobody suddenly is buying when the price is down. Something a lot of people seem to think. 
It's a sign of weakness. Something that goes down doesn't look healthy and people don't want to be part of it. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:28:14
No. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:50:01
So you people want to use Bitcoin for every day stuff. That means everything you buy online will need escrow to avoid being scammed. You people are hilarious. Completely out of touch with reality. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:48:59
You have to be close to insane if you think that 1: the whole world wide fiat system will collapse and 2: the whole world will move to Bitcoin. 
Actually now i think of it you'd have to be fully insane. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:29:22
It looks the same as the last 12 months. Downwards.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:13:58
Yes, you are right. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:02:30
Just don't take anyone's advice in this thread and send them your money. It's the only way kids like you will learn. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:21:17
Because it lost 80% in the last year. But of course in Bitcoin fantasy land that would be no obstacle. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:32:41
Because they won't look at what it did 2 years ago but what it does now now and the previous year. I can't believe i'm explaining this to you. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:11:38
Posts like this make you look desperate. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:59:53
No. That's why you wait and save 150 bucks or so to buy an i5. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:58:18
In that case you will be the one getting scammed. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:27:49
Yes. OP's 1.5 coins will be worth 100k. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:11:01
Oh, in that case he's innocent then. Case closed. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:35:58
No i don't. I prefer to get my product without an escrow system. Just like the rest of the world. And if i don't get it i'll chargeback. 
You should get out of this sub once and talk to people outside this cult. It'll be a whole new world full of surprises. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:30:19
Oh give me a break. Just type in mining and you'll get TONS of results from yesterday to a year ago all saying the same thing. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:04:14
A bot? You are one of the people i mentioned above. Insane. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:44:20
Actually the math can be perfect without Bitcoin going up 1 cent anymore. I sure don't hope so but your logic is false. 
It's possible we only go down from here while there is nothing wrong with the math. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:35:35
Why are there always posts like this on top of the mainpage how some currency lost value but never how Bitcoin lost 80% of its value?
Maybe we should focus more on the problems Bitcoin has instead of circle jerking over bad news about other currencies. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:25:05
Yes. To another trader. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:33:50
I wish some money would be spent on the Bitcoin protocol and client to make everything more simple and user friendly. That's what is needed most instead of company x getting millions. 
And sadly that's the one part of the Bitcoin industry where almost nothing happens. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:05:34
The rich don't care about Bitcoin. They either already sold their coins or are playing the exchanges. 
It's the broke kids with half a coin who do everything to pump the price. And actually the majority of them also don't care about Bitcoin. They just want....to get rich. 
Yes just keep downvoting it till it goes away. Screw reality! We need more fantasy and faith!
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:29:24
Why don't you explain it in your own words?
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:14:14
Nice clickbait. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:25:38
An i3 for gaming? 5 year old games you mean?
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:07:05
Wait till you buy something with Bitcoin and you don't get your product at all. You'll then wish you paid with your cc instead. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:49:26
Right. Yeah sorry. My bad. Thanks for clearing it up. No idea how i didn't think of this. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:12:38
Damn, the replies are getting more and more crazy. 
And all this because "i love drugs so he is innocent". Any common sense is gone. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:10:51
Stop giving that fool so much attention. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:08:23
I think the 150 articles about this a week ago have been enough already. 
I've seen your username before and it's always in combination with old news. Maybe it's time to change whatever you are doing. Or am i talking to a bot?
Edit: look at the date of the article man. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:56:07
This thread has been done 20 times already. We got it. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:24:23
Calm down kiddo. I'm still waiting for your explanation. Do you have any?
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:38:25
And it all means nothing untill people are gonna start buying. Which isn't happening. 
Yes, obviously my post is so absolutely totally horrible that i must be downvoted 15 times. This place is insane. It makes the scientology church look normal. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:51:57
I'll take the 3% fees instead. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:36:49
And soon it will be removed because of people spamming cents all over the place. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:50:37
You are insane if you think that's how real life works. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:52:35
It gets pretty much ignored and it's not done to talk about it here. Because yes it is a problem and there is no real solution for it. 
So we just pretend it doesn't exist. 
Now watch me get downvoted to oblivion because posts like this must dissapear quickly. It's inconvenient. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:18:22
I have a great idea. Let's stop giving that guy so much attention. Guess the reason why he posts bs? To get attention and more followers. With every new thread you start about him he achieves his goal. 
At least people are finding out the guy is full of shit finally. Earlier today and yesterday he came close to messiah status here. 
If a nobody predicts a downtrend he gets ridiculed but when a nobody predicts an uptrend it's like Jesus returned. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:00:40
Is someone losing 2k on what i assume is a betting site worth starting a thread about in all caps?
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:43:05
I have no idea about both companies. Why are they sueing them. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:48:22
Every single day between 1 and 5 people ask here what the price will do. Every single day. 
That so much people for some reason think that anybody here can look into the future truly is beyond me. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:51:56
Look, you can come up with tons of excuses. Simple fact is they will not move to a currency that lost 80% in the last year. Use some common sense man. It's not exactly rocket science. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:39:23
Yes. You are a conspiracy theorist. A dumb one, like most. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:59:38
No explanation. As expected. You people are so predictable. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:48:11
I'm sure the mods will feel generous with the remove button. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:21:55
That doesn't answer my question?
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:30:41
Just download the client again and replace the wallet.dat?
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:36:41
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:56:15
And if it hits 20 dollars in 3 years you will be wrong. 
If i win the lottery i will be rich. 
If if if. 
Look, i understand you are very young and have a lot to learn but just accept this friendly advise from me. Don't tip people based on what you THINK it might be worth 3 years from. You will piss people off. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:54:55
If you paid with Bitcoin how does this make sense? Give us more details. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:48:45
Because everyone who is critical Bitcoin is a troll. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:50:02
Are we supposed to translate this somehow?
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:55:24
Lose not loose. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:06:50
It's easier to make a list of things that are not a scam in the Bitcoin industry. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:35:42
Either you are a scam or you're gonna get scammed. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:56:29
Banks have better things to do. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:32:34
You really think that people are gonna use escrow for everything they buy online instead of simply using a cc?
I really like Bitcoin as well but at least i have some common sense. Stop being so delusional. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:48:26
Aaah right, that's the guy! Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:57:10
I heard Bitcoin cures aids as well. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:56:42
Please stop giving this guy so much attention. It's the one and only reason he posted that stuff. You're doing exactly what he wants. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:09:38
I bet you were a good customer at the Silk Road. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:46:51
Hilarious how you get downvoted for posting this.  
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:33:26
Wait, there are still people who are dealing with these crooks? No way. 
At this point i can safely say you deserve to be scammed if that's the case. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:56:07
We had no idea. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:23:32
I think you will lose your money. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:00:25
*Should have
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:19:17
I can't find any mention of Bitcoin in the article. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:47:12
You got downvoted. When asked your opinion about the price you're only allowed to answer if it's positive for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:41:13
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:01:10
Or to cut off exchanges or probably 10 other options before doing what the OP suggested. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:47:35
Good, i like to see arrogant little know it alls like you lose their money. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:59:21
I'm not your bro. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:36:17
You won't notice any difference whatsoever. I can guarantee you that. 
This kind of news always seems like something amazing, incredible, fireworks and moon but in reality nothing changes and not 1 extra Bitcoin will be sold because of it. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:33:37
When you write "stable" what exactly goes on in your head?
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:58:22
What's the weather like in fantasy land?
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:08:59
Great. At 14 you're smarter than me and i'm twice your age. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:21:28
Yeah, i'm such a troll. 
We all know Bitcoiners would never do such a thing as spamming pennies all over the place. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:16:27
Sure, kiddo. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:27:01
"With the number of transactions nearly doubling over the past year, it would seem that the number of users nearly doubled too, and will continue to."
Based on which fact again?
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:58:28
I always get confused with these crooks. What does he do again?
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:52:04
I don't see anything wrong with the article. Seems like he understands it just fine. 
Instead of just downvoting me out of Bitcoin rage why don't you man up and tell me where i'm wrong?
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:48:44
Hilarious how you edited the title just to make it appear relevant. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:03:07
How many fractions of a cent did they throw at ya?
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:58:24
Sure, that's the only reason. Because normally posts that are critical of this specific issue are never downvoted. 
The circle jerk, lies and delusions here are never ending. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:01:04
You're getting pathetic now. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:02:07
Between now and a 100 years. Maybe. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:45:58
What? How am i trolling?
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:26:54
Yeah i wasn't really talking to you. Just in general. You're making fun of him so that gets him less followers than threads praising him and his amazing predictions which i've seen before. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:37:40
I'm not a millionaire at the moment because i haven't won the lottery yet.
