But it's giving the false impression that their customers will be able to make money off mining after buying a GPU which surely is misleading. I'm not disputing the fact that they should advertise their GPUs, just that they shouldn't be advertising in this way.

Have you seen 
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:43:41
It says "Start mining with AMD" when that is not profitable in any way. So either they are advertising to people wanting to make a loss, or they are misleading people who think BTC mining will make them money.
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:28:27
Can someone explain what this actually means ?
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:16:54
Someone did, so I tweeted IKEA to see what they would say :)
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:55:50
Is  Ok? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:40:01
Well people wouldn't buy them thinking "Let's Bitcoin mine and give my hashing power to the network even though I'll lose money!" 
Seeing as people mine to MAKE money, this clearly is false advertising.

I apologise, on other subreddits it warns me if the link I am posting has already been posted. Hence I was not aware. Why are you getting so angry when people wont upvote this due to the other thread being there already? :(
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:19:12
Many streamers now take these
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:48:52
I did not know this had already been posted, no need for the insult or grouping me into a category of people who do such a thing.

Is BTC too slow ? Can that let it down in terms of altcoins overtaking it?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:37:05
I think I might move my funds to bitalo.com
Any other suggestions? more secure wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:27:55
Why are other cryptocurrencies rising so much? Is there space for multiple cryptocurrencies? (that are just clones of BTC, right?)
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:39:59
I'm sure theres a lot of much more expensive things in the museum !
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:37:42
Oh that makes sense. Thanks
So what happens when all the Bitcoins have been mined? What will verify the transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:59:14
Ok, so would the difficulty go down to compensate for not having a 25BTC reward anymore?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:29:16
Is it a good idea diversifying/buying other cryptocurrencies or will BTC rise way above them? (and force them down)
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:27:21
Will people use BTC as a currency or will the deflationary factor mean that people just hoard it?
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:16:54
Bitalo don't actually have access to your bitcoins, it is multisignature meaning if they want to take them them they need your private key aswell.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:00:10
What about faster transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:21:52
So is it part of the 25BTC reward or is that from bitcoins that have been mined (new bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:09:43
Why does he think LTC will rise so high? 0,o I don't quite understand it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:14:58
Where do transaction fees (sending from wallet to wallet) actually go to and how do they speed up transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:09:18
Is it that simple to make BTC transactions faster?
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:46:18
People on local bitcoins sell $100k worth of bitcoins? 0,o never seen that !
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:32:35
Well played.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:53:22
Dat is a nice tip 0,o 
@_date: 2013-11-02 09:52:46
How are you buying the bitcoins? If you buy them by doing a bank transfer won't the credditors wonder who you sent $20k to?
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:01:01
How would this happen. We have the power to change the rules of the blockchain ?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:20:28
I'm going! been looking forward to it for a while now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:35:32
How do you which one will have the Cash 2 Coin service? Can you ask them if you use Zip Zap now ?
