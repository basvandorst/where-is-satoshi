You arrived to that assumption on your own, Alex statements is clearly true that the government (EPA) did approve the use of pesticides that turns the frogs "gay". He is simply contesting having these type of chemicals in our drinking water! Wouldn't you agree? 


Point out exactly where Alex said that the government is using chemicals to turn ordinary people to homosexuals. Your statement is incorrect. 
As far as frogs go then yes the premise is true and that is not the subject of debate. These companies would not be using these chemicals if the EPA didn't approve it.
Now just because these chemicals can chemically castrate male frogs doesn't mean that it will do the same to humans, if anything you are the one who made that false correlation and not Alex Jones, he is simply implying that this type of toxic chemicals being used as herbicides which can chemically obliterate the endocrine system of male frogs should not be dumped in our rivers and drinking water because it can be harmful to us humans. If you have been following the news lately you would notice that there is a multi million dollar lawsuit against Monsanto the agricultural giant for using chemicals in their products that causes cancer (not the same chemical turning the frogs gay, but simply to demonstrate how dangerous these substances can be) 
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:55:30


You are a bit slow dear, do you really want proof for their "intent"? There are 3 facts from the article that can't be disputed A. One of the world's most widely used pesticides Atrazine chemically castrates male frogs (link below) B. The effects of these pesticides are very well know and documented, regardless authorities are doing nothing about it C. The idea of turning enemy combatants to homosexuals to reduce their fighting ability has been studied extensively - pssst possibly tested like Agent Orange on enemy combatants or our soldiers- resulting in Wright Laboratory winnig the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize for "instigating research &amp; development on a chemical weapon — the so-called 'gay bomb' / 'poof bomb' — that will make enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other."
After reading all of the above does hearing the claim that Alex Jones made "I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the freakin' frogs gay"  sound so bizarre and unreasonable? 


Don't assume dumbass go read what he said, we don't need them putting chemicals in the water that turn the "freakin frogs gay" are you a freakin' frog? 


It is not "A chemical" as to imply it is there in nature, no it is a pesticide and a commonly used one. Go read the natural science article

OK so in order for crypto to succeed we have to share our profits with the bank because if they don't make money from it somehow crypto will never become mainstream.... I think you are missing the whole point of crypto here, if the bank has your crypto you simply do not own it and there is no reason for you to do so as your crypto is just as secure in a Ledger wallet as it is in a bank, so again why would a sane person put his money in a bank, it makes no sense

Fuck off and the climate change crap, please don't pretend to be an expert and regurgitate what CNN shoves down your throat to us. Yes there is a climate change as the climate has been changing on earth ever since the earth was created 4 billion years ago and there isn't anything you can do about that. Even the most hardcore scietest would tell you that correlating these changes in climate with human behavior is inaccurate as many of these changes would have happened anyways so having a bunch of corrupt politicians drive policy based on pure speculations is harmful to the economy and serves no one but them not to mention that the US is one of the cleanest countries on earth, so why not try to regulate China or India Co2 production first. Also, I laugh at how you idiots used to call it "global warming" which is inaccurate so you now call it "climate change" a process that has been going on even before humans inhabited the earth �� We should keep the climate clean as much as we can because it is common sense  but the Dems could not give a shit about it as they only care about enriching their pockets under the guise of "Climate Change" and creating their nanny state, so fuck off libtards.

Climate change? But not too long ago it was "global warming" now it is climate change? Of course the climate is changing as it has been for 4 billion years. Do you know how many ice ages the earth went through or do you expect the temperature to remain the same throughout the ages. And please don't copy/paste links, because I can do the same. No one denies that the climate changes but the question is to which extent do humans have control over this if any. There isn't a single scientist that can give you an answer due to multiple confounding factors affecting climate the majority of which humans can do nothing about so enough neo-liberal political pandering as if you are a professor in geology. Most liberals live in cities with piles of homeless turd in the streets yet claim that they care about the environment.

I choose to align myself with financial freedom, you go and enjoy your Slave Master . An awesome move by Peterson and others should do the same let the filthy banksters know that they can't stop people from putting food on the table just because they disagree with their opinion. Brb donating BTC to Peterson.

So you are saying if some private company decided to fire every employee who is liberal or voted for Obama that this will be perfectly legal? Are you an attorney or are you just talking out of your ass because you seem to be an expert on everything ��

No it has everything to do with censorship, just because you don't like what they say doesn't give you the right to censor them and Bitcoin is here to break censorship

Social credit system making its way through under the guise of "hate speech"

I never use drugs but I once received a letter from my credit card company telling me that they sell my data to 3rd party and they use it for marketing. I'm was not surprised at all when I read this

A private company can't discriminate against people based on their sex, gender, religious or political beliefs. Just because you don't like someone's opinion on things you don't  get to deny them service, otherwise utility companies can deny you service for example for being "racist, sexist, Hitler... Etc" this is an absolutely stupid argument you are making.

So if he is using the blockchain to receive payment does that make the blockchain right-wing? Patreon is a payment processing service and they should stick to that, not regulate what their users do with their lives. Soon AT&amp;T will ban people who use "hate speech" on their network and idiots like you will be cheering then... I bet you will love China's social credit system

I'm sorry you aren't smarter than a human being and you have no understanding of anything in life let alone the constitution. If you can't understand why it is illegal to cross over any country's borders without facing any consequences then there is no hope for you. Constitution is a foreign concept to you �� no not everyone coming to America has the right to a hearing or to see a judge to migrate here, this is unreasonable and stupid.
Calling for people to be censored is fascist, defending your country's borders isn't... that is why you have low IQ and me defending your right to make an ass out of your self proves I'm a 'Murica patriot. The only reason your type likes to silence people is because you are dumb and morally bankrupt. Bitcoin is here to end the tyranny of your puppet masters

You are a fascist lol. You call to deplatform people who you disagree with and have their right to speak taken away.  Private companies that are this big need to be broken down because private entities should not be allowed to censor political discourse and determine the outcome of elections.
Welcome to the Gulag, soon the your turn will come and you will be someone's slave because you are not smart enough to form your own thoughts and in a hierarchical fascist society you will form the bottom of the barrel.
Dumb people like censorship

Yeah sure we'll hire a million more judges just to look into this so every illegal who forces himself into here can have a pathway to citizenship. You know this is impossible and will never happen so while we try to figure this out  the criminal illegals can stay and vote for the criminal Democrats��.
Don't shit where you eat because bottom feeders who like to defend lawlessness and handing over their liberties to private corporations will be the first to get crucified in the fascist socialist regime that you are espousing.
