Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.. plain and simple.

Isnt one of Bitcoin's goals to decentralize the banking system. Just a thought, would that not be enough motive for the government to try to stop bitcoin? Also, why would they need to ban computers?

Moving bitcoin still requires Blockchain, which is comprised of everyone’s computer currently mining. For anyone to send bitcoin, a miner will still be needed to authenticate the transaction.

Hodlers don’t always know when to cash out.

There is a small non-profit in my community. It’s called Newspring Art Studio. They focus on low income schools providing guidance, an after school activities, mentorship programs and much more. 
Their website: NewspringCenter.org
If you are interested in this kind of organization please let me know.

I understand that. Since Coinbase and other exchanges are separate entities, do they all have different their own evaluations?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:32:03
I agree with you. Bitcoin is behaving like a stock because people are investing in it as such. It’s suppose to be a currency and be used as one. I think we need more mainstream acceptance of bitcoin in the marketplace for it to stabilize.

Is that a fanny pack you got for your bike?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:04:03
Ahhhh got it! That’s what I wanted to know!

It’s not one to one. Feel free to withdraw your bitcoin for cash for a loss of 30% on the spot.

That may very well be. 
There is a large generational gap in the workforce today. Many people doubted crypto just a few years ago. Those who didn’t are in an advantageous position today. 
Crypto is a new era of technological revolution.

What if satoshi saw it as a currency but we are yet to find its true purpose?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:12:08
Very true!

I said ‘astronomical increase’
Yes bitcoin was increasing since summer but it more than doubled in November.
Talk about not understand simply economics of supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:50:55
I don’t think this is true. I am sure supply and demand plays a roll but don’t think it’s the answer.

What happens if the government outlaws mining? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:46:10
This is off topic but was I the only guy imagining some guy with a telegraph trying to communicate with the world every time they mention ‘telegraph’ in that article?

How would Bitcoin “[take] up 5%”?
Would it be the value of the asset mining bitcoin?

Damn quit countin

I understand that. But what I want to know is who is compiling and analyzing the data? Whoever or whatever that is can be taking into account other factors other then the history of the last purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:56:18
I understand that. But who or what is gathering this data and analyzing it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:57:28
If everyone paid their bills they would still be making money. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:58
So who is determining what people are paying? Blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:11:15
The difference is that visa is a giant corporation and money flows there. However, with bitcoin miners are the decentralized system that is Blockchain.

Its based on the flux of atoms entering the earths atmosphere at any given time (da/dt). The constant change in price of bitcoin is due to this phenomenon. This is why bitcoin headquarters is in Greenland, to monitor Auroras at all times.

Love to hear it!

When people go buy bitcoin they can buy it at Coinbase, Blockchain, etc. However, these are different companies selling the same bitcoin. What’s the overarching system that knows what each of these exchanges are selling at what price?
