Well, you don't have to answer. We just have to ask you in order to provide suitable advice for your situation.
Also, we don't ask that when you want to make a transfert like OP said. A simple disclaimer is ok. We ask that when we sell our own financial products or if you open and keep your wallet of funds in our bank. Sorry if I didn't make it clear

Haha. Risking your capital may be a bit more dangerous than a basic 0.75% savings account.
In fact, lots of banks nowadays are proposing people to invest small amounts on the market. But you have to be very clear on what are the risks. You have to collect precise information about the customer's situation... Job, income, patrimony... If you can't prove you did it + provided appropriate advice, and people are losing money... You are faulty. And I think it's a good thing.

I have hard time to understand your point. Not a native speaker. But I'll try to give an answer :
If you ask us to do a transfer to your grandmother or whatever, we just do it. We just have to know the name of the owner of the receiving account for security reasons. (Fight against terrorism, fraud, money laundering...)
If you ask us to transfer money to a speculative website/wallet that we don't manage, we give you a disclaimer. And then do it.
If you want to open and keep a speculative account in our bank, we ask for more details about your situation before doing it, see my other answers in this thread.
It's just logical customer's protection that is stated by the law. 
I personally don't care what you do with your money. I would myself have invested in Bitcoin if I knew. I also invest in speculative funds. I just do it with the money I can afford to lose. And people must be aware of that.

Hey, french bank worker here. We can be sued if we don't provide advices on risky transactions. It's ok if he asks you to fill a disclaimer but then he has no right to keep you from doing the transaction.

Most of the things are covered to at least 70%. Dental prothesis and glasses beings way way less though. Source : I'm french.

Social cotisations applies from the first to the last euros of your market gains since... ~8 years. And it's not just CSG (witch is only 6.1% of a total 17.2%).

Edit : my mistake : it's coming in "plus value sur biens meubles" and not in "plus value sur valeurs mobilières".
