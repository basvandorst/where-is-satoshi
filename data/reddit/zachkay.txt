1. Create an account on coinbase. 
2. Buy your crypto
3. When you’re ready to transfer to your wallet, use your login info for coinbase but enter it on gdax.com (they’re the same company so same login info)
4. Click deposit, select coinbase account, move your coins from coinbase to gdax.
5. Select withdraw, withdraw into your wallet.
(Steps 3-5 save you from paying any transaction fee for moving your coins into your wallet)

Hey no worries this sub is all about sharing knowledge. When your crypto is stored on an exchange, you don’t have access to the private key, which is a code that grants you control over your funds. The exchange has them, and merely allows you to move your funds, but if the exchange gets hacked or goes down, you’re out of luck. Moving your funds to a wallet where you have the private key means that you are in control. As long as you keep that key safe, nobody can steal your funds, and even if your computer or hardware wallet breaks, you can restore your wallet and recover your funds using that private key

I did exactly what you mentioned - transferred a bit of my BTC from my ledger to coinbase, sold it for USD, then transferred to my bank. I started the process Wednesday evening, and today mid-evening found out that the transaction cleared into my bank account. So yes, it is exactly that simple. Good move getting a Ledger, I absolutely love mine.

It’s still a very technical process to buy and safety store bitcoin. Also, there is currently a very big issue in terms of scalability and as a consequence, transaction fees are high.
When these big issues are dealt with, when bitcoin is as easy to buy as an iPhone case, and once again costs less to send money than visa, that will be the real explosion. That will be when crypto goes truly mainstream. And that will be when the price skyrockets.

Think about your bank account. Let’s say you have $1000 in there. You don’t actually have $1000 physical bills. The bank does. Now you can  go to the bank and swap the money that they credit you for physical bills, but until then they are just data and representative of your wealth.
Bitcoin is the same, I️ can cash out or hold on to my representative wealth.
The key difference is who controls that data. With a bank, they have centralized servers. That is a single point of attack. If malicious actors breach their security you could lose your funds. Now most banks are insured but if there was ever a catastrophic data breach the bank would be physically unable to pay you your own money.
With block chains, their is no single point of attack. In order to truly “steal” bitcoins (not conning people out of them) you would need to build a computer capable of producing over 50% of the total hashing power, the cost of which would be astronomical to the point of being unfeasible. This is what makes bitcoin secure

If you have more than $70 invested you should honestly get a hardware wallet (ledger nano s is ~$72) control your private keys!

It’s all the same garbage. You pay for someone else to buy mining equipment, then they promise to pay you back over time with absolutely no accountability or recourse if they suddenly go offline. Just build your own rig if you really want to mine. The most profitable solution by far is to just buy a coin and hold onto it. If you dropped 3 grand on building an ether mining rig with sapphire 8gb graphics cards back in April you MAY have made about a grand by now and still be 2000 in the red. If you just bought 3 grand of ether you’d be up to 7000.

Took about 12 hours for me to transfer a decent size transaction from gdax to my ledger. Was definitely a stressful time but eventually it made its way through

different people are buying and selling on the two different exchanges, resulting in two different prices. The price of one exchange is only dependent on the market makers and takers on that particular site, and not the other exchanges.
However...arbitrage traders utilize these discrepancies to profit, which has the secondary effect of bringing the prices on each exchange closer to each other. That is why you will see flash spikes and crashes on one site and not the other, but longer term price trends are reflected across all exchanges.

I keep the bulk of my crypto on my ledger. I have a hundred bucks or so in bitcoin and litecoin on a Jaxx wallet on my iphone. Just so if I ever run into an opportunity to buy a beer or something with crypto I can seize the moment. But no, I get my coins off of coinbase as soon as i possibly can. I don't want to be prevented from controlling my own money because some big company's website is down. That defeats the whole point of crypto in my opinion.

One of the best advantages of investing in crypto is that with most coins you don't have to buy a "full coin". Right now you could get about .03 BTC for your $300. If the price jumps up another grand you'll make a decent 30 bucks profit. Welcome to the party

But ledger nanos are designed so you control the private key. The company itself can’t touch your funds and even if they were to go bankrupt or disappear you could still easily recover all of your funds. There is no central point of failure and you are not sacrificing any degree of security for convenience. I don’t think owning a ledger makes crypto any more centralized. Also, there are competitors like Trezor and paper wallets so it isn’t even the only option people have.

The fact that no government or company on Earth has the ability to print it out of thin air. It cannot be depreciated (somewhat debatable considering forks but if BCH is any indication I’m certainly not worried)
 Also 15 exahashes/second of computing power.
That’s 15,000,000,000,000,000 hashing functions completed every second to secure bitcoin’s blockchain.

As long as you have the private key you can recover your lost funds
