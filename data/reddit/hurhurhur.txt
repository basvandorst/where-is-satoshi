How is the auto invest option working out for people? Seems like a good way to spread the risk?
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:44:00
Because they're making up stupid shit.

You mean only examples you can use to justify your assumption. And not the tons of examples where a technology simply failed. Am i correct?
Bitcoin is just like aaaaall the technologies that took years to get big and absolutely nothing like the technologies that never got off ground.

Sorry, 1 more question. I just browsed around and noticed the auto invest lets you choose several options. What's the point of investing in someone who pays back after 6 months if you can also choose 1 month? 
Thanks.

Ok, well i disagree with you. 
Downvoted because this is not allowed? Seriously? Who the fuck are the people doing this? What kind of lives do you have?

Yes WU is completely dead. Bitcoin completely took over their business. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:46:40
I thought this place absolutely hated bankers and banks. 
How odd. I must be mistaken. 
Huh? All these downvotes because??
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:33:04
Nice! Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:40:59
Yeah so? What the hell does that have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:45:23
Nope sorry. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:35:35
Off topic. And your title is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:14:00
Bitcoin isn't a ponzi. Many rabid users make it seem like one though. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:56:21
Thanks, that really helped me!
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:52:31
Why don't you call them to discuss it? Or should someone else do that?
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:50:12
Just like the early internet!
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:04:25
Can you just answer my question?
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:51:30
So when are you gonna set this up? Or are you just an ideas guy?
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:03:48
Hilarious. This is probably a 25 year old guy who saw a kid with the same story last week got quite a few donations. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:08:18
6 years in = early adopters??
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:33:46
So do we hate bankers or not? I'm trying go keep up. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:12:28
Uhm wow. That's kinda sad really.
