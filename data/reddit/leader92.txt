I think I had a fair understanding after reading all your comments, the video helped as well. Thank you all. Long live Bitcoin.

Taking risk doesn't always pay off, but when it does. Oh boy...
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:39:27
can you please give me the store's name? or location
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:19:13
You make it sound like what we discuss here is going to be breaking news.
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:07:55
enlighten me, please.
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:56:43
That is the one, Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:27:09
exactly right, they give you a phone number to call and keep the line on till you ran out of the credit you requested or another way is to send an SMS. either way I want to know the fees for such method of purchase
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:21:29
not so much into coding but you seem to have a point. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:59:39
I didn't say it doesn't have any, I said they don't have much. People were commenting "Oil money" but the actual oil money comes from country where it exports 80% of total oil market, which comes  at around US$215 billion.

You'll get greedy. Basic human instinct.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:45:42
what do you think of my choices? do you think IOTA or ADA are scams?
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:15:36
I've always had the impression that SA is following US's step, not the other way around.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:55:44
Agreed, but I was just taking in terms of today's economy. You're very bullish. Love it.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:44:43
thanks for stating the obvious.
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:14:34
Is it really a mistake? IOTA is hooking up with BMW. Cardano is a great project. BNB has gone through ATH while I was holding it. What mistake are you talking about! ALT season is real

I own a ledger and happy with it, only problem is that all my coins are owned by one private key but they are on scattered wallets ( All ERC20 on MEW, some on the ledger live itself, other coins have their own native wallet integrated with ledger) But with **Trezor, most of them can be found on Exodus.**

Roger is the one to blame for these kinds of accidents. Marketing BCH so much then put it in front of Bitcoin.com

btw, in respose to the FinCEN thing, I reside in the middle east, the only regiestering I'll have to do here is through the central bank of Bahrain which can be done online. I'm less worried about the legal aspect and more worried about the bitcoin re-purchasing issue. the bank is no good for me after what I leant from you;
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:59:17
if by "region" you mean the Gulf countries, then Yes in UAE and Bahrain, but not in SA.

I'll wire that cash to an exchange I know that charges a 1.5%. please go on, I'd like to learn more

install a BTCATM machine in your community and stand by it with a yellow Bitcoiny shirt on and raise awareness.
@_date: 2019-08-28 08:59:03
slavery was never abolished, it exists in other forms.
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:52:55
Thanks for taking the time to write such valuable tips. Would you have another way to use the cash I made from the machine to buy more coins? other than the bank?
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:48:13
Thank you guys, You've been helpful, 5% doesn't cover my costs,  I'll be calculating to find the grey area where it's not too low nor greedy. I got the location + ATM type and cost + legal aspects covered. I'll just work on the rate and see what I can do.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:44:16
around 500, not much but still speak for a mindset.
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:16:03
Why are you guys looking at it as a mistake. IOTA and ADA are great projects. BNB is going through 30s for the first time ever.
@_date: 2019-10-13 13:27:44
You're nice.
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:30:54
What if the landlord or the one who's paying the bills notices that he's paying double or triple the usual bill? anyone who wants free money has to steal. In your case, it's electricity.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:04:18
I've read a similar article for someone who got hacked through AT&amp;A sim card spoofing. Hackers managed to milk 100k out of his Coinbase account, guess the title of his frustrated post on Medium? Yeah, you guessed it and said it "I wish I had a cold wallet".

Can you name a few old school coins?

lying to maintain personal and beloved one's safety is a pretty common human behavior.

Couldn't agree more with the contribution that Bitcoin was blessed with. I'm especially fascinated by the story of Nick's Bitgold back in the 90s. Although similar to bitcoin, it wasn't successful. The 08' crisis was an excellent entry point for Satoshi, the guy had marketing skills as well. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:15:23
Would you recommended it if someone invested in BTC and came out with huge gains?
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:13:21
This is a Bahraini Exchange, bahrain doesn't have much oil reserves. The big Mama of middle east (Saudi Arabia) is still warning its citizens from trading Crypto. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago they changed their tone to a more extreme one with explicit warning to a shitty coin called CryptoRiyal which used the Saud's flag as a logo.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:49:34
if 1 BTC is worth 1 million, a Satoshi would be 1 cent. So, if this was an under-prediction and 1 BTC became for example worth 100 million, a Satoshi would be worth a dollar, right? It would sound cool to rarely have 1 BTC mentioned and all people are trading in term of Satoshis. a rich person may be called a Bitcoinaer in the future.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:01:05
Alright, I'll try to sort the bank issue out, my single most important question, is this business profitable? I'm not talking about getting rich, but would it be reliable as a secondary income?
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:47:59
If you watched the interview when he said that, he basically freaked out in denial when he was asked " So, Tesla is adapting BTC"? " No,No,No,etc"
@_date: 2019-10-13 01:36:08
Would love a YouTube tutorial on how to do it!
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:48:56
mining rigs are loud and they require cooling. Fire accidents are not uncommon. Imagine causing one in the server room, you will be sued out of existence. I'm just saying think this through.

The authors' use-cases included medical applications like implanting a patient's medical record into his body, I just had to include crypto-related ideas to the post :). Besides, the concept is really revolutionary.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:54:16
Honest miners living in a country that has a notorious reputation for oppression. Think about it: They banned cryptocurrencies, launched their own coin, then welcomed all miners back. Their plan is obvious.

Dismantle that boy to IOTA, XRP, BNB, and ADA.  Investment 101: diversify.

My standard is that money isn't everything. my previous job was an overpay. To get a position where I get paid enough for something I love is a win-win.

HSBC, one of the world's biggest banks was and still is the "go to" service for Mexican cartels, helping them launder millions of drug money and they have the audacity to play that card against Big B.

I Agree, It sounds weird to people who chase money. I was overpaid for my previous job and hated it. Now I am paid enough for something I love.
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:44:06

It is not.

WWIII\*. Hitler is long gone son.
Well, everyone speaks for himself, but I think most fell in love with the idea of decentralized money. Me personally, I've had my bank account frozen multiple times for complete legit transactions forcing me to spend hours on the phone with the bank to CONVINCE them on how to spend MY MONEY. What happened in Greece and Venezuela is another prime and live example to love Bitcoin even more, why not when it is frictionless and borderless, fast and private.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:21:11
please don't insult me, you could have just settled with your valuable input. Thanks.

This might be the best advice I have ever heard. I really apprecate your vision. It is true because I was a surgical resident when I quite. After 5 years I could have been a consultant with alot of money and so little effort. But I didn't like surgery. Besides my new online career, I'm thinking of doing my masters in public health. I could end up having an acadmic career instead of a clinical one. With my online career on the side. Thank you again. You did leave an impression.
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:53:26
Same here. What fascinates the most is that if you are deep into Crypto, You'll wake up one day to realize your life is never the same.
