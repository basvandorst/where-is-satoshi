does this apply to me selling my coins on coinbase?
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:36:03
I guess I am lucky.

@_date: 2015-06-28 07:26:47
I hope you're being sarcastic.
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:43:47
But because of articles like this, people in Greece WILL know what bitcoin is.  something is brewing.
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:49:19
me too
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:17:25
I use bitcoin daily and that never ever happens to me. No need to be a dick and make assumptions.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:29:34
I am not. Thank you for responding though.
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:03:34
Thusly was a word created to mock the uneducated.

how do you know he doesnt own viacoin? are you two buddies?

Masternodes are honeypots. Worst solution ever.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:54:41
I would say yes its a good time to buy.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:36:17
He's invested deeply in another coin called viacoin. If bitcoin fails his coin benefits......
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:55:13
I didnt realize bitcoin had been around for 25 years.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:03:20
ha.you are so wrong. the coming months will show you that.

@_date: 2014-02-21 18:46:46
try contacting coinbase so they can right the wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:53:26
wow thanks for the bit.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:45:33
This is just for the current u.s. market not bitcoin. seems like shit is going to hit the fan.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:56:00
stop being lazy and just sign up for coinbase already.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:43:58
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:42:53
yeah. those words seem to say bitcoin is great and can change the world... brush up on your english.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:38:26
I think it will go lower than 400.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:02:35

@_date: 2014-02-12 22:43:45
because someday it will clearly be worth a lot of money because of its properties. This should not be hard to see.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:34:55
yeah I guess its really hard if you have no patience. But really its not hard to setup a coinbase account unless you are ultra lazy or dont have a bank account.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:52:04
This is true.

@_date: 2014-07-09 15:37:34
My friend I would avoid telling people what they believe. You have no idea what I believe or why I believe that. I do think coinbase is a fairly easy way to buy bitcoins and dont give a shit how it makes bitcoin look. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:16:11
no problem. Glad to help!
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:25:09

@_date: 2014-02-25 17:20:00

@_date: 2014-02-25 23:42:36
I agree with you completely man. Some oddballs are hitting the sub with this negative press.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:47:03
Hes being negative about bitcoin. Its obvious to anyone that gets bitcoin where the price will go.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:04:42
because it helps noobs get started.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:44:29
can they really climb out of bankruptcy in 2 weeks? me thinks not.
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:18:59
I believe just by people viewing it puts it in the hot list, whether they vote or not.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:50:43
Im implying anytime is a good time to buy bitcoin. unless bitcoin collapses the price will be absurd even a year from now. a few bitcoins can be enough cash for a small countries entire economy. put 2 and 2 together, its not rocket science.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:12:07
I'd say so.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:43:35
This makes me think a full on crash is ahead of us tonight.

@_date: 2014-02-20 21:44:39
ha... whatever you say man...
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:45:31
from what Ive noticed bitcoin will go to an all time high then halve for a while then repeat.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:26:40
no you're fucked or maybe I should say, you'll never be fucked.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:28:35

you are not a very smart individual. Your loss.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:49:05

@_date: 2014-02-12 17:28:27

clearly Someone bought karpeles. Hes now owned.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:07:27
Was it cryptographic in nature? was it decentralized? could people mine it? could a person use a wallet to store and send the money anywhere they wanted or did there need to be a third party involved?
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:58:10
Im also interested. I have seen some annoying shirts out there. I want a classy T
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:21:13
coinbase sure seems easy to me.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:19:09
doesnt seem very neat to me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:59:53
No way in hell transaction malleability is why 750,000 bitcoins are missing. I think that is a no brainer.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:09:59
excellent point. services like this are excellent for helping mass adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:58:58
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:53:30
yes a sane person!
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:34:14
nice speculation
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:14:53
The Fuck bro?
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:54:50

My bitcoin arrives instantly.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:15:37
its gonna tak longer than a half hour..... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:12:19
you can track the movement of coins from address to address. Find where a person entered the market and follow their money indefinitely.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:22:41
this is very very very very old news.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:03:48
This is what I have noticed also. I do hold dogecoin too.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:13:32
no Im still here. And I stand by all my statements to you. You'll eat your own words. You must be new to bitcoin... because price collapses have happen many many many many times. Bitcoin will recover and sooner than later.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:58:50
I think its a fair valuation.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:35:57
because they are obviously insolvent and when the news hits, their lives will most likely be in danger.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:22:10
you will get eaten alive for posting this. Its against the rules.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:42:19
because if you think bitcoin is dead you are thinking in the short term. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:53:35
My response was because u think this should be done with cash.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:34:58
from what I understand, fiat withdrawals have been blocked for months.
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:40:59
I never knew this feature existed. Just send your bitcoins to a new paper wallet you generate online.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:26:48
I get the point of the article. I'm just saying I don't think its all that hard to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:01:44
because of the network effect. but really its not a bad idea to buy both. Bitcoin will be king, litecoin may be queen
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:50:40
Ive heard when mining it causes problems to send mining payments to an exchange... even though coinbase isnt exactly an exchange. I would start sending them to a paper wallet or possibly the bitcoin qt.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:00:31
like wise
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:04:09
Ive signed this petition.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:42:44
yes I do know what you are talking about as the topic says bitcoins are ridiculously difficult to buy. I disagree with the statement. You seem a tad overly invested in the topic. Shill much?
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:22:16
I withdrew .10 about an hour ago, and didnt have any problems
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:30:41
What you consider to be so difficult I consider to be painless and easy. Yeah the initial sign up takes some time but once you are signed up instant purchasing of bitcoin is very simple. But hey keep ranting, I dont care.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:45:10
I call bullshit on your being bernie madoffs secretary.
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:02:59

Ive had it take a couple days before
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:33:27
sorry man, but I think its waaaaay more likely that something else would replace bitcoin rather than those 3 shit coins..... But its not gonna happen. Bitcoin will remain the gold bullion of digital currencies.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:40:04
If you think ripple stands a chance of overcoming bitcoin I wonder how deeply you understand the benefit of decentralized currencies. Ripple doesnt stand a chance.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:25:58
meh.. those three dont stand a chance
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:01:18
I wish I had some btc
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:21:12
What are these 3 that can transact 1000 transactions per second?
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:18:06
No Im not. You stated ripple as one of the three. I think youre dreaming
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:19:25
Although the bear market is hard to cope with I love bitcoin and believe!
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:37:45
I just don't think there will be just one crypto currency that is widely used. Namecoin because its just an amazing idea. Monero because anonymity will be worth much money eventually. Dogecoin because, meh why not?,  litecoin because it's very liquid compared to other alts.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:59:10
I love me some bits!
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:39:31

@_date: 2015-04-08 15:26:56
I believe this whole heartedly.
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:38:28
really? I tried to buy ripple and the only wallet available was on their web wallet, so I decided against investing. No downloadable wallet I could find.
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:40:47
