LND v0.6.1, unfortunately only log files are left (don't ask ;)


Unfortunately, I can not close it and even if my peer will close it, funds will remain in limbo, cf

Unfortunately not

Sorry, just another question: does it make a difference to the network in terms of routing etc if the 'abandoned' channel (i.e. the one I lost access to)  is still shown as active (e.g. in 1ml)?
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:15:46
Got it - what you are saying, not the channel database/channel state unfortunately.
Nevertheless, I will give a new shot. Not sure about investing in other hardware, USVs etc.
This is way to important and I want to contribute.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:20:05
Thanks again, was not aware of that.
So even with the ChannelID or the ChannelPoint (or anything else that has been logged) there is no way? I still got the log files. 
(If not, I gladly lost the Satoshis :)
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:47:41
Even when knee-deep in the red with alts, ask yourself: which coin will see faster and more growth? So realize losses and buy the one you think will appreciate more.
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:40:04
Bold move, congrats!
I think the most difficult part comes when it really hits 100k...for why would you be selling then, could as well continue its march. 
Furthermore, I wonder what the value of a US$ will be like then, i.e. if 1 US$ then will be like 0.XX today.
But again, it will be a fun ride. Hope you can refrain from developing a price-check-habit :)
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:44:43
Awesome, thank you!
If I mess up my node, would you help me close channels on your side?
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:37:16
Re Lightning: Does it make a difference to the lightning network if I have lost access to a channel that is still advertised as active on 1ml? E. g. in terms of failed routings?
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:43:10
to me, the more challenging question is: when to sell? For when you are going to sell, I guess it's safe to assume that you will end up regretting it, no matter the timing

Pls factor in changes in mobility (what would autonomous, demand responsive shuttles do to real estate prices in urban areas), changes in technology (telepresence), central bank socialism inducing price controls in urban real estate markets
on average, ie looking at urban and rural areas, real estate might not be overpriced... but then again, you are trapped between a rock and a hard space

So Bitfinex and Tether again under scrutiny for manufacturing the bullrun in 2017 (sigh, again?)
Plot twist: this time it is supposed to be due to one single whale (whatever that means)
Now think what would happen if lots of investors start rushing into bitcoin

@_date: 2019-08-30 11:52:14
Thanks for your elaborate answer
If you would allow me one addition learning one could get from reading your story: getting the timing of liquidity/investment horizon right. By that I mean that the draw down you suffered would not be a problem if your investment horizon would have been several years (or 'two halvenings'). Hope you did not have to realize your losses.
@_date: 2019-10-25 06:24:16
Thank you again, much appreciated!
So to conclude, the impact on btc supply can unfortunately not be inferred by looking at bakkt bot. And the open interest figure is equally not reported on the ice product specs/data site.
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:49:36
extremely bullish for let's say starting with 6 months after the halvening
but disappointment and a great buying opportunity around the halvening date due to inflated expectations
oops, my crystal ball just dropped
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:10:58
So you are saying that Bitcoin's price appreciation will be so strong that it will change people's propensity to safe?
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:08:25
You truly understand asymmetric return distributions! Best of luck, though I think you won't need it.

'I am not long bitcoin, I am short fiat'
Unknown banker
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:23:33
as the contracts are settled in btc, does that mean the btc are like in escrow during the time the contracts are tradeable, ie before the future expires?
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:06:59
It is not if, but when will this model break-down?
Perhaps the effect on price from the halvening will kick in much later than anticipated, leading to the narrative 'sf logic breaks down' (same like 'bakkt disappointed and failed' which of course is way to early to tell). Price could be ridiculously dropping then. 
It will be a good opportunity to dump fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:40:33
Sorry to hear that. Do you mind sharing your lessons learned regarding your trading behavior?
@_date: 2019-10-25 06:35:19
When you will wake up finding that
a) everyone got 10k directly in their bank account (for the same amount you had been working damn hard past months)
b) a one time tax on your property or bank holdings
c) private holding of gold prohibited
d) cash abolished for governmental emoney that changes in value according to what you are doing with it
you will perhaps reassess your opinion on btc and the fact that no one can mess around with it
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:20:16
Who should require you to have a license? It's decentralized.

two halvenings and six months
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:58:33
Thanks. 
As we are looking at a monthly contract, does that then imply that the sum of the volume between the first and the last trading day needs to be delivered at settlement/day after last trading day? 
(Assuming there would be on average 100 contracts traded per day for a period of 20 days that would require 2000 contracts or 2000 btc to be transfered at the day of settlement, equalling more than a days worth of mining at current block reward?)
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:10:07
if called PlanB, then yes
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:22:25
No 3: Will the decline in interest be faster then the decrease in supply? I doubt that. 
Thus I would assume that prices will stay in the ballpark we have seen and will not decrease significantly. This in turn could mean that when zooming out, the rising price narrative will stay intact. 
And this will continue to channel interest to btc (and beyond that, there are very good reasons to hodl btc in this monetary environment).
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:36:22
Spot on, nothing to add.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:21:20
I would argue that you are right and wrong at the same time:
Wrong: You assume a constant monetary environment in which the value of 1 USD stays constant. Yet the balance sheets of major central banks have nearly tripled from 7 trn USD to 22 trn   USD (2008-2019). This increase in debt requires ever more greater debts, inflation or defaults to be serviced. A debt deflation leading to defaults is politically not feasible. Thus balance sheets will continue to increase massively. However, the effect on the economy is waning. 
What do you think will happen to the price of btc if helicopter money, i. e. 10000 USD per person, will be handed out? In only one country? In several countries?
(Right: I also miss the good old times, when we were all super excited and everything felt so new and fresh. Guess it's part of becoming mainstream.)
@_date: 2019-10-21 06:34:47
yes, no problems
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:39:53
Just ask them what they think is a good way to save.
Cash? Bonds? Stocks? Real estate?
Prepare your answers to that in advance.

not going to paint the island, just leave it all natural
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:10:20
Basically no. 
It is stating that price/value can be inferred from sf with a high confidence, not that it is caused by it.
Did you try to get a quote for your poo? If yes, then perhaps you could try to model it.

So this illustrates (a) how little is needed to move the market (b) how significant the halvening could potentially be

I never understood this one. There is no guarantee for future results, but: your whole day is packed with routines where you expect past performance to be an indicator of future results.
Or do you check each chair before sitting down because it could break?!
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:17:14
It is perhaps more about how long it needs to stay 'low'... my take: if the scarcity drives price or hard money narrative breaks-down, then it is no longer a great deal... but there are no signs of it yet
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:07:33

What's the biggest threat to Bitcoin and what are the odds that this threat happens?
Efit: 2nd question: What do you think of PlanB's work in modeling Bitcoin price based on stock-to-flow?
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:46:01
In addition: think about position sizing, i.e. what proportion of your total investable money would you want to allocate to btc. Be clear on when do you need this money, i.e. the holding period.
Personally, I would keep all btc for at least two halvenings in order to even decide if I would sell.
(edit: spelling)
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:11:39
? If you buy BTC with USD, you are equally using a fractional reserve currency. Oh, and by the way, that's why we see inflated asset values everywhere.
