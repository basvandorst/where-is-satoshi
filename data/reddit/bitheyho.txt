The agreement was to hardfork to 2 mb and activate segwit. This was broken. Core destroyed bitcoin, even i am on the side of core, because they have better devs.
And of course unlimited is probably run by 15 teenagers. They behave like that, they talk like that, they code like that.
Thats even worser for core unable to be play the role of an adult.
War is destroying, not able to consens to a compromise. So sad, the idea destroyed by selfines. 
Why not  proposing to make a change. No winners just losers..
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:55:23
You are one of the banksters to destroy bitcoin. beautifull.
post some war posts too to be legimitate.
everyone knows what happened to ethereum on the split. they just recovered after one year.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:49:41
segwit is not breaking the compatibility with bitcoin since start so it is bitcoin. BU is not compatible. Fullstop.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:53:13
from a technical point of view you are right, but from economical you are wrong, because there are alot of transactions not finding into the block.
what is your point / arguments for / against bigger blocks to grow the ecosystem and making transactions almost for free to speed up the adoption of bitcoin. its still a niche, but it could have a monopol status.

What have worked for ages. Btc creditcard from xapo or many others
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:21:28
Charlie, you didnt get it.
the miners to want offchain scalling because they want the onchain fees.
there must a cut with miners thinking that way.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:44:00
the price will go to levels before the halfning. thats not the bottom we saw right now. 
the price will go back, if the forking dabate finished. no one is going to invest before that, because its too dangerous. 
we saw the forking debate in ethereum and a price drop in half. so half of 1300 would be 650
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:00:29
If miner dont make blocks on the compatible blockchain, they will switch to an altcoin or continue with the development given. 
second best idea ever.
best idea ever:
would be to make 2mb blocks and segwit with the whole miner. together we have now over 75%
doesnt sound like healthy compromise against the war and killing bitcoin at the end?
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:18:49
yeah make war. destroy it! cmon. thats a non brainer, just kill them all, its just a computer game, right? is it, stupid?
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:50:06
how do you see BIP 148? are you a supporter for it as part of the bitcoin community?

@_date: 2017-03-15 13:00:49
cant we have 2 mb blocks and segwit. 
i am sure everyone would be happy then.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:32:54
here is exactly explaining his strategy. he want to prevent any off-chain scalling solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:44:32
really great idea. its for sure good to stop saying really stupid things before looking at whats inside the proposal.
its the way satoshi did it
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:04:31
The point is to stay compatible with all old versions of bitcoin. In a case of HF there will be two incopatible blockchains. Thats splitting btc at the moment because of splitted community, who want to destroy btc. And they are winning. Its definitly a war situation.
Dont allow the split if you dont want to destroy btc, vitalik. Staying compatible with the original btc, everything else is an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:29:36
How can they use bitcoin name? Isnt there a tradename or copyright on bitcoin? 
If someone is forking an open source project they dont use the name of the project they forked.
It seems ethereum classic will have to change their name soon.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:18:44
Its peace, not endless war. Its killing everything. Hatred should never win, its just destroying, nothing else then losers.

Ignoring entries with shit, fuck, stupid.
Because thats imature. 
What will investors think, if they read some disgusting words and see that People using this words are having power to deside and are not sitting in the corner without having the power to rule over bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:38:05
they stated:  
Margin longs in BTC/USD and margin shorts in XXX/BTC will not receive BCH  
  
so in my humble opinion i was very surpriced, they were distributing bch to maring btc longs

Just dont touch this altcoin, even with a pole. This guys are going to ride a rollercoaster with you and afterwards your pockets are empty. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:25:36
core had since dec 2015 time to include wishes into this hard fork?  
  
**what are you talking about?**  
  
lies for the fools? core wants sidechain, offchain txs first, then bigger blocks.  
  
its ok, but that was not the consens, compromise. therefor the war continues, the first lose-lose situation was bcash the second will be bcore. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:15:38
Because scaling btc is an attack?  
  
Bitcoin is getting more and more centralised, because less and less people can afford a tx on blockchain. Its a bigger problem then when people cant afford to run a node, because of bigger blockchain IMO

If You need 6 etahash per second security you could you an mergemined altcoin.  
  
Otherwise use any altcoin for such little txs. Just a tip.

Do it like the 99% : Buy the greed, sell the fear, dream of your lamb0.
Oh, and after you bought the greed, post a moon pic to encourage others to buy the greed as well and reassure yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:23:39
the was a reorg of the blockchain and all txs are stopped at the moment. i guess 51% attack or smthng
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:17:58
It could be a risk doing that. So no thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:29:17
decentralisation means also that alot of people can make a tx on bitcoin. with $7 tx fess, bitcoin blockchain is more centralised then ever.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:47:24
bitconnect coin is more scam then bcash  
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:31:49
Its ok Roger told you that bitcoin cash is the next super thing, he told us also some days before crash that mt.gox is super secure.
but seriously, its not like cash, because its traceable. if you want a REAL bitcoin cash coin then go for bitcoin plus.

they are implementing a way to take community, nodes into voting system, so its not just the miners. 
there will be next implementations coming, since its possible to make parallel implementations. 
But seqwit is working on the testnet and is doing his work. i cant see why it will be not supported.
How did you come to make this question? Cant understand, besides you are scamming
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:31:24
its not compatible with previous versions. every hard fork creates an altcoin, it depends if community and ecosystem agree on calling it bitcoin or giving it a different name.  
actually blocksize and time should not be touched by any miner. just my 50cents. but if the network has to grow, there are plenty other possibilities.  
and if the blocks are really too small in some years, you can let it grow in 100kB steps, until it doubled over some more years.  
the main thing to understand is, that you dont want to have your coffee tx saved on the blockchain for another 100 years.

who is saying, that you should not talk about bcc?
the more people know about it, the more bitcoin, as original can be successfull. i also dont think there is a competition between bitcoin and forks, we compete against fiat
@_date: 2016-12-12 08:40:11
its the every day spam attack about making blocks bigger. nothing new here and i hope its getting deleted my the mods.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:05:36
f2pool will join after activation on litecoin. bw.com pool is supporting ltc segwit so it will jump on board too

@_date: 2017-04-13 14:55:47
and bitcoin is not a religion. its a tech that has to progress. A whitepaper is not a moral book, what is good and bad, what is allowed what not.
its time to UASF
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:24:06
the question is, how can we push bip148 harder without gregory maxwell?
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:31:59
They are Hard Forking. There will no compatibility anymore with to all Bitcoin Wallets. You could say it will be a different coin. A coin split. Therefor their version number are discontinuing the numbers which were started from Satoshi Nakamoto. 
There is just the question how much support this new coin will get and i promise you JihanWu will run at least 60% of total bitcoin hashrate on this new coin. 
Therefor the first solution was to change the algorithm, because one miner is controlling the majority of the hashrate. greedy bastards and they are mining empty and half empty blocks by using a bug, which will be fixed the new update on the original bitcoin client.
So happy downvoting now to all JihanWu trolls, which were not banned yet.
like 
[–]brassboy  
Fucking UASF commie scum
I mean, who loves bitcoin can complain seriously about the community voting for a proposal. Right. Altcoins supporter.
(we are underground movement, read the the threads up side down. downvotes first, upvotes you can easily skip. we are taking back the btc thread from the jihanWu clan stalling btc scaling for years now. it can still take along time, but at the end the good will win)
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:40:34
is there a bip to propose smaller blocks 
so we get more security
less centralisation
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:49:24
god, why so late?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:21:09
UASF support here:
* 
* run a node
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:42:34












seriously or ironical ? or brainwashed ? 
ltc running segwit, no effects for everyone, i agree, but for btc it would be nice. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:30:00
with viabtc, there will be 5% support more for segwit. its a starter, but we need 95% for segwit or BU or 8MB blocks.
most important is that there will be no chain split, because that will be the middle finger for Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:00:12
Can I support USD with running a node? Is it POW, then I would consider mining it too.
Guys hope much did you lose by hodling USD, be honest? I read someone got homeless, because he had all his money in USD. Freaky gambler....
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:39:56
dude they made the patent on the time when hashcoin produced their hardware. they were the 4nd miner producer worldwide, before any antminers were constructed. that was probably before you were born LOL
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:30:20
yeah, bitcoins blockchain is very popular for attacks all of kind of. 
but the blocksize limit is preventing from disfunctional or over bloated network.
dont worry.
if you pay 200 satoshi/byte  will pay something like 50 cents for your txs and its getting into the block in less then 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:05:58
will be viabtc the first pool funded by bitmain going segwit?
lets see who will follow...
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:27:30
this idea was used before. you cant patent what was invented and used before, by yourself.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:23:12
wait, i think i read on r/btc that it was cores fault. blockstream was causing this this problem. i am not sure, but there are even several entries on that.
i will give here a link to this. lets see how many upvotes it gets.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:37:19
hf at the moment would split the chains, because some people (roger ver, jihan wu) would love to destroy bitcoin and make profit out of it by hodling altcoins and double their coins with BU. they could also rise alot of power by that (what they would looove to have)
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:11:24
no miner will stay on the old chain. go to start and learn economics.

@_date: 2017-05-02 07:43:53

@_date: 2017-05-23 14:24:07
run a node
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:44:23
and i thought the miners are blocking segwit or BU and not the devs.
lets look at the numbers: 35% miners support segwit, 35% miners support BU. 8 % implementation of both.
So, i wish i would understand this bashing campaign on blockstream. 
but i guess no one is bashing the miners, because we are all mining ourselves and love the high fees.
so i would suggest, be stop blaming the developers until the miners are supporting scaling bitcoin with segwit or BU with +75%.
If there is +75% support for any scaling, then we can blame the devs for i dont know what.
Therefor i strongly support UASF, we can do it togethe!
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:08:33
not sure, but is sewit making less txs a second?
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:13:03
2nd layers on the blockchain. trustless offchain transactions. thats the next innovation to make small purchases possible.
its since 2013 in development.
we were dreaming from the beginn on to pay with btc, but were knowing its not possible, so the dev startet and its almost at the implemetion. The evolution can start soon (6-12 months) :-)
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:21:33
we will know more on 1. august.
