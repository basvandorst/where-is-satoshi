Does anyone else think this is tulip mania all over again? I'm sure its been said a thousand times, but how do you mainstream users react this rhetoric?

Well actually blockchain technology can fill this niche, while using existing currencies, or even commodities like gold.
One advantage of bitcoin is that, since it doesn't exist, it could never be raided or seized by a government. So that's one huge advantage. But as far as being a sort of "e-cash" for the internet, there's probably far better alternative coming down the pike.

What happens when the day comes that the guy you're trying to sell to doesn't want to pay more than what you payed?
Will prices just plateau forever? And what will people with bitcoins do with them, from that point on?

The original Model T sold for just 5 bitcoins. Back in those days a horse cost 18 litecoins and etherium was just a glimmer in nicola tesla's eye.

What will bitcoin users do with their coins once the price stops rising?

Thanks for the reply!


I thought this too, and it made me think bitcoin has a niche to fill -- until I learned that blockchain technology could accomplish this in any number of ways using existing currencies, or even gold backed currencies.
One thing bitcoin has over, say, a gold-backed currency blockchain, is that no government could raid it, since the "thing" doesn't actually exist in any tangible way. But from a perspective of using, what I think of as "e-cash", there's going to be much better alternatives as blockchain technology matures.

How old are people who subscribe to this stuff, generally?
Like, were any of you kids around in 2012? Remember ron paul and gold? This is like the exact same rhetoric, only the goalposts moved from a physical real world commodity (that's going to beat inflation and break the banks and rise to 10,000 an oz etc) to something that's not even made of atoms... wtf

Holy shit, that's a chilling comparison. I remember those days, when millionaires were coined simply from registering a domain name.
It actually made a certain amount of sense back then, because you couldn't simply "google" your way through the internet, and there weren't any aggregators like reddit.
What do you think the future of blockchain will be? I figure we'll all be using one to do financial transactions soon enough -- I'm just not convinced it'll be bitcoin.

I wonder how things would change if everybody knew everyone else's net worth.

As a *currency,* not an appreciating asset, it would be better to have a payment system that uses US dollars, or gold, or any major currency, because of the liquidity and stability of price.
Bitcoin may be better at increasing in value over time, and therefore you'd want to buy and hold them for this reason, but as a medium for exchanging goods and services, the existing currencies are definitely better.

Once it stops rising though, why would someone who isn't already a bitcoin holder buy bitcoins, if cash serves the same job just as well?
