Even if you imprison the whole BTC core developer it wouldn't be that bad. Bitcoin is open source so every one can write new code. So as long as programmers exists as long will bitcoin exists. I think I dont have to explain that you cant imprision all programmers who wants to improve bitcoin.

I don't think that a lot of people will be too rich of of nothing. A lot of them will sell her own Bitcoins quite earlier (20k, 50k or sth like that). Now Bitcoin is something about 7k USD. Where are the rich people who bought BTC in 2011? A lot of them sold already and there are just 21mio BTC so out of 7 billion people on earth it would be just a few percent who will be very rich. Bitcoin is such a new thing that it is hard to predict the future but I believe in it in a long run.

It supports "onchain" aswell. With all different types of addresses (Bech32, SegWit and the "standard old one"). It is noncostodial, custom fees for transactions, replace by fee is supported aswell. For me its a good mobile wallet

The stock to flow ratio gets better after each halvening.  So it is the best store of value that ever exists

I recommend to use a passphrase. It is like a 25th word, which you can choose by your own. The advantage is that you just need to remember this one word. If your recovery seed is stolen the thief won't get anything because he doesn't know your passphrase. So use a passphrase an you will be fine.

Ah really? I didn't know that. Do you have a source to proof it?
