Assuming strictly theoretical. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin used for VR? Good idea? Bad? Why?

There's only ever going to be just over 21,100,000 Bitcoin in existence, but I acknowledge you may be joking, in which case I laugh. Hahaha. (Comic book guy's voice)

Mostly cynicism from this post. Prices are said to rise in future, why is this? I think the massive rise to $1,000 was due to large quantities of money in Bitcoin from drug operations back when silk road was a big deal. The prices then dropped when laws started coming about and those invested in the drug side of it took all their money out or lost it. Either way they were worried. The best way to have an operation of such is to keep the money out of bitcoin now, until laws are settled. 
For the average person though, we see the good the tech can do and want to take advantage of that. We don't want banks running the world, encouraging pollution, fossil fuels, and dairy farms (which are both bad for the environment and bad for human consumption). We want the economy in the peoples hand. This is now kicking off and the more good impressions Bitcoin has, the better. 
But I also wonder if the economy will be better off in everyone's hand if we don't have the power to take action. The previous statement is of course a joke.

I've been wanting to purchase bitcoin since early 2010 when I was in grade 9 and I was 14. Haven't had the money to be able to until this year when I was given 10 000 dollars when my grandma passed away. The price I baught at was ~5000. Tried to convince my mum every day to buy. From the day it first became a quick search in Google every day for a month I told her the price and the %in change. when it crashed she made me stop telling her and said its dead and how could it ever have value. Still living paycheck to paycheck... for now.
