1. Spending = income. If people aren't spending, workers and factories are sitting idle. Putting those resources to work benefits everyone.
Keyensian econ does not say don't save. You're still mixing saving with hoarding. 
2. House prices are affected by income and monthly payment costs. If you make credit more expensive you'll deflate the house price, but that still leaves the prospective buyer in a worse spot.
Also existing homeowners get boned hard.

I don't recall high taxes being one of Venezuela's main issues. Remind me if that was the case. 
PDVSA mismanagement, falling oil prices and expensive subsidies were the initial causes I remember. Subsequent nationalizations didn't help, and subsequent monetary expansion hasn't either. Core problems remain, having more currency does not fix.

Would affect both savings and borrowing, yes. If they went - 0.25% on overnight rates, a 30yr mortgage would probably still be above zero as you'll still be baking in risk / duration premiums. 
One way to think of a recession is a miss-match between saving and spending (including real investment). Lower interest rates encourage spending and discourage savings to help return the economy to equilibrium.
Or, you can wait for markets to adjust but that could take a generation, which would be a waste.

It never really catches on as a currency / payment system and that causes interest to fall off. Price declines / price stability takes out the speculative interest. After that there's just some enthusiasts using it as a hobby.

Risk of a single stock is extremely risky. Doesn't matter if BTC falls to $100 or $0, basically the same thing.

Saving to invest is spending. A deflationary currency encourages hoarding, which is entirely wasteful. Additionally, a deflationary currency is best for creditors and disastrous for regular people. 
With fiat you have the option to earn a positive return, low risk, post inflation (TIPS). This isn't really that difficult. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:06:05
1. It didn't address the problems with deflation, unless I missed something.

Capitalism encourages reckless spending. You'll never have progress without testing the water, taking risk, trying ideas, pushing boundaries, etc. Lower rates don't really change any of this.

OK, but that's not what most people refer to with 'inflation'.
By your definition I don't see how inflation takes away from savings. Only takes away when we're talking about price inflation. Even then it does not just go to the government.

Stacking a huge chunk of your portfolio into BTC makes it extremely risky. That's why they used 99% cash to hide the risk, and then stacked in an unrealistic rate of return on the BTC. 
BTC falling towards zero is also a reasonable expectation. It's a very risky, very speculative asset and should be trayed as such.

Markets have many factors in them. Competitive pressure prevents companies from doing whatever they want. This is true for both inflationary and deflationary currencies.
Overall quality of products have been increasing. We do not need a terrible idea, like a deflationary currency, to continue that. We do not need people like you to recreate economic disasters like Venezuela in the US.

Well, inflation hasn't been running 4%.
Those 'raises' are mostly just cost of living bumps.
Not sure why you're trying to draw a parallel between gold and inequality. You're much better off looking at other items. Going from 90% to 37% on the top tax bracket has a much more direct impact on the super wealthy than gold. The divergence between those with a college education vs those who do not is hardly gold related either. Non-cash benefits suppressing wages.. also not a gold issue.

Cars did not last as long back decades ago. Average age of a vehicle in the US has been steadily rising. Was 7yrs in the 70's now 10+.
People used to spend a lot of time and money fixing things back then. People aren't as inclined to do that and it is harder as products become more complicated.

This sounds positive for banks, particularly the big ones. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:04:02
An example from a borrower's perspective:
$1000/mo mortgage.
$3000/mo salary (take home)
Money is a bit tight, but 10 years later mortgage is still $1000 but salary is $4000 (3% inflation), so a few years it's rough but then gets easier. Or 10 years later salary is now $2200 (3% deflation). Now the mortgage is unsustainable.
Deflation is not friendly for regular households and businesses. It's very nice for banks and the extremely wealthy, at least until you get to the economic collapse and their assets are written down.

CPI is in line with other inflation measures (both public and private). It's accurate. 
Also we live in a market economy so the price changes you experience may very well differ from someone else's. There are regional / select urban stats if you want something closer to home. 
Lastly, your raise at work really is just to keep you treading water. Take away inflation and you'll be down to a 0% raise. Bring on deflation and annual pay cuts. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 04:05:15
CPI is correct. It matches other public and private inflation measures. Moves to substitutes is market forces, not inflation. 
The past two decades have seen falling inflation and rising house prices. You have your math backwards.

1) volatility would also happen due to changes in demand for currency. Since bitcoin is inflexible in terms of supply, we should expect a lot of price volatility to get everything to clear.
4a) the wealthy spend a much smaller percentage of their income / wealth. Would naturally accumulate. Particularly as a deflationary currency incentives hoarding.

CPI does try to capture quality issues. GDP deflator is more comprehensive.
Inflation is the general rise in prices. Signaling out one price category (housing) is just noting that we live in a market economy. House prices rising is not inflation.. it's just house prices rising.
Housing affordability is more closely linked to monthly payments and interest rates than a typical consumer good. As inflation has fallen from the 80's, interest rates have fallen dramatically which allows house prices to rise and remain affordable.

Yes. 1,2,3,4 offer no evidece that the inflation rate is incorrect. Is 4 even correct? A new model iPhone priced higher than the old model is not a good measure of inflation. The products are not identical. 
If course CPI has weighted categories. How else would it work? If you don't like their categories pick a more comprehensive measure like the GDP deflator. Or cite which category is incorrect or was manipulated to post an incorrect figure.

Inflation was high in the 70's / 80's, low in the 90's to today. If inflation is the issue your charts should look vastly different. If you're claiming a cause other than inflation, not sure what that is or how that would affect college vs HS only education wage differences.

1) bitcoin, only bitcoin. Demand for it will fluctuate as the economy fluctuates. Ex. During Christmas people spend a lot, and the supply of money (currently) can change to accommodate that. 
4a) yes the market will adjust so that the wealthy elites own everything. There are many equilibriums and markets do not alway adjust to what you'd like to see, and adjustment may take a very long time (ex Great Depression). 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:56:09
Is the weighting wrong vs rents? Would imagine owner occupied should be more. 
Survey methodology looked fine last I checked. 
Inflation is the general rise in prices, not expansion of the money supply.
If CPI or GDP deflator were significantly off we'd be able to notice pretty easily by comparing to private data sets. We'd see odd things in corporate revenue figures or household standard of living or private price indexes (ex. MIT's), or bond prices after just a few years, let alone decades.
When a country fudges inflation figures people do call the gov out on it. That's not happening in the US. The numbers are good. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:10:40
AIER says they use BLS data, just select categories. So their data matches CPI.

Not disagreeing but do the math. $500 in savings isn't very relevant at any plausible interest rate environment.

You don't need to change consumption much to have a large effect. 2% drop in consumer spending has the potential to trigger a recession.
Also consider that anyone with debt (like a mortgage or student loans) will be in a rough spot. As deflation lowers your wages the monthly payment gets harder to make.

@_date: 2019-01-04 05:31:19
Hoarding of currency is a problem because GDP = all spending. As we hoard more currency we spend less, and GDP falls.
This puts more downward pressure on prices (more deflation) and the cycles go on.
Eventually you can reach a new equilibrium but that could take a long time (years and years) and lots of people will have become destitute in the meantime.
Last major deflationary cycle in the US was 'The Great Depression'. Fun, fun.

Ex. $1k/mo mortgage. $2k/mo net pay.

$1k/mo mortgage, $2.7k/mo net pay.

Sure, and depositors are lenders too. So we're back to square one of inflation being a non issue rather than theft of your paycheck.
Inflation is still helpful to debtors. We never really get zero change in inflation, consistently, over decades. Nominal changes in income help with repaying fixed payment amounts.

1) bitcoin is highly volatile and moreso if it were the sole global currency. Deflationary currencies are considered bad for economic use.
4a) not following why it cannot be concentrated in the hands of elites. A deflationary currency that favors early adopters would tend to that outcome. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:08:43
So they should close shop. You're highlighting the exact problem. They have an incentive to leave the real asset idle and hoard the deflationary currency.
Just do the math. If you sit idle you earn a return. For the marginal asset you, what, cut prices? Cut wages? Negotiate suppliers down? Why even try when you can just sit idle? 
Now extrapolate for the already wealthy and enjoy being a serf.

It's up to market participants to decide how money is best spent. Righ now market participants can't find enough high quality investment opportunities as it is. So, what your vision ends up with is a lot of idle capital (shrunk GDP). 
Your business venture idea involves lending. What legal form the lending takes (debt vs equity) is irrelevant here.

@_date: 2018-12-28 19:23:48
How is it badly wrong? All spending = GDP. Saving naturally detracts from spending (no shit, right?) and so caused GDP to shrink.
The idea that saving is good for the economy is contingent on savings being turned into productive investment. That requires savings to be lent out. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:42:28
It's hard to repay long term loan with a declining income. Wages are a price too. That 30 year mortgage pmt will be terribly painful 20 years in.
Deflation is great for lenders and the very wealthy. Debtors and workers suffer terribly.
One way around would be negative interest rates but then why lend? If no one lends how does the economy grow? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:33:43
2008 run started in a market the Fed didn't have legal authority to cover (money markets). 
Fed action once it spread to the institutions it could tough (banks) was limited and could only address liquidity issues not solvency issues. 
So the response was to create multiple solutions. The Fed took on lots of collateral from in exchange for cash (liquidity). TARP covered areas the Fed couldn't touch. 
Once the crisis got going the response worked as well as you could hope. Markets pretty quickly got working again. A lot of bad banks went bust. The Fed and the Treasury made a tidy profit. 
Took a looong time for the rest of the economy to heal. Which is why you'd rather these things didn't happen in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:02:54
Lol what? 
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:35:06
You what now? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:10:49
Saving causes an economy to shrink. 
Saving only leads to growth if that savings is spent (lending). 
If you are increasing saving and reducing lending you are shrinking the economy - you are destroying real purchasing power.
