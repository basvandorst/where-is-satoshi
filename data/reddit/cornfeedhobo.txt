@_date: 2013-12-14 14:47:00
well, it starts by not believing everything you see in movies.
just because someone points a gun at you does not mean you can't
1) run
2) grab for the gun
3) (aren't) in close proximity and therefore able to find cover
4) etc...

please, you are beyond mis-informed.
1) this is a fake post by someone impersonating me
2) you are telling me to do something in an arena that i know WAY more about. thanks though.
Please do your part, and report the original post

That would be advertising for Bitcoin which was never the goal. The goal is to disperse the funds to those in need.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:54:26
You have other comments in that are also intending to pump the price.
Let me be very clear
NO ONE CARES THAT YOU DIDN'T GET IN ON TIME, AND NO ONE BELIEVES YOUR MOOM THEORIES. IF WALLSTREET WANTED IN, THEY WOULD BE IN ALREADY.
The fact is that there are not enough places to circulate coins and not enough exchanges or coins to handle the depth they would need.
STOP COMING TO REDDIT TO TRY AND PUMP THE PRICE

Heifer program has high overhead which results in lower score. Needless to say, the NPR article I linked to for just this reason explains how their impact is hard to quantify immediately since the gains are more long term.
But that is why I also mentioned GiveDirectly.

i am not sure how that works here in the city... I mean, they are filming on the sidewalk, and the place I was standing was in the street. They weren't letting anyone stop on the street to watch, they would usher them by. So I imagine they have some type of legal claim.

To answer your questions, I plan to donate the money.
Currently I am thinking about giving to the homeless directly (from my hand to theirs, no shelter intermediary), but I am open to suggestions. Whatever I choose to do, I will include photos for proof upon completion.
Other ideas I liked are:
  (typhoon relief effort)
More can be read about them here:
If you have a meaningful suggestion, please be sure to include links and supportive articles that the charity actually gets the vast majority of their donations to those in need.
Thank you all for helping get Bitcoin to where it is and don't forget to help those in need when you can.
P.S. If you do not feel comfortable donating through me, please find a homeless person/family this month, and buy them a meal, non-perishables, shoes; anything they need! Every little bit matters!

[Gavin @ Bitcointalk: How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People](
**Update: I want to publicly acknowledge and thank Luke for changing his mind in this matter.**
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:01:58
Community doesn't matter one bit, the core programmers do. Bitcoin's comminuty is all over the map, with very few ever being as evangelical as shibes are. Yet here we are. Same thing with cryptonote based coins; the communities are tiny and not very vocal, yet people are already getting active with them.
Last I checked, people in the financial sector don't care for a bunch of kids that can't even take their own creation seriously.
**Let me be very clear: Creating a currency is not, and should not be, a "fun" activity. If you are looking to have it actually used as a currency, you want stiff nosed, slow moving types like Bitcoin has. No one wants to depend on a currency with creators that just keep chanting "to the moon"**
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:52:36
Because when fun and economics cross, we call that "gambling", which is not exactly a healthy habit to be supporting.
At the end of the day, people are putting **real money** into **real hash power**, which means they need **real returns**.
Fun and PoW do not go together, and never will.

Where is your trade history? Put your money where your mouth is.
Second, you are again placing odd constraints that only exist in your head. I have no desire to deposit the money or interact with a teller. When your are no logger using bank services anymore, what good is it for? A LOBBY WITH CAMERAS.  Guess what? You can find those a lot of places, similar to the place that I met the trader.
Please stop ending your comments with pejorative statements. That is some troll shit; no one is meeting in "dark alleyways".
Also, if you hadn't noticed, this thread was a dude impersonating me. How about you scroll up for the bitcointalk link for the TRUE story instead of trolling people

**I see a lot of comments about how the price will sky rocket if it gets banned.**
**I want to put forward a few arguments:**
1) Miners would have to go into hiding, and since there are a bunch in datacenters now that are big operations, we would likely see an impact on the ability to move blocks. We can expect that some (maybe most) big operations would try to move to other countries, and obviously home miners with small electrical footprints would continue to operate.
2) Prices go up on black market items which have a *need*. For example, people *need* drugs, but can the same be said for bitcoin? Do you *need* it to exist? Everyone seemed to be doing fine 10 years ago.
3) The developers have been very very public about their work. That would likely have to stop, and I don't expect Satoshi to come in and save the day. So anonymous programmers would have to take the lead and continue development, which could be a serious hurdle.

Yes, with bitpay you can now process with 0 fees, but for how long? You can't start relying on something that hasn't even existed for 6 months. They have had fee based processing before, it's not crazy to say we could see it again. (for small merchants)
Further, great, you have lowered your fees, but I, as a consumer, refuse to spend me money at a place that can't be charged back because I have no reason to trust you. This chicken and egg argument will always be there, and nothing in your proposition addresses that.
Mark my words; in a short time, people will use bitcoin to fund their paypal, just so they can be protected with charge backs. No one cares about the plight of the merchant!

Except most other forms other "information" do not carry with them, the possibility of full liability and years of litigation.
It is easy, as a nerd, to think about this in turns of bits and joules, but there are mountains of legal conventions that brought us to the current state of affairs. Dismissing that with a simple contrast, like you have done, only bolsters the existing industry, because it is clear that we (crypto users) don't have any understanding or respect for the safety nets that users *do* use everyday (chargebacks anyone?).

No, that's very accurate. No bank lets you walk in and just use their lobby to transact large amounts of cash without intending to deposit it, or in some other way involve the bank. Anyone that is rational, and more importantly, with experience will tell you the same.
Further, a cursory google search of my handle would have shown you that I have TONS of ratings as a face2face trader. It is you, that need to put up proof, or shut the fuck up.

The "Boycott Gentoo" thread was started by a well-known reddit troll and there is nothing I can do to resolve his ignorance; I have tried.
I agree the rhetoric is strong, but it seems to be the only way to address things with Luke-Jr. Well before putting up this thread, I addressed it with him in private, and then in public on IRC. As well, the bug had been up for over a week at the time, and both maintainers of the bitcoin overlay affirmed that they would not change their stance, even though there were well articulated responses explaining why this was a bad way to address the issue at hand.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:50:02
This is stupid on it's face.
People *have to* trade. The notion that inflation spurs economic activity is fraught with misinformation. Do I even need to bring up predatory loaning?
Deflationary currencies incentivise more rational use, leading to more rational actors in the market. How could this ever be a bad thing?
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:37:21
This is the dumbest thing I have looked at in months. Thankfully there are enough other rational people here to point that out to you. Bitcoin is a currency that helps you connect directly, if you want, but the vast majority of day to day users are using web wallets, which is tantamount to using a bank. Soon those operations we have real costs when the price evens out and guess what model they will head towards? Existing banking models!
Look at how many people lost at gox or have trouble getting their money from coinbase or bitstamp. Your graph relies on pure stupidity.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:53:23
