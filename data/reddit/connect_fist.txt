I keep seeing articles like this, and it's total crap. What is being done about it? Are they going to change the law? Can we petition for the process or law to be changed? It's so infuriating, I can't even imagine how this guy feels. It's so much worse than him being robbed at gunpoint even.

What the hell would google know about something starting tiny and growing into something poised to disrupt business, particularly in regards to searching and ads?

I actually had to reach this backwards in order to really get the concepts.

What's up with that?
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:50:26
[this guy]( might know.

Interesting how Bitcoin just surpassed WU. Maybe they gave up and said, fuck it, we need some bitcoin.

Woah woah woah, he didn't steal anything! He just mislead people into thinking he obtained the money legally and then wired it to a "Japan-based exchange" so he could launder it. Nothing to see here, folks.

Thanks, but which one on the strip do you use? Thanks for your input here.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:59:43
Yeah but the problem is still the price. If I store 2 bitcoins today, the price could be +/- $50 USD in 6 months. Whereas with cash, the value doesn't necessarily change. If I store $11k in a safe, 6 months later it will still be worth $11k.

In my company, we get unlimited paid time off. It all has to be approved by your supervisor though. So if you're abusing it, you don't get the time paid off... you might still get it off though. Basically just be respectful of company time and you get to be out of the office. Work hard, play hard.

Cool idea but why not have an app download instead of going through a web interface?
@_date: 2015-05-07 14:33:27
Yup. Just like one. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:50:49
Yeah... I'm not going to avoid Bittrex... sorry. 
I will avoid Garza though. And I won't buy XPY.

Why does block size matter? What does increasing it from 1mb to 20mb do for the network?
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:17:05
Oh you mean satoshi

How is it not practical for day-to-day use? It's money, its transactable, OF COURSE it is practical for day-to-day use!!

This has to be satire. It's almost comical some of what he writes. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:38:32
its just some issue with data not being passed somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 20:16:25


Thanks for the great advice.
@_date: 2015-08-08 14:21:23
Your last 2 sentences can be applied to Bitcoin, all you need is money and a connection and it will be ubiquitous, it's only a matter of time!
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:02:19
lol. Local Mall. Funny part is that indoor malls are being phased out too. so he was wrong about us going to indoor malls these days. Malls are mostly outdoors. And the business they do is comprable in store vs online. If they're smart they'll transact online. Dumbass.

Now is probably the best time to buy since the last time we went to 1200+ the price was right around $100-$200 per coin, i don't forsee it crashing to below those levels again.. we are back on an upswing. You may see it drop a few dollars here and there but if you're in it for the long haul i would buy now. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:40:08
My advice is to wait for bottom, then buy more BTC. Though there are some good stocks out there that are cheaper than normal right now.

I think the banks are likely just to take on a different role, I don't think they will actually fully go away. Roles like, lending, converting BTC to cash, etc. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:46:31
Do you feel they are one in the same?
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:43:19
Does this mean for services like BitPay, because they don't hold the customer's coins, the company doesn't have to apply for a license?
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:25:36

Haven't seen it up there yet.

Yes but adding an HD account does not give me the option to put in the 12 words. Adding a single account doesn't allow me to restore them as it is not related.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:10:20
I should mention i have backups of 2 accounts using the HD feature. But I can't import the keys.
@_date: 2015-04-30 19:25:53
That's the key to this whole thing. No one cares what the technology is or how it works, they just want to be able to easily use it. Same reason why no one cares how email works: they just want the message to get to the other person. Similar concept with BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:24:10
I will try that thanks. I didn't realize it had to be a fresh install.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:32:27
Yeah but now they get to search the agent's PC's and you don't know what they might find..
