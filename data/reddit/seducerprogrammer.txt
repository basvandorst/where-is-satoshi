He understood fiat. Many people nowadays depend totally on government support like housing benefit, welfare, foodstamp, free medical, medicare, free university... You know what will happen next when fiat is no longer accepted but Bitcoin &amp; cryptos? There would be a massive humanitarian crisis. So the US government will keep protecting the US Dollar. The distance between the rich &amp; poor will be further if cryptos dominate.

As far as I know Full nodes don't protect you from double spending 51&amp; attack from Bitmain but they can only accept valid blocks because Full nodes don't decide Concensus like Mining pools. Am I correct.
In an 51&amp; double spending attack, 2 blockchain with valid blocks Co-Exist, the Bitcoin network will choose the longest chain, right?
Valid blocks meaning transactions signed from valid private keys.

Because Bitmain gave birth to Bcash while owning [BTC.top]( [BTC.com]( AntPool ViaBTC. They're dumping Bitcoin to help boost Bcash
