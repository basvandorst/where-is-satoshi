Yea, super hard to get a Swiss bank if any US person is involved.  Only easy if you are a really high net worth individual who wants to plop $10m into an investment bank...

ha! That guy was EVERYWHERE

Yea, couldn't agree more. It looks like the foundation for that could be happening now...the irony of Russia putting together legislation first before the US specifically for this (it would seem) is super ironic for your analogy lol

Interesting point - they've been moving toward monetizing the platform, especially as it relates to video...incorporating the ability to tip...

Just like 4 months ago this was still such a niche (albeit growing space).  Now, we hear about bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency being talked about EVERYWHERE! Definitely just the beginning...for the entire industry...

pretty sure there's a fitting moon joke in here somewhere...

It really seems to be on a bank per bank basis - each group has its own compliance protocol to follow. We think its natural in an emerging market to see this as there are lots of legislative questions being sorted out.  Additionally, depending on where the individual/company/foundation is based who is engaging these banks for crypto or blockchain-related projects, they may get denied (American companies, for instance, have a tough time getting Swiss bank accounts in general).  Meanwhile, you have a Swiss bank like Falcon PG, which is actually allowing their clients to store and trade certain coins via the bank.  Interesting times for sure!

Yea, we hear you.  But, speaking of bullish, there's also a ton of activity in Belarus where they're looking to legalize ICOs and make them tax free (  Gibraltar is also creating a special hub for crypto/blockchain and a specific license for those businesses, and they already have a very favorable tax structure in general for international businesses. Russia is looking to create specific legislation for trading crypto, too, by July...we think we'll see more and more of this...

Lots of energy and activity in Switzerland, but the roadblocks to get set up in Switzerland as a new blockchain initiative are still pretty cumbersome to a global takeover...

Not surprising, given that Japan was an early adopter of Bitcoin and one of the first countries to recognize it as a legal form of tender.  Cool stuff - hoping we see more and more of this...we heard Japan is even planning to launch it's own digital token pegged to the Yen...

WhatsApp is actually super popular in San Francisco! We all use it. Of course we use Telegram and WeChat, too. It seems like the crypto community is somehow more world-connected...
