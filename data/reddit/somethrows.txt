They don't pay interest on frozen accounts but can accumulate it themselves. Is that not an incentive?

Just a thought, but another approach could be for exchanges to partner with some sort of remittance system to improve efficiency. 
On one side you have someone looking to trade cat for bitcoin, and an exchange full of people wanting to trade bitcoin for cash. 
On the other side you have a person receiving the remittance wanting to trade bitcoin for cash and (hopefully) an exchange full of people wanting to trade (local) cash for bitcoin. 
If instead of the exchange in each currency base happening manually by the remitter and remittee the exchanges happened in the background, and each exchange only took a fee on one side of the transaction I think you could have a very affordable remittance product. 
In short, organizations like ops could act as the remote exchange by forming an agreement with local exchanges to only add exchange fees to one party of a remittance transaction. 
Excuse any really dumb ideas, it's early still.

Super anonymous, even you don't know who has it!

Yes. 
In fact you'll often need to. Some sites and services will ban you if you allow for connections to that service. 
For example, you cannot connect to freenode if you allow  connections to exit from your node. Freenode instead has an onion address you can use.

I've read that some people use purse to get bitcoin without needing an account that requires linking to a bank account and are willing to pay a premium for that convenience. Not sure if it's true though.

This is sort of what onion links are for. 
Since I used freenode as an example this might be useful as well. For freenode you cannot connect directly with tor, you must instead connect via the onion hidden service.
