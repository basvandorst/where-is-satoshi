I guess this is a good example of ambition over intelligence.

"real money"...

Monzo?  I've used Monzo without any issues but Starling didn't even let me link to Coinbase...

I hadn't heard this, that means no more GBP banking, no faster payments etc?
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:31:57
I wouldn't bother, if someone needs convincing, they don't see the problems that bitcoin provides solutions for.

I love it when a plan comes together.
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:06:08
Yeah, of course it is...
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:57:01
Yeah... I'm going to guess you've never actually been to London.
Don't believe everything you read on zerohedge.

That's bollocks, there is plenty of socialism in (northern) Europe without the corruption...
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:17:23
Spoken like a true American.
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:02:54


Surely it is more the latter than the former that is the real problem?

To be fair, he hasn't stated anything outlandish.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:19:53
Agreed, crypto Youtubers are about as useful as genital warts.
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:07:23
Care to elaborate?

Anyone who actually questions your behaviour is an arsehole, clearly you aren't, well played.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:16:39


Are you okay?  You seem deranged ranting about bitcoin so much, if you don't like it (understand it is more applicable) why waste your time?
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:00:39
Do you read The Sun by any chance?
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:08:22
No, I'm not.

There is plenty of corruption in Thailand generally but in the context of Taxi drivers it is usually the drivers who are "corrupt" by either tampering with the regulated meter or just simply not using the meter with gullible tourists.

Unlikely, maybe but I wouldn't say no way.

No principles?  You're absolutely clueless but hey, this is the internet so why would that stop you commenting on things you clearly know nothing about?!
Whether you agree with his policies or not, to say he has no principles is a joke, there are countless examples of Corbyn showing "his principles" towards his constituents over the decades, in fact he would be one of the few MP's you couldn't accuse of having no principles...

I feel the same, no way would I swap First Direct (my main bank) for Monzo but from the little I have used them as a secondary account, they have been fine.

Buy in lower if you have the opportunity.
