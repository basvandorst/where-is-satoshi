Never too late. Start small and get a feel for it. Never spend more than your willing to lose. Good luck!

I shouldnt be “playing” bitcoin because im concerned that net neutrality will cause problems? It is a legitimate concern so I dont know why you are being so ignorant

I wish we were saying in the unlikely event net neutrality is removed 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:04:08
Wait what do you mean when you unistall net neutrality. Could you elaborate

Yeah coinbase is having a stroke right now luckily I got in a few orders before it bounces back up

Sorry I just don’t understand all of this and am just trying to get a grasp of whats going on

American user here definitely do not want to get cut out. Sounds like it would be a huge blow to bitcoin.

Thank you for such a detailed response. It really helped me make a decision on investing. I bought about 100$ worth and is still in coinbase. What mobile wallet do you suggest using? I downloaded airbitz but im a little confused on using it. Thanks again im very excited about being a part of this

As a newbie looking to invest and not worried about short term returns what do you suggest I do? Does it seem foolish to invest in buying less than a full bitcoin? How does the value of bitcoin continue to rise? Will it continue to rise? I know these seems like very silly questions but I have never invested in anything before and am still trying to grasp this whole thing. So if I invest around 4000$ and own 1 bitcoin is that ridiculous because I already missed the ship of buying it when it was cents for 1 bitcoin? Or will it be a small price to pay in the long run of how much the value will continue to rise? Also what would be the best way to purchase it? I'm just wondering if this is more of a tool used for specific buying situations as opposed to something I could put money into to see a return eventually.
