@_date: 2014-04-07 09:46:48
that would indeed make things quite a bit easier.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:43:55
ah crap sorry. dont mind me.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:09:32
Thats just my understanding. I could be wrong :p i dont have any eth. Just been researching it. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:50:56
The idea behind eth is smart contracts. Which in theory can get rid of middlemen like real estate agents. But you would still need someone to set up that contract...however, if the smart contract already exists on the network then your golden.

intersting info! thanks for the heads up. I dont think people will be buying for the next 48 hours. gotta wait until the table levels out a bit i think.
@_date: 2011-06-02 11:30:00
I think im just gonna stop mineing... Ill just use it for minecrafting instead :P
@_date: 2011-06-30 12:41:11
ah i see. I cant believe i did that. im an idiot
@_date: 2011-06-30 10:14:21
some of the offers are actually pretty good. 
Just saw this one today and thought it would be good for bitcoin. I have an unencryped wallet at the moment, but I dont have any bit coin in it anyway but if i were to encrypt it... i wonder if this would be an easy way to do it.
@_date: 2011-06-05 19:22:35
i know right, its pretty amasing. I just wish i got on this at $0.50
@_date: 2011-06-02 16:13:39
ah ok cool. Its funny coz my quadro is like 800 euros. but I guess its just built for a different type of functionality eh.
good luck mining!
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:21:51
im totally holding on. nothing to worry about, its just a 1 day flux. it will be back up in no time. someone is selling though. panic selling in effect.
@_date: 2011-06-02 08:24:06
Well my card is mostly used for rendering/3d/video editing. I didnt set up the system for mining, i just wanted to see what would happen my hash rate is 36.9 Mhash/s is that even decent? I'm pretty new at this.
I dont think im going to be mining anymore, I would rather invest on some coins then burn out my card.
@_date: 2011-06-04 11:30:07
I guess those are the signs i was looking for thanks/. I was just wondering if there was something that i was missing. I'm just trying to get a nice overview of the situation.
@_date: 2011-06-30 10:12:02
would you mind giving a little deeper feedback? what am i doing wrong?
@_date: 2011-06-04 11:23:30
So when would be a good time to pull out in your eyes?.
Also if the deicimal place is moved, wouldn't our wallets just adjust? or is that just not how it works?
@_date: 2011-06-04 11:09:04
Thanks for your response. I agree with what your saying. I'm just looking for signs of the bubble bursting.
What would be a reason for the coins to loose their value you think? People selling them?
Also Its likely there will soon be a few stories about people getting rich of bitcoin. Possibly a book and a CNBC interview of sorts I suppose. Like on the new Larry King.
So i think it still has rizing to do. I dont know if it would quite reach 10,000 a coin. but man if it did... I would be super happy :D
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:10:56
you just got me back into it! thanks king! UPVOTES FOR EVERYONE! haha
@_date: 2011-06-30 12:44:35
thanks. my bad, post has been edited.

The email may have been written prior to the MtGox email. Since he was also sending emails out to freaking everyone on the list, some people may have got it before the MtGox email as well. I am not the dude who did this. But even though I would consider it rude to email me, at the same time, I can see where he is coming from. 
I wonder how much he will make from that email.
@_date: 2011-06-02 08:24:57
Thanks everyone for your comments! quite helpful so far.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:12:44

just out of curiosity... how do you spell your mothers maiden name?
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:42:02
also... first pet name.... oh, no reason. my friend was asking about you thats all. on another note, I'm damned if I cant remember what street you grew up on. I must be losing it.

how about, justthetip.org? seriously though, the shorter it is the better. bittip is nice.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:33:48
is it possible to move Gox bitcoins elsewhere?
@_date: 2013-04-22 09:08:42
My mum is nuts about bigfish games :P
I think having it there as an option is good. 
Odds are they are not into bitcoin right now, but their husbands or children might be. 
by having it on the site, it might keep their eyes open to it. and hey, mothers day is coming up! why not buy her a game with bitcoins as a gift?
