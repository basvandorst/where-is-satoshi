These are instances and not indicative of a market around bitcoins. 
Ex. 0.1% of ecommerce happens over bitcoin is a more representative metric of Bitcoin's usage.

How can not using the Signatures while computing the hash / Transaction ID make it any less secure? Signatures are used to validate transactions and T IDs are used to identify transactions. The new TID will still cover the inputs and outputs. The PKScript is also included in the hash. Only SigScript is not used in computing the TID hash just as we would do for computing the hash to sign the transaction.

Come on. After I posted here, I also posted the same question on bitcoin-dev mailing list. And whenever relevant I am discussing the important parts I learnt from the discussion there here.

Block size increase is not what I am interested in. 
I am looking for the simplest change to address Tx Malleability. BIP140 proposes a soft fork to introduce Normalized Tx ID as described by me to deal with Tx Malleability without interfering with block size limitations or broad protocol / format changes as per my discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list.

I am sorry for not phrasing my statement appropriately. What I meant was that in SegWit, the transaction needs a data structure different from the current one where signatures are separated from the rest of the transaction data. Why change the format at all? Why cant we just compute the Transaction ID the same way the hash for signing the transaction is computed?

Segwit proposes a different format for the Transaction. What I mean is - Why cant we just compute the Transaction ID the same way the hash for signing the transaction is computed?

I mean a different data structure not a separate data structure.

Segwit separates the signatures into different data structure if I am right. My question is why is such separation even required! 
When computing the signature for a transaction, one computes the hash of the transaction data after removing any signatures added previously by others. But while computing the Transaction ID they compute the hash of the transaction data along with the signatures introducing 'Transaction Malleability'.
Now my question is - why can't we compute the hash used for Transaction ID the same way it is computed for creating signatures.

My question is... what simple alternatives exists to fix Tx Malleability....
