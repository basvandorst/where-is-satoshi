I thought the point of this post was that people should send their bitcoins to their private wallets instead of holding them in bitstamps wallet? At least that's what I did and didn't lose anything.

I actually can code, but I am not sure this would work. First if you create a layer on top of bitcoin everyone must use it in order to for it to work, and second the verification is fundamental to the protocol and one of the only "solutions" would be to not require verifications and just trust that the payment is not a double spend. It may work if payments are small, just like shops do not check every single euro bill they accept.

Yeah, I realized that myself after some fact checking. But my point was that it can find it's place. And unlike new bitcoin branch, litecoin can not be mined with bitcoin mining ASIC, so miners are not free to change to the most profitable branch easily. I don't know how and when it could be useful, but I am sure that it will at some point.

Unlike paper money, which might be safer at bank, bitcoins are safer at home, because a thief has to specifically target your computer and has to look for bitcoins himself. In case of online wallets they can automate the process and only use manual actions when he has the password.

Except for Antarctica. Whole continent, not an island. Only inhabited by scientists, who are likely using bitcoins too.

I am sure they will be really excited getting paper cards instead of toys! They can pretend these are movie tickets as they play "movie theater", or they can pretend these are actual credit cards. But most likely these will be thrown out to the garbage can as soon as you leave.

No, I still do not believe it is not hard to implement. Your explanation, even in theory, is not easy, I am sure you would run into many problems if you tried to actually do it. But let's not argue over that, we both agree that we need decentralized systems like that.

Let the new government form and see how it will be. And if we are where we started, then we can make at least some things more right from the beginning.

How bitcoin compares to litecoin? What are the differences?

The kid wrote a terrible essay and got what he deserved, it is not related to bitcoin. He wrote it as some kind of scam or phishing email. He suggests you can get quick buck before holiday. It makes it look like this is some sort of investment fraud. Or a pyramid. I'd give him 0 too if I was a teacher, even if children were assigned to write about bitcoin. Knowing how bitcoin work doesn't make you a good writer.

Although I am all for Bitcoin, let's not forget that it is not suitable for day to day business transactions. Because first it has limit on how many transactions there can be per block, and second because it takes time to verify the transaction. And besides that, I'm not convinced single global currency is actually positive thing to have.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:33:29
Regarding block time, yes, it's true. But it could be used in places, where customer does not want to spend so much time waiting for verification. Although same could be achieved by 3rd party services and bitcoin. Still, never underestimate alt currencies, they are as capable as every other, if not premined,and litecoin, as far as I am aware, is not premined.

Too bad I don't have much bitcoins. Would sell soon while the bubble is up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:14:29
No need to get all zealous about bitcoin. Litecoin has stronger encryption and shorter approval time than bitcoin, other than that it's the same bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:17:46


**Verification time** makes it *not practical*. **Transaction limit** per block makes it *not suitable* for business at all, except certain kind of business where time is not of the essence.
P.S. lack of anonymity is another barrier for big business. If you think it is anonymous already better think twice.

I would never download, not even mention BUY, a distribution "designed" by a stranger for usage with bitcoins. And I'd suggest others, who are not computer experts, too. Because regular people have no way of finding out if your prepacked ubuntu doesn't come with some malware already installed that sends bitcoins directly to your wallet. Or at least wait for some time until many people tries this out and if they won't get robbed only then use it.
