California checking in - works here, though it asked me some more questions regarding my income source and employer name.

It's hard for me to imagine someone who is savvy enough to own bitcoins and yet be un-savvy enough to fall for this.

Been a very noob user of bitcoin for a while and just read every single page while at work. Love it! Design/navigation can use some work but that can come later.
I never understood the details of how keys are generated and verified, and this explains it so well.
Thank you kind sir!

I would love to but unfortunately my coinbase transaction (first timer) won't be clearing until 12/3. Sadface. I shall stimulate the bitcoin economy with my mind instead.

This sounds pretty legit... Definitely going to try it out. Thanks!

I think that's perfectly reasonable. Probably an entirely different conversation but I wouldn't be so concerned with tithing to the letter of the law so much. The point of tithing is for it to be a sacrifice of your financial gains as an act of trust and hope to bless others. If you felt like 10% of the USD was a significant portion, then there you go. Not sure what your exact beliefs are but speaking as a Christian, God cares most about where our heart is at, in all things, including our giving.

As far as you can tell? Please, tell us how you conducted this research into the total number of transactions and the number of false positives.

Apple considers their In-App purchase system part of what they offer, so they take the same 30% cut that they do for App sales. I'll probably get downvoted to hell but everyone is just bandwagon-complaining/hating. Apple set up the App Store system and they can charge whatever they want. And as a developer, you have the choice whether to use them or not.
For iPhone users, the Coinbase website works just fine through Safari, and I believe there are some other HTML solutions for QR code scanning as well. I'm pretty sure Apple is not "Anti-Bitcoin", but has a strict policy on In-App purchases that they aren't going to just bypass because BITCOIN RULES ALL THE INTERNETS.

Good thing you can verify who is upvoting/downvoting your posts comments... oh wait... only if they were to tell you.
Me = downvote.
