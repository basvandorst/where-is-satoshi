Great job on those designs. Are you planning on setting up some sort of collaborative project to get this implemented? Are there some developers banging on your door asking to help build it?
If you are taking a collaborative route I would love to pitch in.

Do you have an English version of the website?

I think you are confused. Bitcoins can still be the medium for transactions that would have been far slower and more costly if they had used fiat. Therefor, they have value and a bitcoin economy could in theory be sustained.

I know. I tried just asking people at random on the street, but this seems to be working better.

Short answer: Double spending vulnerabilities.

Sorry, I must have missed that. To be fair, my post is a bit more useful and serious.

This is ludicrous, unless people start putting their bitcoins in banks, which defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency and has not happened to date. Remember that on coinbase (gox, btc-e, ...), for example, you have money in a wallet, not a bank account. Your wallet is just a private key that corresponds to a certain number of bitcoins linked to a public key in a public ledger.

Silly government. If I want to launder money with bitcoins I'm not going to go through the trouble of involving this guy!

I did... didn't see anything from &lt;1 month ago.

You are correct that users don't have access to their private keys on these online wallets. But that's irrelevant. When I buy bitcoins with an online wallet, I can inspect the blockchain to see that the btc reside in my wallet. Either they are their or they aren't. No 'points'

The best time to buy was a year ago. The second best time is now.
 If you are in the US, coinbase is your best bet.
