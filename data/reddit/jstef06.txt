No imperial data given to make a case. 
Here's my thoughts...
If you observe the market cap of BTC, which is basically the money supply in dollars, it's about $9 billion. That's a lot of money, right? 
But then an economy like Venezuela has a GDP of &gt;$450 billion and is imploding. 
So what happens when a country like Zimbabwe or Venezuela adopts BTC as a de facto national currency? Wait before you can say it hasn't happened in the past.
It's happening in the Caribbean nations right now and don't forget that Iceland once considered ditching their currency for the Canadian Dollar during the financial crisis.
It's going to take a financial shock in a tech literate country. Once BTC become adopted as a de facto currency, this current $600 will be considered cheap.

I don't know why this is so hard for people to understand. You're just buying your place on the public ledger (blockchain). There's limited supply and unlimited demand... the price will increase. Ponzi scams are a result of a con-man taking money from investors to payoff earlier investors downstream. If Bitcoin were a ponzi, one guys would have access to all encryption keys AND be able to liquidate them. Not very realistic.

The crypto-pie is getting bigger but BTC is only maintaining or consolidating its share. With so many alt coins in the market, there are better long term investment opportunities.
It’s a competitive space now. BTC isn’t the only game out there.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:51:49
I agree. This doesn’t make sense. Bitcoin is a currency or a store of value. It’s not a stock market.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:17:13
Crypto maybe. But there are ICOs out there offering other investments than new cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:48:15
This is laughably wrongheaded. First, the comparables to BTC as a store of value are gold, silver, platinum, palladium, etc. Second, the comparables to BTC as a transfer of value are world currencies ie USD, GBP, EUR. So what is the money supply or M1 supply of cash in those currencies? Then don’t forget, the consumer is not just Americans or Europeans, it’s a global market! So you could potentially take the entirety of the world’s current and most liquid money supply, CASH and compare it to the worth of BTC.
Comparing a currency or alternative store of value to an entire stock market is ridiculous unless you’re relying on BTC traded exchanges/stocks popping up and overtaking the world’s stock markets.
And I also don’t think the ICO analogy is appropriate either. First, most of the world’s vendors still do not accept ETH as a exchange of value. When ICOs are fully funded the officers of the companies must begin liquidating ETH for cash to pay vendors. That creates significant down-pressure of ETH that BTC doesn’t have to overcome. Then, and this is key, the company must earn cash returns at a rate equal to current ETH ROI. Right now, that’s just impossible. You’d be much better off sitting on ETH as an investment and riding it through.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:45:39
Everyone looks at bitcoin and compares its value to a national fiat currency. But bitcoin can supplant every national fiat currency, not just one. So it will always be undervalued to me.

It's interesting more people don't talk about this. All that needs to start happening are a few high profile money laundering cases and PRC takes a position and begins raiding mining facilities. Since a handful of miners account for such large transaction volumes, it could lead to massive disruption in BTC pricing and mining costs. I think it's not a question of if but when it will happen.

GLD ETF has a market cap of $41B
SLV ETF has a market cap of $7B
BitCoin has a TOTAL market cap of $9B. TOTAL!
Whereas GLD and SLV ETFs only represent a portion of the worlds traded gold and silver but the BTC market cap represents all of it.
If BTC gets listed as an ETF and even $1B gets purchased as an ETF, it will drive daily traded volumes crazy. There will be an exponential spike in the price. Especially in the first few months.

Gold &amp; silver are traditional alternatives to storing value. When the stock market goes south or there's any doubt as to the value of fiat, investors traditionally flee to gold and silver because it's held value for millennia. 
Same thing goes for BitGold, ahem, BitCoin. If there's inflationary pressure or market anxiety, investors will seek a safe haven for their money outside of cash or the stock market.
The best example of investors fleeing fiat currency for BitCoin was the Cyprus insolvency crisis in 2012.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:11:39
Well, I think really any crypto-currency if you have doubts about your country's money.
I think BTC will continue to grow share and retain value as a legacy cryptocurrency and market share leader but altcoins can grow just as fast or faster in terms of market cap.
Historically, gold, art and diamonds were the best ways to move a substantial amount of money outside the country in times of crisis (war) but bitcoin will probably become the new standard.
