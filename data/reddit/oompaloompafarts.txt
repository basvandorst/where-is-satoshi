@_date: 2017-02-22 01:13:31
really - i tried and nothing showed up in my PopChest.
my $5 in bitcoin is also sitting unconfirmed after 24 hours....
not sure WTF is going on
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:50:28
this is true.....what could be the reason behind this constant "destabilizing" of the BTC price?
China leads in mining power and transaction volume.   This puts China in the poll position for the moment.   
Interesting times......long and strong!

I did a $5 donation to watch the "magic money" bitcoin documentary
it took 40+ hours for the 1st confirmation - sent from Blockchain.
very strange...
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:13:29
you played it safe....never go broke taking a profit.
you will be kicking yourself if the ETF is approved.
you will be patting yourself on the back if it is not.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:48:24
nicely done - send over your private key and I'll confirm you BTC are still safe.  ;)
cold storage, take hackers out of the equation
good luck!

@_date: 2017-03-14 01:04:30
never go broke taking profits
you can always start slowly building back up your position
I would also recommend taking a position in Ethereum

Schiff made some good calls back in the day.
Eventually his call for the dollar collapsing and real estate collapsing will come to fruition.   It's been years now though and fortunes have been made in crypto that you missed out on if you followed his advice.
my 2 cents
gold/silver are decent investments to have in your portfolio
same with real estate
but never forget....crypto is king, crypto is the future
praise kek
