BTCjam is denying lenders net arbitration documents for select loans:

Like many users of the Bitcoin lending site, I've been receiving a persistent withdraw error while using BTCjam:    
Upon contacting support, I was told that they would not fix the withdraw error or speak with me further on the matter.  My account has a 100% rating with 16 positive and zero negative reviews.  But I have voiced concern on social media regarding BTCjam's tolerance of ponzi schemes and, as a result, they have pocketed my account balance.  
These withdraw errors are allowing the company to confiscate their users' funds, as in the case of Mt Gox. This must not be tolerated.

They assured me via support that they would not fix the error because I had voiced criticism on social media.

One borrower I invested with (username mikku) used stolen documents to engage in identity theft, claiming to be from Mauritius though all his documents were from Croatia.  I'm even in contact with the individual whose ID was stolen.  I sent a notice to support at BTCjam and they ignored it.  Left a comment on the loan page and they deleted it.

Totally, I will add to your thread.

BTCjam is garbage.  Borrowers who become late on their loans get "blacklisted" and can no longer post comments to communicate with their investors.  The kneejerk censorship by the administration makes constructive criticism of any kind impossible.

I think your priorities are in the wrong place when you flag me for linking to your competitor's forums in an attempt to inform other defrauded investors. Meanwhile BTCjam appears not to be concerned with borrowers obviously engaging in identity fraud, where documents do not even match.  My thread is here:

BTCjam is particularly high risk.  I can confirm from firsthand experience that the service is accepting stolen IDs for loan requests, where the identification and address on file clearly belong to two different countries. Jam will bar users from commenting who mention this on the site.

"Users get blacklisted for many reason (which I will not disclose)."  BitLendingClub seems to be doing fine without censoring their users' comments, and they also provide a forum for discussion.  This concern shows up repeatedly on the site. I can point you to numerous examples of the same "ridiculous" critique appearing on BTCjam comments sections if you wish.  
Controlling users' communications interferes with the lender/borrower relationship, and your competition engages in no such censorship.  ALL CAPS.

Not true.  Various users have been blacklisted after defaulting and cannot communicate.  When I attempt to notify  Support, as I have done various times, they simply ignore the emails.  There is a borrower who has defaulted who claims to be the victim of identity theft, but no one involved can leave a comment on his loan or get in touch with Support.

BTCjam accepts mismatching IDs from people engaging in identity theft.  If you mention it on the site, they turn off your commenting privileges and ignore any emails you send to their support staff.  
@_date: 2015-10-02 17:01:06
Violated your terms of service?  You mean by explicating in my comments on the site how you are accepting mismatching documents and encouraging identity theft?  If by communicating to other lenders on BTCjam that you are encouraging fraud I thereby "violate" your terms of service, this proves that you are dependent upon censorship to mask the corruption underlying your business practices.  
Your blanket use of censorship to keep your customers in the dark about your encouraging identity theft among fraudulent borrowers is unthinkable in the age of the internet.  I pity you, BTCjammer, for thinking you can get away with treating your customers with such contempt.

My Coinbase transactions have also been stuck in "Pending" for hours today, zero confirmations.

You've not responded to my issues at all and merely delete any and all comments I make on the site, while your support team refuses to respond to my legitimate concerns.  Loanbase allows discussion on their forums, which you should be emulating instead of banning anyone who attempts to inform other users.  These "accusations" are backed by clear evidence that you are supporting the use of identity theft to defraud investors.
@_date: 2015-10-02 17:22:48
How about, for starters, not accepting mismatching documents from scammers engaging in identity theft?  How about not censoring and banning lenders for "violating the terms of service" if they point out in the comments section that you are actively encouraging fraud?
@_date: 2016-05-08 04:49:53
TLDR:  Bitcoin will go up then down.  Volatility will increase.

BTCjam does *not* in fact do any meaningful verification of identification when reviewing borrowers. This statement by BTCjammer is total BS.  
In actuality, BTCjam accepts mismatching documents from borrowers who are engaging in identity theft.  If you mention this on the site, as I have, BTCjam staff blacklist you for violating their terms of service and refuse all inquiries submitted to BTCjam Support.

The support is absolutely dreadful.  They have blacklisted all my support tickets since I pointed out to them that BTCjam was accepting mismatching documents for their loans and thereby encouraging identity theft.

I'd agree, the writing needs to be revised.  Using "Mickey Mouse" as an ad hominem is about as descriptive as saying fiat is "poopy-head" money.  Also,

Total bull, BTCjammer.  You do *not* check against identity theft.  My thread on loanbase forums clearly demonstrates that you accept mismatching documents and reward identity theft.  
Why on earth would I invest in a service that encourages fraud and engages in censorship in this manner?  It is my obligation to warn others of your irresponsible behavior.  Pointing out that borrowers are using stolen documents to open up their loans is not "harassment," but statements of objectively verifiable reality.  Meanwhile, you *are* engaging in censorship to cover up your irresponsible conduct and rewarding borrowers for committing identity theft.  
Your behavior is destructive, and censoring your users simply means that we will take to other forums, such as this one.
