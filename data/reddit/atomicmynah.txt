If I found myself in that situation I would not sell at $450, I would instead hold on to them.

How can so many fail at this? I see the prices go up and down all day and it seems as easy as buying when they are low and selling when they are high. I am looking for the exact reason why this wouldn't work.

I don't have 10k to spend but I do have a good amount. I made it by working over the Summer.

Oh that's a cool game, thanks! And just as I suspected I bought when the stock was low and sold it when it was high and made significantly more money than the buy and hold every time.

Emotions will not be a problem for me. Why would it be hard to buy when the prices are low and sell when they are high?
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:51:41
I did this before with bitcoins but over a much longer time frame. I've bought and sold bitcoins a bit before but not on this scale or short time frame. I don't see how emotions would some how make me make completely illogical decisions. There must be some other reason that would make this method of investing not work.

I still made money didn't I? I used to have .1 BTC when the price was spiking all the way up to $1000. I sold it at about $650 because I figured that would be good enough and I still would make a profit (bought the .1 when it was $100). Yes it eventually went up to $1000, but I was still happy because I made money. I'm not sure how making money could leave me unhappy.

Yes that was what I thought might come up. So when you buy and sell bitcoins, do you have to like go through and find people willing to buy what you have at some price? You can't just sell it to a website at whatever the regular price is?
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:52:49
No but I see the prices very consistently fluctuating every single day. They reach a low point every day, at which point I would buy, and a high point, at which point I would sell. What is there that makes it more complicated?
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:42:55
I do not have $10k I am willing to invest but still a significant amount and I don't give two shits if I lose it.
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:46:33
What makes you think that? I am 100% serious. I have a fair amount of extra money on my hands and I'm looking for a way to invest it and make a profit. I thought of this idea but it seems too good to be true, and I'm looking for the exact reason why this wouldn't work. The best I can think of is that for some reason it is impossible to move large quantities of bitcoins on a short notice.
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:22:45
The situation you are describing is of no worry to me. I have a large amount of money with nothing to spend it on. I have absolutely no need for it, so I want to do a riskier investment and see if I can get more out of it.
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:48:52
This is sort of what I'm thinking of doing except on a much smaller scale and with bitcoins. I don't care that they're making magnitudes more than me. $200 a day is more than enough for me. I don't see how people like this existing prevents me from doing this.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:06:35
That's a good idea, I think I'll try it out. Or maybe I'll try it out with a smaller amount of money. Thanks! Also is it hard to move large amounts such as $10k? That's what I'm most worried about, not being able to sell it within the 10 minute time frame that I'll need to.
@_date: 2014-09-17 03:21:30
Yea I've decided I'll try investing a small amount (in the hundreds maybe?) to test the waters. It's probably stupid to go into this full on right away.
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:40:47
In which case I would just hold on to the money until they go back up. I've noticed that if you're buying at a mid-low price, the price will undoubtedly spike to a small margin (~$10) more than what you bought it at within a few days. I am not worried about this bit at all.
