I believe you have justed the answer to my problem as well as OP's but I can't figure out what to do with  ~/.bitcoin/    So I have a wallet.dat on my desktop from back in the day and bitcoin core installed and running.  Where the hell do I copy that Wallet.dat to?  so frustrating!  :&gt;)

Yep I got it.  Thanks for your help.  I am kinda a newb and sometimes I get tripped up doing the easy stuff.

Because bitcoin is being used by jail-able individuals and big banks are corporate entities.  It is the idea of a corporate veil.  This means that the humans in a company are not actually the company and not liable for the corporate actions.  Imagine if someone sued McDonalds employees for making burgers.  Not the corporation, but the employees, and won.  Every employee would then have to pay xx$ even if they wern't there etc.  
It doesn't work.  This is probably much of the reason bank heads don't roll.  That and money.  Tons of money.

Excellent.  This is wonderful to hear.  I cant wait for a super mega insane mixture between all that is awesome on the tubes.  Bitcoin, Bittorrent, mesh networks, Blockchain, etc in one massive pile of anonymous secure awesomeness.

Bitcoins are over $18,000?!    Then I looked closer ha ha.

Oh gosh... If only it was MOAR composites lol.   Well, I applaud you guys, that is an awesome car.  If possible make the electronics open so that the user mod the non-safety related stuff.  It would be cool to have car apps like I have for my phone.

Honestly, this is where a shitty memory comes in handy...  I like to use a sketchy and unreliable set of obscure hints and tricks to remember a password that is otherwise un-rememberable.  I honestly, could never remember my own (important) passwords if under duress of if I did not use them regularly.  I have a few things I encrypt and every few weeks I go through it and it takes me 5 or so times to get it.  If I was ever coerced I would not be physically in the place where the memory joggers are and if I was in that place I would promptly destroy them or just ask someone to do it for me.  Also, programs like Truecrypt have the ability to be indistinguishable from random data so it can be very difficult for someone to say that your data is even encrypted at all.

Ha ha, no but over a long period of time the average should be up if one could effectively filter out speculation.  
@_date: 2011-10-17 14:13:08
See, the catch is that businesses don't want to operate with a deflating currency.  Every day there will be less money to buy your products than the day before.  This means that you have to hike your prices over and over and over.  As a person trying to sell stuff, this will be painful and expensive on the advertizing side.  Bitcoin is stuck as a speculation currency simply because it's value will always rise... It will be horded and traded.  It lacks the stability and store of value that is necessary for a real currency.  Don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoin is great and I think a future iteration of this will change the world (for better or worse) but it needs the following changes...
Rock solid encryption to keep hackers/etc from stealing it.  The fact that it is so easily stolen makes it almost worthless for storing any serious money.  It simply cannot be used by the technologically illiterate.  Bitcoin needs a stable (fixed) quantity with a mechanism to replace coins that were lost or "destroyed" though computer crashes, wallet loss etc.  These changes would make it a lot more attractive to businesses over time.

uuh... thanks for the ?help?

Interesting thanks for the info.  
@_date: 2011-10-17 20:38:02
My guess is the initial surge was due to speculation as I alluded to... but like you said...  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  
@_date: 2011-04-19 22:53:51
Man, there are people out there with tens of THOUSANDS of bit coins already.  I feel so behind the times.  They could buy a bit coin Corvette lol.

Shit just got real....     But yeah.  I agree totally.  The world as we know it is over baby!

!!!!!  Holy Crap... I've been mining on 2 fast computers for a month and I have 0.00000 bit coins to show for it.  How on earth did you get so many?  One just selects "Generate Coins" right? /cry

I'm actually super-proud of BTC and it's followers.  For such a new idea the government, the media and a small group of right-minded individuals have quickly grasped upon its significance.  To appear in a "normal" media source so quickly is a testament to how successful this will be given a larger period of time.  I was actually sad when the price went up so fast because I simply was priced out of the market.  I don't have the time/skill to mine but I was interested in just buying BTC as a hedge against inflation of fiat currencies.  Now I can afford to again!

This one thread probably has more relevant and intellectually stimulating information than 100 books on economics.   I love The Tubes, Reddit and Bitcoin.

My guess is that a bitcoin based scam would fail in the courts... at least early on because, at its core, bitcoin is nothing but a math problem.  If I choose to trade the solution to my math problem for some good that does not make it money.  Does any one else see things this way?

My point is this:  Why spend your Btc today when (speculation aside) it will be worth more tomorrow?  The answer is you won't.  You will spend dollars instead.  The problem is everyone will do this so businesses will not see BTC as a wise currency to do business in.  Speculators will rule this currency.  We can see this in the wild price swings that it has had from its inception.   
@_date: 2011-05-17 01:41:32
Ahh  Fair Market Value.  Gotcha.  I understand now.  
@_date: 2011-10-22 16:09:48
Well Btc should balance out the being just slightly above the cost of mining it considering time, equipment, electricity etc. required to get coins averaged of a period of time.  The thought that anyone can mine it should basically set this number pretty solidly.  The catch is that it is so easy to speculate.  The "price" is all relative though.  I like to compare currencies to products or commodities not to other currencies.  Would you be more interested in a hosting service that would sell to you at a fixed BTC and a variable dollar or a fixed dollar and a variable BTC?   My guess is that this will crop up very quickly if it has not already.  
@_date: 2011-06-05 22:20:46
Isn't it the point of bitcoin that it is untraceable and dispersed so t cant be shut down???

The purchase of goods with BTC  is basically anonymous if done correctly so thats kinda what I thought.

I think you can buy some Alpaca socks for 35 btc. .  Thats the only real product I've seen and thats what I'm holding out for.  A physical product from a Reprap machine would also relieve me of some btc, especially if it was somewhat useful.  I think that the combination of decentralized currencies and decentralized production like Reprap is going to change every single thing in the world.  I hope it does!

Wowzers...  what an asshole.  Remember, bitcoin is the bleeding edge of monetary technology.  It is the wild west so I would be careful out there in bitcoin land.  When I used to buy on CL, I would bring a friend and act like a silly excited tourist with my friend taking the pictures.  I would always try to get some shot of me next to the seller with a stupid look on my face giving the camera a thumbs up.  This could've likely kept me from being scammed in stuff like this.  I think bring-a-friend /take a picture may be a good way to combat this in the future?

Um, explain how every single fiat currency is exactly the same only more likely to disappear because of the ability to produce more and more of it at the printing press as opposed to less and less being possible to produce due to a mathematical function.  
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:44:00
Honestly, I would transfer my wealth into bitcoin AND gold/silver and land(if you can) and other currencies and maybe even borrow some money to do these things because you will be able to pay the money back with cheaper inflated Yen's in the future.  Do NOT do just one thing.  Expect there to be some rough times ahead and stay away from any form of fixed income.  GOod luck.
