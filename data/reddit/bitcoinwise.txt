I haven't seen anybody tatooeing his surname on his body.
This makes it even more probable that its NOT his real name!

Danny is under the illusion that he can return to cyprus only when he decides so, or when "advised" to do so.
Once an international arrest warrant is issued and you know it and do not show up, you commit another criminal offence. The guy seems to believe that its a game. He will end up in jail for many many years.

You are unfair to them.

I am really amazed how quickly the cyprus police jumped into the case, structured the criminal prosecution and got an arrest warrant issued. The Japanese police left the other crook Karpeles untouched.
If they manage to jail Danny they will become the most beloved and famous police force within the entire bitcoin community.
Danny boy has been speechless and in hiding for 2 weeks, when the arrest warrant was issued he was so scared that shit his pants and came out of the hide shaking.
Danny don't be scared. With so many hundreds of defrauded shareholders and creditors that you have stolen their money, probably you are much more safer in a prison cell than outside in the free world.

Do not worry people. Everything will be cleared in his trial.

It is crystal clear that the crook ran away with 5,000 of the company's Bitcoins. 
Those that "disappeared" between the 18th and 19th of March. 
Those that **he thought he owned but after “checking” a wallet, realised had actually spent them all.**
