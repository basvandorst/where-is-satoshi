Only once at a restaurant near campus and only because of the silk road. D: I assume there must be people on campus who own bitcoins, but just don't talk about them much. I was thinking of starting a weekly meetup or something, advertising it on the college's subreddit, but haven't gotten around to it. Would help newbies out with setting up wallets etc too.

I am also surprised at how few people my agemajor have heard of it. If anything, they've only heard about it due to the silk road capture and don't own any themselves. In April, I overheard a classmate say he was mining with his gaming computer, but I assume it would be unprofitable by now. Everyone else I know who knows bitcoins learned about it from me :P

Was refunded about half of what what in my Coinlenders account. 
"Hi, we have sad news..
Due to major hacks, Inputs does not have enough BTC to repay everyone fully. We're dividing up the coins we do have left based on a sliding scale, and have sent it to the specified address. On your Inputs account, your balance should have flipped to the negative to indicate you've received a refund.
We apologize sincerely for the lost Bitcoins. It's been a very hard lesson for us, and we're sorry that we have to pass it onto our users. Please respond to the email if you have any queries."

Gox's slowdown/crash certainly didn't help... As soon as they came back online, everyone was in a panic trying to sell everything they had before the price fully fell.
