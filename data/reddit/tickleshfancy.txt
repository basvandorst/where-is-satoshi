What happens when altcoins pair with more options than BTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:04:44
I said goodbye to my money long ago-if you love something set it free, if it returns it was yours all along. If it doesn't then your broke.

Now you know ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:42:22
Even if it goes to 0 I ain't selling shit!! I just hope all my money went to someone who needs it instead of some rich asshole
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:40:53
Predictions are like assholes everybody has one

If people don't buy at the highs it will never go up right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:50:16
We need to make that 7 billion monkeys 14.9 satoshis each  I bought btc a few years ago and then Drifted off to the futurology sub Reddit so excited about the possibilities of what's to come and now I find my self obsessed over the price of btc and that makes me sad.  Wish we could focus on the tech and how it CAN change the world.

Finally-maybe this is a financial revolution or whatever it takes to subplant one. I'm just a dumbshit but can't the people of the world decide what's valuable and what's not? Or are we told what to chase? Just trying to read the fine print on my bottle of brain wash.

Fiat 0

It was looking like 2018 was setting up to be a big year for cryptocurrency in general. Do you think this will set things back? I don't see how newcomers will trust their money to this market with such shady practices. Of course there is risk when investing in crypto, but nobody what's to get conned. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:19
I'm looking at it like this, it would suck ass if I lose what I have in crypto but if I do I will be ok. But if I sell and miss out on $ 1,000,000 bit coin I will never forgive myself. HODL!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:27:56
Have a nano and I send fiat from my account even though it takes a week to get there. I think I will start using binance for now. Bought some alt coins recently there and was pretty smooth. Although I can't deposit USD there and the other exchanges will not verify me. I have sent everything they requested minus DNA samples to them already, and still nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:47
Couldn't coinbase be easily disrupted? Someone should get on that
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:54
Trading in and out has never seemed like a good idea to me unless you  have insider info
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:03:18
If people sell out then not many except banks
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:43:37
Lol if everyone would HODL people win!! But Greed?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:35:12
In hindsight this was the worst advise ever 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:07:41
Drunken comment erased. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:00
Yeah why is everybody abandoning ship? Just because bcash gets listed on coinbase? I understand the implications but it seems like a bunch of sheep being herded to a new pasture 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:48:43
Why cash out to fiat? Just wondering if fiat might be worth so much less if people decide to take control of money VALUE
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:32
Yeah I feel a little sick knowing that these shady bastards have a nice chunk of my money. Sad thing is coinbase was supposed to be the friendly newbie exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:46
Are people just selling to buy Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:36:04
So it is written.
