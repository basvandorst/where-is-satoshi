Bitcoin has about 100 days to get past this impasse. If not, sometime in early August it will forever lose it's dominant position. People need to rapidly be talking about compromise between camps and the various leaders of the groups need to get on the phone and come up with a way forward.

Ok, here's your war.  If bitcoin does not resolve this impasse, in 100 days, early August, it will lose it's dominant position forever.  War with that.  It's time to get both sides to a table and compromise.  Otherwise, the dominant position is lost forever come early August.  Remember that.

I'm perfectly calm.  99 days until bitcoin has lost it's dominant position.  Plan accordingly.

99 days (conservative estimate) before the bottom drops out and bitcoin is the alt.  Time for posturing is over.  Plan accordingly.  
Edit:  I can see why you wouldn't care as you've recently bought a bunch of alts.  I would promote no compromising if I were you as well.

Trend lines of percentage dominance drop as a function of time. Early August is actually a little generous.  If panic sets in, it could actually be significantly lower than 50% worst case scenario.  
We have flat run out of time.

This is getting fucking stupid.  Something needs to be done.  We're almost 100 days out from bitcoin losing dominance because of this impasse.  Some time in early August, if things don't change, bitcoin will no longer be the dominant cryptocurrency.

I'm telling you right here and now.  Remember this.  If this impasse isn't broken by early August bitcoin will lose it's dominant position forever...around 100 days.
