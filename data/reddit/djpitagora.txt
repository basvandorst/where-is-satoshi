I agree with this. If the stock markets go down, crypto will go down to, so don't wish it to happen

it holds for 2014 as well. For years before 2013 there is no data on CMC....

Am I a horrible person if only invested what I afford to loose, made a shitton of money and now enjoy the drama of the "crash" drinking noob tears from a wine glass?
I think I going to burn in hell...
Hold, always hold!

Like all reddit communities, this one is an echo chamber as well. The up vote and down-vote features of reddit make it impossible for controversial content to surface up. It's the same with all reddit boards, not something related to bitcoin. Take everything you read on reddit and facebook with a grain of salt and remember the content is tailored to either your interest or interest of your community. It will be a distorted view of the reality that reinforced what you already know (or think you know). 
Sad fact of modern internet.

it's just like with socker teams: the winning teams have many fans. Once they stop winning they loose their fans. These people are not true believers and will shift their attention like a flock of sheep depending what the media sais and what is popular. You don't want to be seen doing something not popular now do you?

the problem is the context has changed so much, the article is no longer relevant in any way. If you did that study now you'd get radically different results. Re-posting old news is just stupid. Worse then spam or lies.
