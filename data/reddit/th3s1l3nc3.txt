Oh wow. I was trying to make this fit in with market orders. That's why I was struggling to make sense if it. So if I don't intend on holding USD in Bitifnex or trade on a margin, I wouldn't need to be concerned too much with this?

It's an opinion piece from someone who has working knowledge. What facts would you like to see? Especially when he's making speculation about the future of an entirely new tech. Please present an actual argument, not just flipent criticism with no foundation. 
And don't attack grammatical mistakes. That's the weakest go to for petty arguments. I knew from the first error he wasn't a native speaker. So writing on a topic this technical with that level of coherence is impressive. Attacking that only makes you seem less capable.

Thank you both! I posted my question somewhat hastily. Should always sleep on it before posting...it avoid posting late at night.

Wait, is this it? Seems maybe, but looks different.

Thank you! I had kind of brushed off the HF stuff, assuming it wouldnt change, but then all this made me wonder. I'm just going to hold tight for now. But a few on the cheap.

So I know we can't know for sure, but is it likely the new regs in China or the business with BU. I'm a bit behind, but I know that a new version of Bitcoin is being debated and they are taking votes that show somewhat even divide. Is the potential for a new bitcoin driving people to sell already?
