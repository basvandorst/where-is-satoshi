If they keep going down this road, they won't have bigger blocks. 
Segwit gives them bigger blocks, which gives them far more earnings potential when LN arrives.

Take a wild guess which one Roger and Jihan will go for.

If you read vinny's article, you'd see that it isn't about BU taking over, but BU creating an altcoin that is mistaken for bitcoin. 
Why in the world would anyone think BU would call itself anything other than "the real bitcoin" ?
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:59:10
Fine, then how about wall street, Chinese traders, Japan, and everyone else who isn't on R/bitcoin but would want to try bitcoin out or invest in it?

Good research. Not completely sold yet on the brand takeover argument, but I haven't heard a better classification.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:17:30
You might find that option a tad expensive.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:28:54
Of course not. Here is the benefits page: 
If anything it should make your system more stable, but the larger blocks may take up more hard drive space.

Fees will be smaller, but there is absolutely no stopping one of the 6 lightning networks from deploying later this year which will make fees smaller anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:28:55
Satoshi style? You mean the lightning network, which Satoshi invented?

We'll see miners grow wings and fly long before they upgrade to any version of bitcoin with larger blocks, including BU &amp; Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:44:16
Don't worry, it's an MLM scheme pumping their price:

Is the famous list that didn't include any of the 100+ segwit upgraded-companies from the bitcoincore.org segwit adoption page? 
You know those companies had to add themselves to the list via github, right?

What he said.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:42:56
Tell your grandma that.

Sadly, there are no intelligent people to reason with anymore over on r/btc. Just sockpuppets and Buttcoiners who all want to see bitcoin die.

For seeds? I thought that was just Pin

* Step 1. Start up a new bitcoin business in Japan
* Step 2. List your company's IPO (It's apparently cheap &amp; easy on JPX)
* Step 3. Profit
Everybody'll be doing it before long.

That's a feature, not a guarantee.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:56:24
Are you kidding? I'm going to sell now and buy back at $0.5!
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:57:16
Scary as in "What can I possibly do with all this money?" 
Yeah, terrifying.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:42:36
I understand and I know a lot of the investor world feels the same way... But nowhere in Satoshi's writings did he allude to a stable value storage... It's only stable in that govt can't take it over... But market forces are in full effect and the market won't like the split very much.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:58:42
If the segwit chain wins, there is no doubt going to be a huge rebound from all the bitcoin believers picking up super-cheap coins, but first all the whales and institutions are going to rush out like bitcoin just caught herpes.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:10:09
I welcome this. It would make every hardware and mobile wallet create an option to make a duress pin/rubberhose option overnight.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:44:46
Basically the same thing, but on the operating system level.
Assange wrote it before Wikileaks.

Oooh, BRB, suddenly I feel the need to create a 1000-word Seed.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:34:36
This is a myth. The price is going to fall 90% before and during the split. Maybe 99%. Maybe even 100%.  This isn't Ethereum, this split will matter.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:32:22
If the world sees two bitcoins, neither will ever recover. Satoshi will have lied to them all when he said there would only be 21m coins. Why would investors believe in any cryptocurrency after being so betrayed?
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:35:33
Yay! Instead of 1x $2900 coin we'll all have 2x $0.5 coin.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:12:59
Wow, that's some cheap power they've got up there. 
Now... Are these Bitmain chips or Bitfury? (Or avalon?)
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:50:07
That's crazy. The dip could literally go to $1 if there are two Bitcoins and the world can trade them. 
At that point, all the investors in the world who still think in terms of stocks and splits will see that Bitcoin's creator lied to them about the 21m limit, that Bitcoin just split to 42m coins, and who knows how many next year.
ALL cryptocurrencies could fall below $1 with that revellation.
This is beyond risky. It's like playing russian roulette with five bullets in your gun.

You know what's going to feel far worse, OP?
In five more years you're going to be reminiscing once again on the same topic. You'll come across this very thread and say to yourself, "Holy sh!t! I was complaining about having missed the boat when bitcoin's price was only $2,500!.. Wish I would have bought some back then..."
At that time, a single millibit might be worth $2,500 each. It'll feel even worse because you're aware of your previous regret now in 2017... That's a lot of time to let the regrets boil.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:20:52
I didn't get that memo... The one that says you're the boss of me.
Afraid I'll say something you don't want to hear?
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:36:11
He's got great understanding of the inner workings of bitcoin, but he's an academic and comes from the Keynesian school of economics... Kind of impressive that he liked bitcoin as much as he did with that understanding of money.

Grrrr..... Removing app now.

Newegg's got nice mics.
I hear they dropped bitcoin in canada though; don't know if they dropped it worldwide, but they were like the 2nd major retailer to accept bitcoin so I'd think they won't until it's impossible to accept bitcoin.
