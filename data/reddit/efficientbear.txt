Right timing and mass adoption, basically. Nobody will tell you that Javascript is anywhere close to the best designed language out there. And yet everybody uses it because the effort it would take to switch to anything else is inconceivable.

You raise a great point, but you're implicitly assuming that the economy is homogenous, and it's not. In a perfect world, the best currency for a particular part of the economy will be used only for that part of the economy.
On one extreme, suppose that the Bitcoin dominates fiat in every way. Then fiat falls out of use and the stable price of Bitcoin is proportional to the global economy.
On the other extreme, suppose that the world stops caring about Bitcoin except for some people on the dark web. Then the stable price of Bitcoin is proportional to the value of drugs/illicit items sold in the world.
Anywhere in between, the "stable" price of Bitcoin is proportional to products that are easier to buy with Bitcoin than fiat. How "stable" this equilibrium is, of course, is the question.

You have the right idea. If you happen to work at a job that pays in Bitcoin for some reason, then your employer would probably directly send you the money via the same channel as you said.
If not, I have to imagine there will be exchanges that can "refill" your channel in exchange for fiat WITHOUT making an on chain transaction. Doing so would be far cheaper than setting up a new channel.
TL;DR If you have like a month's worth of spending money now and your spending habits don't change too much, there's no reason you can't theoretically use one channel for the rest of your life.

Same reason Javascript is the language of the internet. Also Bitcoin is by far the best name.
