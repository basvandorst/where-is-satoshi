But don’t your vendor or whoever accept your payment request higher payment in bitcoin, because Bitcoin’s purchasing power is now worth noticeably less?  
Unless you live in a fully self sufficient community that deal exclusively in Bitcoin... I’m not aware that such thing exist.

Serious question: How does one have access to cryptocurrency in Venezuela?  
As far as I know (from reading the VenezuelaUpdate subreddit), access to the internet is very limited.  
And how do you get crypto? I would assume the rate of  Bolivar to Bitcoin is completely bonker. Do any exchange accepts bolivars?  Can you go to the bank and say I want to turn my Bolivars into Bitcoin?    
Pardon me for drawing a conclusion before an answer. But it seems to me that the kind of people who have access to bitcoins, are the kind of people who have access to dollars in the first place. Which render the point moot.
 Dollars is in extremely, extremely high demand in Venezuela. You would be better off keeping your government distributed dollars and buy stuff with it, than having to take several extra steps and use bitcoin (which the vendor, should they accept it, will probably immediately convert it back to dollars).

Someone explain why is blockchain tied to Bitcoin?  My measly knowledge of blockchain tell me that any organization can create their blockchain system for database/transactional purpose without needing a publicly traded tokens?

Black markets, illicit activities, make shift currencies for countries where economies went down the shitter? What other uses for cryptocurrency is there right now?  
Nevertheless those will definitely not support the current price level caused by speculation bubble.

Then you might have lived a very privileged life to not notice the negatives effect a profitable criminal enterprise have on your community’s and yourself.  And no I’m not talking about your typical mom and pops growing weed in their backyard, I’m talking drug cartels who would butcher anyone who gets in the way of their profit and hang the victim mutilated corpse on display.  
Or perhaps you are one of such filthy criminals.

Easy for you to say.
