The cost per transaction is not fixed. It depends on the rate of exchange, and the cost of electricity, and the difficulty, which can go down too. The difficulty calculation and the miners form an equilibrium such that it is marginally profitable to mine. We know how much each transaction costs already because we pay miner’s fees. As the number of transactions per 10min block increases, so will the transaction fees decrease accordingly. Again this is a well thought out equilibrium which slowly offloads from block reward to fee weighted as the block reward is reduced over time.
As for your environmental concerns, stop comparing bitcoin to a fantasy international monetary system which apparently does everything bitcoin does with no energy use at all; and start comparing it to the combined energy consumption of legacy banking all over the world.

If Bitcoin was suddenly made worthless by some unknown means, the miners would simply stop running their machines since it would be economic suicide spending all that electricity. Once that happens, no bitcoin can move as there will be no miners to make the blocks, which would truly render them worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:50:47
Not necessarily, no. 
It’s an equilibrium.
What you mean, I think, is that if there’s no block reward, the fees must add up to pay the miner enough to entirely incentivise them to continue. True.
Does that mean that there must be millions of transactions on each block? No.
Scenario one: mass adoption; millions of transactions all pay a fraction of a penny fees, miners still get $200,000 per block. Mining difficulty will be such that it costs around $180,000 of electricity to mine each block. So mining is marginally profitable.
Scenario two: minimal adoption; hundreds of transactions all pay a few cents fees. Miners get $100 per block. Mining difficulty will be such that it costs around $90 of electricity to mine each block. So mining is marginally profitable.
The system is designed to continue perpetually like this, which is how it was able to come from nothing to what we have now. The incentive structure is beautiful, isn’t it?

@_date: 2017-12-11 13:59:49
To add to and correct this. The mining block reward exists for two reasons:
1. To incentivise miners during the period where there are not enough transaction fees to do so on their own.
2. To distribute new money into the system in a self preserving fashion, rewarding the maintenance of the system.
Coin distribution is not democratic. Mining pools and specialized hardware were envisaged at the time of the white paper, and do not mess with this distribution mechanism at all. Everything works beautifully.

I hope one day we don't need charities, and rather we can donate directly to either the hospitals (to pay doctors to treat the unwell) or those in need of direct financial aid. What unsettles me about organised charities is that there are a bunch of employees who's employment relies on the problem their charity seeks to fix persisting. Obviously this doesn't apply to all charities, but does anyone else think that some charities may be upholding the status quo?
As an entirely fabricated example: instead of donating to a charity which helps starving children in a coffee producing area of the world, in my mind it would be better for that same money to be spent on more expensive - but fair trade - coffee from that region, which would enable the parents to feed their own children by making a fairer wage.

Bitcoin is a system which secures electronic payments by making them publicly verifiable by broadcasting a giant list of all historic transactions. The ownership of Bitcoin is defined by the existence of an incoming transaction to an address you have generated, because this allows you to authorise a transaction which sends it to another address. This only works because it's impossible to fake this ownership, and the system itself economically insentivises people who maintain the rules.

Right. Otherwise you could get a market failure. The currency market requires a learned user base in order to be efficient at allocating resources to the best currency. At the moment it may be the case that resources are being transferred to the currency which best facilitates the needs of the user base: short term profits, and perpetual upside. So the winner is the currency which is easiest to buy in a bull run and hardest to sell in a downturn. Price goes down? Make sure the crowd can’t move.
Oh - I think just stumbled upon why small blocks work.
(Coming from someone who encourages all forks of bitcoin.) Perhaps this is the strategy small block advocates are actually in favour of? People can slowly buy “up the stairs” but then when there’s a flash crash “down the elevator”, the bulk of hodlers can’t afford to move their money. So the “damage” is mitigated. So if you’re competing with a very liquid (shall not be named) currency, you’re more likely to rack up market cap and avoid losing it. Hmm. So whilst crypto is predominantly used as an investment vehicle, bitcoin will win. If crypto is ever used as a day to day currency, then another will win.
Whether you can call uneducated investors a “market failure” I suppose is a valid question. I’d certainly say that we’re not selecting for good  currency currently, we’re selecting for good investment.

I'd say that the value of an idea is in its implementation. An idea alone is worth practically nothing. The skills, knowledge, network of people, and capital required to implement your idea is what she brought in terms of value. Also she took the risk. So if you think the idea itself is worth something, then why not set up a competing organisation?
It's kind of like modern art. Some people might say "I could have painted that - it's just a splodge!" It's the people who risk failure by doing things that are rewarded. Clearly you're a smart person - so have a think and actually risk something next time. "Go do." is a fairly common entrepreneurial phrase where I'm from.

Yeah, I didn't miss that at all. I guess we just have different perspectives. Implementation for me would include in a business sense, rather than just in the code sense. There would be 0 inventive for someone to steal a project which had been successfully implemented as a business. She clearly thought she could do better without you. If you had set up properly, then she may have then set up competition and beaten the original dev team anyway. If they're still convinced she did the wrong thing then they should proceed regardless.

There is no non technical way to do it with a simple link anymore because of the competitiveness of "earning" (mining) bitcoin.
You may be interested in "cloud mining" - google it - which involves paying a specialist for a share of their mining hardware and management. This would "earn" you bitcoin via mining indirectly.
As others have mentioned, it is often more economical to simply buy bitcoin from others.
One of the best things you could do is sell your own services or products for bitcoin.
Any of these options would support the Bitcoin economy more than you attempting to solo-mine, which is as you've mentioned - a raping of GPU cycles for zero return.

Interesting thought. I've been trying to figure this out myself. Higher velocity is almost like an inflationary effect right?
The thing is, pretty sure this is the good type of inflationary effect: One controlled not by government or central bank or commercial bank, but by the actual free market demand for money. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 11:33:41
The good type of inflationary effect I was referring to, works as follows:
Imagine a certain percentage of all Bitcoin was sitting as a store of value (exactly the case). There are a certain amount of goods and services in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the remaining bitcoin are chasing these services. Overall this is supposed to be considered "low velocity" because the hoarded Bitcoin has a low velocity which drags the average down.
Now assume that there is a sudden uptick in the amount of goods and services in the system, some service that the hoarders want. They then spend into the economy those dormant coins; velocity goes up. This may have a slight inflationary effect because you could imagine the pot of fluid money has now increased to include those until recently hoarded coins.
It's good inflation because the amount of fluid coin goes up with the amount of goods and services, so the purchasing power doesn't go down.
If gold is the only product on the market then this is the equivalent of:
10 bars of gold chased by 10 liquid Bitcoin and 10 hoarded Bitcoin. Some more gold ore is mined and smelted into one additional bar, and one hoarded Bitcoin becomes liquid. One bar of gold still sells for one Bitcoin.

Reduction in number of nodes could be correlated as opposed to caused-by block size. Block size will not just jump right up if we hard fork to increase the limit. It's been gradually increasing as more transactions occur per block. So it's likely to cause no additional strain on current nodes, but rather allow the continuation of a gradual (volatile but fairly linear) increase of block size over time. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:04:18
Perhaps I should've used the word "robust" or the phrase "resistant on an open network". It's robust enough that you don't need a pressure sealed PVC pipe with fibre running through it.

I think wars before fiat currencies were about control over a tax base. The more people within your realm, the more tax money you'd get. So the incentive to capture a neighbouring Kingdom was to collect more tax.
I imagine if we all start to use bitcoin, we'd have the power to collectively refuse to pay taxes, since we'd be the only ones with our private keys, which would reduce the incentive for other states to capture us. Everyone gradually moving into bitcoin means gradually removing the government's control over your purchasing power. So they'll have to start asking for tax, rather than just inflating the currency. When you have to ask for tax, and enough people say "no", the system collapses. So when there's no tax system then wars to capture States of people become fairly pointless. Hence I think with mainstream bitcoin there'd be less war.

Bitcoin only seems like a waste of resources right now because of its tiny usage, but since it's already the most secure system in all existence (are we agreed on that at least?) it could easily take on a large percentage of financial transactions in the world without requiring much more electricity. Which would make it far more efficient than current financial system - if you think about moving cash and gold and powering ATMs and SWIFT data centres etc.

If there's no currency then nothing incentivises fair play by each individual courthouse. Defeats the point of proof of work. Might as well just use a shared google doc.

How would you prevent malicious individuals from participating in this private blockchain? Bitcoin is secure because you can't compete with the network. A small private network could be overthrown with sufficient mining power. If there's no currency as a reward then difficulty will remain low and attacks would be possible.

Real actual bitcoins, of course. Keeping them in cold storage predominantly.

Managing risk is what actual money managers do. I am not one of them. All my "I can live without this" money is in bitcoin because I am willing to risk it all for a greater potential return. High risk high reward. I'm making an educated bet. It's not exactly gambling, because the result is not random, but it is high risk.

Why have you been down voted so much? Circle provides insured reserves I believe.

Trending does not equal volatility. Larger market cap needs more cash to move the price. Or rather, if the price moves $25 today that's a 10% move. If it moves $25 when the price is $2500 per coin, that's only a 1% move. ie less volatility assuming the same liquidity.
That's how I understand it from a layman perspective - Have I got this roughly right?
@_date: 2016-05-11 06:58:45
Thanks for your comment. I haven't heard it put so concisely before. This. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:03:12
How would you control who participated? Couldn't someone just steal someone's login details through phishing or whatever and take down the network with minimal effort?
Whereas since Bitcoin is open to anyone it's security is simply through huge hash rate and elliptical curve cryptography? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:57:33
Yes, I'm awaiting my debit card.

What makes you think current efforts to increase adoption and take Bitcoin mainstream are aimed solely at men? I don't think I would approach women any differently on the topic. Why treat any gender differently?

I'm intrigued by this problem. Debt in a bitcoin world. The interest within a fixed money supply problem means you can't really do that. I think I'd lend my Bitcoin to someone more productive in exchange for a % share of profits. So if the company fails. I lose my money. But if you do this with enough companies simultaneously with risk management, then hopefully successful businesses would outstrip the unsuccessful ones.
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:10:20
I would still argue against bitcoin's price being unpredictable. Difficult to predict with accuracy, and volatile due to small market cap, sure. For example I predict that tomorrow it will cost $245 give or take $10. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:07:48
Wow. Excellent explanation. Thanks! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-03-19 23:54:36
The person who stole the bitcoin applied the correct math to gain control of those bitcoin. BTCe and fiat currencies exchanges are a different matter.

Ooops I'm a bit of a reddit n00b still - should've tipped you both. Don't know how to tip to the original author and still think you deserve a tip for bringing the information to our attention here. Feel free to pass it on!
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:57:06
I was trying to point out that bitcoin is regulated by math, and btce is not.
Furthermore, if we reduce the previous comment to "Bitcoin stolen - how is that regulated by math?" Then it is perhaps clearer how absurd the question is.
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:29:18
I'm not at all saying drugs are good. Clearly they're not. Yes they can kill you. The argument is that people will buy drugs anyway and that service reduced the violence by separating the parties exchanging physically.

I think it's safe to say the USD will not be the global reserve currency much longer. Given historical period of reserve currencies.

That's not news, rather a position which some hold. Depends how you define 'fiat'.

Also. I believe that imprisonment for trading certain vegetables freely between consenting adults is immoral.
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:12:27
That's an interesting position. Why does Bitcoin interest you?
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:47:53
The world is changing anyway - Bitcoin is one of a handful of technological innovations upon which we will build civilisations in the future. Probably the most important single invention.
To give an alternate opinion, perhaps the problem is a lack of vision and imagination on the part of some members of this community. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 00:13:24
You're missing the point. Selling drugs should not be a crime in the first place - all he did was facilitate trade. "Laundering money" suggests you think voluntary exchange between consenting adults is morally wrong. It's not.
That's why he's a martyr. He was imprisoned for providing liquidity to a market which was reducing violence usually caused by drug trades in the streets. He did something which was illegal but not morally wrong. He's no criminal - but a moral agent in a corrupt world.
Or at least that's what I think based on the information I have read. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 00:01:30
Needs more upvotes. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:35:00
You're conflating stuff which is illegal with stuff which is immoral. Guns and drugs can be exchanged without it being immoral. Two parties want to exchange. No violence. Child porn and human trafficking on the other hand are obvious breaches of the non aggression principle. Both are forced on victims and are therefore immoral.
I agree we cannot just go on the interpretation of individuals what should and shouldn't be illegal. That's why we should instead rely on universal moral principles like the NAP.

I believe all inputs are spent. Whatever the difference between total inputs subtract total output, is considered the miner free.

Limited supply definitely. I'm trying to avoid buzz words like decentralised and permissionless because they don't tend to mean much to muggles.

I am making the (above) claim, based on those premises, you can deduce what it would do: online marketplace reduces likelihood of violence. I don't know how else to put this more clearly.
Would you agree to the aforementioned premises?
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:50:12
Agreed, yes. I was referring to a transaction - rather than a wallet. My mistake.

@_date: 2016-07-31 19:15:19
Not that I mind necessarily, but you didn't answer my question. Should I put forward the premises again, or would you prefer to end the discussion?

Can you elaborate on this? One of the subscribers to the podcast always talks up Rothbard. Was he the "one way helicopter ride" guy in South America? Dumping people in the sea for disagreeing with him?

Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed and all encompassing reply. Wonderful. I noticed a possible error. Just one tiny detail. End of paragraph two. Ten millionths should read "hundred millionths" as a Satoshi is 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin.

This is the same exact data with different multipliers because they are in "1971 dollars". They are just laying those graphs over each other. This is not the same as the Bitcoin fractal price. It's three ways of drawing the same data.
I also think his might be a joke... But I don't know.

I only ask if you agree to those premises? If so then we are in agreement that the Silk Road reduced violence. I'm willing to hear any arguments against so we may arrive at convergent truth.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:32:49
Agreed. He's a legend. I'd rather link to his content than try to regurgitate it though. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 19:05:33
You don't need proof for an argument to make sense. It's deductive:
Some drug deals go bad.
In-person conflict can get violent; Internet conflict cannot.
Therefore one Internet drug deals are less violent than in-person ones.
Thoughts?
