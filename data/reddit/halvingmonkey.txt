Two guys are high-fiving each other a Yahoo. “We got a click!?”

Thanks for the heads up. I'm overseas now and I need fiat to sustain myself. How was it living off pure cards?
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:40:32
Isn't it the same company?
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:48:11
Maybe I'll retweet myself one day. Till then, I won't retweet till it's incentivized for satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:41:49
I'll try to do a week, month and maybe beyond if I don't break. The surges are great arbitrage against fiat, but that's where the gambling comes into play. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:12:45
They already have.

I keep hearing about this service. Do I have to work within the limits of swift?
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:43:37
There's actually no risk. If I sell fiat for bitcoin to withdraw within a span of 1 hour there's very little risk. I'm not a noob. I'm only vesting any new coin purchases to live off; I'm done hodling, I have enough.

Muther****ers. I do wire so it's not terrible. I'll keep a look out. Thanks for the tip. 
Edit: can't edit my swear. So fuck it all to hell.

I'm actually paid in dollars. My agenda is to live solely on my side income. Overall, the long-term goal is to ween my entire salary on to bitcoins and pay taxes through a cooperative. That's another story for another day.

Longest one is sitting on 60 hours with a low priority fee. The medium priority (~$4+) is about 30 hours. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:44:23
If we click all their ads. Will they go away? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:25:58
Exactly. 55 hours for low and 32 hours for priority 2 blocks ago. We will know what to expect next time around. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:38:53
TA upvote. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:53:47
There are about 70k pending transaction and if you pay a higher fee—back to the end of the line for us. I have one with 24 hours and it is a nightmare.

The problem is capital control. Especially with SWIFT abandonment a likely response to the sanctions.

They finally did something. So they invented HTTP 402, get paid tasks, and monetize APIs?

I still have a lot of respect for his commentary on the housing bubble. This made him very credible and his agenda is clearly to sell more gold and he doesn't trade what he does not understand. Someone should explain how mining works and the parallels.

I see them on YouTube in Spain all the time. I click to make them go away.

The mascot looks like he already has his hand in my pocket.

Lesson of the day. Have more LTC to switch between clogged networks. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:44:08
VHS or Beta?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:40:42
Yes. You can do it in google app script or use JSON API script to bring it in. The refresh is too slow and you will likely need a custom JSON connector to have a 1 minute refresh.

I'm building my wife a powerpoint to address some of the same concerns. It would be a matter of setting up a 3rd party that has your private keys...
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:27:50
That is like putting unleaded gas into a sports car. Try a hardware wallet. I am always paranoid about losing my phone and I only carry dust around.

Needs more red arrows.
