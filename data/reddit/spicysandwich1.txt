When i first bought bitcoin i was clueless about the drama until i started reading some news articles and then on reddit. This was a huge turnoff so i went to ETH instead, but turns out drama is everywhere in crypto.  I actually find it interesting now, but not sure outsides woukd think so.

@_date: 2019-04-25 15:07:51
I’m just saying that watching the price day to day is pointless for most if the year, even if it jumped it could go back down to 4200 and its not really that interesting until we break 6k
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:25:03

Might not happen this year unless there is significant news like an ETF or Baakt or something else. More likely later this year or next year. Either way i think we will test it multiple times before breaking it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:13:52
It’s actually amazing that only one person in the world claims to be satoshi without proof, you would think there would be more nutcases
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:32:59
The more I think about it, I think Dave Klein is probably Satoshi and worked with Craig Wright. This is how Craig has knowledge of certain things and since Dave is dead Craig's ego and greed have taken over to try and claim it as his own.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:55:05
so we're all selling at 6k?
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:12:11
Wouldn't the U.S Govt seize the bitcoin and then auction them off?
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:32:12
But it is r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:58:10
no. no one wants to be craig wright (except roger ver).
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:59:06
Is there anyone that actually beleives he’s satoshi?
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:26:26
Maybe gifting it to yourself

None of the people I know will touch it now that its dropped so low, the visions of getting rich quick are gone from their minds. They dont understand market cycles because they dont want to spend time learning and researching. Once its back up these same people will be back with dollar signs in their eyes.

Only bullish predictions are upvoted
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:14:52
Is it increasing?
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:22:11
All it takes is one whale or a few
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:58:14
I wonder why he doesn’t give up already
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:12:27
How much does it cost to do this?
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:43:06

@_date: 2019-05-20 17:50:32

Every TA i read said it would go back to 4200 before going up. TA is useless and people should stop trying to predict with it.

@_date: 2019-05-13 21:18:38
is it ever going to stop or is this the bitcoin train?
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:49:43
I would've liked to see Tyrion kill Dany with a crossbow and Jon take the throne. Samwell always believed in Jon and doesn't seem right to see Samwell without Jon. Brienne would be queen beyond the wall and live with Tormund. Bran would be one of the council members. Tyrion would be hand. Bronn should've died, he doesn't deserve a seat. Arya would join the nights watch.  Sansa would be at winterfell.
