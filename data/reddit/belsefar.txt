Too biased for me. I prefer. A more objective perspective so I can form my own opinion:

Fiat has an actual value because people get paid in BTC for their work and services. This is key and why the fuck noone talks about it is a mystery to me. Noone gets their paycheck in BTC except traders and miners. Which means the value is based upon mining and trading, spiced up with speculation. I hate the principles behind fiat, but the religious lack of criticism on BTC is just as stupid. Because the technology is there doesn't make it valuable. Practical usage and real commercial exchange in services and commodities is valuable. That every dude who dreams of the moon shoves money into a market doesn't give it real value, just market cap.

How long did you trade? Why did you choose to stop? How much better is your performance now?
Do you have an exit strategy in case of a heavy bear market? Everyone has got to break at some point, I mean one thing is to hold in a bull market another is a bear.

How are people supposed to keep their BTC when they lose their job and need food? In 08 they sold everything even their house to survive in a fucking tent.

Con? Seems to suck at it in that case.

What is your profit strategy/target? HODLing in a bull market is easy but why hold in a bear market instead of taking some profit during the bull and buy cheap during the bear?

Am I the only one who thinks Trump looks like Owen Wilson's doucebag brother?

Seems dodgy from first impression. Didn't con me.

What about ethfinex?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:07:50
I was genuinely interested in learning from your change in strategy
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:55:12
because BTC is taken.

Anything to back this up? Nothing?

Christ this is a cluster fuck. You would think that the people who do a 'hard fork' had communicated a clear decision on the damn ticker before going public - not on the 1st of fucking August. This is a joke.

Maybe. In any case they should be firm on their execution strategy.

1. What sources do you have any sources to back your claims?
2. Do you follow others claims?
3. Was these questions specific enough?
Like you said don't follow, ask your own questions - see above. That way I can check wether your claims are valid and shape my own opinion and decisions instead of following yours. Pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:38:32
Avoiding an answer and contradicting yourself is not exactly strengthening your  argument. I call bullshit, your claims could be based upon interest in BTC price increase, you might as well be hired by the Chinese government to FUD - pump and dump for all I know.

When I lived there from 2010-2013 many used Lire - their old currency. Larger stores in Florence had signs that said "we don't take lire" because people litteraly pulled them out of their mattresses. In the south this was even more common.
