I hope you are right. I doubt you are though.
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:54:52
wait,it's a store of value!! Just absolutely shit at it!
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:44:23
zzzzz.. ouch
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:04:59
just seen the rise in fees today... I hope they do not factor in these when considering the network effects?
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:01:11
yeah, throw me a BILLION DOLLARS and I'll manipulate things too... have you not noticed how easily BTC is manipulated?? HELLOOOOO.. its wide open to abuse and you are worrying about some other alt coin.. ffs what planet are you from?
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:51:32
that's not it mate.. stroll on, maybe you'll understand one day when you you've finished telling your Aunt that your smarter than her...

the Whales are lazy that is all, they chew off a the odd 100 million tether when they want and drain it out of crypto.. Wall street shorts just go along for the ride and do the dirty work... no biggie.. just the way it is..

Can't wait for the second coming : The Lightning Network Miracle.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:27:05
They cant face it. The truth is ugly but LN adds up to zero... BTC has become a useless bubble. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:38:47
not if you bought at 18K... 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:01:25
but far less brains :P
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:50:35
I doubt it mate. What do you teach, out of interest? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:46:03
what like Bcash is incorrect? It should be "BCH". Don't be a pedantic nerd..
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:47:53
if only... 
are you Nick the Crypto Dick?
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:17:27
hodling his life away.. probably sold his house to buy at $20K on the advice of the fuckwits on this reddit
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:02:14
oh so they created bitcoin, did they? Hallelujah, I did not know THAT!  it is open source.. anyone can use/copy it.. thats the whole point, this is not microsoft but it sounds like you want it to be
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:18
segwit and small blocks good luck with that, LN is the laughing stock of the digital engineers world. Things move on, you should too.. no disrespect.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:07
have you considered that you might be the simple one? lots to play out here. BCH have already duped Bitcoin Core.. where is the fabled Lightning Network? It is bs, watch the fuckwits on youtube.. there's nothing there. Bitcoin is supposed to be usable by everyone, not just a load of rich, stupid, obese and bigoted Americans
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:28:49
your prediction don't mean shit man.. i got 6375 already and it goin down dude.. more
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:17:16
a religion is a cult.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:04:52
well not many of the posters on here would get that far, would they? Basically, he called their bluff, LN is a fairytale atm (though many on here think it will solve the worlds problems), BTC needs to scale and Blockstream won't let it because their business model is inadequate, protectionist and inflexible. I don't know who will will succeed, but do you think Bitcoin can hold out until LN arrives? The crypto world is evolving very quickly. My bet is that Blockstream will cobble a 2mb upgrade together in the next three months.. If not could be another enron., seriously
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:04:59
forget it mate, bunch of fools and their cronies post on here. At least they talk some sense on r/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:50:53
I think you'll discover he's way smarter than that and has made bitcoin core look like a bunch of zeros. If you can't see it I pity you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:40:00
because you are an idiot
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:32:10
lap it up boys, and rearrange those deck chairs while you're at it...
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:08:34
as if the Koreans are even awake right now. Face facts man, you are in denial
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:12:29
I think everybody here is buying snake oil or at least trying to sell it at the highest price... I have no scam but I can see the market for what it is, and you cannot, and atm BTC looks vulnerable and LN looks like a show that even Ronald Macdonald would turn down. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:26:21
already called it dude. Just wondering if its worth another punt? Not that sure it has the legs atm, its been a very good week;) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:14:08
laughable.. took this long to admit you needed banks to pay all the transactions before going to the chain.... bunch of f
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:18:32
you should dump btc before it crashes .. you need to trade man, not think that btc is your momma.. btc is way over  priced?? if you guys cant see that ... wtf can you see?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:51:39
Ok ask yourself; 1mb blocks, VERY high fees, Very slow network, potential secondary, sorry, tertiary settlement layer (with no end in sight),  horrific levels of power consumption, just to buy a coffee or buy something on amazon. What is the point? BTC was supposed to be for everyone, it's been hijacked and for WHAT? Btc could be the next Enron.
