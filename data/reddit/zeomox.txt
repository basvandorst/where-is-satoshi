yup, getting tired of being stressed.
I was looking for a time toe invest more, but I think I may have missed it... or not...
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:13:31
Ya, exactly! not to seem TOO /conspiracy BUT... I call  
There is ABSOLUTELY some thing wrong with this. Can "they" track your BTC when bought through an ATM? links the address to your card? Something like that maybe?
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:24:51
So... this is the importance of having a Crypto USB key (or computer with a wallet) at home ?
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:44:27
IMHO: I'll expand on your question,why don't people believe more in "crypto currency"? That's what people need to think about. I suspect something LIKE Bitcoin; either with a more clever name (or marketing budget), maybe even a quantum computer block-chain something-or-other, will rise to the surface and become the supreme global digital credit.   
Don't get TOO hung up on BitCoin... yes, it's the first, it's the best (so far) BUT it certainly won't bet the last.

Banks... yes, politicians... no. They're only going to merge into a one world government... due to our one world currency...bitcoin!

!!! YAAAAAASSSSS!!!!  
Okay, when do I sell now?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:34:30
That's the worst part. Missed the train, BUT the next best time is now. :)

Madness, what is happening!?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:11:20
LOL Ya, there's a couple more "wallets" I've got on the go. Not planning on giving up a REAL address. Unless I'm getting some donations. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:57:43
Well, looks like I'm an idiot. Excellent.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:51:03
My next question: What's the best way to buy the "other" currencies? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:08:28
This. This is great advice! My gut says I'm taking BitCoin to the movies (so I'll invest $20). No big deal, for now...
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:53:24
I hear you there. I'll be watching this thread. Would also like to throw some bucks at something with a 30ish years.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:47:12
I dying here! I can't find a way to buy either PPC of LTC or even start to mine them! I feel like I'm running behind the wagon yelling, "Here! Take my money and let me on board!" so close but can't get it figured out! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:38:22
Sounds like I should buy $5 in each of them...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:05:00
My dad keeps talking me out of it, 2010, 2011, three times in 2013 now. I only bought in small, I'm pretty peeved. This could have REALLY helped my family out had I just followed my instinct. Is it to late? Over $600? Are we really going to make it to $1000 or am I stupid in hoping this?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:06:25
Good call. Stick it in your ear dad! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:10:29
Right on! This is exactly what I'm talking about. So I want to also consider other "virtual currency" options. What's the differnce between, say, Litecoin and Peer-to-peer coins? If Bitcoin is accepted, will these other currencies also be accepted? Maybe I'll ask this in the spot...Ya I'll do that now...
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:28:32
OH OH! This looks good!! How'd you hear about it?! Teach us mighty Phrozt!! TEACH US!
Seriously, what's the story with this one? how does "competition in currency" work? Isn't that just USA vs CAD vs PESO?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:06:57
Good advice!
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:52:46
How much did you land with this? Look at all those tips!
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:02:01
lol peaked recently, not 8 that was supposed to be 5 years ago. Woops.
I hope they keep heading up. after some research, a half a year ago was  a great time to get in on them. 
I think I'll just stop typing as I'm clearly not in the know anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:57:40
Well said! Don't regret what you've done, regret what you HAVEN'T done!
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:28:41
So is this like a geocache? It's buried somewhere and there will be riddles to find it! i'm in! :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:27:17
Now where did you "buy a bitcoin"? There seems to be so many different bitcoin sites, which one is best? Maybe I should post this question in the stream.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:42:27
I think the best time to invest was 8 years ago. They sort of look like they've peaked. With that being said, they've started to show up as valid forms of payment in restaurants. Better then the old school drug trade so maybe they will only increase in value?
Not sure but did you read the article about the guy who bought $27 worth that's now worth over $500K? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:11:39
I'm in the same boat with you. Worst part, is I'm not sure exactly how much I actually have, but it's WELL under the 1 BTC mark.
If i have this number, how do I find what's in there/been given to me?
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:58:10
ok! Thank you! :) I didn't even know that was around. Guess I need to look at the subreddit list better next time...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:38:23
Look at that! It's all over the place here.
Seriously though, I'm not listening to my dad about it now (even though he retired at 41) I want to listen to some winners from reddit! :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:17:32
And I thank you! :) So I've been doing some digging around and it looks like a good comparison for the other currencies would be to consider them like silver and other precious metals. Still valuable but not as valuable as the BitCoin (Gold 2.0). And hearing it being called "gold 2.0" makes me want to believe it will reach $1000 or more! I'm trying to buy in but everywhere is "closed" or has hit their limits.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:08:51
That's right, it's about an additional income stream. The more the merrier!
