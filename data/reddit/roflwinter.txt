Any guesses on first companies to go bust like the early internet era ?
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:41:45
no he is opting for large companies who don't print fiat to do so. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:20:18
it also makes for great lubricant.
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:42:46
You do that soldier !
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:43:52
You're an idiot actually if you didn't see that.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:31:32
You're just mainstream. You wouldnt know.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:05:33
I just saw their testimony. What a doofus.
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:40:10

Still loving you.

@_date: 2014-10-17 16:53:30
you lack documentation ?
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:28:40
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:54:58
not misunderstanding.
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:54:55
Payza comment on this ?
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:01:26
What's familiar ?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:41:55

@_date: 2014-10-23 01:15:19
What's shady about their team?
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:23:19
You tell em bud
@_date: 2014-10-27 08:00:01


Starting with that in the past would have avoided starting with this in the present and the future.


@_date: 2014-10-26 21:55:33
Because that would be worse.
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:00:38
of course!!!
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:49:09
Its not very different than showing upto sweet16 and giving the gift of charity to the polar bear wildlife fund because it matters.
@_date: 2014-10-17 04:17:20
OMG, you know what that means! You guys should be bff!!
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:01:04
It seems OP of this particular subthread cared how regulators would react.
@_date: 2014-10-25 06:13:33
too late.
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:54:08
it is and you should be happy about it. everyone talks about NSA and it being evil, IRS and them being thieves, and the government being shills of corporations. That is the popular and mainstream thought. My thought is the minority and I am very happy to be in it. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:52:38
chill out holmes
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:47:20
If donations are hard to come by while the market is hot, have you considered that the signal is not as popular as the noise ?
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:01:22
He didn't mention anything about bitcoin. That's piece of my life I won't get back. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-07 22:56:50
Virtex or Cavirtex ?
@_date: 2014-11-07 09:21:46
that is a very long equation, what does it equal?
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:41:13
Everyday millions of dollars happen through the furniture and cereal industry, its insane. I really am into you.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:22:12

@_date: 2014-10-29 01:47:42
They are the replacement bank we have been all waiting for .
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:55:47
nah if a regulator wouldnt say those words he wouldnt be a good or bad regulator .
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:59:39
a light erection.
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:39:43
How is bitcoin purchase a non-financial instrument?
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:40:38
Tell the truth.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:59:26
Wow, you're an idiot and don't know it. True story.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:12:56
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:44:42

Who's "Mike curry"?
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:07:21
I trust Norton and McAfee. My IT guys swear by them.
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:22:33
So no public bank, did I get that right ?
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:39:03
I'd hit that.
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:30:24
Charge your phone.
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:18:45
they are. i know unpopular thought around here, but i believe it. so go ahead downvote me to hell. At least you read someone actually write that and you won't be able to unsee that that thought is still there and strong with at least one person.
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:06:33
goose and gander 
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:20:50
the coders were probably pushing for the release stressing out the bizdev guys
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:02:16

@_date: 2014-10-15 13:43:05
well this blew up
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:16:07
"We have resources that are very powerful..." He wasn't talking about bandwidth or money.

Who's "we"?
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:56:25
do ya?
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:41:08
So stop.
@_date: 2014-11-09 03:33:19
Where is "Storage", "Asset", "Government", "Commodity" or "Anarchy" ?
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:25:07
Fuck it, let's share.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:40:58
I believe the NSA does have the best interest of the country and its objectives at heart.
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:28:49
oh that is good
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:06:45
its good to be the minority and object to the mainstream.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:08:55
ya, people in Africa probably can't use bitstamp. I think that's outrageous.
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:54:00
Actually $0 are transacted through the bitcoin network. Only bitcoin is transacted through the bitcoin network. I love you.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:13:24
those bastards.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:46:23
Getting cleaned up.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:40:18
Strawman much?
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:41:59
Make more money or become poor.You'll care less.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:01:15
nope I just checked with them, you're lying. Nice try bubs.

A Bitcoin bank does not need the FDIC. It has math on its side.
@_date: 2014-10-08 00:04:04
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:54:40
THE UBER BITCOIN BANK IS OPEN!
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:45:41
that is actually not the reason. FD has nothing to do with this. Apple Pay has a larger market, Bitcoin's maket size is pitiful, it makes business sense.
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:36:09
aight laterz!
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:50:41
well...judging how you respond to adversity, I'd say they made a good call.

Let's have a legal subreddit.
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:11:00
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:27:18
no thanks, i would rather stay away from mainstream thought, and adopt a minority view for the time being. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:52:25
there is a good list here 
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:26:19
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:26:38
You've been listening to too many "What is money really?" speeches after bitcoin started getting popular.
@_date: 2014-10-12 20:52:50
Another fine troll post. You got a lot of ppl good. Well played.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:18:28
"without any marketing push"..hmm.. right.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:02:29

Good troll post. You got a few people good. Well played.
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:44:12
Lol! Oh you're golden. OK I'm done laughing. You're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:35:05
Client has a point. There is no reason for the client not to rip off and be a liability for bank accounts that are added. After all what do we know about their internals. It took us 3+years for us to hate Gox and before that we thought all was rosy...
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:03:45
Yes. Most useless of post of 2014 in . You win bro.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:08:24
A tax is by default forceful, so when you say "taxes me by force", you keep cajoling the hyperbolic, which is fine because I love you.

What are your thoughts on the Windhover Principles initiative ?
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:06:24


Its their bank, and he is a customer, and banking is not a human right, its a privilege. If you keep money with a bank, its their rules and their whims.
he doesn't like it, go elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:58:33
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:17:11
It doesn't.

in case it wasn't, I was referring to this: 
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:34:51
How come Silicon Bank has Coinbase but not Xapo?
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:07:31
All true and yet its not a right, it's a privilege.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:02:06
go have some ice cream
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:00:11
That's right! What is really?
@_date: 2014-10-08 06:48:57
anyone can get on Bloomberg to mention an acquisition...?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:52:24
