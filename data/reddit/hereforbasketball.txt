Bitcoin has no future as a currency. Best case scenario it would used like gold. RaiBlocks will become the main cryptocurrency for p2p transactions. Already experimented with it and you can complete XRB transactions in less than one second with ZERO fees whatsoever. It is the future.

I just joined Gemini and got completely verified and everything so I bought 100$ worth of coin like a week ago at $2600 and it said the buy got filled immediately and I have the coin in my account. But it says that I have a "pre credited USD deposit waiting to be fully cleared resulting in a hold on bitcoin withdrawls" so I cant withdraw anything but the money's left my bank account so idk whats going on. This ever happen to you?

$1million per coin?? Now that'd be something! So you think Etherum is a good investment as well?

What are the odds an altcoin could surpass bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:53:56
But couldn't it make sense for one day an altcoin to be created that is basically tweeked as a better version of Bitcoin and then slowly bitcoin begins to decline and this new altcoin rises until one day it's treated as the new main cryptocurrency

I just downloaded Electrum 3.0 wallet to store my coins more safely. If I keep my coins in Electrum will I automatically receive an equal amount of the new coin in Electrum as well when the November fork hits? Also I'm using Electrum on a Macbook Pro this is OK, correct?

As somebody who has little stake in Bitcoin and is completely lost in all this Segwit2x fork talk.. Can anyone let me know in laymen terms what this will do to Bitcoin? Also, if somebody wanted to invest in Bitcoin for the first time today, would it be best to buy now? Or wait til after the fork? Thanks
