Quick question: Did the removal of Net Neutrality influence the major drop in BItcoin back in December? At least through FUD, right?

OP found the real satoshi

It's going to be an up and down until it shoots up again, don't be fooled by FUD and keep calm and HODL on!

too volatile to make those long term predictions. The next couple months are what we may have a little insight to, unless its all a scheme XD...

Who knows, we may get the same pattern as last year with a spike around December and a bull run throughout the fall. But that's all speculation, I'm sure it will feel like the roller coaster we've been on one way or the other.

We don't have to be animalistic. I'm sure he's just a reg dude who was doing what he thought was right. But if he is a malevolent douche, it has yet to be determined...

I don’t think crypto can never be compared to gold, or for that matter any physical store of value. Gold will still be worth a decent amount in any currency (fiat / crypto) as its use in society is rooted in its malleability and aesthetic characteristics. Also it’s worth may even rise when no gold can be found anywhere as it’s a limited resource when crypto finally stabalizes.

I was thinking about that too

It's tax season, the dumb asses who are on their last fiats are going to be pulling out their BTC because they didn't allocate their funds correctly. Big Fish and Small fish can be the same amount of stupid.

What was the hike on April 12th. I keep looking back at the almost instantaneous jump from 6,800 - 7,700.
