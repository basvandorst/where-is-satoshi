your best bet is passive protest by learning about and using cryptocurrency
I'm willing to bet (real money - BTC) that this entire ISP/FCC bullshit scandal is because of this innovation

Has anyone calculated the total resources needed to provide this feature (quickly send many individual micro payments without saturating everything) reasonably well?
My guess is probably, I'm just too lazy to look right now.

this isn't a person that i can become liable for slander or defacement
hypotheticals are always welcome in my book, especially when it comes to my government and my money

i'm just going to copy a comment from there, since it's exactly what i need to say:


is it Wholly fraudulent? Do a little research before you write crap like that. They've shipped a huge amount of product to customers that were very happy and the product testing they did was necessary - it would have been bad business NOT to profit by the testing process... it's like telling car buyers they were ripped off because all the extra steel was recycled by Ford when they stamped out the parts for their car.

true, it should really be the customers' money since it was generated with the customers' capital
TBH I'm not sure anyone can enforce any of this test-net business  because it is a private company, i guess it would be noble and "neutral" to use test-net, but nobody knows really who is skimming that burn-in/test shit.  i would try to steer away from anything that could anger my customers and would rather use the real-net with customer addresses as i would be chastised  otherwise

why pre bastardize your own name?  the powers will reframe you well in time anyway, why make it easier on them?

i bet dollars will replace satoshis as the word we use for what we now know as satoshis so it's really only a temporary issue (give or take a few decimal places every now and then)

so our ISPs are now liable for what we do on the internet
that is interesting in itself
it's like Howl's moving castle but with no Howl so it just crumbles into a couple legs and a board

so the next time someone uses a wall hack to kill me i can sue the shit out their ISP
