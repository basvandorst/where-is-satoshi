Yeah, that sucks. I hope they'll fix it asap, bread is by far the best and best-looking btc wallet I've used. I'm sure they'll figure this out in no time. Good luck!

Had the same problem, that's what support told me to do:
1. Go to the breadwallet menu, and choose "settings"  
2. Go to "start/recover another wallet"  
3. Enter the recovery phrase for your wallet to be checked and choose "wipe" to clear the app's data (be sure to keep it carefully written down on a piece of paper as well, only you have access to this recovery phrase and it's needed to recover your wallet)  
4. Once you've verified that the app is wiped, delete breadwallet from you phone.  
5. Install breadwallet again, and upon startup choose "recover wallet" and enter your recovery phrase. Let the wallet sync to 100%, and the app must be open with screen on to sync. 
After that everything worked for a while.
Today when I checked again it showed me the wrong amount of BTCs.
So yeah, it's not only you, don't worry.
The coins should be OK, but I really hope they'll fix their app asap!

Not the same problem, but even though breadwallet synced the blockchain, the progress bar froze and it didn't show the complete history.
Have you tried reinstalling the app? That worked on my 6s plus running iOS11.0.1.
edit: contact support, they're really quick to respond and were really helpful when I contacted them
