It's as steady as most lol. USDCDN has gone from 1.6 in 02-03 to .90 in 2008 nos back to 1.35. The British Pound to USD in the last ten years, 1.40 to 2.10 and back to 1.49. I could go on...

My point was they knew what would happen, and were rewarded lavishly for it.
Also wouldn't the fed rate hike possibility on the 16th just return the dollar to a bear market and back to previous stimulus levels? Sept 03-03 .70.

I don't think we would ever have inflation, unless groups managed to amass hoards and flood markets they deemed a threat. But I can't see localized inflation like countries have now.
 I see people using BTC as leverage to loan out at the most globally competitive interest rate. A working model is supported on BFX... the rate is controlled by speculators. In the future ppl who want loans, would bid and post at what would be very low in comparison to todays bank loans. Houses, cars, goods, startups etc. would all be much cheaper as your not paying banks the insane daily interest rates and paying literally half of your 20-30 year income on interest. We could all be more productive given a system that supported ppl driven banks, via personal BTC holdings. 
You could easily argue that by holding bitcoin there would be inflation, but as we have seen already there are natural market forces that ebb and flow bitcoin already, it's not a linear progression upwards. But a real market where the question of value is determined daily, hourly and by the minute... lol if you just saw the jump today from 397 to 417.

Also, in any fib sequence be a river, or cows walking in a field or even in crowd dynamics the ratio can be calculated. And they are all very very similar. My point is Bitcoin as a money transfer solution gives ppl the path of least resistance. Whether they understand it now or later it doesn't matter. They will all one day oblige and be decentralized protocol users, as it offers them the path of least resistance. 100k per coin is doable.

No... banks hoarding the money after being given 0% interest rate loans from the fed, hoarding keeps inflation low. You actually think the banks didn't know that the credit swaps on shitty mortgages wouldn't crash the whole system. If your a banker and you engineer markets and dole out the money supply, you couldn't have asked for a more cherry situation than being bailed out and given 0% loans. Now they gamble between themselves on the forex while ppl wonder why printing trillions of dollars hasn't stimulated anything.

It's been the most rock solid exchange by far. Every attempt to DDOS the site failed. Trading is probably the fastest of all exchanges. Trading speed is huge when things start rocketing or falling. Used the site for better part of a year now, always loved it. 
If users were not happy with the site at all then it would show up in the trollbox immediately. The fact that they let each user talk to one another should tell you they are upfront.
Yes it takes two weeks to get a ticket answered sometimes. But ppl expect a corporate western approach to customer service. News flash, not everywhere has the same ideas or standards or the customers is ALWAYS right attitude. If you didn't 2FA your account your an idiot don't cry to the admins for your failures.

I Agree they are on several major gov's hit lists. Which is too bad, they have been solid for awhile now. I think secondmarket will be a game changer. Not good for the little guy as they have stated it's for accredited instituions only. But hey you can trade through banks they are partnering with... grrr
If these small exchanges can survive and thrive we all will benifit.
On the LTC issue, yea it was high when the price started surging from 60c-5$. They got a lot of flak and listened to their customer base and changed it. 
Ppl forget it's a business, they set the fees if you don't like them then change sites. They are slow, I honestly think they're out partying with the immense amount of $$ they made. 
Several days in Nov LTC and BTC' trade volume was over 100 million.

744k BTC on Gox is an absurd number. You can and always have been able to view the full order book on Gox at Clark Moody. For example right now for sale on Gox the total amount of BTC for sale on GOX is 41464 this actually is a lot for Gox to have on the books early Jan. had half that. 
If you watch Bitcoin report on you tube he keeps a very close eye on the amount of BTC left on Gox. The number is/was a good indicator for future price movements.
This story is complete FUD.

If governments around the world were smart they would accept defeat and allow bitcoin to flourish. It would be very simple I would imagine to have a business where you accept BTC and automatically have your sales tax be sent to a wallet that was issued to you in order to pay taxes.
Come tax time you would get the final tally and an accountant would easily compare and file the correct deduction or reimbursement for whatever categories they fall under.
This would save govt millions in man power and paper. 
And as a business owner save a lot of time and headaches.
