@_date: 2017-12-03 14:04:01
What site do you use to trade and how do you decide in what coins to get and when to sell them
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:20:26

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:17:29
I wouldn't recommend mining btc but the ps4 should be able to mine at around 300-400 h/s so google how to mine idk zcash or eth or ltc or something else and find other cryptocurrencys to mine and then convert to btc or just sell it for btc 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:15:51
Is the ledger offline and will it support the coin after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:52:54
Thanks man and is there a way to show both that price and he conversion to usd
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:29:07
I was saying xrp as an example but what has a cheaper fee coinbase or Gdax
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:43:54
if I use Gdax how much would I lose from fee for sending money from my ledger nano s to gdax and gdax back
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:54:31
I used to mine I had his $80 miner and I'd mine around $3-4 a day profit but I stopped cause it was too loud and caused too much heat and it was summer at the time
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:48:37
When are the next to halvings expected
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:36:34

@_date: 2017-11-17 19:22:13
Is there a way for it to display btc and ltc at the same time or make that scrolling
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:13:15
Would you be able to make it for me &lt;3 I have 0 knowledge I bought a Pi by accident a year ago and still have it :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:11:17
any way to add other currencies to this like eth, ltc, btc... all in one 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:31:18
Mine was 13.09% fee 1 hour ago from coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:17:23
Can someone take this down haha
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:08:09
so you're saying if I send money back and forth between Ledger and there and I convert money back and forth and send it back I lose nothing. Everything is effected by my trades
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:19:46
awww, I wanted to use this as a portfolio but i guess they only got btc avaible
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:11:29
How'd you make this, I'm interested in making one
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:55:45
I bought a ledger, I recently (2 days ago) asked the same question and decided on ledger because it supports no coins and I used it and it's really easy to use
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:22:05
are they both as safe like no chance any of my crypto will be stolen or lost and easy to send + what are fees
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:08
Is that site legit?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:46:42
What's the benefits of getting both
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:17:13
wait so if i trade say bitcoin for xrp or anything for anything its free no fee
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:30
I'll do it for PayPal family/friends 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:44
You just answered the question I've been asking for months, thanks
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:47:13
While mining Bitcoin we are doing these super complex equations. How do these equations have a value and who wants these equations
