It's doing a really healthy thing right now, be happy! Steep climbs lead to steep declines, volatility concerns, FUD, and a host of other bullshit that the press eats up and loves to spit out to the public. Small, sustained growth that creates higher lows is about the best thing an investor can ask for. I hope it just keeps doing what it's doing.

“Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”
You mean the way JP Morgan was just busted facilitating a $1.3 Billion cocaine payload on their $90 Million shipping vessel?

Bitcoin seems to react to the stock markets more than before. Some positive earnings and the likelihood of an imminent rate cut really killed the latest bull run. Though, knowing Bitcoin is one of the go to safety nets for the market and political turmoil is fantastic, long-term. It really legitimizes Bitcoin even more than in the past.

Exactly. Isn't there a sub for those who need to constantly tell each other they're holding? That way the rest of us can have useful discussions and news fill the sub.

Such negative comments. I get that those commenting don't like Goldman Sachs, and don't like their price predictions, but I think you're missing the positive here - Goldman Sachs is, for the first time I've seen (could be wrong) providing price analysis and giving their "traditional" investors a greenlight to buy Bitcoin. That's fucking huge to me!

How does Venezuela, with its new currency soon to end up like the currency pictured here, create a successful currency for itself? First, it obviously must be legitimately willing to do so. But what comes second?
Like others, I support using Bitcoin and would love to see a country with a Bitcoin backed economy.

The correlation between the stock markets and Bitcoin have truly developed. And, if it keeps outpacing gold, the future looks bright for Bitcoin, even to the uninformed.

What if they used renewable energy to mine Bitcoin? Building solar and wind sources, creating a large amount of jobs while doing so, giving their country cheap/unlimited energy and mining Bitcoin with it.

Was just looking at u/drmoore718 profile and looking into this cool way to show appreciation on Reddit. Forget karma, or silver/gold, this is the way to do it! I'm going to start spreading the word and petitioning subs to implement this. Or, can we skip the inevitable and just have Reddit replace the arrows site-wide?
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:38:56
Why not? There are Bitcoin ATMs.

History is not a predictor of the future, and once is certainly not a predictor of anything. I do however agree a large move is coming, and it could be downward. It could also be upward. The trigger is being slowly pulled, now it's just a matter of which way the bullet goes when the bang comes.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:13:27
The scam metric. It's how you know Bitcoin is now pulling in the average person again, and FOMO is back.

Always do. I have small increments set all the way down to 3k.

I suppose if you look at it in those terms. I could walk to it. I've never considered anything to be remote if I could walk to it.

Imagine owning enough Bitcoin to influence the price, like Winklevoss amounts. You can use a small percentage of your holdings to do this at no risk because you bought so cheap. Sell enough to cause this to occur. Buy it all back. Do it again, and again, and again to reap profits for the rest of your (or Bitcoion's) life.

There is one in my city. Not remote. 10% premium. It's the price of anonymity and while you may not be willing to pay it, others are.

That's where these scammers get it wrong. If they would have offered me a yacht, I would be wiring them my life savings right now.

I like to be positive for brief moments during the day. I eventually succumb to the world of shit and get negative, but these are dark days.

That's an awesome video. How did this first relate to Bitcoin?

"It's the deep breath before the plunge." - Gandalf
Plunge is typically related with decline, sharp fall, etc. But, I think the deep breath is the decline we're seeing now and the plunge will be the upcoming force that propels Bitcoin to test the 20k psychological boundary. But, who the fuck knows :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:52:23
I don't care for huge climbs. I want to see steady, adoption-based growth stimulation. Yeah 15k, 20k, 100k will be great. But, an emotion-based climb to ( and fall from) those levels sucks for the average investor who can't time the market, it sucks for adoption on a mass level because of volatility concerns, and it sucks for the reputation of digital currencies in general.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:20:06
It depends on what you consider to be getting fucked. The high-end of short-term capital gains tax is 37%. Paying 10% to buy, 10% to sell, is a bargain considering.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:21:10
This happens in the stock market also. Price levels are tested, corrections occur, profits are taken, it's simply the process gone through in any investment. Even the panic brought on is completely normal. After you spend enough years going through the entire process, it becomes much less scary and something you just come to expect.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:42:52
If you care about getting rich, you should care about adoption. The two are intertwined.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:44:25
Just checked the dip. It took like 15 minutes to drop 2k. That's fucking crazy, I expected it to happen in under 5. Seriously, this is the ride. The seasoned know it. The new will learn it. My only advice is don't try to time the market. Bitcoin is destined for unprecedented levels. You will see 10k, 15k, 25k fall off in the same amount of time in the future. Get that mindset now and you will remove the emotional aspect from the ride, and better prepared.

It really is that simple. Either you believe that the price of Bitcoin will rise from the point it's at now, or you believe the price will fall. Then, you will buy Bitcoin at this price, during dips, and while it's under the price you believe it has the possibility to reach. You will either be right, along with many others, or you will be wrong, along with many others.
