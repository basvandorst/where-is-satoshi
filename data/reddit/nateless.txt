It was a short position to hedge exposure of 450BTC sitting on the account.
We kept 450BTC as a deposit on Bitfinex account and went “short” the same 450BTC to lock in the USD value. 
Since the account was denominated in US dollars, we had a fully locked position where the price of the BTC was no longer relevant to the USD value of the account (the loss of the short position will always be offset by the gain of the same deposit amount). Prior to establishing this position, we consulted the Bitfinex staff to make sure the position would not be liquidated in any circumstances. And we got confirmation from them in the beginning and also at the time of receiving the margin calls.
But eventually, the position got liquidated as the price went against us, and the Bitfinex staff continues to ignore my attempts to figure out why it had happened.

I referred to "we" as I operated via a corporate account... but it does not really matter which form you operated at.
Yes, I got automatic emails saying the position was near liquidation. I reached out to Bitfinex support who assured the position would not get shut. But as you see, they either did not know how their system was working or simply lied to me upfront.
Hedging is a good strategy when you think the underlying assets are on long-term bullish trend but short-term looks vulnerable for pullbacks. You can capitalize on pullbacks without giving up your assets... that was the plan.
