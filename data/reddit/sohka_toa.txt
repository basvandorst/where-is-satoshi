Thought you guys would get a kick out of this
Can’t post pics so I’ll iust post the transcript of some internet advice a cyptogenuis gave a potential investor in Dec.2017
Qura forum user : “ should I invest into bitcoin?” 
Bitcoin Expert/Guro extraordinaire : “  You’ll have to be patient and wait for the price to rise, this is most likely to happen in Feb to Mar 2018. If you buy bitcoin now you could double it in the next three months! Some experts believe it will be double by February 2018!” 
Well guys just thought you all could use a good laugh considering the current market. Take it easy fam, Moon Moon Moon! .....hopefully
