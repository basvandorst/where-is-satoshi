This whole article makes me sic...
Security in a serious, but grammatically incorrect, way

That's not how it works. The difficulty recalculates every 2016 blocks. They wouldn't have 2 weeks to reap the harvest of their malice. If they mined a block every minute they would have a little under a day and a half. Because any potential reward for sandbagging is fixed the incentives work against this approach.

I regret that I have but one upvote to give.

Just chill. The blockchain is a ledger, anything in the ledger before any fork, sodt or hard, would remain in both "copies" after the fork.

In the US the IRS has classified bitcoin as a collectible, not investment so unless you can find an etf your tax burden is not capital gains it is the much higher rate of a collectible. Don't take my word for it. Consult with you gorram tax professional, and if you don't have a gorram tax professional get one.

What does it matter who the actor is? Besides the governments have far cheaper and more effective means to project power and control.

So is gold, but it is also taxed as collectible.

Again, an answer to a different question. Considering the potential impact, even a miniscule possibility should be discussed so everyone is going into this with their eyes open and informed.

I admire your faith but I don't share it. I believe there is a point at which groups of people stop behaving according to a purely economic model.

So you *want* 90% of the hashpower to evaporate and ruin the ability to transact on chain for upwards for 6 months. Great idea there slick. /s
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:14:40
It is not an assumption, it is a supposition. Hence my use of the word 'could'. Whether or not it is likely it not what I am questioning. I am trying to understand why this is the hill that suddenly every voice I can hear in these parts is willing to die on if enough hashpower decides to draw this line in the sand.
Investors are not the only people transacting in bitcoin. I suspect that most of them (myself included) are doing exactly that -- waiting this out. Yes we still see the mempool repeatedly growing with load.
If bitcoin did not have a transaction congestion problem none of this drama would have happened in the first place and we would all still be upvoting hilarious DaVinci Code Satoshi identity threads...ah the good ol' days.

Interesting statement. If the core developers were also the principal miners would that be a mechanism more or less like fiat?

I'm not sure I understand the nuance between a node and a user in this context. I was under the impression that the node is the software being run by the user.

That's an answer to "why won't 2x get all the hashrate" A valid position, but not what I'm asking about.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:04:01
This doesn't make sense. The current hashrate is pushing 9PH/s. Getting to the first difficulty adjustment would take something on the order of 10^21 hashes. I don't think your GPU is going to make much of a dent in that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:54:20
This is what vexes me. I don't see a line of reasoning that doesn't just invalidate every argument that is being put forward at this point right now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:30:51
So in reality it comes down to hashpower is the true voting mechanism for consensus. Does that put us in another UASF standoff?
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:26:57
Yes. I'm not worried about my coins. They are all safely offlined for years now. I'm more curious about the community dynamic at play.

Post useful advice or get out. You aren't the god of bitcoin, and nobody has empowered you to judge how well people do or don't protect their posessions.
