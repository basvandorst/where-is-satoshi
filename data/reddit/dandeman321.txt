Yeah I found a guide outlining how to extract it but you had to use some software. Was a bit too nervous to trust that.

FYI, found a solution posted by the app developer on their Google+ page. They suggest downloading bitcoin cash wallet and restoring your wallet.

I've never heard of this guy, what'd he do? Got any links or a quick run down?

I did. and it just came up with his linkedin profile and a bunch of shit about him starting Paycoin and some mining company. Didn't find any major instance or event that makes him a "lying foghorn". Just seems like a shady guy. Did he scam a bunch of people or what.

Oof. Ok. Thanks for the info!

Gotcha. Yeah that all makes sense. I started mining bitcoins but the progress was so slow. I did the calculations and found that I can mine litecoins and make more USD a day based on it's current value.

You think it's too late to get in? Is the "bubble" real?

So when the block rewards are eliminated or just extremely small, in theory fees will be raised and provide rewards for miners?

I'm thinking alllll the way down the line. When you're close to the end where 99.9% of all BTC has been mined.
