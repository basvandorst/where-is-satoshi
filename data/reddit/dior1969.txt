I got a Trezor wallet as a Christmas present and I'm finding it pretty user-friendly so far. My boss sent it to me because blockchain.info kept getting messed up and the wallet I was using had its API.

Chronicled. It authenticates high-end sneakers (running shoes!) on the blockchain. Here's an article:

Bread Wallet is in, apparently. At least, they are listed on the Bitcoin Classic website as supporting it.

These are not business that just up and started to sell weed. These are business that had cleared legal obstacles and were allowed to sell weed. We're not talking Joe Shmoe's Random Backyard Grow-op.

True, but I think the point here is that these are legal businesses that are being pushed out of the mainstream system. Bitcoin is a solution to so many people who are disenfranchised for a variety of reasons. It is possible to point out that legal marijuana businesses are among this group without detracting from other use cases for bitcoin. Anything that demonstrates the way that bitcoin can empower people outside of the regular banking system is a step forward for adoption.

Yes, the rate is not great compared to going through an exchange, but it's pretty convenient. I get paid totally in btc, so it's nice being able to access my money right away, rather than waiting a couple of days to get funds transferred to a bank account. Plus, it's cool being able to bypass the bank.
