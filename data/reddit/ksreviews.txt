I'm still trying to figure it out. Is this some kind of internet combined processing power to. One as a larger unit?

Even so, it just means they are laughing at the disruption. We've always been bigger than them and they delight in the bullshit drama. 
It's not some addition of guilt or some shit. 
It's like someone you know that's always been more successful than you, but they get a streak of bad luck and it puts a smile on your face.

Fuck dude, I want a series where a guy fights people/crime/governments/demons with a badass lawnmower. 
Call it lawnmower man errrrrrrrr I'll work on the name. 
Maybe it's because I'm drunk and have watched too much JoJo, but I have an image of a guy flipping the push assist lever on the mower and uses it to run up the side of a building, launches off the top and into the eye of the storm, where he screams "Reverse Angelic Spino" and his mower blade spins the opposite way of the storm, letting loose this giant wind blast and canceling out the storm. Then he safely glides down to earth holding on to mower inverted and using it as a helicopter.

The lesson: Fuck Craigslist. 
Seriously though that's scary shit. Never heard of that scam, but I'm always weary of selling or buying off Clist, so much so I stopped doing so.
