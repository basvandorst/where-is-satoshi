Yes of course, but not everyone uses those services. The only service that pretty much everyone uses is PayPal. My group of friends (engineers , scientists, programmers) all happen to be into Bitcoin so that's what we use. I realize that's not going to be the case for everyone else. 
I'm sharing how Bitcoin has been useful for *me*.

I think the primary reason is its volatility. People tend to treat it as an investment. A high risk investment. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 13:47:53
Similar to what I said below, it's because Bitcoin is a trustless solution. I've been screwed over making transactions with strangers using PayPal, and PayPal is not on your side.  Why trust a company with your money, after hearing all the horror stories about them?
Altcoins?  Nobody really uses them, so I don't see it as a viable option?

@_date: 2015-06-28 13:43:01
I believe The one advantage Bitcoin brings is the whole "be your own bank" idea. I don't carry cash, and neither do many of my friends.  I could use PayPal, but you don't want to get me started on why PayPal is absolute crap. I want a digital solution that doesn't depend on an awful company to move money around for me. Bitcoin fits that need. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:10:49
I disagree with the people who say you can't cut the blockchain.  Of course you can!  Bitcoin is software, written by human beings.  It can be changed.  We CAN create a "balance sheet" of all addresses with a balance.  Maybe when the blockchain is 567,291 Terabytes in size, you'll be convinced that something needs to be done.

People in developing nations would not use Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions. It makes sense to use cash. But Bitcoin can be tremendously useful to be used as a savings account.  People would no longer have to literally hide their money.

It can be extremely volatile, so it's a high risk investment. Can't think of any other downsides. You're just going to have to spend the time to really understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 18:27:33
It costs money (bitcoin) to use record something to the public ledger (blockchain).  There has to be an incentive for the people (miners) who validate and store the ledger.

The way it has been useful for me is with splitting the tab with friends. For example, I can pay the tab in full with my credit card, then my friends pay me their share in BTC. A lot easier than asking the waiter to split the bill, or having everyone pay their share in cash. 
We live in a cashless society these days, so it's extremely useful for those types of small, peer to peer transactions.

@_date: 2015-06-28 23:05:32
Bitcoin's goal is not to take over all currencies and be used by everyone globally. You need to get that idea out of your head. It's meant to fill a void, - a need for a decentralized (key word), peer to peer payment gateway.  There will always be a need for cold, hard cash.

I don't see an issue with using big numbers like 250,000 bits.  Think about countries like Japan, where $100 is approximately 10,000 yen.  They are accustomed to using large figures for everyday purchases.  And again, imagine when 1 btc = $10,000.  250,000 bits would be equivalent to 250,000 yen!

I don't have a definitive answer to your question, but I don't think that the choice of TLD has any affect on how seizure resistant it is.  If a website is doing something that is considered highly illegal by the country that the business is operated in, then that country's government is likely going to shut down the *servers* that operate the website.  Not the domain name.  A domain name is just an identifier that points to an IP address where the "illegal" activity is being conducted. 
Now, there may be one good thing about the .io domain: they don't allow private WHOIS registrations.  This could lead to more transparency.  Anyone can see who owns the domain name, so it could potentially reduce the chances that the operator will conduct illegal activities (because their identity is exposed).

It depends on which web wallet you are using.  Some give you access to the private keys, and some do not.
@_date: 2014-12-13 03:43:01
Online wallets are more susceptible to hackers, but they are convenient and easy to use for beginners.  Native clients put you in charge of your own security, while online wallets mean you rely on the website.  Honestly, which one is better depends on your needs and skill level.  I suggest giving a few of them a try. 
If you own large quantities of bitcoin,  it is advised that you learn about cold storage and paper wallets.

If a hacker registers the domain name "blockckchain.info" (notice the extra "ck") and creates a fake site, then advertises it on Google, Blockchain.info has no control over that.  Blockchain can report it to Google, but they don't have the power to take it down.  Only Google has that power.

No, the private key doesn't change.
If I steal your private key, I gain the ability to send your bitcoin away to another address.  At which point you lose your bitcoin, because you don't have the private key to that other address.  But I do.

No, it is not fallible, because an SHA256 hash is a one-way mathematical function that can only be solved by brute force.  It can be mathematically proven that it is not reversible. 
Of course, a short passphrase, or a phrase that is found in literature or song is easy to brute force. But a very long passphrase, say, 20 random words, is mathematically impractical to solve.  Meaning, even with all the computing power in the universe, it would take so long that the sun would burn out before you solved it.

It's a simple concept dude.  It means to own one millionth of all bitcoin that will ever be in existence.  
If you owned one millionth of all gold in existence, you would be a multi-millionaire.
Obviously, the implication is that bitcoin *may* be worth significantly more than what it is worth today, therefore owning one millionth of all bitcoin in existence *could* be a big deal.

Whoever owns the private key owns the bitcoin.  So if I steal your private key, we both own the bitcoin.  If I then send the bitcoin to another address, of which I own the private key to, but you don't, then now I own the bitcoin and you don't.

Your example and reality are far from the same.  In reality, they always give out money, but in your example they are taking money.  That would NEVER happen for obvious reasons.
And yes, it would be fair to me if they changed their referral bonus to $0.00001.  They have every right to terminate their referral bonus plan whenever they want.  I've been using the referral program for over a year, and I'm extremely grateful of the number bonuses they have given me.  If they chose to stop, that's their business.
You also have to look at the other side of the coin.  I had one user sign up using my referral link back when it was only $25.  After the guy signed up, they increased their bonus to $75.  So I got more than I expected.  You win some, you lose some.

Send your bitcoin to shapeshift.io and convert it to an altcoin (like litecoin or dogecoin).  Then convert it back to bitcoin and send to a different wallet.

Download the html file. Then you can verify file integrity by computing the hash of the file and comparing it against the version history. Then you know that the file is legit.

The best thing to do is donate it instead of spending it on yourself.

Good to know.  Thanks.

I agree!  But I'm questioning why this video was published in I can only assume that people are concerned that the government is going to steal their bitcoin, right?  That's unrealistic and overly paranoid.

Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

I don't follow. You think they're after you're measly bits?
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:54:35
One of the reasons is because "coin" and "bit" domain names were widely available. Think about how hard it would be to acquire a more unique and original domain like gemini.com.  They probably paid a fortune for that.

Never lost money at Cryptsy but upvoted because their website and service suck balls.

They acquire BTC from people who sell at Circle. 
If there are more buyers than sellers, price goes up. Basic supply and demand.

It was written by Jean Pierre Buntinx. No surprise.  He vomits shit articles on a daily basis, and he enjoys Roger Ver's cock in his mouth.

It says very clearly: 
"The buy has to complete (meaning the bitcoin is delivered). Buys can take up to four business days to complete."

I was concerned with the usability (having to scroll through pages and pages of people's responses) but you know what, maybe it would work on a bulletin board since there's like 10 people who use your forum.

If encryption were "solved" the world economy would catastrophically crash.  Bitcoin would be the least of your problems.

Well my dog shat diarrhea all over the kitchen floor and it spelled "$317 in 2 weeks" so we have some conflicting data here. Hmmm.

Honestly I think it's going to hover around $250 for the next few months.

No. Not everyone is technical enough, and Bitcoin would quickly die without them.

They straight up stole money out of my account about a year ago. Fucking Chinese scum.  Stay away.

I still think it's in bad taste when you look at the context. This person is essentially encouraging people to harass or threaten Theymos by giving out his personal contact info.

The concern with not using BIP38 is when someone finds/steals your flash drives.  Even a simple password would stop them from easily taking your funds.  
You should consider using a secure password manager, like LastPass.

Back in the day I was able to send one satoshi with no fee, but it probably wouldn't work today.
