True, but you realize you have to have *some* feasible understanding of the industry to become a billionaire... Tech =/= crypto, but to completely discredit his statement as “self interest” isn’t just. 
If he was all about the $$$, I’m sure he would have stuck with the most valuable tech company in the world he helped co-found...

Right, but saying “on this sub” implies that people are posting about it, does it not?

What the article I feel fails to mention is what it implies for energy usage at scale. Yes, of course energy usage is lower than what is used by servers + gold mining by governments. They handle exponentially more transactions. 
If BTC were to suddenly swap market shares with fiat, the infrastructure would be fucked. It should be a wake up call for the crypto devs that if we want to gain wider adoption at its current rate, this must improve. 
With the Lightning Network in development, does anyone know if this will also improve energy consumption?

Good for beginners, but the fees are high. Until you research and understand the benefits of using exchanges and storing in hard/soft wallets, coinbase will serve you fine.

I have an account technically but GDAX doesn't have a license in my state. When i uploaded verification, i get a "We're sorry, but we're not currently available in your location" type of message.
Basically, all i have access to are the charts, no sort of trading/buying/selling

The biggest advantages (to me):
1 - it immediately credits your account your USD deposit. No longer are you waiting 6-7 days. 
2 - much lower fees

Nah it's currently living in my Coinbase exchange wallet. Users say its better to send it over to GDAX but I'm unable to make an account. From what I understand, doing any sort of transfer from Coinbase has high fees

Coinbase and GDAX share accounts. They are a great platform to use starting out.

The only reason I’m in r/bitcoin is because shitposts are still too progressive for the mainstream to make a living off of.

Like the others said, try not to let it get to you, they're willfully ignorant. All you can do is respectfully inform with the research you've done and move on.
Specifically to it being a Ponzi Scheme, it's literally just math. Bitcoin go for the prices that people are willing to buy/sell at. You can read the whitepapers and all the code is opensource, it belongs to no one. It's increasing in value because more and more people are believing in the system and investing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:47:04
Woahhh, easy pal. I think you may have misunderstood my comment. 
I was saying I’d invest in shitposts vs Bitcoin if I could. I was adding my tiny dingleberry of a contribution into our thriving sea of shitposts.

Turns out GDAX isn’t available in my state but Coinbase somehow is. My funds are basically held hostage unless I pay $15 fees, so that’s nice.

Sorta makes sense... but by that logic, CA, OR, WA, &amp; NY would be in our same situation.

Being a self proclaimed noob, how is a wallet safer than keeping BTC in the exchange? I understand the risk of a 3rd party hack, but keeping BTC in “cold storage” seems riskier due to hardware failure/theft/natural disaster/etc. 
If any of the above happened, what are your options to recover your wallet/prevent loss?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:18:48

I don’t think there was nearly this level of peak this time last year. Bought in at 16k but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I expect it to drop down to 10-13 and increase at a steady pace to hit 25k end of next year, just a guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:35:46
Can you clarify? Are you saying only the equivalent dollar amount at time of purchase is insured?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:51
Here’s to hoping! I don’t really plan on making many transactions or trades so it’s fine for now. Either that or Segwit support would be nice.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:14:59
I’m sorry to hear that, and feel your frustrations.. it sounds like a strong case of confirmation bias that is difficult to reason with. 
Maybe gear conversation away from price entirely, as it is just a byproduct of its adoption and people abusing the tech to “get-rich-quick.”  Focus more on the technology and what it means for the future of banking. 
Also what may defuse the situation is agreeing with him. The more you personally detach yourself from BTC, the less leverage he has. For example, saying “yeah, fees on the network are driving some users to sell their BTC for alternative coins, they really have some big problems to solve currently to compete” sort of thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:07
I'd personally keep it separate. I think you'd have a lot more fun being in charge of your own wallet solutions (there are many!) and you can compare your findings. You could also invest in different cryptos and shit-talk your friends for/for not investing in ones "knew" would take off/tank.
Also in general, friends and finances don't mix super well, regardless of how trivial the amount is. If BTC is to take off, the trivial amounts can become significant real fast.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:09:01
14k, 18k, it’s small potatoes in the grander scheme. If you plan on holding long term, it’s the same as someone beating themselves up for investing at $800 when they could have waited for the dip to $600. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:25:44
Might want to diversify your portfolio, it’s high-risk to invest all you’ve got into one crypto

What is the difficulty of filling taxes (US) if you're day trading? I've considered selling high / buying back in low but I don't know how much of a nightmare that would be vs the profits gained.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:11:39
If trends continue, your investment will be profitable even if you buy at All Time High. You may have to hold for months or a year but I wouldn't be too concerned if you invest long term.
In my opinion, i think the only thing that would cause BTC to decline is if another crypto takes its spot on top (which is very possible since BTC is the oldest and one of the slowest), but nonetheless, it has by far the highest marketshare hence it's current value.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:01:02
I would still actually like to know the source of its value. Just saying the USD is unfounded without giving a reason why BTC is different makes it look equally bad, a sort of logical fallacy. 
Right and Left political news do this ALL the time, it’s infuriating. They never defend their shitty position, they just try to explain why the other side is worse. 
Edit: thank you everyone for your explanations and perspectives :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:37:01
Yeah, the* shit
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:34:32
hmmmm. that seems like that can get super complicated, especially if you trade multiple times a week, or even a month. For example:
* Invest $1000
* Sell 40% @ $500
* Sell 10% @ $200
* Invest $300
* Sell 50% (net) @ $800
As you can see, it can get confusing really quickly as how much of my profit relates to what i actually invested. Is there a resource to calculate all of this just by punching in numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:14:45

Bitcoin is extremely undervalued, the acceleration of it's value i feel are people trying to "get rich quick" and cashing. If trends continue and hold, you will be net positive even if you invest at ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:23:23
I'll definitely consider, as i mostly plan on investing rather than doing any sort of trading. Plus their [Securtiy FAQ]( seems reasonably transparent and well established, but maybe I'm missing something.

Exact same situation. From what i can tell, no dice.

Are you planning on day trading or investing? If you believe in the tech and planning on holding til it comes mainstream, there’s not a bad time. It’s only gone up year after year.

Been doing some research on US taxes and bitcoin - My question:
If I invest $1000, 6 months later, cash out HALF of my investment for $600 (20% gains on 50% of my investment - $100 profit). 
Do i owe tax on that $100 since i'm still technically $400 negative on my investment??

I think you’re greatly overestimating how many people actually are investing. People are talking more than before, but barrier to entry is still high for the common person and skepticism is still high. 
The fact that (conservatively) 90% use case for BTC is to speculate/trade with says how far it has to go. Once people actually start *using* it as a currency at everyday places and people aren’t worried about volatility, that’s when you know it’s peaked. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:03:19

Regardless of whether putting your life savings into BTC is a good idea...
Why wouldn’t you just take your normal paycheck and just invest it into the market when you choose? Nobody knows what the market will do but there are certainly better times to strategically buy in based on averages. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:12:02
You can use an educated judgment that doesn’t guarantee better results, but higher probability. 
For a dramatic example, buying at an ATH after a 20% bull run in 24hrs may not be the best time to invest. Usually spikes like that is accompanied by a correction (but not guaranteed)
