How can you have "inside" trading if Bitcoin is open.
Valid question.  You can't stop this.  There will always be a way to manipulate the value.  Governments will want control in exchange for pursuing justice.

I mean if he's so bright how could he not realise the feds would lock him up and throw away the key.
Also by bringing him to New York so the dems could give their version of a fair trial.

Well, his biggest investor got pinched.

By telling white middle class millenials its wrong to have kids and not affordable, yet immigrants should get more money for having larger families.
The rich and powerful have been doing their social engineering experiments since they 1960s.  This is why we are all here.  Fuck em all.

@_date: 2018-01-17 14:41:55
buy from pessimists, sell to optimists.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:09:44
Question is did they buy back in.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:54:34
I mean he was a criminal, bitcoin wasn't his crime.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:17:09
Only if they were dumb enough to sell .  If you dont understand paper losses why are you even investing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:07:58
Report them to twitter for what?  This just comes across as insecure crypto kiddies.
Look at the price.  They are fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:31:05
If their employees did pull a fast one wouldn't their company be royally fucked unless they feed them to the wolves?
Anyone with any knowledge on the law can weigh in?

I'm 17 and a financial expert too 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:57:20
Christmas is usually stable?  Whatever is going to happen will likely be January.  It's a big talking point around the family table.  Probably a lot of investment soon 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:03:01
How is the price set?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:07:58
Maybe it crashes from 30k to 18k in march 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:17:24
Best of luck 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:53
Look on the bright side, this is now financially legitimate to be attracting this sort of corruption,  this is how the world works everyday.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:10:35
We are in the correction, or we are in the bubble.
This is the dotcom boom all over again,  people never recovered from being paper millionaires,  it was a boom then when it bust it was just another bubble.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:00:57
It shocks me that there is still no real tutorial for it on the subrwddit advocating it so much 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:17:11
Hodl game strong 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:44:43
Is there a good tutorial on private keys wallets and what I can trust and how to make them?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:57:40
People are selling it.  Mostly the the small fish in the 1000 dollar total bracket look at the trades
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:44:01
The correction train has got lost in transit 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:35
They are making it volatile and aren't even here yet 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:04:16
Pure speculation got use here.  It can drop to 6k tomorrow but a lot needs to happen to reach 100k
That requires a lot of people to buy in.  
Who the hell will read an article and buy something that is worth 50k or 100k. 
It's not going to happen this year.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:06
They probably bought at 15k too 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:17
What if this is the dip where it's still possible to make a lot of money
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:51
The bubble has only just begun ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:35:53
Power will not come to the people,  merely new monopolies will rise 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:30:39
The price is based on emotion. of all this years noobies sold it could dip to 1k
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:57
And now it rises 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:33:35
You shouldn't,  your an idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:26
You only lose if you sell 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:10
I bought in at 19k too aren't you supposed to sell low and buy high 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:48:48
Considering the amount that got stolen I'd say some market manipulation to offload it
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:50:07
People can manipulate the price for profit since futures do not directly buy or sell bitcoins.  A small sum of bircoims can still tank the price despite the majority never seeing the light of day.
1000 are traded a day yet 60 million exist
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:50
86000 now lol

Business takes on new business to make money, more at 11.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:56
This could bottom out under 10 hopefully 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:34:18
Noob here what is Segwit
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:05:45
Yup,  far better returns than any index.  If you want a quick way to achieve goals I say this is the best way to make a 5-10 fold return on 4 figure amounts.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:52
It did, go and check

It's hilarious that even if this happens we will have. Tiny percentage of the world holding 40% of it.  Like 1000 people.
That's not a currency that's a socialist endgame

Saw it jump 1500 gb in an hour or so that one dropped my blood pressure 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:25:38
No,  the amount it would take to get someone to invest in an at his hard enough.

They were significantly successful but. Opt Facebook rich

This is small fish fleeing,  20 bitcoins can swing the market lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:06
Put some notifications in coinbase and was maybe expecting this in 12 hours fuck where are all these purchases coming from? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:33
Maybe it's not dropping because hyenas have not patience 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:13:19
That's a million dollar house!  Just kidding,  the only gains are off of paper
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:45
Is coinbase and Blockchain also vulnerable?   I'm looking to move to a wallet but do t know how secure it is

Flash sale boys.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:34
Only people cashing out .
But I think when the supply of newcomers runs out it will flatline.  Where that will be I dunno

One side of me thinks it could be the millennium bug of our generation and there are people working to wipe it out entirely.

Can't be right. It was surely doomed this time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:29:30
This should be a standard response.
It drops 7% and every 20 year old is crying over their 100 dollar stake 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:38:23
Making it legitimate and mainstream.  Goddamn
