You just do the deposit through BoA, you don't need a BoA account.

Same here. The announcement said "All trading will be suspended..." suspended as in a temporary down time, as in it will be back soon. He could of gave everyone a fair warning but I think all that money is probably in that dudes fucking bank account.

So does everyone use Dwolla? I was going to link my accounts for convenience, but havent had the time to set them up. But aren't there other countless way to transfer money to Mt Gox? Im sure they were probably the most convenient, but  I dont think this is the end of the world?

Yep this is true. This happened to me when Bitfloor closed.

You can add my $217 to that.

Thats pretty rad man. However I personally think that having ads on a porn site are better than not having them. When it comes to porn the more vagina, ass, and titties you can get on the screen the better. It adds to the overall fapping experience.

Why hasn't anyone mentioned BitInstant?

Even if it is legit, the prices are outrageous and don't even seem to follow the market.

I had money in there. Although it was not very much, when compared to many others I'm assuming, it still pisses me off.

Id like to know who didn't see this coming. We all watched the price go through the roof over and over again this past month and a half. There was no possible way the market could have sustained that kind of growth, and I am surprised I went on as long as it did.

NM There is no way for me to change the email or pass like I thought I might Be able to do.

Does anyone want to buy my Bitfloor account off of me?
@_date: 2013-05-21 05:37:19
I would use it to buy what ever I could with it. Computers, tablets, MOBOs, I would build a few computers actually.

Yes, thank you for your efforts you have been putting into this! You are the man!
