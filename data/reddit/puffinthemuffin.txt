I think that might just be you. Cause you're certainly not speaking for me here.

Project Gutenberg, Sea Shepherd. Personally I like The Public Domain Review. They showed me some cool things from Internet Archive that I wouldn't have found myself.

Parked cars in between moving traffic and bikes is absolutely the shittiest idea ever for all road users. At my area, moving cars were confused by the parked lane and thought they are waiting for the light so they line up after empty parked cars. Bikers have to worry about getting doored constantly while biking closely to these parked cars. Parked cars themselves, and the bikers, have to suffer from heavy snow accumulation because the snow plowers will ignore the parking lane as well as the bike lane. Everyone is fucked.

What is this about? I'm pretty sure that place in the picture is a [restaurant]( not a hotel in Hong Kong.

That part is exactly like those infomercials where shitty actors pretend to have muscle spasms all the time. It's not that hard to write one vertical strikethrough line on a letter B. I'm sure people in Thailand don't have problem writing it out like the author does.

As long as you don't send money to other people straight from Coinbase account you should be fine. All you need to do is send your bitcoin back to your own bitcoin wallet so Coinbase don't know what you're doing. I think that's basic precaution with any bitcoin business.

I would like to know what the % cut is. I really hate it when companies say IT'S FREE when obviously it's not and they even make an effort not to show the fees (I'm looking at you Circle).. If I can't tell how much money you're taking from me with your service, you're not getting my money.

[No]( they take a cut with their exchange rate. The article from a year ago shows that Circle's cut is slightly higher than Coinbase's but not by much, but the problem is since they don't tell you straight up what the deal is, you are agreeing to let them take however much they feel like at that time with your transaction. With Coinbase it's straightforward, it's 1% and you will knowingly have 1% less of your money with the exchange. It's much harder to keep track of your fees with Circle this way.
