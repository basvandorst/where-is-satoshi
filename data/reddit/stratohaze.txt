as a store of value gold is safer, now if you like to live on the edge put your money on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:14:16
hope it doesnt happen when youre 74
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:40:48
welp, might not be so late to do that, i already lost 10 usd to bitcoin's price drop, i know 10 usd may just be change for you. thanks for the info tho
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:54:34
 dont know why i have the feeling that we are going to close 2018 the same way 2017 started.

two days ago i was hoping that we could get back to 8500 range, that seems unlikely to happen to for the time being, now im hoping to get back on the 7600 range. that also seems unlikely to happen any time soon. 
PD: im not a trader, im just someone that is trying to save value from my country 's currency devaluation.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:57:27
well youre right i have the same number of coins, i mean milifractions of a coin, but i cannot afford to wait until the price reaches the same number at which i bought, i choose bitcoin as way to save my savings from my countrys savage currency devaluation. i lost nearly 30 dollars, i know this might be just change for you but for me is a small fortune. late did i learn that i could have transfer those coins to uphold and the exchange them for fiat. but anyway is too late now.

here we go again
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:58:15
funny right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:30:34
by break you mean, its going up or down? excuse my ignorance
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:56:44
it is but currently bitcoin is the easiest way for me to pull out any value from harm's way. im from venezuela. forgot to say that.
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:52:27
so, are we going to bounce to 8k or what?
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:02:14
glad to ear youve doing good.
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:16:47
i learned the hard way not to use bitcoin as way to store value
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:34:18
you got it all wrong pal.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:31:29
hell yeah
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:11:15
i think the vets sold high, they are waiting with their hard cash in hand to buy at the lowest point....
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:28:09
hope you get your money back or at least part of it
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:09:14
we try, but they wont allow us, they like to seize equipment from miners and keep it to themselves. the only way to profit from crypto is by trading but most venezuelans dont have access to a usd bank account. so... 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:52:02
yeah, no wonder. the household heating business is doing good.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:21:50
