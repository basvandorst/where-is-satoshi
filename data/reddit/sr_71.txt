i tried analyzing bitcoin price [in this thread]( Basically, the price of bitcoin is pretty much very high right now, even when you think that its going to grow much, **according to that thread**. 
Looking at it from another angle, someone has said that bitcoin is a very high risk asset. Which is true. Compared to dollar, Yen, UK Pound, which are backed by governments with militaries, bitcoin is very high risk. For example, there is practically 0 risk that the price of dollar will fall 90% in next 1 week. However, that is certainly possible with bitcoin, as in its within the realm of possiblities. 
Who wants to lose 50-90% of their investment in a week or a month? No one. 
Yes, the upside is high. But if the upside is so good ( people saying it will go up 1000 times), then you will be a millionaire with just a $1000 worth of bitcoins today. You don't need to buy a lot to get good results.

cost of paypal transfer is more. 
There is 2.9% international transfer fee. Then their dollar-peso exchange rate would be about 1.7% lower than standard rate. That comes to 2.9 + 1.7 = 4.6%. So if you send $100, the reciever will get $95.4 in peso.
With bitcoin, he/she can easily contact a okcoin teller or atm, and withdraw with a maximum exchange rate fee ( as in the exchange rate that is lesser than market rate by this value) of about 1%. So he will get about 99% of value that you send. A differnce of $3.6 over each $100 sent.

Don't buy all at once. Buy some now, at $235. Then buy some at $350. Then buy some at $500. Then buy some at $600. 
If finally bitcoin reaches $10000 some day, or in three years, it won't matter much that you bought at $500 or $350. You'd still get a handsome return. 
But if you buy all of today at $235, and then it goes downwards, at least you won't feel you are losing that much.

What if tomorrow a couple of banks come together, and start an altcoin. They don't want to use bitcoin, because for whatever reasons. 
Is it a possible or probable scenario? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 12:06:34
I did consider that. The 6 million coins that I did not touch, what are they? They are held by people who expect bitcoin to touch $10,000 or more in five years. 
Or do you think that number is much less? What is your guess or estimate?

This 21 thing as a chip in every device to mine bitcoins is the most ridiculous thing I can imagine. I thought they had put out a press release saying that these claims are outdated, and that this is not what they are going for with 21? 
They have something else up their sleeves. most likely a protocol built over bitcoin that allows devices to talk to each other and pay for services using bitcoin.

I haven't looked into it. Cause they are likely to increase that number by making blocks bigger in size or some other technical magic. If we say that they increase them ten times to 3.5 million transactions per day, that will not allow 20 million people to drink coffee using bitcoins, nor other small transactions. 
So I haven't looked into that cause I am not a very technical guy in blocksize/number of transactions metric. However it looks number of transactions is the limiting factor here, and I am not sure how that would affect the price of btc.

bitcoin was the first digital-currency, or cryptocurrency. Maybe with the next generation of cryptocurrencies, they could learn something from bitcoin, and not repeat that. 
That "learning" could be totally unintentional, and just a result of it being not the first. For example, **and this just a shot in the dark**, in next generation of crypto currencies, the founding members may not have as big of a stake in the currency as Bitcoins foundrers did ( because people knew what cryptocurrencies were). This will spread out the eventual gains among a lot more stakeholders, which would make it attractive to more people. 
So my question can be reworded as are there any disadvantages that bitcoin has as  a pioneer that could be avoided by second-gen cryptocurrencies, one of which becomes the world wide currency.

Lets assume, just for conversations sake, there are one million speculators, who want to invest $10,000 each in bitcoin. That makes it $10 billion. 
So everyday, $10 billion is needed for these people ( who don't sell their bitcoins), and $1.5 billion is needed for people using bitcoins. 
So the total market value of bitcoin would be 10 + 1.5 = $11.5 billion. current market value is something like $3 billion. So the bitcoin price would go up four times to cater to that. So bitcoin would be at $1000 in that case. 
But that $1000 would remain the price of bitcoin for years or even a decade or more.

Example use case: You have a fast internet. You want to monetize it somehow. So you have a setting where you say you want to sell 10 GB/month of your internet bandwidth. Now any of your neighbors can use that bandwidth by paying at your rates. The whole protocol happens without user intervention. So devices need to be connected to a wallet cause payment has to be done. There is no mining involved. That is fake news, at best.

In 19th century, there was no US dollar. Every bank issued its own notes. But later, US created federal bank, and it started the dollar. 
I somehow see a correspondence here. Today's coins are like those earlier banking notes, but eventually the US government will issue its own coin. 
Or something something. I am just shooting in the dark here.

I also own a couple of bitcoins. And like anyone else, I'd like them to go up in value too. I did this "analysis" for my personal use to find the likelihood of that happening. 
Personally, I don't why bitcoin should go much above $1000 in next five or even ten years. Further, presently, its $240 rate has already weighed in the growth that it has to see in next 5-10 years, so as an investment, its a bad asset.

Bitcoin is a very high risk investment. Only invest money that you can afford to lose. So basically, maximum 10-20% of your net-worth, and not more, should be in bitcoin.

India's land area is wrong. yOu mention: 2,864,021.00. Official indian land area is something like 3.2 million sqkm. However, that includes Aksai Chin, and Pok. Excluding them, you'd still have more than 3.0 million sqkm.

Mine is a five year old account, and I am from India. Nothing to do with them. Just wanted to share my experience with spending some bitcoin for the first time in my life, thats all.

L-b-peep makes a good point. You should apologize to carrot_eating_johnson.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:36:23
well, holding something like this is a privilege of richer people! An average Indian or Filipino is like 50x poorer than an average American, so you can imagine their capability to invest or hold assets like this is 50x less. Sure, richer Indians or filipinos can hold, but neither my contractor nor me come in that class!
I still hold 1 BTC, so lets see how long can i afford to not sell them.

This thread is so silly I don't even know how anyone can participate in it. Just quit it everyone.

I made a thread about a real world utility of bitcoin, and you have to make a comment about hodl, hodl, hodl. There is a time and place for everything, and this thread is about remittance using bitcoins, or utility of bitcoins, and not about holding it.
Or about Satoshi, or about bitcoin-qt.

The mistake is if they forgot to type . while sending .2 btc.

remember the time when saying "mine is a 5 year old account" meant something about you

Hi Ashton!

I do have bitcoins. And thanks for the information. Will look into them now. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 14:27:44
Amazing video. Thank you. Am going to use it somehow.  
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:14:24
Thats just an amazing service. Dang, after selling your bitcoins, you can withdraw money form ATM's by just entering a code. Mind blown, honestly, because I wasn't expecting this kind of arrangement anywhere, let alone philippines.

Its moving between 440-460 for last ten days now. Where is the run?
@_date: 2015-11-01 19:18:01
Yep, this is a problem. The problem generally can be stated as follows:
Whenever bitcoin price becomes stable, or there is potential of it increasing, it will invite more people to hold them. 
This will reduce their availability. Inflating their price "artificially" in the market. 
Once the price stabilizes, after a fall, there will be turbulence in market. 
But once the price settles, the same cycle would repeat. 
How do other currencies avoid this? Lets take the UK pound against dollar. Both these currencies follow the same type of financial regulation, where the central authorities keep releasing more and more into the market. This keeps them both in equivalent rates. However, bitcoin is not like any of them. So in the long term its price is going to keep on increasing, all other things being equal. 
That means a lot of periods of turbulent prices. The price will basically never settle because there is no central banker who can make sure that the price remains at a stable level vis-a-vis other currencies.
