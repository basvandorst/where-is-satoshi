I just look at the dips as a chance to buy a little more.

This is what I like about armory's fragmented backups. Keep one at home, one in a safe deposit box and give one to a trusted friend.  If you lose one you can still recover your wallet with the 2 others. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:14:25
That's the magic question, nobody really knows. I think it will take off more than it has so far but thats my opinion, theres also a possibility it could completely collapse and we could all lose.
And I'd refer to it as Crypo Currency. Since its not really Virtual, it holds real value, you can buy things off NewEgg, TigerDirect and Overstock with it.

I donated and my account has been upgraded with no issue, I provided a signed message containing my pastebin username for verification.

I git in at 30 Million... 
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:51:58
This is what I did, Kept one part at home in a safe, the other part at the bank in a sefe deposit box.

I love the idea behind Armory but face it, its Beta software, I'm doing the same thing going to pull my funds out of Armory until its stable.

Run your own node.

All I heard was "bla bla bla, but we get a percentage of payments made on our network so use a MasterCard plz"
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:08:27
Thank you sir, I'll download it and see how it goes.
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:57:18
Edit: also BitCoin is very resistant to typos because the addresses contain a built-in check code. So if you had simply mistyped a few of the letters or numbers in the address your client won't let you send the payment. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:07:31
This has nothing to do with what I'm asking... Armory is currently crashing on my Linux distro. I'd like to recover it on the only other machine I have access to right now to spend my bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:05:52
I have a repeating buy order set up with coinbase, been buying every payday for over a year, I don't really pay attention to the price anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:56:55
I'd prefer this, I have a windows computer at work and a MacBook Pro for travel. Maybe building a Debian box for home soon so that would be perfect.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:25:19
Coinbase would agree with you, thus the reason they refunded everyone before they were even asked for it, However I should have realized I was granting a 3rd party app access to my account. Also they've already taken action to reassess the API/application approval process.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:10:26
This. Right. Here. I was also an idiot this morning and was fully prepared to just eat my loss as I realized what I did right away but it was to late.
I filled out a support ticket to notify them of the Phishing email going around, I never requested a refund as as far as I was concerned it was my own damn fault I lost the BTC. Definitely will be using them for the long term. CoinBase already proved they got my back.
EDIT: Spelling

I think this is the best idea yet and more than likely the one I'll go with, Perhaps using a TrueCrypt encrypted USB stick instad of CD-R.

Yea one of the phones is broken (Pretty white bars when turned on) but they say thy accept broken phones, I may send them that one as a test.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:20:09
Thanks for the catch, edited.
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:22:37
It's a great source and since your trading with other people in your area its instant.
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:55:14
Honestly I think it can go ether way. I'm buying about $50 of Bitcoin a month right now. Enough that should the market crash I'll be okay but also if it takes off I'll have a little extra money to love off when I retire in 20-30 years (along with my 401k). I'm expecting it to hit about $1k/BTC in 10 years. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 22:49:38
It seems to me that the entire concept of Bitcoin kinda eliminates the need for a bank, especially when you can create multiple copies of a offline wallet and store them in separate locations (for example to protect against fire).
If you ABSOLUTELY need the security whats wrong with a few offline wallets on an encrypted flash drive in a safety deposit box somewhere? You can even continue to deposit to that wallets address.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:52:57
yes and no, your trusting them to transfer the money for you. I never said it was a good option, just mentioned it was an option.
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:15:47
Looking forward to multiple paper backups. I listened to an interview on [Let's Talk Bitcoin!]( where they talked about possibly having 5 paper backups and needing any 3 of them to restore your wallet, Thus allowing you to store your backups in 5 separate locations, and not having to worry about one getting destroyed.
@_date: 2013-06-19 19:19:30
I keep a small amount of coin on a wallet on my daily use computer. I'm banking on the idea of the coin being difficult to get to. I'm not planning on accessing the machine all that often.

What the hell do you think your mattress is for?!?
@_date: 2013-06-17 04:56:49
I've been investing slowly buy purchasing, just dont have the hardware to even attempt mining. I've simply been putting aside a small amount of each paycheck (~$10). its little enough that if the market does crash, I'm not screwed but at the same time if it skyrockets, I'll make a small profit.
@_date: 2013-08-07 13:48:02
Ahhh good ol' twitter bootstrap. Nice looking site. =)
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:10:23
* [Coinbase]( - Can be slow (usually ~5 days).
* [LocalBitcoins.com]( Find someone local to trade cash for coins.
* [BitInstant]( - Create the transaction pay at CVS or Walmart, get your coins within ~30-60 minutes.
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:58:42
If it drops any lower I'm just going to start buying more. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 15:07:10
I keep a very small percentage of my coin in online exchanges because of this, as soon as I buy coin it gets transfered to my offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:57:39
Back to auto buying $20/week
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:01:41
I also fail to see how this is not an offline solution, the private keys were generated on an offline machine and never touched a system with internet access.
@_date: 2013-07-01 02:12:48
This is reason enough for me never to use them. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 23:21:50
If I remember correctly once invited if they do not create an account and claim the coins within 30 days it goes back to the sender.
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:00:02
My plan was to use [Electrum]( Thus eliminating the need to download the block chain.
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:27:25
See, thats even worse having the address, because now you get to stare at it... I lost about 1.5 Bitcoin to a computer crash about a year ago... Now I have a few paper wallets backing up my Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-19 19:05:38
Already own all the peripherals, All I'd need is a dedicated SD Card.

Thank you sir!
@_date: 2013-07-01 02:42:52
What's stopping users form breaking the payments into chunks below X to remain anonymous. I foresee services to automate this if needed. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:22:31

Someone needs to start working on a solution for this. Its times like this I wish my programming skills where a bit.... less shitty.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:35:51
Time to close my Chase account, I don't like the idea of them deciding where I can and can not spend MY Money.
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:01:42
I like that idea. +1
@_date: 2013-07-09 06:03:23
Use some of the profits to buy a better camera. Or scanner. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:29:34
I've always been of the mindset of 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket' I also have a blockchain.info wallet but I only keep ~0.1BTC in that account. I also have an Electrum Wallet on my computer with ~0.25 - 0.5BTC and the majority of my coin is in an Offline paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:56:38
They've offered it for at least 3 Months.
@_date: 2013-06-15 00:56:47
That's brilliant! Still I'd be hesitant to hide something of value in a nickel, way to easy to mix up.
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:22:42
Not invested when it was ~$1 I remember thinking I should buy a few hundred worth of it. I even went as far as "I'll do it friday!" never did.
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:33:15
You can give them a wallet to send your coins to after the transaction is complete. You could give them an address to a cold storage wallet if you wanted to.
EDIT: More details here:  Select "Bitcoins to Wallet" Under "TRANSACTION METHODS"
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:26:01
Add a tab to fold over and cover the private key and I think that would be pretty damn awesome.
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:57:52
Or keep a hard copy of my private keys? when dealing with something like this, a fresh install every so often doesn't seem that bad.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:12:50
[Gliph]( allows pairing to a Coinbase account which means you can send coin to other Gliph users but still not simply to a bitcoin address.
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:31:25
Coinbase invites the recipient to create a wallet on coinbase.com. the coins are then deposited in there account.
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:16:51
I REALLY like [Electrum]( You can restore your wallet with the [seed]( they [generate]( I saved my seed in plain text on an truecrypt encrypted USB stick.
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:46:19
Contact a collection agency. they will take a cut but its better than nothing. They will hound them for the money and if they still dont pay it will at least affect there credit.
@_date: 2013-06-25 15:03:04
So is it still 10,000BTC for a pizza?
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:48:06
with Gliph you dont know the users bitcoin address, your sending it to a user on Gliph which means your trusting Gliph to pass the correct address on to blockchain.info to make the transfer.
I've never actually sent money using Gliph directly but this is how I understand it works.
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:14:03
You dont need to be registered to purchase coins with bitinstant, registration only gives you greater limits. Also I registered my account a few hours ago with no problem.
EDIT: From the link I posted above: "Either log-in to your BitInstant account, make a new account by adding your information **or continue as a guest**. The information that you provide will determine transaction limits."
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:19:11
Might have to check this out. I live about 5 minutes from mission trails. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:55:17
Brilliant! I'm generally not a fan of online wallets, but I don't keep all my coin in one location ether. Having a few here for easy access and the bulk in cold storage may be just what I've been looking for.
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:28:33
I'll bite and check it out. 12vCTxmUjWU8K7JBaMQVcL9ysVgakfjDAF

Honestly not a bad idea. 
@_date: 2013-08-30 00:33:34
I seriously love Electrum. I have my wallet on 2 machines. if one goes poof I still have a second. to move all my coins to a new secure location.
@_date: 2013-08-07 15:17:38
100% Agree I love Bootstrap =D
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:20:51
Never invest more than you can afford to lose...
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:19:59
Cold storage FTW. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 03:53:27
I'm still using Coinbase. after your verified you can get coins instantly when you buy.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:54:56
Another option is [BitTorrent Sync]( Sync your folders across multiple computers you own, its P2P among your computers, not ever stored on a 3rd party server.
EDIT: Not downplaying SpiderOak by any means, just tossing another option out there, SpiderOak looks amazing and I may actually sign up.
@_date: 2013-07-04 14:53:47
[Coinbase]( is how I started. Very easy, but a little slow on delivery. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:20:27
I really like them for buying and selling coin but dont expect to use them for day trading as the process to buy usually takes a few days. I'd say move the coins over to something like [CampBX]( or [BTC-E]( for day trading.
That being said I really dont have much experience in day trading bitcoin so I'd look at some comments from more experienced traders.
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:29:14
The bulk of my coins sit in cold storage. Then some on my daily use computer. Less than 5% on web wallets. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:23:25
Been doing the same for some of my side work.
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:29:03
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:00:24
I prefer electrum because I don't have to wait for the sync all the time. BUT I run my own node for it to sync with so I'm not trusting a 3rd party. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:01:24
Just buy from sellers with a good reputation. This is one of the major things to pull me to Bitcoin in the first place.
