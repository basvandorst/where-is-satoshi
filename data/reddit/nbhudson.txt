I have been waiting for a bank deposit to become available in my igot account, the amount is for $5000.00 AUD. It has been more than 3 days and I have contacted both contact points advised by iGot and by rickigot to NO response at all.
Where is my support? If there is an issue then I should be notified accordingly, not ignored by your support team! You are managing people's money, understand that this is sensitive and treat your customers accordingly.
Why is your business able to receive such large funds deposited into your account by your customers and then not provide even close to adequate support??
This is not good enough and I demand a response to my enquiries.

I'm assuming that the reason is because the deposit didn't come from my bank account, however it was my wife's cousin and this can be verified. I just need to be responded to so I can complete the approval process! This is ridiculous!!
