Armory offline wallet.

My apologies for the late reply. So are you basically saying that if God himself checked every single standard private key for bitcon addresses possible that he would not end up with access to any of my coin in my multisig address? 
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:47:27
Thank you for the responses.

If you went to a cold storage install, I don't think you get the keys from any of the addresses you created other than the few you started with on the cold storage install. I could mistaken, but I am pretty positive. This is how it works for Electrum too. 
I have no help for you other than to completely uninstall armory and bitcoin qt and then reinstall just armory and then install the blockchain through armorys interface and that should work. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:10:56
Yes, you need to download the blockchain so Armory can get online. Then you can access all your keys and do everything else. I imagine you only have some of your money because the cold storage install only included the first few private keys/addresses. I believe you need to connect to the network to get the rest. You must be doing something wrong because clearly Armory *will* go online if you set it up properly.

Stop deleting and reposting your downvoted comments moron.

But will you get banned for discussing it?
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:23:31
Lol @ you butts upvoting this. It's a culmination effort. If people were only donating large amounts, they would miss out. When 100 people donate 75 cents, it's 75$, or probably 10% (maybe less after yesterday) of the cost of monthly server requirements at the moment (not to mention actual man power). Obviously they aren't there yet, but this applies to everything. Don't buy into this negativity. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:13:00
lol about being worried about personal data in 2015. Protect your assets and it's enough. Anyone can get your info if they want lol.

Buying bitcoin is also gambling. You're wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:40:22
No, Dash was a huge instamine scam. It's anonymity is also much weaker compared to something using cryptonote such as Monero.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:41:28
I don't see why it would be removed. Definitely would have been very useful for me right now.

They better free their minds instead.

Oh okay, thanks for the information. I never actually had a use for the feature until now. That would actually make more sense though. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:30:32
Wish I owned VOAT right now. Server issues would have been fixed weeks ago the first time. Hope they get it up soon/realize if they invest now it will pay off later. Fuck reddit. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:33:45


Who said anything like that? Good thing you are adding "IMO" to everything you say, because it's certainly nothing more than that. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:06:05


Lol. Except you forget the fact that this is the first generation ever to have the internet, AKA the information age.  We are going forward whether the remaining ignorant masses like it or not.

Grab 840 litecoins.

Flooding to litecoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:42:25
It can also handle 4x the amount of transactions bitcoin can because litecoin has a 1mb block ever 2.5 minutes instead of every 10 minutes, just sayin.

Lmao, step out of the thread. You embarrass me.

If you import a private key into breadwallet, the funds are not backed by your seed correct? Similar to electrum?

Trade for 3 litecoins and hodl. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:00:00
You're right. Litecoin is much more promising.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:11:11
This. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:34:44
Ltc, nmc, xmr and that's it. Nothing else seems good for the long term. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:20:24


When you say "I was explaining why your solution is wrong." I take that as insulting *and* disrespectful just for your information. Stop playing victim.
Also, if you can't understand I'm talking about the digital information age and computers while on a bitcoin forum, I have no help for you.
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:19:22
"then they fight you"
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:40:42
I'm talking about the digital age. Information on everything at the access of your finger tips, embeddable implants, downloadable knowledge. Not talking about printing press and libraries. Completely different. Should be obvious to anyone not looking to start petty arguments.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:00:15
Books = information age? Lmao wtf?? Sorry for assuming I was talking to someone who wasn't an ignorant plebeian. Your opinions are invalid. Please stop sharing.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:12:22
Either copy &amp; paste the address or use your phone to scan the QR code lol. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:31:08
I'm responding to the part about typing an address. There's generally no need to do that unless someone does something counterproductive like handwrite and address and give it to you. I do think there will be vanity like address implementations that will be used in certain scenarios in the future. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:35:54
So people go back to blissful ignorance? Don't see that happening after the era of knowledge. Steps forward, not back.

Should take litecoin as well.

You must be new to crypto.
