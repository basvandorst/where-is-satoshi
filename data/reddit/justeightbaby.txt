That value is contained in that sub economy. A baseball card is only valuable to baseball card collectors. A baseball card worth $12,000 will not but you food at a grocery store. Outside of the collectors it has 0 value. The difference between Pokemon cards, video games, bottles of water and cryptocurrency is that you can play with those cards, you can play the video games, and you can drink that bottle of water. They have real value. If you sell any of them for Bitcoin you are only going to be able to participate in a sub economy that holds no intrinsic value.

Until governments accept cryptocurrency as payment for taxes everybody will have to pay fees to services such as coinbase to exchange cryptocurrency. 
How will a country adopt a global currency such as Bitcoin when they have no way to identify and tax their citizens? What incentive do citizens have to identify themselves in order to pay more taxes when they can keep all the money from cryptocurrency? 
If global currency is what the entire population of Earth wants wouldn't there need to be a reconstruction of cryptocurrency to accommodate the value that every country already has?

Throughout the thread I've been backing my premise through example and questioning.

The end result of a cryptocurrency is still Capitalism. The money will find its way to a small group of people who will then dictate it's use. I see the blockchain as very useful but not in the form of currency. The average person will not see a benefit in jumping from capitalism 1.0 (government backed Fiat Currency) to 2.0 (Decentralized Digital Fiat Currency) when they are behind and all the initial resources have been scooped. If anything goes wrong they also have nobody to blame.

Bullets don't help much in a nuclear war. Bullets, resources, and influence will likely impose the will of the influencer(s) more than a cryptocurrency. If the person with bigger guns says "Bacon is the most valuable resource" that doesn't leave much room for cryptocurrency. Nobodies trading bullets for ones and zeros.

Right now cryptocurrency has little worth in the United States. What's to stop a company from asking for a million bitcoins for a bottle of water? You have 0 bargaining power. Dollar/Euro/Cryptocurrency are all Fiat Currency. Cryptocurrency is not "real" money when it's just like the rest. It's just transparent in the inflation and trade of it.

I stand corrected. My leading line should be Bitcoin and Ethereum are worthless unless you're able to pay your taxes with them. 
If governments chose to adopt a global cryptocurrency my initial assertion would be incorrect. However, global adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum do not account for the value that governments already hold in resources. Bitcoin and Ethereum are also not fit for a government to identify tax payers due to built in anonymity. In the future Bitcoin and Ethereum and all current cryptocurrency will hold no value outside of their own sub economic system.

Hope would government regulate this? They aren't able to identify you. Bitcoin and other decentralized apps don't require real information. The government would not know I had Bitcoin unless I disclose it. Who wants to be taxed more? Not I.

I don't see it as criminal but I guess.

If the world did decide to do so I believe it would be a cryptocurrency that hasn't been formed yet. Every country has a budget and I'm sure they don't want to start from 0.

I think it's much simpler than that. If a country does not accept cryptocurrency as legal tender to pay taxes they could still lean your Bitcoin along with any other property and auction it off to pay them. 
Businesses could accept Bitcoin but that doesn't mean that governments would accept it as payment for taxes. Bitcoin is only valuable in the Bitcoin economy.

Who's to say that the previous establishments will let happen? There's no incentive. A UN backed global system will render Bitcoin useless. Until you can pay taxes in Bitcoin it cannot replace Dollars/Euros.

Depends on how SHTF. In what way do you see a future where SHTF and the world bends over to people with Bitcoin? Something that has no value outside of a computer.

Gold has real use. You can build things with it. It is used in products that are sold. It's one of the most adaptable resources on the planet.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:24:33
How would you distribute the current value of a country with the current systems that have not accounted for the value a country already holds?
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:10:52
I don't believe a SHTF instance will happen in my life. All the possibilities of the ones I do see don't result in an open and free internet that has a civil restructuring of power through cryptocurrency.

They may have access to you but unless they have a warrant they can't search you. I'm sure people have already thought of plenty of ways to avoid it by now. 
I'm sorry but it reminds me of the short story "The Emperor's New Clothes." Just because you believe that there's value, you could be being exposed, and later realize there was nothing there the whole time. Regardless I'm willing to change my beliefs if my logic is flawed. Only time will tell.

It's 5% of it's trade value in a stable economy. The reason gold is traded much higher is because people believe when SHTF that gold will be a valuable trading resource in an unstable economy. Same for silver.

English classes taught me to have a good opening line. The rest of the argument is presented afterwards.

I understand that. I know that Fiat Currency works under a perceived value. But, when you sell a car at a dealership you have to keep records of that sale and pay taxes at the end of the year. The government does not value Bitcoin and you are forced to sell your Bitcoin in order to pay taxes. If you don't then you are now operating illegally and the government can come after you. The systems of old traded silver and gold but that was also backed by government. It's not the same.

The value of those companies are that they have user data that they can sell to other companies to have targeted advertising. They also hold value in that they offer legitimate services. Facebooks initial service helps you connect with people, Googles initial service helps you search the internet, Amazons initial service is to sell you goods. Bitcoin offers no initial value and it's future value is dependent on being accepted by governments or operating strictly as a sub economic system.
