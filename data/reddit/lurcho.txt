If I'm not mistaken, you can throw your weight around the Mojang offices and have it implemented in one way or another. I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet considering your previous history with PayPal.

So when are you going to offer microtransaction cosmetic items for bitcoin? I'm waiting.

If it's the same thing as hearing dead people laughing, then yes.

How is the postal service not going to notice animals being mailed through their system? You could get a lot of things on the Road but endangered species was not one of them. However, it did sell deer jerky for a time.

I was surprised to see a Minecraft specific currency (CraftCoin). I'm not sure why people would pick it over BitCoin for buying server specific items, or how Mojang would react to a game currency outside of their control, but it's a neat niche.

I just purchased 3 BTC off Coinbase and this is what's running through my head right now.

I had a feeling this idea was too good to not be done already.

Personal anecdote: I couldn't afford Christmas this year if it weren't for bitcoin. I bought in at $200 per coin and I spent a little under a bitcoin when the price broke the $1000 ceiling. So for some of us, we see bitcoin as a cost saving tool. Plus it's a super neat way to spend money.
I've been waiting for the day to increase my bitcoin stash and that day has finally arrived.

I don't care if it rains or freezes, as long as I've got my Bitcoin Jesus.

My brain hurts, but I learned something new today.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:56:42
I hope not because I just celebrated by buying 3 pairs of alpaca socks for the mom, grandmother and girlfriend. It's not every day you make an investment that triples in value in less than two weeks. I want this to be the peak so I can get one last chance at acquiring cheap bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:08:56
I doubt HSBC cared whether or not their accounts they were using to launder cartel drug money were legitimate or not.  It must be great to profit off the suffering and death of innocent lives and never ever face jail time. You are clearly trying to maintain the status quo on a technology platform that threatens its ability to maintain power and control. But keep going, I find these attempts very amusing. Keep fighting for the industry as it slowly fails to evolve. Watch what happens.

I hope you left a shitty review for them on Glassdoor. You made the right move though, no company is worth going to prison over.

I made a small purchase already via bitcoin, but I'll buy into this as well assuming Coinbase pulls through that particular day.

I'm pretty sure that "crowd-funding assassinations" effort is about as effective as Occupy Wall Street. It's an anti-bitcoin scam that doesn't do anything to anybody, and the more idiots who put their money into it, the more valuable the rest of our bitcoins are.
I'll believe it when I read it in the news. Armchair anarchists tend to do jack squat about anything.

Congratulations, you won the bitcoin lottery. Get a lawyer and a tax accountant ASAP. Don't disclose any amounts on public forums like reddit because it paints a huge target on your back. Figure out how to secure your coins right away. In fact you should delete this thread once you get all the information you need. Lastly, don't live your life any differently than you are now. People's perception of you and all your relationships will change if they know you are a bitcoin baron.

I bought 3 XBC when the price was around $200 and I feel pretty good about my investment. I can only imagine what they'll be worth when I retire 40ish years from now. Maybe I'll buy an apartment on the moon.

Whatever you do, never trust an online wallet for any significant amount of money. Always always always use a local client and make encrypted backups. Also get some anti-virus software for your computer (I use Microsoft Security Essentials + Malwarebytes Antimalware) and run a tight ship.

Install Armory, put your bitcoins into it and print out a paper wallet. Then uninstall it and put the paper wallet in a lock box and/or safety deposit box.
