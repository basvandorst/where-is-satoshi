intels sh*tcoin incoming, relatively late in market terms speaking.
interesting if this will add any value and how much a "mikkel" will be worth in a year or so, big brand name of course, that could help to boost.

On Gox, why?
No, seriously, Ledger is great and not that pricy (forget about the Unplugged though).

"high submission volume" yeah sure, truth hurts, ain't it.

of course bitcoin, what else should be the next candidate, gold again?

i think that's the way all these unnecessary and excessive middleman try to stay in the game:
1) spend lots of money on lobbying
2) against any resistance force "regulation"
3) when access to btc gets nearly impossible -&gt; watch the liberation of monery die

there will always be people like that, ranting on open source software which they are using but not taking part in the development.
they will email you with questions, when you answer and help them they won't even thank you.
they won't donate.
they won't star your project.
they won't help spread the word.
they just use the sh*t out of your software and rant when a tiny part doesn't work as they expect.
fu*k them.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:36:16
taking advantage of anti bitcoin clickbait momentum at its best.
consider that titles like that, no matter what the fu*kin fu*k stands in the text, do have a psychological effect.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:51:34
wtf is he talking about?
is this part of anti bitcoin propaganda or is this guy trying to sell clickbaits (he's doing it at the right time), or simply has he no clue ...
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:00:30
I marned you!
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:55:14
i hope he stays gone.
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:55:38
first off, they're registered in British Virgin Islands and not "North Cyprus".
second, you have no evidence whatsoever to show, so i'd rather tend to think you're making this up.
of course no one can be sure and logging data would be a huge security issue, but as long as there is no evidence you got to stick with the official version ...
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:57:19
i bought coins yesterday and didn't transfer them to my ledger, i hope this will still be possible ...

Next Block Fee: fee to have your transaction mined on the next block (10 minutes). $9.32

soon sub 3300 as it seems
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:00:27
that's a very shortened chain of thought.

- Hardbit - seems legit
- Coolwallet (seem to be shipped, but the software isn't ready yet: wiith aimed delivery time in Novemenber)
- bwallet - you need to build the hardware on your own ...
- Case Wallet - you're right, seems legit 
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:46:04
how's that?
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:36:51
reality check, there are 4 hardware wallets as of date, the rest is in the makings.
- Trezor
- Ledger
- Black Arrow eWallet (ugly Trezor rip-off, have never ever seen any in action)
- and today KeepKey
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:30:36
of course you should
edit: and you should also have a strong stomach sitting out till sub $100

damn, U.S. only again.

nah, he just bought yesterday at the price of 500...
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:02:56
are they actually really shipping already?
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:36:58
no, he isn't.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:41:50
but damage may already be made to bitcoin. irreversible and completely unnecessary, i just hope this fool gets what he deserves.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:53:35
complete shenanigan.
watch this guy talk on youtube, he is evasive and clueless.
the real satoshi(s) must have tons of working papers, machines with testcode, unfinished code &amp; studies produced along the process only someone who worked really long on this stuff can have as also logins to all accounts used by satoshi - show us that.
but damage may already be made to bitcoin, it's all over the newspapers, worldwide.
irreversible and completely unnecessary, i just hope this fool gets what he deserves.

that's Bootstrap v3.0.0 (released on 19 Aug 2013).
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:02:57
the moment when the news came out they're under investigation it was clear to me one should get out of there immediately.
hab about 40$ worth of sh*tcoins, currently worth &lt; 2$.
i don't even bother to get them out, not worth the hassle - get ready to be goxxed (got my gox coins out about ~3 weeks before the fiasco, it was also clear to me then, one has to read the signs ...).
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:15:14
hasn't russia kindof banned bitcoin recently?
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:44:39
