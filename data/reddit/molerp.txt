That's cool. Can you lower the price please?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:04:25
Wow! Thank you very much! It's appreciated. I've learned my lesson about checking recommended fees before sending anything

If I send BTC from an older version of Electrum to a bc1 address, will it go through?

Just a quick update: I have received a refund into my wallet this morning after contacting cardservices last night

It's a tracfone alcatel one touch. Android. Model No. is A571VL

I'm experiencing the same thing as you. I submitted my photo 2 or so weeks ago and still nothing. I haven't fussed because of similar complaints on this sub but this is getting ridiculous :/

I'm pleased to see this isn't as rare as I thought. I sometimes feel insane checking the address as much as I do before hitting send

Some malware is sneaky and can easily evade AV scans, but please continue scanning your machine for anything. Also scan for rootkits using MalwareBytes antirootkit or something similar. You should also notify Electrum devs so they can check the binary.
Please keep us all updated.

Bitcoin is finished. Move on. It's over. Apply for a new credit card instead so you're not scammed in the future

Existential dread keeps me awake at night anyway. At least I have Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:01:36
Good point. It's easy to forget how much bigger Bitcoin gets everyday

He's right. I've been playing poker for years and the difference between today and just 2 years ago is massive. If you don't keep up, you're going to be blown away by these kids.
I'm referring to online poker btw. Your standard $1/2 game in a casino is still a fishfest.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:46:44
Yeah we know. People say the same shit everytime it crashes.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:35:21
No, I don't remember, but that's because you're not important.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:46:11
You actually took the time to dig all of this up? What a toxic person you are.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:31:46
Because Bitcoin itself is a great technology that many people around the world use for everyday things. Not everyone stares at the price all day and speculates

Going on three months for me. Emailed them and they said they have a backlog. It's not awfully urgent anyway as I am on other exchanges but I would like to check them out sometime!
