I'd invite him to join our Bitcoin meetups / talks.
I guess he lives in Zurich, since Mike worked in Googles Zurich Office.

Can I still use LocalBitcoins with my German bank account selling for Euros while living outside of Germany?

Ok, so today we bash Peter Todd, tomorrow luke-jr again, who is next?
Have you considered doing something usefull with your time, like those guys do?
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:35:05
They are a company. You don't need to / can't make a donation to a company. There are plenty of open source projects that could use your donation.
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:32:56
SUSE, OTRS, Google (Android), Apple (BSD), Wordpress.com, Oracle (MySQL, Java, ..), MariaDB Corporation, MongoDB Inc., Neo4j, and many more

I already did that ones for in another thread, but he doesn't care about facts.

Any plans to lower the fee?
1% is quite a lot.

My experience wit the Pirate Party (although not in the Netherlands) is that they're mostly socialists with some internet freedom. They hide their face behinde things like privacy, internet, copyright and don't say much about stuff like social system, military, political system, taxes etc which IMO are more important.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:14:41
Pics or didn't happen ;)
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:11:20
Voluntary is the definition of freedom for me.
So Agorism is a political form of freedom.

Yes, because my grandma cares alot about the block size. She told me, if this doesn't get consensus she will go with Ripple.
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:02:40
At least they don't call it the new Colored Coins 'Standard' anymore. I don't see advantages over the simplicity of Open Asset.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:52:29
That was a general suggestion for the OP and everyone else that wants to build a node on a Pi 2. Or an invitation for discussion, like I understood OPs reddit post too. Thanks for your valuable contribution to that.
Wouldn't be very difficult to ship preloaded SD cards (or with device) with something like that on it for Plug 'N Play OOTB full nodes.
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:11:26
Please! Then all of you can go to @_date: 2015-05-19 12:17:51
Looks like an advertisement page for GetHashing Cloud.
What's the difference between your web wallet and Coinprism? Beside the built-in advertisement for your cloud hashing thing.

Not true. Not everyone who has commit access is paid by the Bitcoin foundation. Not even the majority. And nothing ever got merged that doesn't have a consensus by the majority of the contributors (if they would do that, people would develop in a fork).
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:47:49
Yes, go on and fork testnet.
The 'official' testnet will still be 1MB, since people want to use it for testing other stuff too.
@_date: 2015-05-07 08:57:45
Nobody is forcing you to run the upstream Bitcoin Core verison. Run your own modified version.
However, like the Bitcoin Core developer can't you also can't force other people to run the version you want. If you don't like that everyone has the choice feel free to leave.
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:07:14
Everyone that contributes to Bitcoin Core is a Core Dev(eloper).
It's not an 'official' title given by any central authority.

Regarding other recent news about XAPO I've done some research:
Since XAPO moved their official company to Switzerland I guess this is them: 
(The only company under the name XAPO in Switzerland).
I visited that address a few days ago, they didn't even have a own mailbox. In theory it might be a legal advantage when their company is based in Switzerland, but everyone knows the US government doesn't care about that if your founders, employees etc. are in the US. If you do business in the US or live there you have to play after their rules (e.g. see UBS), so having an address in Switzerland is pointless IMO. Nobody should feel saver because of that.
Edit: Next I'm going to check Shapeshift.io. I guess it's the same for them, because their address also points to a notary in Zug.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:34:24
Yes, he should make a test altcoin and all the pro guys can go and test it's limits. without putting any real value in.

Donated to coinb.in
Charged my Namecheap account after missing a deadline for a domain.
And since the week isn't over yet, some beer at the Bitcoin meetup tomorrow ,)

If you want the block size increase make your own fork of Bitcoin Core and run that. There you have your leadership.
If I want a currency with a leader I can take fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:04:24
This commit also tells us he reviewed (at least) the readme. Every contribution is valuable.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:29:10
I'd like to see a blog post from him about how he would manage a hard fork safely.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:21:06
It's vaporware. They are talking about this since ages.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:10:55
You should get a Desktop Wallet. E.g. download from  or Bitcoin Android Wallet: 
Those you named are webservices, not real wallets.
To buy Bitcoins (after you have a wallet), go to a ATM, localbitcoins.com or an exchange like kraken.com.
@_date: 2015-05-13 13:41:51
How I would build it:
* Big SD card (32 or 64 GB) instead of USB stick
* No WiFi (or optional)
* Wait for the next Bitcoin Core release with pruning on
* Super simple web-interface where you can adjust the pruning-level / blockchain size if needed, instead of full UI. Maybe there is already something like this? Should be easy to build with the JSON-RPC interface

Do you want to force others to use your implementation of Bitcoin with 20MB per block? You can't.
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:42:55
I don't own a single apple device and I'd never buy one (being an open source fan). But if the market demands products to have such a chip inside, Apple will follow. Like they did with the Bitcoin wallets.
@_date: 2015-05-07 09:11:22


oh no, please not! We need you! Having you on board with your valuable comments is so important for Bitcoin.
"Do it my way or I leave" buhuuu
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:15:17
Also have a look at libbitcoin, and alternative implementation that is already modular and well designed. Code is much easier to read.

Life ain't fair and it will never be. But it can better than now, and Bitcoin is certainly a big step in that direction.

Commercial Register of Canton Zug: 
XAPO Website Terms claiming to be based in Switzerland:
The reason I post this:
The US doesn't care if your company is registered in Switzerland or not. If you live and work in the US they will put so much pressure on you until you do what they want. 
Don't think Swiss privacy law (or any other protection) applies to you when having Bitcoins at XAPO.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:48:38
It is, but like I wrote above that isn't worth mutch when your people are in the US.
@_date: 2015-07-08 09:53:15
Thanks for clarifying. I'm looking forward to see Xapo employees at our Bitcoin meetups :)
Will the managment move to Switzerland?
Moving out of the US is a key point to get all the benefits from Swiss law you mentioned in the Coindesk articel.

Show me the source code.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:50:51


Doesn't say anything regarding an open source client. Where do you have your information from?
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:42:24
I don't see any source code there that looks like a OT / triple-signed-receipt system.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:28:18
Shouldn't it be the other way around? They aren't using the open source code from Open Transactions anymore. Show me the source code of what they use now.
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:42:25
If they would be a bit more transparent we'd know..
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:19:36
They aren't closing the client source because they didn't release anything open source. They can't close the OT source since they don't own it.
I only believe in actions (releasing something as open source) and not in guesses (there aren't even statements that it will be open source).
@_date: 2015-03-18 07:08:21
They write there that they wont use Open Transactions anymore. I'm talking about their source code.
