Yeah, open up the dvd drive and insert it there. If no dvd drive, external drives are quite cheap.

You asking a group of people invested in bitcoin if bitcoin a good investment? Would you go to and ask them if Liverpool football club was a good team expecting impartial advice?
Do your own research. 
If after that, if you feel its a good investment then buy. If not, don't.

Going to get down voted for saying it but you wasting your time.
All these people saying it's great and well done, you can bet your last satoshi they pay for their cutz with cash. 
Make a new post in 3 months and see if I'm wrong.

Then you need to use your own judgement on which expectations are most likely. If you are still confused then I would suggest this is definitely not the time for you to invest and more research is required until you are confident in your decision.

A) Is he a geeky twat that for as long as you have known him has never had a girlfriend?
B) Does he leave his hand-built computer on 24h a day and even when he's not using it, the fan still going at full speed?
If the answer to the "a" then yes he's a miner. If the answer to "b" is yes then possibly. If a no to both than no.

Using a android device, what's the simplest and easiest, non technical way to use LN.?
I don't have a node, not even sure what a node is to be honest. Is there a simple android app that can both send and receive bitcoin via LN.? Have looked at a couple but they only seem to be able to send. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:10:40
It's android. Is it easy to set up?
Edit, and is it on pkaystore?
