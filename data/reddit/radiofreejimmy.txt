I could, of course, set up solar panels (which would pay for themselves too, in time) - what is a cutting edge mining machine ?

Yeah, Isn't that also what Courtney's therapist told her regarding Curt Cobain ?

Does anyone have a brief link with Kramer saying this - maybe even a loop ?

let me rephrase my question - ignoring electricity and having thew capital to buy the best of the best rigs...  would it pay for itself ? I see your points, slumping market, high price of rigs... of course, everyone who is doing would really want to discourage others from doing it too right ?
So, i have to ask you in all fairness, do you have a rig ?  Why buy on an exchange when i can mine it like Crateer of Diamonds State park ?  Had to drop that one, i have wanted to do that park for a long time.

Reddit has so successfully bludgeoned me for even thinking about bitcoin mining that I eventually wrote to the Bitcoin foundation just to see what they think.  Tough love they called it.  When I saw Gavin's remarks re: these companies, I immediately put it out of my mind.  Thanks for your kind reply (I know, I know, imagine that, I feel like I need to thank every single redditor for a non-abusive or unimformative reply)

Thank you for your kind reply. Everyone said PONZI re: rented and I am inclined to believe that.  Something fundamentally wrong with the concept and if Bitcoin Foundation was renting the space, yeah, count me in.
The other question I have too is if the rental providers are only geared to do Bitcoin.  Sadly, I was recently robbed and the monies I would have used to even experiment are now gone too --- so, I guess it has all become academic --- luckily I am an inventor and I do have an idea I want to run with some day if I can only get myself clear in any way of my financial woes.

I was thinking about getting into the game late with the attitude better now than never. I was bludgeoned by redditors. Just buy some they said. uhg.

yeah, i hear everyone here loud and clear.  It appears that the thing to do would be to develop my own coin if I was going to try and get ahead of the curve again but I know that is not happening.  I was hoping to set my daughter up with a mining rig actually...   another redditor sent me links with China's huge bit coining operations, uhg.
Edit: reddit's autocorrect changed radiator to redactor hahahaha,  hmmmmmmm

Ok, look, why with the abuse ?
Hey, explain it to me like I'm five if you really thin I'm an idiot.
Otherwise, pics links or commentary which is useful.
Cah-peesh ?
Yes, i always upvote responses even if i disagree with them.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:25:46
Don't feel bad ?  Cripes I saw it early on and then just plain laid an egg when i knew it was right - fuck.  Of course, I have thought of making my own coin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:37:57
IF I had been convinced that it was not too late, I would have made a run at it as long as it could pay for itself but apparently this is not the case now.  Gone from feeling bad to feeling stupid too, now.
