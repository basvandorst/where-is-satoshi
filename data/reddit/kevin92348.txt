You also have to pay taxes on your gains, and effectively reset the cost basis for the amount you spend (spend $40, pay capital gains, buy $40 at the current price). Also, depending on how much you are spending, you can get into a situation where you move from long term to short term capital gains, which can definitely cost you money.

I don't think the sending side would be as difficult. A lot of communities have sms available, so they'd be able to still send via sms, while the satellites would provide a high bandwidth way to get the blockchain.

And it's still at $3575.

I believe it's based on your primary residence, so you'd have to move to Texas and then sell (and then stay there for a year).
That said, at a certain point, and depending on your personal situation, this could become worth it.

Thank you! I found the overview to be pretty understandable. I'm guessing this could function within a wallet by giving you the ability to move funds into the lightning network, and then any transactions within these funds would be instantaneous (as long as both parties cooperate). Funds could also be moved back into your main balance. Kind of line a line of credit, but your main wallet acts as the source rather than a bank acting as the source.
One question - what's the state of it / when can we expect widespread use?

I personally think people are overreacting here. There is a risk in storing your bitcoins at an exchange, but in my mind Coinbase is fairly safe.
The 2 factors at play to help you make your decision are:
1. Are you comfortable with a hardware wallet? This can be more dangerous than leaving them with Coinbase if you don't know what you are doing.
2. How much money is involved? For a few $100, I'd just leave them on Coinbase, and work on getting comfortable with a hardware wallet, or paper wallet.

That would be awesome!

This does bring up a good point though. Right now there really isn't any advantage to pay in bitcoin vs a credit card. In fact there is a disadvantage. My options are:
1. Pay with a credit card and get 2% back in points
2. Pay with bitcoin and pay a fee.
Ideally there would be a way for the recipient to pay the fee, and merchants would start pricing the cost of accepting credit cards + the fraud risk into the transactions, or give a discount when purchasing with bitcoin.
I'd love to see someone offer bitcoin as a payment option and provide a discount for using it. Until then it seems unlikely that it will obtain widespread use for everyday transactions.

I had similar questions (as the GP) about lightning network after watching the video posted above, but I found this explanation to be pretty understandable if anyone is still confused:

I'm curious to hear from people that have been selling on it, and how it's working for them. I sell a number of things on Amazon and Ebay, and I'd consider listing on OpenBazaar as well.

You could even send your transaction via a sms message since this is very low bandwidth.

The fee is only 4% on Coinbase if you pay with a credit card. It's 1.49% with a bank account, or 0% on Gdax (if you are the maker. Otherwise 0.25%). Gdax is part of coinbase.

Do you have an estimate of how many items you have sold?
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:30:36
I've always pictured something like this embedded in a cell phone.

Based on the [public sales rank data]( and my personal experience, OP's story seems believable. I would estimate that they are selling &gt; 10k per month.

For people that aren't familiar with this: 3rd party sellers that use Amazon's warehouses (listings with the 'prime' label) store their inventory in Amazon's warehouses. For most items, including the Ledger Nano S, if a seller sends them brand new items with UPC codes, they let them 'commingle' their inventory. This means that Amazon scans the items when they receive them, and then puts them into shared inventory, giving the the seller 1 credit.
For any seller that commingles, including Amazon themselves, Amazon ships ones of the items out of the commingled inventory to customers.
tldr; It doesn't matter which seller you buy from - it's all coming from the same inventory.
