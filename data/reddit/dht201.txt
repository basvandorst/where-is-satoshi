There is too much Irrelevant or boring stuff in r/bitcoin.
Now spam too?!?

It’s look legit. 
He was attacking Facebook coin, and mentioned  and attacked bitcoin while doing it.

They rely on that people will trade on their platform and make profits from trading fees.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:48:06
Yes, he’s more afraid from Libra then bitcoin.
Because Libra have 1.2 users on Facebook.
And he know nothing about bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:14:11
Better then open Blockfolio every second ��
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:23:15
Didn’t get you.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:53:52
Did he hodl or didn’t?
 That’s more important.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:13:32
4 figures.
But it’s was obvious that this pump won’t last. Too early, 0-reasons, and no TA indicators for bull market.

That site is a trading platform?
If it’s, so they’re really smart.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:31:58
Who are those stupid who still buy mining rigs?!?  In the long run mining is not profitable compared to buying coins. 
Unless you have some free/low cost electricity or something.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:30:56
It can be.. but I don’t think man with als can preform good in order to come up with idea like bitcoin. But every thing is possible.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:21:40
I’m familiar with that video.
But why them? I don’t get any of the crypto meme that they appear in.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:35:54
Do you can imagine the ceo of Honda lunching super startup from scratch like spaceX? -No! 
Because elum musk is something you don’t see very often even among the successful people. 
Watch Elon musk interview at joe rogan you will understand what I’m talking about.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:34:30
When we will test 7k you will wait for 6k because there is big resistance there from 2018. 
Forget this, and do “dollar cost averaging”, if I was doing that from day 1 I’m in crypto I was with lambo already.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:15:15
Seems like an indicator for selling, for me too
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:03:40
Btw, how the user got the  hashtag?
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:32:29
You are looking at this the wrong way.
He was doing Tesla spaceX and bitcoin together that what costs him his marriage. Read how satoshi talk “.. I don’t have time to explain to you..” you can feel the man is doing other big project that equal to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:36:13
Smart move.
Every body on cryptoTwitter are super bullish, but the don’t even look on any indicator.
The rsi is shouting over bought.
The long/short tell there are too longs on leverage.
Ton of indicators tell me to sell but every body are over emotional and afraid of missing the pump (FOMOS).
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:25:13
Not a long time sell. Only until we hit lower support (9.2k)
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:18:02
You convinced me.
It’s plausible.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:16:29
100k is enough for me. I will still leave 10-20% for shorting (100k is the top, so 30-40 is the bottom) then buying back in case of 1M bitcoin in my life time.
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:09:13
Who are those bagdanoff?!? They really have something to crypto space, or it’s just an out of control meme.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:22:57
Can’t find it (I’m on my phone). Try searching in the caption of the video for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:24:16
I remember around 2007 (I think) there was a problem for PayPal holding usd for their user (or non USA citizens only, like me) because USA gov . That probably make  his first step to invent uncensored monetary sys.
Even though Elon is a big daydreamer because he want to build spaceX in order to colonize the moon for mankind . I don’t think he is too stupid too aim that far away before he achieved something bigger here on earth for humanity,  something like bitcoin.
Re watch the interview with joe Rogan when they speak about bitcoin, you can spot a little lie. 
And there is data that I want to check before I write it down, I don’t have time to check it.
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:57:34
70m ?

In crypto there is a lot of greed.
Greed is powerful then logic.
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:57:45
I’m betting/trading only on maximum 10% of my bitcoin. The rest is in hodl until 100k, but I’m sure that 100k is more far then anybody-else in our community thinks .
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:01:00
How you posted here with 6d account
And 50  karma only?!?
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:59:10
Elon musk. 95%
@_date: 2019-08-04 22:30:22
Elon musk == satoshi Nakamoto .
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:51:26
150 days if the hash rate stays as now ?
There is more variables for mining roi then electricity. In 150 days you probably will need maintenance and the more mining rigs more maintenance, and the time of system failures your rigs ain’t mining. 
When you hodl you can go to work every morning without worry to your rigs like a baby you left home alone.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:28:08
Reporters asking questions, so he must saying something.,, he isn’t posting articles about bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:56:49
That why I think it’s him.
Who in the early 2000 understand enough economics, know programming, better then PayPal founder.
And I have more data to back it up, that Elon musk invented bitcoin.

You scriptboy...

One day in the future this post will be screenshoted and people will say “WOW he gave him 500 satoshi, he probably reach now”. Just like today we say about 2009 posts that people gave  away hundreds of bitcoins for every one.
