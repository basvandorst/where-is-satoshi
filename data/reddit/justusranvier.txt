Ok, so the supply curve is flat and zero. Apparently just as close to zero at tiny block sizes as at large ones.


This effect only happens if the curve isn't flat and close to zero.
Which is it?
By the way, you've implicitly assumed there are no costs to geographical centralization. For one thing, there's no guarantee that the lowest electricity costs geographically will stay in the same geographical location (or will not be affected by all the miners trying to locate there).


The metric system defines the meter the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.
That is an arbitrary definition. Does that mean we can freely change it without consequence?
The metric system does not define a maximum number of meters, but what if they did. They could announce that, "measurements in excess of 10 meters are not defined by the metric system. If you want to measure something longer than 10 meters, you're required to use a different unit."
That would also be an arbitrary definition.
These two arbitrary definitions are equivalent, right? Since all standards are arbitrary, you can put whatever rules you want into one and they are all basically the same?
There clearly can not exist any method for determining which rules are better fit for their purpose and which ones are not.

IBLT shifts the focus from block propagation to transaction propagation, which is why I've been writing about price discovery for transaction relaying.
If users pay to have their transactions relayed, then they are paying for the network bandwidth they are consuming.
If IBLT means that miners have to broadcast the transactions contained inside their blocks prior to broadcasting the block itself, and if they have to pay to relay new transactions which they've created just like everybody else, then if they want to increase load on the the network by creating spam blocks they have to pay for the network bandwidth they consume as well.

Voting pool exist so that there will be fewer Mt Goxes and Bitcoinicas in the future.

You're reaching the exact backward conclusion from what the evidence actually says.
The situation we know to be safe is the block size limit sufficiently higher than the demand for transactions that it doesn't constrain actual block sizes.
*That's* the situation we've been in for the last five years.
Keeping the block size limit at 1 MB while the demand for transactions approaches, then exceeds, that value is the uncharted, experimental territory.

Why choose a number so low?
After all, it makes sense to make the number as close to 100% as practical if for no other reason than it makes the change less controversial now.
As long as a proposal is accepted in terms of being worked into the software upgrade cycle of all network participants, there's no particular urgency regarding when the actual protocol upgrade happens since the time needed for miners to produce new block versions is low if they've already put software in place the year before to be ready for it.

* Allow users to receive money even if they are not online
* Retain full functionality even if the users is on an SPV (or otherwise not a full node) wallet
1 Requires the notifications to happen on the blockchain
3 Means the notifications have to arrive at a predetermined script so that the light wallet knows where to look for them. This is very much where you **don't** want the actual payment to arrive.

And we are only just now running up against the limitations of the existing block size limit so now is the perfect time to get an increased limit in the pipeline.
The actual change doesn't need to happen now, but getting the new rules in earlier in the update cycle is preferable to waiting until the last minute.
It's a lot easier for everyone to have updated software that will raise the block size limit after 95% of the last 2016 blocks are version 4 and for miners to just refrain from mining version 4 blocks until immediately before they are needed, than it would be to wait for the network capacity to be exceeded then ask everyone to do an urgent update.

Even that won't be needed after a switch to O(1) block propagation, because then a miner can't produce a large block ex nihilo  - they'd have to first broadcast all the transactions that will be in the block.

Have you now changed your mind about whether or not I'm proposing a central plan?
What's described in that blog post is the design criteria for a new networking protocol which could be deployed alongside the existing one.
The primary difference between the two protocols is that the new one would have additional messages for setting up payment channels and communicating price lists.
Full nodes could enable or disable either protocol. They could even set all their prices to 0 if they wanted.
As the number of SPV users increases, the users who are willing to pay their providers should find their access to the network is improved.
That's all that would change from a user-visible perspective.
Enabling payment-based load balancing between nodes would be a separate project that's independent of the node-client protocol, but would probably be developer later.

What this proposal needs to work is a client-server protocol that includes the messages SPV clients use now, plus the messages from BitcoinJ that set up, manage, and close payment channels, plus a price list message the server can send the client.
A node should be able to set a different price for each client request so that if they want to charge more for filtered blocks than full blocks they can do so.
In order to make price-based load balancing work, each individual price could be a multiplier against a global price variable. That way the node would have a single pricing knob to control.

It shouldn't be considered a "good" as it's not produced.


Miners exist to perform a very simple task - make assertions about the relative ordering of conflicting transactions.
Proof of work means that it's very expensive for a miner to change their mind after making an assertion. Because of this expense the rest of the network has a reason to assume that miners will not change their mind on a whim and so treats the inclusion of a transaction in a block as strong evidence that everyone else will agree the transaction is valid over any conflicting transactions which may appear.

Paying for old data is trivially easy compared to paying for real-time bandwidth, so I haven't devoted much time to discussing it.
If an SPV node has obtained the block headers and wants to download full blocks to verify them, they can just announce which blocks they want in an appropriate communication channel and choose which archival nodes they buy them from via a simple auction.

Economic consensus in Bitcoin is independent from consensus among any individual group of developers.
Developers who oppose the consensus reached by the economic majority do not have the power to prevent the majority from acting on it, and they do not have the power to prevent some other developers from creating the software that embodies that consensus.
They can only produce or decline to produce the software which the economic majority will use.

If everyone in the network pays to have their transactions relayed, whether they are an end user or a miner, then there's no such thing as a "flooding attack" any more, because the "attackers" are compensating the people whose bandwidth they are consuming.
The problem is this model where nodes in the network give their bandwidth away for free to whoever asks to use it.
Replace that model with a market and the need to worry about how many resources any particular participant consumes is rendered moot.

Agree that he should switch to block numbers instead of timestamps.
Also think the proposal should go into affect immediately following a difficulty adjustment where 1916 of the last 2016 blocks (95%) are the new version.
Timing the change to leave the 5% who don't switch over with a very high difficulty and the longest possible time before they can adjust it downward is the best way to get 100% on the new version.

You shouldn't expect to be able to predict the exact composition and behavior of the mining industry in the future. If you could do that you would be able to solve the economic calculation problem and central planning would work.

SPV clients can only function if somebody expends scarce resources to support them.
_Somebody_ is going to pay for those resources, the only question is if the question of payment is going to be handled in an intelligent way, or not.
I think the intelligent way is to treat the service of providing connectivity to an SPV node in the exact same way as other services in the economy and allow the customer to pay the provider.
That's the model that ensures that the network can support massive growth by routing payments resources from the consumers of scarce resources to the providers of the same (Bitcoin users who run their own full node are always going to be a minority of users).

Block propagation time can be, and surely will be, made 0(1).
What this means is the only bandwidth capacity problem to worry about is that of transaction relaying. (With IBLT, before a miner can create 2GB block, they need to upload 2 GB of transactions to the network.)
This means that if we have working price discovery for transaction relaying, we no longer need to care about block size.

The "technical limit" is the necessity of miners to broadcast the transactions first before they can broadcast a (constant-size) block.

The way this started is that I wanted to stop using a static vanity address for the Austin Bitcoin meetup donation address.
I knew stealth addresses did what I want, but only Darkwallet supported them. Due to practical necessity, in order for the meetup to accept donations to a stealth address, we'd need for there to exist a mobile wallet that could at least send to stealth addresses, so I started [lobbying]( wallet developers to include this feature.
Then I started looking in to what it would take for mobile wallets to receive to stealth addresses, so I studied the Darkwallet/unSystem wiki to figure out how stealth addresses actually worked.
Avoiding the full chain scan (which mobile clients can't do themselves) means generating ECHD public keys deterministic instead of randomly (BIP-32).
After that it was just a matter of figuring out how to make all the requires pieces fit together correctly.

I don't think there's any way yet to rely on UTXO set commitments that retains the existing security model.
The fact that a miner included the hash of a particular UTXO set in a block does not prove that the set is valid.

I'm generally optimistic that some kind of zero knowledge proof could be developed in the future that would fix that, however.

Maybe the "PRESERVE ZEROCONF AT ALL COSTS" position could be more accurately characterized as "don't be an unnecessary douchebag when implementing new features" position?
Bandwidth limits and mempool limits might have an effect of not catching 100% of all double spend attempts, but they are not at all the same as encouraging miners to offer paid undermining of the ledger to their suite of services offered.
The reason we have miners is to resolve the question of "which transaction happened first?" in the event of a double spend.
The most obviously correct way for miners to behave is to honestly report which transaction they observed first.
If they decide to deviate from the obviously correct behaviour, and if they don't want to undermine their investment by degrading the value of the entire Bitcoin network, they should be _extremely careful_ to implement a policy that doesn't have the side effect of encouraging fraud.
That doesn't mean we can force miners determined to be evil to behave a certain way, but we can at least point the honest ones in the right direction (right direction for Bitcoin, not for competing currencies and projects).

Bitcoin transactions are expensive because the fixed cost of hashing is servicing a low number of transactions.
Options for correcting this solution include:
* Allowing the transaction rate to increase so that the cost of hashing is spread out over a larger number of transactions, resulting in a lower per-transaction cost
* Lock in the high per-transaction cost in the delusional belief that Bitcoin is so valuable that it will still be in demand even if it fails to deliver the useful service that made it valuable in the first place.

If it's as simple as using a LocalBitcoins username that Coinbase can scrape and easily associate with one of their customers, that's mostly a PEBKAC error.
What would be far more troubling is if Coinbase (either themselves, or through a contracted service) was performing network-level and/or blockchain-level analysis to determine which addresses are associated with LocalBitcoins.
It's possible that companies that attempt to determine transaction origination IP addresses could perform outgoing transactions from a LocalBitcoins wallet to find their IP address, then create a database of suspected LocalBitcoins addresses.
LocalBitcoins could fix this by changing the way in which they route outgoing transactions so that the IP address can not be harvested. They could run a bitcoind node with -onlynet=tor and -listen=0, and only broadcast outgoing transactions through that node.

The key point is that if the bandwidth for relaying transactions through the network is paid for by the people who use the bandwidth, then we no longer have to worry about using too much of it because the providers of that bandwidth will be compensated appropriately.
Part of achieving that is creating a protocol via which SPV wallets can pay full nodes, and the other part us payment-mediated routing between full nodes.
Once those things were in place, and after changes to block propagation (IBLT) that require miners to broadcast all transactions in their block ahead of time, all bandwidth allocation issues can be solved by achieving price discovery for transaction relaying.

I've been contemplating what MojoNation did right and did wrong for a long time, and specifically how to update their model for Bitcoin applications since 2012:
In particular, I think MojoNation's primary flaw was that price discovery was not automated on both the supply and the demand side. Price discovery happens when autonomous agents make independent decisions. Either this means automated software agents acting on behalf of humans, or it means humans have to sit around and daytrade their bandwidth/storage constantly.

There's nothing about running a native Bitcoin business that inherently requires being registered as a business with any government, as long as the operation of the business doesn't require banking. 
Everything a web site needs to actually deliver a product to customers can be purchased with bitcoins from a wide variety of international providers.
The question needs to be asked, "why register as a business at all?" and even if that course of action is determined to be beneficial there should be no default assumptions regarding which jurisdiction to choose.

The only reason people think the marginal cost of including a transaction is zero is because they are ignoring or overlooking some of the costs.
Before a miner can include a transaction in a block, they first need to learn about its existence and verify that it is valid.
Both of those operations consume scarce resources, so it will always be necessary for miners to allocate space in the blocks they produce.
There really is no such thing as a non-economic good. Anything that requires time, or energy, or matter to produce is scarce and requires allocation.
If you think the marginal cost of a scarce good is zero, it means you're missing something.

Yeah, that was a bad sentence.
For every payment code, there is a known notification address. Everybody can see which transactions which create outputs at that address.
This means everybody can also see any OP_RETURN output associated with those transactions.
Decoding the OP_RETURN output requires the private keys of the recipient's payment code, so an external observer won't know whether or not the OP_RETURN output actually contains a valid payment code at all, much less whose payment code is encoded if there is one.

Payment codes are supposed to be long-lived identifiers, which encourages them to be used many times.
If Alice sends Bob n payments during the rest of their lives, those n payment will require a minimum of n+1 transactions.
Yes, there's overhead created by the notification transactions. If the average n averaged across all users in the network is low, then the overhead is significant.
The best application for payment codes in terms of efficiency is by merchants who will tend to form long-term business relationships with their customers in order to raise the average n.
As far as losing the master key, because we're following the BIP43 recommendation you can use the same seed for payment codes that you use for a BIP-44 Bitcoin wallet.
It's possible to keep building off of the BIP-43 standard such that everyone just needs to create one truly random master seed, back it up appropriately, and then use it for most or all of their future cryptographic needs.
The fewer backups individuals need to to keep track of, the less likely they are to lose them.

"Decentralized" is a pointless buzzword that has no value.
Things I care about in my money:
1) Nobody can arbitrarily create more units
2) Nobody can exercise control over units that do not belong to them
Right now we get 1) from having a network that will reject as invalid any blocks that mint more than the allowed number of Bitcoins.
We get 2) from two sources: the same mechanism that insures 1) also rejects invalid scripts, so you can only spend funds by holding the correct private key. The other aspect of it is censorship-resistance.
We get that by the PoW mechanism. Existing miners can not blacklist competitors without doing more work than the competitors they want to keep out. If miners try to block valid transactions, they'll lose out to a miner who will accept them.
This is one reason it's important to get miners dependent on tx fee revenue instead of the subsidy.

I think you're getting a few different issues confused.
The number of currency units should be fixed, because money is [delayed recipriocal altruism]( and allowing the arbitrary creation of new units messes up that system.
We just had a roundtable discussion about this very issue at our meetup literally a few minutes ago: 
So regarding the number of units, it's a binary situation: either the number of units are fixed or they aren't. The actual number chosen at the beginning doesn't matter.
If you want to understand how price discovery could work in the Bitcoin P2P network, you need to identify the scarce resources, and then identify the supply and demand factors.
Start with the bandwidth needed to move transactions from the users to the miners. This is a scarce (not infinite) resource. It's supplied by relay nodes and the demand comes from the users who want to transact on the network. There is some equilibrium price where the willingness of relay nodes to supply bandwidth meets the demand of users. (don't worry for the moment about whether this price is positive or negative, just note that a price exists).
There's another side to this bandwidth, however. Imagine for a moment there is no block subsidy and miners derive all their revenue from transaction fees.
The transactions which pay the miners are _also_ a scarce resource. It's entirely conceivable that miners would pay relay nodes to deliver fee-paying transaction to them, for the exact same reason that a steel mill pays suppliers to provide it with iron ore.
The bandwith needed to transport the block a miner produces to the rest of the network is also a scarce recource, that has an equilibrium price.
Keep in mind also that all these people who want to get paid for providing various services only do get paid if the Bitcoin network continues to function.
This isn't a complete description of how market allocation could work, but it should be clear that price discovery is possible. Once there was a functioning market for bandwidth/connectivity, then you wouldn't have to worry about blocks being "too big" for the exact same reason that we don't have to worry that all the grocery stores in town will suddenly decide to stock "too many" gallons of milk.

With OT as it exist now (no federation), a liablity is only valid within the namspace where it was issued. This means that for the same instrument to trade on multiple notaries, the issuer needs an account on all of them.
With federated instruments, colored coins are the canonical representation of the units. The blockchain enforces the quantity of issued liabilities, so the issuer no longer needs to trust the notaries, and in fact _never needs to interact with the notaries at all_.
When a user comes to the issuer with a redemption request, the issuer only needs to verify that the user is presenting the correct type and quantity of colored coins in order to know that it's safe to release the underlying asset.

I guess I shouldn't have assumed that everybody understands the relationship.
CEX and ghash are two branches of the same business. CEX controls the physical hardware, and ghash is the pool that hardware mines on.
Other people want to duplicate this model. If there were 4 equally-sized competitors, then ghash's fraction of the network would be 17%.
CEX can afford to buy so much hardware because they've created a commody market that let other people by shares of the operation, so they have greater access to capital.
They can get away with that because the operate in a country where the SEC can't quite get their tentacles in, and probably have some local connections.
The SEC would rape the operators of CEX if they could get to them, because the SEC effectively claims jurisdiction over the entire human race and insists that anything remotely resembling a commodity market only operates with their explicit permission.
This is why CEX/ghash operate without effective competition. As usual, the "political moderates" are blaming the free market for the sitution which Leviathan created.

The optimal strategy is develop a response plan for consensus forks (which we should assume will happen no matter what), then push through the transition from a monoculture to a heterogenous network as quickly as possible.

There are a lot better technical solutions that what I'm going to describe here, but this procedure is easy enough that most people should be able to handle it:
* Buy Bitcoins on Coinbase.
* Immediately withdraw those coins to your LocalBitcoins account.
    * Note: they give you a unique deposit address each time, so don't reuse addresses
* Withdraw some random fraction of your LocalBitcoins account balance to a wallet (Mycelium, Armory, Electrum, etc)
    * Note: Wallets are software applications that run on hardware you control and hold private keys for your bitcoins. Several Bitcoin banks offer btc-denominated accounts and call their products "wallets", but they aren't.
* Wait a day or two, then withdraw more of your LocalBitcoins account balance to your wallet.
* Repeat until all your bitcoins are in your wallet
If desired, replace "LocalBitcoins" with any other exchange not located in the USA that has a suitably high turnover and will give you a unique deposit address after every deposit.
Coinbase and Circle should only be used as brokers that let you buy/sell coins easily.
Don't store your bitcoins there, or use your account as a wallet.

Size is a major reason why miners choose ghash. There is a strong perception that larger pools generate more income for individual miners (irrespective of fee policies). As far as I know there is no basis for this in fact, but as long as people believe this then a lot of miners will just point their rigs at the largest pool.
CEX is the reason why ghash is the largest pool - their rigs make up about half the hashrate (or did before the reallocated some of them).


Another reason why their vertically integrated model is so successful.
The solution is not to condem them for their success. The solution is to remove the barriers that keep other companies from replicating it.
@_date: 2014-08-20 09:41:44


This is a false choice in several ways.
"Store of value" is an emergent property of a good medium of exchange; it's not something that can be treated as an independent feature.
If Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange that all people in the world can actually use, it won't be a good store of value.
High transaction rate does not imply a reduction in censorship resistance. Actually, higher transaction rates can be beneficial for things like hiding the original source of a transaction because there's a larger anonyminity set.
There are problems with the current P2P network in that running a node is a volunteer effort which earns no revenue to compensate for the increased costs incurred by higher activity. The solution for that is to fix the network layer, not to keep the transaction rate of the network artifically capped.

What's wrong with Counterparty?
It's a solution looking for a problem, on two levels.
At the first level, it a thinly-veiled attempt to make XCP seem necessary or desirable so that IPO investors can cash out. The existance of XCP adds zero value to anyone except for those investors - to everybody else it's a permanent inconvienience.
At the second level, it's emulating a stock market on the blockchain just so that we can say that we have stock markets on the blockchain. They aren't creating equity markets because there is this huge market demand for legitimate enterprises to raise startup capital via equity sales which they will repay via dividends - they are creating equity markets so that daytarders have something to daytard, without realizing that daytarders want a platform with lower latency than what a blockchain can provide.

The situation with the reference client is untenable.
It's nearly impossible to write a specificlation, and therefore create compatible (consensus-preserving) alternate implementations because Bitcoin Core is a experiment and prototype that evolved into its current form instead of having been engineered.
I'm going to use btcd as an example here only because it's the most complete alt implementation. btcd was engineered, and it's codebase is specifiable. If other alt implementations added mining support, and used btcd's behavior and test suite as their basis for theirs they'd actually have a decent chance at getting it right.
Also, the Conformal programmers are more approachable and willing to work with others than the Bitcoin Core team ever has been, so the odds of a building a successful heterogenous network would be even greater.
Don't take my word for this - ask anybody who ever tried to write an alt implementation and ask them how helpful the Core devs are when comes to answering questions about how Bitcoin Core actually behaves.

If you're operating a notary as part of a well-constituted voting pool, then the users of your notary can have _more assurance_ that you can't steal or modify the blockchain units represented by the OT balances than they would if you were operating alone.


If you are issuing some kind of OT instrument, then it's perfectly valid to register on more than one notary using the same nym, although in the case of federated assets you don't need to do this - you just issue the colored coins and your users can transact in them however they want.
I'm also detecting an impedance mismatch. In OT, cash is just one of many possible ways of representing a financial instrument.
The most common type of financial instrument would be a promissory note - a bearer token that can be redeemed for dollars, or bitcoins, or gold, etc.
Somebody who holds a balance of this instrument type can emply many types of transactions: checks, vouchers, A2A transfers, and cash.
All four of those transaction types are denominated in the same asset - it's up to the user how they want to move their balances around and how they want to store them.

At the moment, Bitcoin is good for neither.
In any case it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is or is not good for today - it's about what Bitcoin can be developed into. It's not finished yet.
Also debt settlement/vs microtransactions is another false dichotomy. There are more kinds of transactions in an economy that those.
It's ironic that you're pushing for Bitcoin as a low transaction rate settlement system and also that you want to keep Bitcoin free (libre). Those two situations are completely incompatible.
A free Bitcoin is one that's paid for by transaction fees generated by billions of people using it every day. The "settlement between brokers" model means the network is funded by, and therefore controlled by, a small cartel.

From the perspective of the child blockchain, the hashing being performed as proof of work is not an "opportunity cost outside the system".
Hashing that is rewarded with Bitcoins is not an opportunity cost therefore proves nothing when the same hashing is used to vaidate Namecoin blocks.
Andrew's paper uses this concept of opportunity cost to explain why PoS doesn' prove anything meaningful for distributed consensus.
Oleg Andreev's explaination of PoW implies an even strong stronger conclusion - the conditions necessary to produce a proof transcends individual blockchains:








The "should have employed provably big amount of resources, big enough that there are not enough resources left for any alternative Y" condition can only be met for the parent blockchain, and also for the _largest blockchain employing that particular PoW algorithm_.
Double SHA-256 can only generate meaningful proofs for Bitcoin. Any other blockchain that tries to use the same algorithm isn't actually benefiting from PoW. At best, they just haven't been attacked yet.

Of course it's different.
Once you're being paid in bitcoin you're suddenly selling your services into a global market rather than a local one.
Imagine you're a Venezuelan software engineer. Would you rather be limited to working for companies in Venezuala, or would like to have the option of contracting for a Swiss software company?
While it's theoritically possible to do that without Bitcoin, in practice there are many downsides to trying to make that kind of arrangement work with fiat currencies, to the point at which it's effectively impossible.

I'll try to make it more clear with an example:
JCN Inc. wants to issue stocks
They use a bitcoin wallet (btcwallet, chromawallet, or any other wallet that supports transaction-based coloring) to issue the desired number of units as colored coins. These colored coins will share the same colored coin ID.
They create an OT asset contract which identifies their units as stock in JCN Inc and specifies the colored coin ID they generated before as representing their stock units.
Then they bidirectionally link the OT asset contract to a smart property.
The identifier for that smart property becomes the canonical identifier for their stock units as a federated asset type in OT.
They distribute the colored coins and the associated OT asset contract to their shareholders via any method.
The shareholders can hold those colored coins in a regular bitcoin wallet, or they can deposit them with any notary in any voting pool. At this point JCN neither knows nor cares where or with whom their stocks are held.
Once the colored coins are deposited with a notary, the notary can use the OT asset contract to issue OT receipts for them, and the user can then perform _any operation of which OT is capable_ on their receipt balance.
At any time, the holder of the associated OT receipt can redeem their receipt for the colored coins, to transfer them to another voting pool, store them themselves, or perhaps return them to the issuer for out-of-band redemption.

In my opinion, asking users to take such an extraordinary step via a support email alone is irresponsible.

Cash issued within the namespace of a notary is only valid within that namespace.
If you want to move cash from one notary to another (not part of the same voting pool), you redeem the cash with the first notary, withdraw the colored coins which the cash respresents and deposit it with the second notary then convert it to cash again.

Right after Napster was shut down, there were a lot of programmers who tried to work within the system to create services that would serve customers and not violate copyright law.
One of them would let you download mp3s, but only after you put the physical CD in the drive and let them query a random sector to make sure you actually had it. They thought that would appease the RIAA.
It didn't work. One by one, all the services which tried to do things legally got shut down.
After that, the only way forward was to stop trying to comply with copyright law entirely and instead focus on bypassing it.

Mostly what this means is that somebody can issue tokens that represent their liabilities, and those tokens can trade beyond their control, and when they receive a token from somebody wanting to redeem it, they can use the blockchain to verify that the token is valid.
They don't need to keep track themselves of everything that happened with the token between when they issued it and when they redeem it.
Currently in OT, a liability issuer needs to trust the notary to not sign counterfeit balances. Issuing the units as colored coins avoids this problem, and with voting pools users still get all the added functionality of OT.

What's bad about it is that last year when [bitcoind broke the network]( by being incompatible *with itself*, high profile developers were quick to say, "patches welcome!" to everbody who insisted that the undocumentability of the protocol was a problem.
Then, when the patches actually show up, they are either ignored completely or else derided as ["programmer OCD"](
The longer this keeps going on, the easier it will be to make the case that Bitcoin Core developers are deliberately keeping the codebase fragile and the protocol undocumentable, while spreading FUD about alternative implementations, just to maintain their self-appointed "wizard" status.
This situation with Bitcoin Core is intolerable. If nobody can add any new features to it without risking the entire structure collapsing, then it's time to either fix it or put forward a plan for deprecating it.
If the developers of Bitcoin Core are unable or unwilling to fix the code, and are unwilling to allow anyone to help them fix it, and also use their reputation and contacts to sabotage superior implementations, then said developers can go fuck themselves.
Bitcoin is more important the Bitcoin Core or any of its developers, and right now they are holding it back.

This is longer than I thought it would be, but I'll post it anyway:
**Elliptic Curve Cryptography**
If Alice and Bob want to use ECC, first they need to agree on an elliptic curve to use. There are many curves to choose from, and each one is defined by several parameters. The one we'll mention in particular is the generator point (G). The generator point is a point on the chosen curve whose most important property is that everybody agrees to use the same one.
Alice needs a private key (a), which is just a 256 bit random number. She also needs a public key (A), which she calculates by multiplying her private key by the generator point (A=aG)
Bob calculates his keypair in the same way (b, B=bG)
Alice can use her private key and a message to generate a signature. If Bob sees the signature attached to a message, and if Bob has Alice's public key, Bob can prove that the signature came from Alice's private key. Alice can do the same for signatures generated by Bob.
The security of ECC comes from the property that multiplication is easy, but division is so hard that it's considered impossible.
Even though the actual process for performing addition and multiplication on EC points is complicated, a nice feature of EC math is that you don't need to worry about how it actually happens - most of the time all you need to know is that addition and multiplication on EC points behaves like addition and multiplication of numbers.
**Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman**
Alice wants to send some Bitcoins to Bob. For that, she needs an address. Bob does not want to explicitly give Alice an address - he wants to publish a public key that anyone can use to generate an address from, but he doesn't want everybody to generate the same address. How is this possible?
Alice needs a shared secret with Bob. To create one, she multiplies her private key by Bob's public key:
S = aB
This doesn't look immediately useful until we consider how Bob would calculate the shared secret. He multiplies his private key by Alice's public key.
S = bA
Are these really the same? Remember that public keys are private keys multiplied by a generator point:
S = aB = a(bG)
S = bA = b(aG)
S = abG = baG
Any two individuals who know each other's public key can, with simple multiplication, can calculate a shared secret that nobody else can either duplicate or link to either party's public keys. That's ECDH.
Alice and Bob can turn their shared secret (which is a curve point) into a number using a hash function. We'll call the number representation of the shared secret (s).
In what way is the shared secret useful for Alice's problem?
She needs to calculate a new public key for which Bob can calculate the private key, but which nobody else can connect either to Alice's or to Bob's public keys.
Alice creates a new public key for Bob by adding the shared secret to Bob's public key:
C = B + sG
How do we know that Bob has the private key (c) for this new public key?
C = B + sG = bG + sG
C = (b+s)G
c = b + s
Perfect. To spend bitcoins sent to the address for C, all Bob needs to know is Alice's public key. Then he can calculate the shared secret, and add that shared secret to his private key.
Alice can't calculate c, because she doesn't know Bob's private key.
No outside observers can connect C to either Alice or Bob, because they can't calculate the shared secret.

We need contingency plans and recovery plans in place in the event of unexpected network events, regardless of how many implementations exist on the network.
If we're worried about multiple implementations causing a disaster, that's de facto evidence that our disaster response preparations are inadequate in general and that's the actual problem that should be fixed.
If we are suitably prepared to recover from Bitcoin Core forking against itself again, then we are also suitably prepared to recover from Bitcoin Core forking against another implementation.

I think what you're missing is that individual home miners are going to matter less and less over time as the industry matures, in the same way that blacksmiths gradually disappeared.
The CEX conglomerate owns about 1/4 of the hashing hardware that operates the network, because they've got a platform that appeals to speculators, so those speculators will buy that hardware for double price.
The only way to compete with that is to duplicate their model so they end up with a smaller fraction of the hashing power, which means that home miners are going to be even less relevant in the future.

What would be better than BIP62 would be to actually fix the root cause of the problem: the data that is hashed to produce the txid should never have included the signature scripts to begin with.
So much pain has resulted from that one original mistake.

Voting pools are a way for notaries (formerly called "transaction servers") to interact with the blockchain in a way that is more secure than a single server acting alone.
The first application of voting pools will be for holding bulk (non-colored) Bitcoin deposits so that a single server can neither customer steal deposits nor fail to reedeem deposits on demand. This will provide redundancy for Bitcoin-backed promissory nodes in OT.
The second application of voting pools will be to store colored coins. This enables the creation of federated assets which are no longer tied to a specific notary.
Any OT instrument, including basket currencies, can be created as a federated asset.
If the colored coins which represent a federated asset are deposited in a voting pool, the user enjoys an amount of redundency based on the composition of that pool.


Voting pools are being documented on the Open-Transactions wiki:

Chris is too busy coding OT to really give Ethereum a critical evaluation. He's interested in the idea because it (claims to) solve a problem he hasn't quite figured out a good solution for yet: censorship-resistant computations.
OT is preparing to roll out corporation support, and one of the drawbacks will be that a corporation contract can only reside on one server.
If Ethereum could provide serverless distributed computations that might be useful for OT, if it provided an acceptable set of tradeoffs.
Doing your computations on a blockchain means you have no privacy. That's a pretty big downside, so you better be getting a huge benefit to compensate for that.
In the case of OT corporations, they can add provisions for the owner(s) of corporation to move the contract to a new server if the one they are running on starts screwing with them. That's far easier and less resource intensive than the Ethereum distributed computation model, and doesn't involve revealing your computations to the entire world.

Stealth Addresses have a major privacy flaw in that unless you run your own Obelisk server (virtually everyone) then the privacy improvement is limited since whomever runs the Obelisk server has all the information. 
Payment codes can be used by mobile wallets without relying on a third party to tell them which transactions are theirs.
The only information that leaks is an _upper bound_ on the popularity of a given payment code. It's an upper bound because some of the payment codes sent to notification address may be decoys. Which individuals are interacting, how many payments are involved, and which transactions correspond to a given payment code can not be determined via blockchain analysis.


You have a way to break ECDH?
If an attacker knows that certain UTXOs are associated with a particular individual (Bob), and if the attacker then sees those outputs used as inputs to a transaction which creates an output at a known notification address (Alice's), then the attacker can assume a probability that the Bob will send some bitcoins to Alice at some point in the future.
Bob might have sent a decoy notification to Alice, so the attacker can never be sure. All the attacker knows that Bob will sent Alice somewhere between 0 and 2^32 payments to Alice between the time of the notification transaction and forever.
The attacker might assume that any payments appearing in the mempool immediately following the notification transaction are a payment between Bob and Alice, but that's a problem that tends to solve itself as the transaction rate increases and can be addressed by intelligent clients which make sure to put a random amount of temporal separation between the notification transaction and the first payment.

Now that btcd is capable of mining, what we need is a third independent implementation.
Maybe somebody could add mining support to libbitcoin and Obelisk.
The ideal situation would be for no single implementation to be running a majority of the network so that **when** (note 1) consensus-breaking bugs occur, they are likely to only affect a minority of the network.
note 1: As we saw last March, Bitcoin Core can't even guarentee that it can achieve consensus with *itself*, which means we need to have recovery plans in place for those kinds of bugs anyway, even if there is only one mining implementation.

I don't have a short answer to fully explain why I disagree with that, so instead I'll just offer this thought:
By asserting that a limit should exist specifically to limit the way some people would use Bitcoin, you've inherently divided Bitcoin users into two categories: those whose preferences should be heeded, and those whose preferences should be ignored. Are you sure your methodology for determining who should be in which category is valid?

In order to know that you've received a payment to a stealth address, you need to know the public key which the payer used.
One way to communicate this information is through the blockchain itself, in the form of data included in an OP_RETURN output. The advantage to this is that the blockchain is reliable. The disadvantage is that you've got to scan all of it to find your payments (or have someone else do it for you).
This is not the only way. If the payer and payee have a direct communication channel (instant message, email, bitmessage, etc), then the payer can give them that public key directly.
There's nothing wrong with sharing the public key over more than one channel. Wallets that support stealth sends could send the public key they used to the other party via some direct communication method, and also include the OP_RETURN data as a back up so that the funds won't get lost forever in case the message gets dropped.

That's not the only solution.
It's entirely possible to run a Bitcoin ATM where the operator *never* needs to transport cash.

ATM is low on cash? Raise the exchange rate to attract more cash sellers.
ATM has too much cash? Lower the exchange rate to attract more cash buyers.

High frequency traders aren't gambling with their own money - they are gambling with money the Federal Reserve loaned into existence for them to gamble with, and with the retirement savings of the middle class the IRS funnels their way via the 401k system.
When they lose their bets, the Federal Reserve monetizes the debt and we all pay for it via inflation. When they win, they keep the profits.

* Situations may arise where one party can steal funds that don't belong to them anymore.
* Some of the things you may want to do will only work if a large number of entities are online and contactable at the same time.
* Certain arrangements can result in unexpected and non-intuitive limits on receiving and/or sending funds.
* Some methods of avoiding the previous pitfalls may require somebody to lock up large amounts of idle capital, up to and and maybe even exceeding the total amounts being transacted.

Rely on a central authority to do what? Anything? Some things? What tasks does the Bitcoin network perform? Which ones of them must be performed in a decentralized manner? All of them? If Bitcoin relies on decentralization, and there isn't enough of it some day, what is a Bitcoin user going notice that will indicate that Bitcoin isn't working any more?

You might personally think Bitcoin is only valuable if it achieves 100% perfection in terms of DoS and double spend resistance, but somehow I doubt that an economic majority takes that position.
What you wrote looks an awfully lot like a fallacy of the excluded middle.
Perhaps it's sufficient for the risk of attacks to be measurable, and thus predictable, rather than being a mathematically-guaranteed.
That may eternally annoy the cryptographers, but the entire market economy works perfectly well in the presence of non-zero risks of all types and does a fine job of adapting to risk, especially predictable risks.
And to answer your specific question: proof of work does something that a trusted third party can not - add a non-recoverable price the TTP must pay in order to change their mind.
That this mechanism is not infinitely effective isn't a valid reason to treat it as having zero effect.

Adding the block size limit in the first place made the consensus system more fragile by deviating from the "a block is valid if the transactions in it are valid" standard expressed in the Bitcoin whitepaper.
Continuing to add to the complexity to the block size limit, rather than working toward removing it from the consensus definition, increases the fragility.
@_date: 2015-08-25 06:25:42
I think the best we can do is:
* assume that consensus bugs will never be eliminated
* encourage the development and adoption of many different implementations such that no single implementation (and ultimately, no combination of two implementations) runs a majority of the network
That approach should act to compartmentalize consensus bugs such that they are more likely to affect a minority of the network than the entire network.
This should be less disruptive to the network even if the approach increases the gross number of consensus bugs.

Are you sure you really know how to help a homeless person?
If you perform this experiment, what criteria will you use to judge its success or failure? You might phrase this in the form of "If the person has been helped by my efforts, then I should observe A. If they are not helped, then I should not observe A and might observe B instead."
When people don't have a clear plan for measuring whether or not their help actually achieves the intended goal, especially when they don't even know what their intended goal actually is, I have to wonder if they are really trying to help someone else, or if they actually want to feel better about themselves because they are going through the motions of being "a person who helps the homeless."

You may or may not understand democracy, but you certainly don't understand money.
Money has no value. The products that people will deliver in exchange for money have value, and the act of holding money is a bet that there will exist in the future people who will do so for the particular form of money being held.
For money to be useful, it inherently requires bilateral cooperation - it's a continual negotiation between producers and savers. If one decides to walk away from the process, he also walks away from the benefit of money.
The only reason to hold Bitcoins is because you expect to spend them someday. In order to expect to spend them, you need to have a good reason for someone else to accept them. If you can't provide such a reason, you can't compel them to do so.
The fact that Bitcoin can grow in the face of central bank money's overwhelming network effect is an aberration - a testament to the amount of work central banks and governments put into destroying the scarcity and utility of their money. If they let up even a little bit on the active destruction of their currency system, Bitcoin's value proposition will suffer.
Bitcoin doesn't have advantages over competing cryptocurrencies other than a larger base of economic activity, so it can't afford to make stupid decisions like rejecting the activity that makes it valuable in the first place.

Localbitcoins is in a generally good position to resist extraterritorial US laws, since they are capable of operating without a bank account.
They do have to watch out for laws which could get them extradited, but those should be fairly rare and if they avoid travel to the US they'd be fine in most cases.
The real risk here is to the traders in the US who might get caught in sting operations.
Sting operations targeting in person trade is the vulnerability which I expect will be commonly used to attack unlicensed businesses of all types. (Think ride sharing and AirBnB clones too)
I think the general solution is a web of trust optimised for infiltration resistance.

If it's not yet possible to define decentralization, then it's not correct to say that we even know what it is at all, much less whether it's even desirable in the first place, much less important.
Without such a definition it's also not possible to state that it's the best way to prevent attacks.
Personally I think that focusing on decentralization is a complete waste of time and an intellectual dead end. It's also actively dangerous because it causes people to take their eyes off the ball of _the actual attacks decentralization is supposed to prevent_.
Once you go down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to maximize some quantity you can neither measure nor define and forget the reason you ever cared about it in the first place, you stop paying attention to whether or not what you're doing is actually effective in terms of stopping the attacks.

Some of those people are acting out of a fear of easily-swayed masses getting into Bitcoin and then being persuaded to accept changes to Bitcoin that are actually harmful, like the block reward formula.
That group is the worst, because they couldn't possibly do anything more counterproductive to their own goals.
Bitcoin has no special magic that makes it immune to network effects. The money we'll be using in a decade will be the money used by the largest number of people. It's going to take a lot of explanation and persuasion for that money to be Bitcoin.
If people want to protect Bitcoin's essential characteristics like its limited supply, they are approaching the block size debate in entirely the wrong way. They should start out by accepting that users are free to choose the software they want to run, and what currency to trade with, and take it upon themselves to make the case that Bitcoin users benefit from a 1 MB block size. Their arguments would still be weak, but at least they'd be practising the skills they'll need for the actual important fight.
Trying to stop the debate by censoring discussion venues, name calling (&lt;person I don't like&gt;coin), expressions of elitism, etc is doing absolutely nothing to protect Bitcoin and is shredding their credibility while letting their reasoning skills atrophy.

Watch out for the slippery language and hidden assumptions!
We know that a miner with 51% of the hashing power can choose to mine 100% of the blocks by orphaning every block solved by a different miner.
If a single miner mines 100% of the blocks, they can perform double spend attacks or transaction-level denial of service attacks with 100% probability of success.
That _might_, but does not necessarily, mean "broken completely."
There is still a cost to performing those attacks, in the form of the irrecoverable proof of work that must be expended in order to orphan blocks.
Under what circumstances will the benefit of the attacks exceed the cost of the attacks?
Why would a miner choose to perform the extra proof of work needed to orphan 49% of the blocks rather than just build off the longest chain and claim their 51% of mining revenue? Under what circumstances does it make sense for a miner to do this?

There is a downside to stealth addresses - only a full node wallet (one that stores the entire blockchain itself) can fully benefit from the privacy improvements they offer.
Virtually every wallet in existence has to rely on a trusted third party to scan their stealth address for payments on their behalf, which means the wallet has no privacy with respect to the trusted third party.

SPV clients can't verify anything other than header syntax and proof of work, so it accepts the chain with the most proof of work that it sees, even if that chain is actually invalid.

What is reported is that "bad" cops act with impunity, as if they've done the acts which make the news many times and have a reasonable expectation of never being held accountable.
From that, we can deduce that the so-called "good cops" are willing to turn a blind eye to abuse on a regular basis.
There's another very simple test that proves the non-existence (or at least extreme rarity) of "good cops": ask one of them if they are as likely to give a speeding ticket to one of their coworkers are they would be to give one to a member of the general public in equivalent situations.

Sure, but it's incumbent upon the cinema company to prove the person they evict did, in fact, start screaming and yelling.
If they picked a customer to evict for any reason other than what the customer agreed to when they purchased the ticket, this would be theft.
When any business accepts consideration in exchange for a service to be performed, and if they choose not to perform they have to give the money back because it's no longer rightfully theirs.
The more I think about this, the more I think there's a pathology to these companies that offer "free" services.
If a company is in the business of not having customers, but rather users which are _products_, I'm not sure it's possible for anyone to work there and not be damaged in some way. Treating other humans as a product is not a healthy activity.
On the other hand, maybe the causality is backwards and only the people who are already inclined to think that way gravitate to those companies in the first place.

Inflation is how the ruling class robs the rest of the population.
The job of mainstream economists is to prevent the rest of the population from resisting the robbery by providing pseudoscience explanations that make the robbery seem like something else.
The more plausible an explanation an economist can make about why robbery is actually something else, the more they will be rewarded through social advancement. Most of them are so well-trained that they don't even realize they are lying.

I don't think that UTXO set commitments - by themselves - are a solution.
The reason we have a blockchain is that it was the simplest thing that could work in terms of achieving the original consensus definition of block validity: a block is valid if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
The simplest thing that could possibly work in this case means every node storing a full history so they can check for themselves. The data needed to verify the validity of a block is external to the block itself (the block chain).
What needs to change is a more efficient system such that allows any entity with the relevant information to create compact and easily verifiable proofs that a block is invalid.
I described such a system here: 
Under that proposal, the consensus definition is changed to "a block is valid if _it contains a valid proof_ that all the transactions in the block are valid"

Bitcoin is not "trustless" under any circumstance and can not be made so.
There are always attacks which can be performed profitably and attacks which can not.
We can compare two arrangements of hashing power and compare them in terms of which one allows for more profitable attacks than the other, but there is no transition point where security goes from 100% to 0% or vice versa.

I think the double spending problem is actually fairly well taken care of with proof of work:
And by "taken care of" I mean that it's easy for a user to estimate how safe an incoming payment is.
If you assume an absolute worst case scenario of 100% of the hashing power conspiring against you, then as long as the number of new bitcoins which have been mined since the block which included your incoming transaction is greater than the value of your transaction it's reasonable to assume the payment will not be reversed (since it would cost more than the value of the transaction to reverse it).
If less than 100% of the hashing power is conspiring against you, then it's even better.

Yes, there can be defined placeholder value defined that means "that hash of the current block". Note that the ordering requirement for hashes in a block by itself reduces the frequency at which it's possible to spend outpoints created in the same block.


You're talking about isStandard(), which is Bitcoin Core policy instead of a consensus rule.
All current Bitcoin implementations would accept blocks whose generation transactions contain zero-valued OP_RETURN outputs, so this means the change could be rolled out without disrupting existing software.
The same technique could be used for blockchain commitments of many types. It would be very easy to define meanings for generation transaction outputs at specified index values for various types of commitments.


You can sort the set of transactions which exclude the generation transaction.




It's difficult to summarize the change in a single sentence without losing some precision. What that means is that each block contains the minimum amount of information needed such that if anyone in the world knows that a block is invalid, they can communicate that knowledge in way that is compact and easily verifiable by those who do not have it.
I don't think talking about this in terms of "positive proofs" and "negative proofs" (Factom marketing terms) is particularly relevant to Bitcoin.


Those things don't appear to be ready for prime time, if for no other reason than the number of people in the world who are sure that they do work as described is still very low.

The reason is they know for sure the dangerous one will cause trouble for them if their whims are not catered to, and the reasonable person will almost certainly make the short-term economically rational decision to drop the matter.

If the upgrade process for enabling &gt;1MB blocks requires that 95% of the relay network and hashing power upgrade before the new rules take effect, then it's basically impossible for the "old bitcoin" to function after the change.
Before people can arbitrage the different coins on exchanges, they first need to be able to move coins to those exchanges, which will be difficult during the time in which the non-upgraded chain is experiencing 200 minute block intervals.
Imagine what happens when a lot of people wanting to quickly take advantage of arbitrage opportunities by moving coins on a "1 MB every 200 minute" blockchain.

Not all of the pockets are big.


Miners sell a service to Bitcoin users and investors. They are utterly at the mercy of their customers, without whom they can not pay their electric bills.


Yes, Bitcoin needs developers.
This fact in no way implies that it needs any *specific* developer.
There is a very large amount of programming talent in the world, and if certain developers drop out others will step in to replace them.
I actually think a mass resignation of all the well known developers would be good for Bitcoin in the long term because it would prove once and for all that nobody is irreplaceable.

Yes, signing with the same key more than once increases the risk of an unknown ECDSA flaw revealing the private key.
Even as we speak, a terrifying fraction of Bitcoin transactions do this because they are using Blockchain.info-style single-address wallets, or because they're going through payment processors that reuse addresses.
Payment codes involve the address reuse only for the initial setup of a payment context and eliminate it for all other transaction.
That's an improvement from what we have now.

I'm disappointed in the entire BIP process.
How many Bitcoin users know there's an upcoming user-visible relay policy change in the form of IsStandard()?
Did the individuals who proposed that change go through the BIP process? Is there a written specification for (what will be) standard multi-push OP_RETURN transactions?
From my perspective, the entire BIP process is just a series of hoops that non-insiders are encouraged to jump through.
I sent an initial draft of the proposal to the mailing list, per the published procedure. I addressed the feedback that I received at the time.
Months go by, the first wallet to implement BIP47 is approaching an imminent release, and then Luke-jr shows up and says we should change the protocol to use a feature that would (at best) result in a 10% success rate at sending transactions until the next Bitcoin Core upgrade cycle sometime next year.
If BIP47 switched to multi-push OP_RETURN immediately, then payment codes would be effectively unusable because not enough of the network will relay or mine those transactions.
What is unreasonable about saying, "We'll do what works today for version 1, and then specify version 2 once better capabilities are generally available?"


The intent is to update to a v2 once multi-push OP_RETURN is usable in the Bitcoin network.
Since there is no guarantee how long this will take, we're not going to delay version 1 indefinitely just because there are people who won't want to use payment codes until version 2.


It's not necessary for Core to do anything whatsoever. The wallets who want this feature can implement it, and wallets whose developers don't want to implement it are in no way required to do so.

it's also a long way away from solving any real problem.
What people around the world want is *liquidity*.
They want to know they can easily turn their bitcoins into the national currency they need to buy groceries with, and easily buy bitcoins with that currency. Meeting that desire requires a large network of easily-accessible brokers.
LocalBitcoin has that now, and their ability to facilitate global liquidity has not been hampered by a lack of verifying bank transfers using fancy SSL proxies.
The most important problem to solve is how to get the large global network of brokers. Once that problem is solved, whether or not the platform is "decentralized" barely matters, if at all.
I'm not going to be interested in any decentralized exchange project unless they present a credible plan for growing their userbase larger than LocalBitcoins, or at least Mycellium Local Trader.

It's good to a point, but when it comes to their Multibit implementation they have an incomplete understanding at the threat model.
The reason you want a second factor apart from the PC wallet is because you assume an attacker can break the security of the PC remotely and steal the private key. Their method prevents thefts caused by this particular attack.
So far, so good, but the problem isn't fully solved because stealing a private key is not the only thing an attacker can do.
If the attacker controls the PC well enough to steal a private key, they control what the user of the PC sees, and they control the communication path to the second factor.
An attacker who can't steal funds by simply accessing a private key will simply adjust their strategy. Next time the user tries to send bitcoins somewhere the attacker's malware will substitute the attacker's address for the intended destination. When the user looks at the transaction on their phone to check it (if they even do any checking) they will be checking the transaction displayed on their phone against the transaction displayed on their PC, which the attacker controls...
If the security of your Bitcoins is like a house, then threshold signatures are like moving from a wooden front door to a steel front door. It doesn't mean that thefts will no longer happen - it just means the thieves will no longer attack through the front door (they'll go through the windows instead).

You mentioned a couple advantages of off-chain output transfer:
* Smaller transaction fees.
* Complete indistinguishably from other transactions.
You didn't mention any of the downsides:
* Higher implementation complexity: Now a Bitcoin wallet that wants to use them must connect to some secondary network in addition to being a Bitcoin client.
* Higher risk of lost funds: the number of scenarios in which an output can be lost forever is increased.
* Additional opportunities for privacy loss: Accessing the secondary network increases the attack surface of the wallet (timing attacks, etc).

No, I'm saying that if there exists a daily demand to purchase 200000 bitcoins at a given price level, if the amount of bitcoins offered for sale each day dropped to 198200 because of the reward halving, the price should rise continuously until enough new sellers appear  (and enough buyers disappear) to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium.

This is not a helpful statement, because virtually anything "could" happen tomorrow.
Not every "could" is equally likely.
The only objective evidence I can see which would indicate the relevant probability is Eligius's hash rate: 2%.
Unless you can demonstrate that a larger fraction of the network runs your personal patch set, I forecast a 98% probability that a version 1 payment code notification transaction could be mined tomorrow, and a 2% probability that they'd be blocked.
Likewise, that means a 2% possibility of a successful multi-push OP_RETURN notification being mined tomorrow and a 98% probability of failure.
I don't have any reason to believe those probabilities are going to change before Bitcoin Core 0.12 shipping.

You've got it completely backwards. Signatures are fine - they already sign as much as is possible to sign. Maybe you don't realize that transactions are not signed - individual inputs inside transactions are signed.
The problem is with transaction IDs. They are constructed by hashing the entire transaction including information which _can not be signed_.

The problem is that you're assuming that everybody in the economy has the same incentives.
Deflation starts off being bad for debtors, since repaying debt becomes more difficult, and good for lenders since the earn more real interest.
That only goes so far though. Debtors can only  take so much financial stress before they default. After a default they'll have more discretionary income and their increasing purchasing power tends to compensate for their reduced access to credit. After a default, lenders are left holding an empty bag of broken promises.
This is why we've had so many bailouts since 2008. The lenders are fewer in number and tend to be more politically connected than the debtors. Had events been allowed to take their natural course (without bailouts) much of the wealth of the wealthier classes would have been wiped out, and the middle and lower classes would have re-learned the value of savings and it would take another two generations to get the population hooked on easy credit again.

In certain parts of the developing world, it's going to give women the ability to gain far greater degree of financial independence from their husbands and fathers than they currently enjoy.

Yes, the block reward horribly distorts the economics of mining.
Other than getting rid of it entirely, the only other solution is to grow past the distortion until the transaction rate is high enough such that fee revenue exceeds the block reward.
The current state of the network is economically untenable, but it does not need to remain this way.

People who use Bitcoin wallets want to be able to send and receive payments.
The ability to do that is the primary measurement of whether a Bitcoin wallet works or not.
There are two ways we can deliver payment codes to users:
* "Here's a solution that you can use right away because 100% of miners will relay and mine the transactions. It's not optimal, but it's the best we can do with the resources currently at our disposal and sometime next year you'll get a software update that improves it once those transactions are commonly accepted by the network.
* "Here's a solution that gives your transactions a 2% chance of being included in a block because only Eligius will relay and mine them. Don't worry though - someday 2% will go up, probably."
I want to get rid of notification transactions from BIP47, absolutely as soon as it's possible to do so without making them unusable in practice.

Not every arbitrary number affects Bitcoin's fitness for purpose.
Money that doesn't allow people to use it is fundamentally broken.
I wouldn't immediately dismiss proposals to change the other numbers (block interval, difficulty adjustment period), provided that they don't change the inflation schedule, where I define the inflation schedule as *the exponential function of which the current formula is an approximation*.
Instead of reducing the reward by a large amount every four years, it could be equally valid to reduce it by a smaller amount every two years. Or, for that matter, every block.
As long as it was done in a way that the number of coins issued over time didn't change, it could still be conceived of as maintaining the original controlled supply promise.
That being said, I'm not sure any of those changes are actually defensible in terms of cost/benefit analysis.

When it comes to a merchant accepting payments, security is not a binary feature.

The first time a sender pays a given recipient, they have to send a notification transaction to a known address so that the recipient knows to look for incoming payments from them.
Those notification transactions need to be handled carefully to avoid causing privacy leaks and other problems.
Notification transactions can be eliminated once the network supports standard multi-push OP_RETURN outputs.
Multi-push OP_RETURN won't be usable until after Bitcoin Core 0.12 is released, and becomes widely enough deployed that the transactions will reliably reach miners, and miners upgrade their software and start mining them.
The above set of conditions may not be met for six months or more, so it didn't make sense to me to delay BIP47 roll out for half a year or more by making version 1 depend on multi-push OP_RETURN.

If this isn't possible, then maybe you're working with an inaccurate definition of "benefit."

I don't think you've read [the article]( I wrote since the last time we had this discussion.


Why would a soft-limit in the future work any differently than it has in the past?
For a long time, most miners were keeping the blocks they produced below 250k, but accepted larger blocks if somebody else produced them.


Decentralization is user-controlled. A user, via their SPV client, chooses how many nodes to connect to in the network.
Many users would want to connect to more nodes than a single one, because it improves their privacy and also the reliability of their connection to the network. Some would strictly stick with the cheapest option. The resulting number of nodes would reflect the blended distributed consents of Bitcoin users.


I don't think that it will always be necessary for every node to store full history forever. That was just the simplest way to implement the network.
If each node in the network has to buy transit from their peers, then they are going to change more for data that isn't likely to be requested in the future.

As long as your definition of "better" allows for fundamental problems to remain unsolved.


Storage in any DHT can always decrease - nodes just stop storing certain keys. See Freenet, Bittorrent.


That possibility would certainly affect the price they'd be able to command for their service, wouldn't it?


One part of the central planner's fallacy is the idea that it's necessary to solve all problems completely.
This isn't possible, and attempts to do so just lead to infinite development loops.
Instead, set up a marketplace and allow people who can solve a problem to profit from doing so.
For example, it's absolutely unnecessary to figure out how to distinguish spammy keys that will never be retrieved from ones that will be.
If nodes can profit from delivering keys to people who request them, then the ones who identify the best techniques for guessing which keys to save and which ones to discard will do better than those who don't.
Marketplaces are a technique for distributed, parallel problem solving. Try using them sometime instead of constantly trying to play god.

Right now it is a hard limit set by the block validation code.
It wasn't always the case though. When Bitcoin was first released there was no upper limit on block size but Satoshi added one later after concerns were raised that a malicious miner could produce a 1 terabyte block to intentionally clog up the network. They eventually settled on a 1 MB block limit as a temporary  measure until a more permanent solution could be invented.

If the goal is to protect people with large savings from having a home invader stick a gun to their head and force them to transfer bitcoins then 2-of-2 makes sense.
You could do 2-of-3 and give the third key to a protection service completely independent of the first to prevent a protection service from becoming the attacker, but that's much less user friendly to set up.
Too bad there's no fancy cryptography that would make it possible to upgrade from 2-of-2 to 2-of-3 on the fly. Then people could start out with the degenerate case, then better protect themselves later by contracting with a second provider.

The last thing we want is to push transactions off the blockchain.
The entire security model of Bitcoin relies on a large enough incentive for miners to join the network that it becomes impractical for an adversary to buy up a majority of the processing power. In order to do this, we need to allow the transaction volume to grow to increase fee revenue and thus incentive to mine.
Some people think the best way to increase fee revenue is to restrict the block size, but this is insane. The way you maximize fee revenue is to have high volume, because if the blockchain is not capable of processing a transaction in a timely fashion the users won't bid up fees to high levels - instead they just won't use Bitcoin at all.
Right now miners don't optimize their transaction selection because the fee revenue per block is less than 2 BTC while the coinbase is 25 BTC. If Bitcoin grew to handle the same volume of trade as PayPal the block size would be closer to the 18 MB we would need to bring fee revenue up to the point at which it matched the block subsidy. From that point on miners would optimize for transaction fees because that would represent half their revenue and as Bitcoin saw further growth there would be more incentive for new miners to enter the market.
There is a lot of room to reduce the costs associated with increasing the block size. Blockchain compression/pruning, different signature algorithms, and better algorithms for broadcasting blocks can allow the network to scale with commodity hardware and internet connections available to home users; all that's missing is developer time to implement them.

You're not going to get both "easy to use" and inexpensive in the same solution.
You could ask the donors to make an account at buybitcoin.com and send the bitcoins to your address after they buy them. For the right price, I'm sure the site would add some kind of widget to automate it for you. Their prices are high, though. At this moment they are charging $85 for a bitcoin when the market is at $72.
If navigate to your donation address on blockchain.info and click the "Donation Button" button, they will give you some html code that will set up a Bitinstant order to your address. That will be much less expensive but will require the donors to take cash to a Moneygram location.

55/1000 = 5.5%.
It's normal if you want same-day deposits into an exchange in the US. Bitinstant+Mt Gox is about the same price. 
The only way to pay less is to do a glacialy slow Dwolla-&gt;Mt Gox, but by the time the transaction is done the exchange rate has probably already risen 5% so you're not actually saving anything.
There's also Coinbase, which locks in the price when you start the transaction and only costs 1%, but they are frequently sold out.

I assume you means localbitcoins.com
Meet in a busy public place. Make sure the seller funds the sale before going to meet him. Show the seller the money but do not hand it over until he releases the Bitcoins.
You'll know he's released the Bitcoins because when you set up the order on LocalBitcoins they'll give you a confirmation code. Write it down and when the seller releases the sale he'll get the code which he can then show you.
Don't bypass the escrow system. You should do the sale entirely through their web site - the seller shouldn't be sending your Bitcoins directly to your BTC address, it should go from his LocalBitcoins wallet to yours.

The bitcoin seller should fund the transaction by allocating bitcoins from his bitcoin wallet to the transaction, thus placing them in escrow.
Don't go to the meeting unless the site is telling you that the transaction is funded. There's also no reason for you to not enable escrow. Escrow means the site will hold on to those bitcoins and prevent the seller from backing out of the deal.
When the transaction has been funded you will receive a verify code that you should write down (do NOT tell the seller what this code is). LocalBitcoins will reveal the code to the seller once they have released the bitcoins to your wallet. 
When the seller shows you the same code that LocalBitcoins gave you that's how you know you've received the bitcoins. After the transaction you can withdraw those bitcoins from your LocalBitcoins wallet anywhere you want.

The biggest problem I see with this analysis is that it uses today’s GDP numbers combined with the number of bitcoins which will exist a century from now.
By the end of 2012 only about half the total number of bitcoins was mined, so that would double your estimate to about $880 thousand.
On the other side, we could try to guess what world economic output will be in 2140 when all 21000000.00000000 bitcoins have been mined. Let’s assume a world wide population of 10 billion (our current best guess of where population will peak before declining fertility rates cause the birth rate to drop below replacement), that the US has the same fraction of the world’s population as present, that US GDP grows at an average of 3% per year, and finally that by 2140 the rest of the world has the same per-capita income as the US.
This produces an estimate of 2140 world economic output of $22000 trillion (current dollars) when all the bitcoins have been mined, so a single BTC will be worth $175 million.
Personally I think $1 million is a good upper bound estimate in the next decade or two when you account for permanently lost coins, and a possible lower velocity because in a bitcoin economy saving becomes a lot more attractive.

Well yes. In any system where you accept receipts from a third party you have to trust them. This means pretty much anything except bitcoins (litecoins, etc) held in a wallet under your exclusive control on your own computer.
As soon as you use any kind of service like an exchange (Mt Gox, Bitstamp, Coinbase, etc) you're back to needing to trust an issuer.
For the case of cryptocurrencies you can use voting pools to reduce the risk of a malicious or incompetent service operator losing your coins.
If the receipts are supposed to represent real-world assets, you can use surety bonds to allow issuers to back their promise to redeem with a cryptocurrency.

That's basically what should happen, but it should be automatic and not manual.
The problem is that no existing Bitcoin wallets are actually ready for primetime yet. Basically Satoshi implemented wallet functionality very badly in the reference client and everyone else copied his design, and the process of cleaning up the mess has just barely gotten underway.
What should actually happen is that you give him a BIP32 extended public key (or an Armory or Electrum watching-only wallet, since no production software supports BIP32 yet) which his client software would use to automatically send every payment to a unique address.

Transactions are distributed throughout the P2P network quickly, but blocks only happen about every 10 minutes.
The way blocks are relayed now if 1 GB of transactions were broadcast in the last 10 minutes and get included in a block each node in the network will need to download 2 GB of data. The first 1 GB consists of the transactions themselves which are downloaded continualy as they are broadcast, and the second GB is the block itself, which needs to be downloaded quickly as soon as it is found.
There's no technical reason it has to be that way though. Instead of transmitting the entire block the miner could just transmit the nonce, coinbase, and list of transactions included in the block.
Transactions themselves could be shared via some kind of DHT system so that a node only has to query the network for ones it hasn't seen itself when it comes time to validate a block.

Is this a joke? A child could debunk Krugman.
How do members of the co op hoard coupons? The only way to obtain them is to provide a baby sitting service to the other members without using another person's services. In other words, the producers of this service must produce more than they consume.
Clearly not everybody can do this at the same time. If everybody decides to watch their own kids nobody accumulates coupons and no trade takes place. If some people are desperate to accumulate coupons then they are going to have to start competing with each other for customers by lowering their price. Those whose desire to save is less pronounced will be happy to spend their coupons because now each one buys more babysitting.
At some point the coupon hoarders will decide to take a break and spend some of their accumulated coupons. Because they are switching from production to consumption the price of babysitting will rise. Some of the people who were consumers will switch back to producing when the prices reaches a value that they'd rather earn a coupon than whatever else they were doing.
In this way the supply and demand for this service will remain perfectly balanced because the pricing mechanism will constantly move the system towards equilibrium. The only way something can go wrong is if an outside authority tries to fix the price by prohibiting anyone from selling their service for more or less than exactly 1 coupon.

Storage and bandwidth do not need to be limiting factors.
Pruning allows for nodes to discard transactions that have already been spent, drastically reducing the amount of data they must store. This isn't implemented yet, but some people are already working on it.
There are also ways to optimize the way that blocks are transmitted to require much less bandwidth, which again haven't been implemented because there hasn't yet been a need.

I use a blockchain.info wallet, but only for small amounts of funds.
Any method of generating private keys on a computer which is connected to the Internet is **unacceptable** for securing more than a trivial amount of funds in the long term. As the value of Bitcoin increases, so also does the incentive for an attacker to comprompise blockchain.info or bitaddress and insert malicious code that will steal your private keys.
Private keys that will be used for secure saving must be generated offline, on a device that will *never again* be connected to the Internet.

It will work out as long as the exchange rate is higher then as compared to now, which is a pretty safe assumption based on the price history.

The other cool thing is that the scripting language for smart contracts is modular.
Right now they are using Chaiscript and adding Lua, but I think they should add Bitcoin's scripting language too.
Then for every case where you don't need a Turing complete script to express your contract you execute it directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Now OT has basically become a convienient user interface and IDE for smart contracts that only uses transaction servers for the specific uses that can not be exectuted directly on the blockchain.

This "liquidity trap" is a non-problem. If all of a sudden people prefer to watch their own kids it doesn't mean anything bad has happened, all it means is the market no longer requires that service, just like how the market for buggy whips no longer exists.
In reality that wouldn't happen though. Absent any arbitrary interference by an external force the price of coupons will float freely with supply and demand. The price of babysitting will be highest during prime times and lowest during the times of least demand.
This allows parents to optimally allocate their time. The parents who want to go out on Friday evenings will pay more, so they must have earned extra coupons by babysitting for the same amount of time on the previous Friday night, or else they had to do a lot more babysitting during off-peak hours.
Because the supply of coupons is fixed, nobody gets a free ride. If new coupons were introduced into circulation the first person to spend them would be using another person's time without first having to contribute any of their own.

Bitcoin indeed would have been a great safe haven from the deposit confiscations, but there's no evidence to suggest that anyone in Cyprus has even heard of Bitcoin yet, much less bought significant quantities. This story is pure hype and speculation.

Blockchain storage requirements are addressed by this proposal:
Bandwidth use is not optimal because nodes effectively have to download every transaction twice - once when it is broadcast and again when it's included in block. It's even worse than it sounds because blocks need to download in a short time while the transactions enter at a more leisurely rate. There are other proposals to change the structure of blocks so the miners don't need to rebroadcast transaction the network has already seen. That would reduce the burst capacity needed to handle high transaction rates.

Once you found a seller that accepts the payment method you want to use, open an order with them.

Make the payment as specifed by the seller, then go back to the LocalBitcoins site and mark the payment as complete.
Then the seller releases the bitcoins to your LB wallet. If they don't then open a dispute.

In the beginning, there was no deliberate blocksize limit.
There was an effective one because the protocol had a 32 MB maximum message size and a block must fit into a single message, but there is no evidence that Satoshi intended that instead of it being an accidental side effect, especially since he talked about processing VISA-like transaction volumes from his very first writings and that can only happen with block sizes much larger than 1 MB, or even 32 MB.
In late 2010, an explicit maximum block size of 1 MB was installed as a temporary anti-spam feature, because some concerns were raised about an attacker griefing the network with 1 TB blocks.
Then in 2012 when it looked like it was time to prepare to remove that temporary anti-spam measure, a bunch of people (mostly altcoin pumpers and at least one core developer) started spreading the story that the 1 MB block size limit was a deliberate economic feature which had been built in from the beginning.
It's very strange why people who knew better would lie in that way, especially since the source code had been open from the beginning and anyone can go read the forums and the mailing lists, and see exactly when that change went in and what public discussions were happening at the time.

They can do that, but there is protection if the buyer is careful.
For online advertisements, LocalBitcoins will automatically enable escrow after an order if funded.
Once funds are held in escrow the seller can not cancel the sale. They only way they can avoid releasing the bitcoins after the buyer marks the payment as complete is to go through the dispute process.

Here's a quote directly from the author:
"If you printed out a paper backup of your Armory wallet, it's good forever.  The piece of paper will let you generate any number of addresses (13 trillion if you wnat, but really almost-infinite).  Whenever you receive coins, Armory generates the next address in the chain for you.  When it needs to send change to itself, it generates the next address.  So you receive coins to address 1,000, then you click "Recieve Bitcoins" again, and you end up with address 1,001... then you send money which generates change, which is sent to 1,002, then you hit "Receive Bitcoins" again and you get 1,003.  It's all protected by your paper backup... forever."

Increasing the block size might [doom the altcoins]( to irrelevance though.

The purpose of competing cryptocurrencies (excepting special-purpose ones like Namecoin) is to provide a credible threat such that Bitcoin developers don't get complacent. As long as the possibility of an competitor is on the horizon, Bitcoin will need to respond to the needs of its users or risk losing them.
If more any of them get more than an insignificant user base it means Bitcoin is failing to meet some need in the market and should work to correct that.

The last thing a miner wants is to delay the verification of their blocks.

Before the government does anything, the bureaucrats need to recognize Bitcoin, decide it's a threat, and decide to attack it via mining.
Once that's done, it's time to start taking bids and writing contracts, appropriating money. After all that's done they'll hire a private contractor to build the mining rig for them.
The completed miner will be built out of a bunch of obsolete nvidia graphics cards AMD was looking to unload because that's who had the best lobbyist. The project will be 400% over budget, three years behind schedule, and will have a hashing power equivalent to what Bitcoin was doing in 2011.

LocalBitcoins has an escorow system built in to their web site. I keep enough Bitcoins there to automatically fund my sell orders and when we meet, I just use an SMS code to release the Bitcoins and then LB will credit the buyer's wallet. After they are done buying from me they can withdraw those bitcoins to their own offline wallet.
I actually never count the cash in public. So far I've just accepted their word that the amount is correct and haven't yet been burned. If I keep doing this I probably will be shorted at some point, but that's part of the reason you charge a comission. If you are charging enough it should cover the occational loss.

Suppose I want to buy something from Bitcoinstore.com that costs 10 BTC.
I have 15 BTC in my wallet, in the form of a 9 BTC output at address A and a 6 BTC output at address B.
With normal public keys, Bitcoinstore (via BitPay) would give me a payment address C and I'd have to create a transaction that combines the outputs at A and B and sends to address C and change address D.
This reduces privacy because simple blockchain analysis proves that the same person controls A, B and D.
If BitPay instead gave me an extended public key C*, I could generate as many payment addresses as I needed to avoid combining outputs from multiple addresses into the same transaction without requiring any special coordination with BitPay. Their wallet software would just watch the entire subtree using a lookahead mechanism.

Never leave your bitcoins in an online wallet longer than absolutely necessary. That's how you end up losing them.
Blockchain.info is a partial exception to this because of how they shouldn't have access to your private keys. They are fine to use as long as you don't access it from a compromised PC, install the javascript verifier plugin for your browser, use a a strong passphrase, and don't store your life savings in it.
An offline Armory wallet with paper backups is currently the best option for secure storage, that is still relatively easy when you want to spend from it.

Make your commission large enough to cover Coinbase and LB, plus 5% for yourself.
Many of the people who buy on LocalBitcoins are first time, unexperienced buyers, who will pay a healthy premium in order to get a smooth buying experience and lots of help and tech support.
If you've got a good reputation and are willing to work with them, you'll get plenty of sales.

Since November of last year I've made 20 purchases through Coinbase. One was cancelled in February via the infamous "high risk" email, but after that I was supposedly whitelisted.
