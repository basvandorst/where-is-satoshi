"bought himself an apartment in Toyen, one of Oslo’s wealthiest neighbourhoods"
That's like saying Detroit is one of the nicest cities in the US. Tøyen isn't like Detroit, but it sure isn't like Chelsea or Santa Monica.

Thanks for the great info.  I actually live in Oslo, but on occasion I head to Stockholm to escape the crazy Norwegians.  Im short on time as I write this but I will definitely look over the numerous responses and act accordingly.  Thanks again for taking the time to offer your insight!

I was going to buy 20 bitcoin at 225, but the only reason was I am fearful of someone stealing it since Im not so computer savvy.  I cringe for my own self, but am glad for the bitcoin community.  I wish I could just buy bitcoin like from a ATM and never have to worry about the possibility of a thief.  Rooting for you

interesting bitcoin info

I've been dying to buy bitcoin since it was down at $190. I'm looking at 5-10k but I'm terrified it will eventually be stolen. I'm awful with computers, security etc.
