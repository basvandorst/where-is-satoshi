Lets first talk about what bitcoin actually is.
It is software that includes a distributed database and verification system as well as a communications protocol.
That is what it ACTUALLY is.
So looking at similiar things like javascript.
Can javascript be viewed as a commodity? As money? 
I think the better thing is to say it is software. Software with completely newproperties neverbefore invented.
 Its software with positions and participations that have value.  
But there is no current analog in law or fact that it can be considered. People need to stop trying to sayit is like this or that.
It isnt. . Its new. Thats why it is so revolutionary and having such an impact.
Therefore no current law can be applied and unless more is made there is no precedent.
We didnt try to apply horse and buggy laws to airplanes when airplanes were invented.   There had to be completely new provisions and laws made because it rewrote everything.
Bitcoin isnt like anything else.

And remember, congress has NEVER made a law saying  switching crypto protocols is a taxable event or that crypto is either property or currency. (its neither. Its a distributed database and computer communications and verification protocol.) The irs pulled that out of their ass with NO SUPPORT from congress or the Trump administration on that. And with no law.
Only congress can make tax law.
And old tax law on capital gains cannot be interpreted to embrace or extend new things that didnt exist when the old law was made becuase tue intent of congress at the time of the laws passage cannot be interpreted to mean something that didnt exist at the time of the laws passage.
I am pretty certain millions of people overpaid taxes that dont actually exist in law regarding crypto.

The republican commitee also really slapped the IRS for making coinbase hand over its user data. Notice how so much of the irs and sec talk has now completely stopped?
Republicans dont want crypto throttled orregulated. They want it left alone like the internet was.
Its the democrats who were trying to shut down crypto and tax it to death.
Notice how all that ended when Trump won?
If democrats win the senate expect all that crap to start up again.
Democrats are paid by their banker friends more than republicans. Its someof both but the republicans have the libertarian branch which is very strong now with trump in office.  Tea psrty Meadows etc. Hate regulations.

Please stop spresding FUD that could cause people to overpay taxes no irs publication or congressional law has said they owe.
No irs publication has ever said swapping one crypto protocol say bitcoin for another is a taxable event....ever.
If you dispute  it please show me which publication or court case found SPECIFICALLY THAT....not your "interpretation" of tue 2014 guideline which does NOT SAY THAT. Not your cautious accountant who doesnt want to be liable if he is wrong and therefore always wants you to overpay.
Show me in specific  writing where it says changing from bitcoin protocol to another computer protocol is a taxable event. Nor did any examples given in their guidelines show such an example although the examples were exhaustige.
And if you do find that somewhere i dont know about (and i would like know if i am wrong)   then please tell me how you are reporitng the thousands of times a day your browser is swapping the valuable monetary advertiser data with real determinable market value in cookies from javascript to java to php to sql  since tuey are also computer protocols hokding and exchanging valuable data with monetary value?  Remember if you dont report that exchange then according to you you could get in all kinds of trouble! Or do you somehow say bitcoin protocol storing value is different than htmo cookie protocol or sql protocol and please explain why.
Also please tell me how you reported the swaps when bitcoin changed protocol to segwit ion protocol as a exchange of old bitcoin protocol to new bitcoin protocol at the market value of bitcoin at that time to the irs according to your tueroy right?

There have been no tax laws regarding cryptocurrency by the congress.
The irs wrote an old guideline that is not supported by any actual law made by congress.

There is no case law regarding cryptocurrency taxes yet either.
Its all a complete unknown.
