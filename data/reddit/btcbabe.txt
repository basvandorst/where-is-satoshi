I dont know enough about stocks or money to say if its 'strictly true'.. I should have phrased, Bitcoin is not primarily a stock.

32 upvotes 24 downvotes..
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:14:51
like why in gods name would someone downvote this???
Did anyone think of how reddit can easily be controlled by a malicious actor? Such as a bank or something in the case of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:22:27
wow wish someone would give me a tip like that!!
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:58:27
Oh i wasnt trying to pigeonhole it my bad!! thats exactly what I was trying to avoid. I was just saying some people do pigeon hole it, like as a stock or whatever, and thats bad.  I like calling it electronic cash, lets people use their imaginations for the kinds of our protocol can do.

I post something about this and I get willythewanker swearing at me.  i look at his posts and its like this 
Just officially got into bitcoins, couple of quick questions about starting out, and the future of bitcoins. by icecool988in Bitcoin
[–]WallyTheWanker 1 point 2 hours ago
Don't be so fucking gullible! First of all if you did a search you would've seen that just today you are the 8th person or so to ask this question. Which makes you an annoying prick. And second nobody knows what Bitcoin will do. Nobody! If you are older than 15 then i can't believe you would ask such a thing. Do you think anybody here can look into the future? And that guy saying 300k is obviously pulling numbers out if his ass. Guess what, he is some dumbass who owns a few coins who wants to get rich. So what else he is gonna say than 300k? It's called the Bitcoin fantasy land syndrome. A lot of people here suffer from it. And i can tell you sure look like a good candidate for it!

Fraud, Chargebacks, and How Bitcoin Can Prevent Both by noel20in Bitcoin
[–]WallyTheWanker 0 points 8 hours ago
How many happy posts have i seen here that Paypal refunded BFL money. Money that people who paid with Bitcoin never saw back. People even suggested here not to pay with Bitcoin. And how safe is it? Insane amounts of bitcoins got stolen over the years. These awesome features of Bitcoin aren't that awesome really. I rather buy a product with my card or paypal and gladly pay a few % extra. I'll have buyer protection. No way i'll buy an expensive product with Bitcoin.

No, you are the idiot if you think that anyone here, or on this planet, can tell you what Bitcoin will do.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:50:59
what is wrong with my PR?? I'm doing everything myself.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:34:06
couldnt agree more!! spread the word! the more people with BTC the better!!!
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:32:24
Where is the real to the moonguy?? I want to ride his rocket right into outerspace!! take me to new heights!
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:25:43
ughh it really makes me sick the way the guys in the bitcoin community are treating girls. . someone messaged me saying that bitcoin doesnt need girls!! that doesnt make sense, what currency excludes FIFTY PERCENT of the population??
YOU TROLLS need to wake up and realize how much money will be pumped into BTC if its adopted by everyone-- and that means WOMEN.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:30:05
yes!! thats exactly what bitcoin needs !! control by a central authority!!! 
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:44:37
Is there a new site to post at?  I was going to make my first post on GirlsGoneBitcoin today!!  
Meanwhile I've been using my twitter (  )

can u explain this to me??
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:49:47
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:22:38
yeah girls certainly dont use consumer electronics like cell phones or websites like facebook.. they will never use btc either!
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:48:44
Its ignorant thinking like this that is slowing the real usefulness of bitcoin!   Theres so much innovation untapped!  
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:53:12

why are you using it on me then??
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:32:29
i find it very interesting that you took the time to type this reply, yet have very little / nothing of substance to say.  
Do you just like arguing with a pretty girl? Are you like the kid that was mean to me in grade school cuz he had a crush on me??
Is that actually what's going on with all my downvoting on reddit??
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:39:02
Hmmm I thought a Bitcoin address was complicated but look how hard it is to use any of the 'traditional' payment methods!! some are 8 lines long!!
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:07:44
cue lil wayne!! a mili a mili a mili!!
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:37:21
okay right, but girls going bitcoin was down then and I dont want to do porn or nudity or fuck myself with a banana.. Im working on a new business model but i dont want to post too many details on reddit cos it could be huge.. and if bitcoin gets adopted by the american girl, we will all be much reacher due to the increased customer base.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:24:45
22 upvotes 10 downvotes... really?? WHY
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:42:50

@_date: 2013-10-31 09:37:01
thank you for calling me elaborate. that is the nicest thing that anyone on reddit has said about me.  
I'm convinced at this point r/Bitcoin is an eleborate troll account.  I refuse to believe that stupidity of that level is natural.
Hail President Space-Lizard
I'm out seeya on BitcoinTalk &lt;3&lt;3 
Also someone said my twitter is just spam and selfies, what is a twitter supposed to be?  
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:04:28
Hi!  Since this site is down I dont know where else to post!  I got interested in Bitcoin a few days ago and I think its so exciting!!! I got together a few of my friends and we are working on a concept that you will all love!! 
This is NOT porn based at all!!
For now you can check my twitter feed for updates and pictures of me!! I won't be going wild perse, but Bitcoin does get me excited!!
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:37:49
okay this is why i dont like reddit. its just a popularilty contest which is fine for some things, but NOT FOR THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.  How many great ideas would have been downvoted out of existence if reddit had been around for longer?  Maybe even Bitcoin itself.
edit:  I'm just saying its not fair to downvote me without providing an argument as to why I'm wrong or irrelevant; it doesnt do anyone good.
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:24:01
Are you a programmer??

I'm trying to figure out how to fund my pic sessions with bitcoin, sounds like we are on the same page!
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:53:33
oh wow thats so sexy!! i dont know what it is but the idea of Bitcoin just excites me more than anything else going on right now.  I dont care about stupid pop music or facebook or other things girls my age are talking about all i can think about is the revolution that digital currency is going to shape!!
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:37:23
besides its a well known fact that 95% of guys spend 95% of their money on girls anyways.
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:06:55
and who are you to be bossing me around like this?? I have a NEW business that is DIFFERENT then girlsgonebitcoin.. Thats not RIGHT to say that thats the ONLY place on the internet/reddit that girls can go post pictures of themselves on it for bitcoin.. why is my plan to spread the news about my bitcoin venture any different then a site that accepts bitcoins for graphics hardware or sports jerseys or whatever
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:51:28
yeah sorry i think i just got too excited!!  I will try to be more intelligent on here
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:44:08
Why does this get 36 upvotes but when i plug my independent twitter bitcoin business i get downvoted and harassed to hell?
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:16:44
not gettin downvoted to hell
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:11:05
i used the word dominate in jest referring to your use of it.  I should have single quoted it to show my sarcasm.  I'm not used to having my ramblings being judged so critically but I'm up to the challenge. 
What I was saying is "Being nice to someone is not the same as forcing them to submit to you"
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:23:41
I'm waiting for an investor to take the Bitcoin plunge on me!!
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:36:40
if i make my own sub to promote my own site, will i get tos'd like girls gone bitcoin did?  also i dont do porn or nude nor have i ever posted on that sub.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:29:30
then prepare to get downvoted into the unholy depths of hell!! yes i can def relate from talking to the libertarians on twitter.. LMAO u made me giggle
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:05:33
thank youuu &lt;3 i will!
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:47:48
right, which is what I'm saying the bitcoin protocol is strong, but it needs an idiot proof software overlay to get mass appeal.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:57:53
i stopped doing that and apologized for it in a thread that the mod was in and said i wouldnt do it anymore.. that post was of course deleted though
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:10:31
yes i have a twitter thats getting popular twitter.com/bitcoinbabe
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:19:18
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:31:43
it sounds like banter.. stop all this hate!
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:41:30
I'm having the same problem! As full of potential as BTC is, its still pretty clunky.. not ready to pass the 19 year old girl test!
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:41:54
btc opens up all kinds of business models not possible with some lump of metal!!
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:23:50
woah that is not what I meant.
@_date: 2013-10-27 20:36:11
i take sexy pictures and I GFE... follow me on twitter you'll know I'm the real deal!! 
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:05:12
okay then for that part i sincerly apologize you will not see any address from me on this subreddit respect to reddit/bitcoin.  sorry i just dont know if reddit is the best format i sort of like forums better, this whole upvoting thing is like, not really a good thing for a few reasons.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:33:22
saying what certain people can or can not do with certain bitcoins is against the idea of bitcoin.  they should be sold and tumbled and put back into the stream.  
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:56:43
the we that needs to push people is the 90% of people here (including myself lol) that thing 1 BTC is worth 1,000 or 10,000 USD and its just a matter of time before we are all stinking rich from early adopting.
and yes. be nice to people so they will submit to you and join btc instead of hating it out of spite for our shitty attitudes.
