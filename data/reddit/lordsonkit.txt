* It is backed by nothing
* We can create unlimited amount (PS  Altcoin)
* If it isnt a scam, it gotta be a ponzi
* Am I to late
* MAGIK ONLINE HYIP
Again for F sake, you don't introduce people by telling them Bitcoin = profit or Bitcoin = Magic internet money (You can as a chat starter, for 2 seconds), but on the first time of chat, you gotta imprint to them the power of this protocol instead of the price of this commodity.

When the govt cuts off the 3G connection of the protest area, think what would happen. You are all disconnected and you have no way to communicate. Firechat could work by communicating using bluetooth, which all the message propagates to nearby protesters using Firechat.

It doesn't really matter if one side is louder or not. Of course people can buy up media and stuff like that to get exposure on their views. If you think this thing is nice, stay and have fun. You can buy coins, or even business. else you can perhaps walk away and look if Bitcoin is going up sky or rock bottom. The utility value of Bitcoin, the advantages of it is here. And it is up to you and everyone how much it values.

Yes, indeed Bitcoin could, for now, be applied to a lot of things. In the future, who knows if Bitcoin is going to be in the front-facing use or was is a backend method for value sending.
For now, the risk of double-spending is here for unconf. tx.. (Which if we apply to everyday use of credit card, is the time between you swipe and the time that merchant actually get the money w/o a risk of reverse transaction. Should be about 30-90 days). 
If you are a merchant that sell coffee, the transaction is about few bucks. You can take the risk of 0 conf tx as long as it is well fee-ed and well propagated since the money you lost is insignificant compared to the time that you are going to wait.  But if you buy a car or house, you probably going for a 6 conf. (Which is about an hour)
Of course you can do off chain transaction, but thats a hell lotta risk since there is a point of trust. You can switch to litecoin for faster block time perhaps, but the waiting time is still here

Hey, since I've talked with the operator like a month ago. Would like to share a bit on here. He is a Bitcoin fan for like 2-3 years and treat this as a side project
As we all know these thing (esp the palm thing) can't really sell for money, and he personally is not those kinda of crazy person (like those in NSA??). Additionally collecting personal data (biometric and ID such and such) is regulated. The collection of those things are actually more like a liability than an asset since he might break HK laws if he handles mistakenly. Currently he is negotiating with Robo to have alternative measures on verification of users, and he hope to have soft-launch to end after things have got in place.

I am 16 and I am interested and hold bitcoin, dealing with Bitcoin for 2 years will all the freelance and some buying and investing. Bitcoin, for us is like a financial lesson, but cheaper. You should probably learn and read articles. I am a Chinese but I read most English articles as Chinese articles are shit and talks ONLY about the price. Bitcoin is not only about the currency, but the protocol. Once you get the whole thing, get some in your hands (Caveat Emptor, dont buy what you cant afford losing), try buy stuff, do some investment, lose some in casino, lend some out and let people default on you. Now you learn the basic to be wary of your money. This is how I learn to manage my Bitcoin / even fiat money IRL. But hope you can take a shorter path, learn from my/others mistake.

The price imho reflects 2 thing. 1: how the hype had gone recently. 2: what is the utility value of Bitcoin, with item 1 taking the most portion, the price is not what is the best to focus on. If we got to 10,000 price point now what? Without merchant adoption, user participation, infrastructure, clear guidelines etc. Bitcoin is nothing more than digital money to enrich a few.
What we (I think, and i hope) most people here on the view of Bitcoin is that it is NOT some sort of magic money, it is not a get-rich-quick and it is certainly not something that continue to help the growth of current corruption of the government. It is a project, and a protocol that will put the power back to the people and perhaps make a better way for the payment method in future.

My comment
If Bitcoin is being counterfeited that they can generate whatever Bitcoin they want, since Bitcoin uses SHA256 encryption, a government and bank standard. If Bitcoin be printed at an unlimited amount, the current bank system and government will be compromised.
Second is to have over 50% of the world's mining power so that a miner can control what transaction they include. While the state-owned supercomputer in 2012, have a power of 17 Petaflops (calculating speed) per seconds. The whole mining network has 58000 Petaflops. So the whole Bitcoin network is pretty darn secure.
Next for recent scandals that "Bitcoin stolen", actually is that a;) You don't own the coin. b) Computer was hacked and the Private key of the address is stolen. By owning a Bitcoin, people MUST have the sole ownage of the private key. And same, if a gold vault got robbed,  the one to blame is the vault, not the gold.
Images that explain Bitcoin address there are.

Actually the transaction done by credit cards are in a zero transaction status too. See with the power that banks or Paypal can do reverse transaction and pull the money outta you, it is a zero confirmation. Bitcoin shorten the timeframe of that from 3 months to a whopping 10 minutes. Nice enough.

I am a 16 y/o guy living in Hong Kong, I build website and have found myself into Bitcoin 2 years ago. Now I have a big block of coin despite I have quit mining for quite some time. Few days ago I have bought some Physical Coin of Bitcoin and I posted it on my Facebook stream. Some of my schoolmate is nice enough to be curious about it. And in school sometimes my schoolmate will be curious about what I am doing and how Bitcoin is performing. School is a nice spreader of knowledge, esp. with the amount of coins I have, guys are interested.

I'd treat Bitcoin as an commodity (since the model of it is derived from Gold) and a payment system (Very clear why).
If you take a step back and look at Gold, not many people are using it as a barter system, it is rather just something hold a purchasing value and it is deflationary like Bitcoin. While with Bitcoin, the protocol improved on the easeness on bartering with stuff. If we count the value of gold nowadays by solely looking on the transaction volume, gold would literally worth somewhere like zero.
 For the too much in growth, Bitcoin is a very young system that is on this world for 5 years. And it is started at 0. With anything divided by zero, it is infinity. It is irrational to just look at the growth in this short term period.
For the transaction time that we are seeing now, it is actually a common issue on having transaction dealing on the internet. Though Visa Paypal etc can see the transaction as it arrives, just like Bitcoin's unconfirmed transaction. You will not be able to use the money right away, instead you have to wait for months until the banks see it not a fraud transaction and accept it. While Bitcoin, after 1 confirmations, your coins are belongs to you and you can spend it anywhere without worrying that the "bank" will reverse a transaction and put you in debt.

I'd rather think Bitcoin as a commodity rather than currency.  Look at how  Bitcoin characteristic looks like a precious metal than a currency.
Currency is mostly having a central authority to do the "trust" , backed by the unwillingness to go to jail (coz of not paying tax), they can print whatever they want while commodity is limited by nature and the valuation is decided mostly by the free market.
The thing that Bitcoin is ever close to a currency is that the trading of it is easy. Well this is the characteristic from Bitcoin payment network and we should rather classify this as a payment network rather than a currency as the whole thing is a barter system that you toss "Bitcoin", something that we value around for goods, which looks like more of a barter on Bitcoin (or fill your precious metal name here) than a transaction on currency.
tl;dr: Bitcoin had long been a commodity

I agree to that it is really a mystery on what will happen upon the dev. stage. Lots of people have thought Bitcoin as a currency but for me I think that is would rather be a commodity just like what you've said.
By the word currency, it is rather like something that is regulated by some authorities such that it would be rather stable.
While commodity is what is should act to be, like a product or goods. It is a limited amount of goods that being traded with other stuff. Just like gold, when you deal with transaction it is rather a barter than just a number game. And frankly with the design of Bitcoin, it is simulating the structure of Gold so that instead of making it a currency, it is a commodity.
But what stands out is that Bitcoin is also a payment system, in which advance the current VISA Paypal etc in many ways such as the low tx fee and the anonymity.

Gold store robbery and bank robbery makes them both worth nothing
Volitile are comparative. Even more don't you know that Bitcoin is colorless on growth. Up to now we are sill higher than the last rally at April. Compare your USD, still less purchasing power what you get from the past. 
People who néed privacy go to local bitcoins. Who says you must get through government. Even you can launder your coins at places like justdice. And transaction can't be controlled by government. This is what make Bitcoin more advanced. 
Yes Bitcoin is deflationary. If it isn't, who would have got on here with this publicity if we say here are unlimited supply.  
You have to be powerful enough and innovative enough. You just can't make a random coin with a few variables modify and expect people get on and say that crap is valueable
If a guy bought in a stock in. A cheap price and it grows. Does it make the stock a pyramid scheme. 
Than the paper should be overvalued by much if you say the utility value of it. Bitcoin has utility value because Bitcoin is the only way you can use the payment network's advantage. That's why it worth. Btw most money is in bank digitally. Take a look how much it worth in your banks. 
VISA take 3 months to confirm your transaction and really credit you with that. That's an improvement. 
Fee is to protec the network. A few cents is quite a lot compared to PayPal or credit card. 0.3USD PLus 3%. 
To review transaction publicitly withou the government bound. That is worth zero utility

Instead of currency, Bitcoin should be a commodity. See how Bitcoin's basic structure of scarcity have much similarity to Gold. Well Gold is a commodity.

DiceNow is an innovative site for gambling BOTH Bitcoin and Litecoin. It is by far the most far reaching Bitcoin dice game place. But of coz, they are new so the bankroll is kinda small for now.
The best thing of this site is leverage investment.Since the probability on having the invest profit to have a 30% or more cut is really low. So it is reasonable to take on some risk and leverage the investment and to maximize the return on your coins, with really low chance of busting the whole investment. Clever system I'd say.
Botting do exist in some other dice site but we got everything in pieces. You won't just go to a dice site for a single feature and have 10 account. The one click for 10000 bets botting is a nice feature for martingales.
What Just Dice users want are now here, what can I complain about (except the UI could make some improvement and they are working on it). 
This is what dedication and hardwork will create, something nice.

[TechWeb report]
News from 22nd November. Recently, the People's Bank of China (PBC) Deputy Governor Yi Gang shows opinion on Bitcoin for the first time. He reckon that from the perspective of the PBC, Bitcoin's legitimacy will not be recognized in short term. While Bitcoin as a online currency, peasants can have the freedom to participate online transactions. Moreover, Bitcoin is very special and innovative. Personally, Yi Gang will continue to speculate Bitcoin in long term
Insiders believe that his word towards Bitcoin is positive for the Bitcoin Investors. PBC doesn't recognize Bitcoin legitimacy is in expectation. While YiGang simultaneously show that Bitcoin is free to transfer on the internet, will not directly interferes. This might show that the development of  Bitcoin in China received the regulators' acquiescence
While some others also say the since the requirements of launching a Bitcoin Exchange is low, without the interruption of the regulators. The exchange market will be flooded with much more competitors. Moreover, since Bitcoin is a virtual currency that based of trust. Once there are more dishonest platform close down and escape with users fund (Translator's note: example - the GBL issue recently), it will cost greatly to the price of Bitcoin thus destroy the whole market order. Apart from Bitcoin exchanges, there had been other Bitcoin based business such as Bitcoin casino, these service indeed have cross the line of what financial regulators can control. Bringing huge risk to the participants
The Bitcoin market in China is hot recently, from the data from the largest Bitcoin exchange in China, including BTCChina, OKCoin and Huobi. The avg transaction per day is more than double of that the last month

Yes. They are marginally acceptable in my perspective. Anyway you also did other things to actually benefit the society instead of some guys trying to ddos their way out for business. Lets hope that things like that can make our dear devs to have some disks pace saving method out in the near future.

I view Bitcoin as a commodity and a payment network. Payment network, this point is clear. While Bitcoin's nature is like gold, limited supply, free market exchange (which leads to trading is rather a barter than a transaction)

Despite I started two years ago. I didn't get my fiat piggy bank into it until January this year. 2yrs ago was 10usd. Jan 13 was 25. And now is 130. I didn't put much fiat in it but I did a very successful leverage trading in 1broker and turned my 5btc to 20. Others are from some giveaways and works etc and some lucky tradings and investments

Read the history. Know the future. That's what everyone says. History says every fiat currency will crash. While most people haven't got their brain to work backwards. What makes no sense also be doomed to fail in their perspective

Imagine your Pebble watch or your iPhone bought with Bitcoin is stuffed with a GPS. You wrap it on your body and now that device had turned you in NSA dog. 
This is how much respect you have been given from America's government. *Pat Pat*

Really hope that your billboard will be attractive. Since we got one project previously with "donate [coin image] to [QR]". And it looks like a billboard for rent image.

It is possible to create a forced fork chain on that, since people's coin will be devaluated by 1000x, no one will continue to use that forked chain thus the Bitcoin on the forced forked chain will have no value.

I am 16 and I found my way to Bitcoin 2 years ago. I am not studying Econ in Highschool for now but surely Bitcoin is a great way to discover on it. I started small myself, and yes I did gamble and ends up losing some despite there are free coins given on there. With Bitcoin it is kinda like a portal for your full grown life, scale-able in price.
For now in Bitcoin I have dealt with buying coins, mining, gambling, buying stuff (shirt, coffee, Physical Coin), Buy securities, invest in anything else, loan out, make my own business (failed :P ), being scammed and busted out a scam. What great is that all the above didn't get my credit card since I dont even have one (I have fund that my parent store for me in bank thou). Plus the best thing is that fees are virtually zero, only some minor tx fee on those stock exchange, and the greatest fee is shipping for my stuff from US to HK.
Seriously, the above stuff have made me a great journey and lesson. Like gambling, after losing the limited coins you have, you will feel yourself kinda a jerk and know not to do the second time. It is better for anyone to know what harm will it get instead of your child being curious and get to Vegas and lose his college fund when he is 18 (I dont know if this will happen, not living in America). And I have dug deeper and start calculating the EV stuff and see which is the jerkiest casino and share this with others on BitcoinTalk.
Loaned out twice too, and both failed to be repaid back to me. Thats a lesson on never invest on what you can afford to lose. For now I have a great performance on investing stuff with a stable "income" like JustDice Coinlenders ASICMINING and hope I can pay my stuff in university (hopefully i get into) or even buy myself a flat in future (if Bitcoin performs super well)
Hope this isnt tldr, would like to sum up that Bitcoin is the cheapest way to let kids to get a taste of the mature world. Learn the best practices of financing, and best of all that it can trigger your emotion when you lose them (losing play money and real money is 2 different things)

We are one step nearer, this time is Low-Earth orbit. Might be next time. But I am sure that if they accept it on their Airlines, then we will surely get to the moon

Would CoinKite be the competitorof Bitpay in the future, their work seems promising and they are launching the payment system POS soon.

Last step is the seller get his/her account locked and closed down.

Btw. Snap card and bitsumo got nice service. Snapcard is waiving fees for now too!
