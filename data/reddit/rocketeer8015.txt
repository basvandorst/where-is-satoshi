Have fun explaining that particular bank transfer to the IRS... "Yep, that is thanks to my bitcoins, which have 1000x over the years, but actually I didn’t sell them! I borrowed against them and actually I’m *deducting* that interest from my taxes this year".

What do you mean could? You can. That’s what ETCs are for. Problem is you don’t actually have gold, you have a note receivable. You essentially have to trust someone else to take good care of your gold, not write note receivables on gold they don’t possess and don’t hand it over to the government due to some emergency law or for tax reasons. Considering the people taking care of your gold deposits are **banks**, which are guilty of doing all of the above with dollars ... they are not the **most** trustworthy bunch I guess?

Depends. Just because something is technologically better doesn’t mean it wins adoption, which means not appreciating in value, bleeding developers and ultimately falling behind.
It’s generally one of the biggest mistakes in investing to only look at the tech or quality behind a product. Marketing plays a role, being first to market is also a factor, also public perception. Doesn’t matter if you have the best product if everyone thinks it’s shitty or a competitor just drowns you out and no one knows about your product.
A crypto currency **needs** adoption. Without adoption there is no usecase, without usecase there is no investment, without investment the market cap stays small. And a small market cap ... at the end that’s the difference between Bitcoin and it’s identical fork Snowmannen-coin. Crypto derives it’s value from people believing in it. And people believe in successful things becoming more successful. That’s the reason they buy into bubbles after all.

No, that’s stupid advice. Not even Switzerland held to their bank secrecy laws when threatened by the US. I don’t care what nation that webpage is hosted in, they won’t put their citizens at risk of sanctions to protect US citizens. Even if they did, now your funds are in the possession of a company on a sanction list, congratulations, your situation just got a lot worse!
The correct advise is to hold your coin in your own wallet that only you have access to. Preferably a hardware wallet like ledger because that cuts down the human error chance of using a compromised phone or pc.

Oh please, there is a lawsuit going against nano. Because it’s a company, registered in Texas. That’s already a pretty severe disadvantage. It looks interesting I agree, but it’s also less secure than bitcoin due to its proof of stake version. The entire premise rests on the idea that a large group of stakeholders would always want what is best for nano, because they are large stakeholders. That completely ignores the possibility of a state actor being willing to take a loss to harm a system your banks rely on for example. And since everyone has his own blockchain that makes a hard fork, which is the natural defense in such a scenario, basically impossible.
I’m not saying it’s bad or something, it’s just going in a very different direction than what Satoshi intended for bitcoin. Censorship resistance and protection from state actors is quite a big part of it after all.

It’s not unusual, no. But it’s the reason crypto even exists in the first place! Do you think it’s a coincidence that bitcoins white paper got released directly after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression?
The problem with your money in a bank is  essentially if you deposit $1,000 dollar into your bank they go ahead and lend 10,000 of that out to customers. And that’s not a typo. The $9000 that they lend someone but wasn’t deposited by anyone gets created out of thin air. It’s part of the reason a ounce of gold once was worth $20, and now is $1400. 
If you store crypto in a bank ... that’s not a good idea. It would be **less** safe since they would control it. And banks need money to operate, so they need to get a cut from your crypto in some way for them to be offering their "service", see fractional reserve banking(they get the interest on the money they lend out based on your deposit). 
That you don’t see the problem tells me you don’t really understand what almost happened in 2008, what was **not** done to prevent a even worse repeat and which steps to take to protect yourself. The situation is much worse than it looks.

That’s what we had before Nixon abolished the gold standard... the problem with that is the apparent fact that a single person can abolish that connection between your issued coins/paper and safely stored gold. At which point the gold is still safely stored, but it’s no longer **your** gold. Which makes the entire concept inferior to actual physical gold **in your possession.**
And that’s what’s awesome about crypto. As they say, Possession is nine-tenths of the law. With crypto it’s more like possession is nobody-cares-about-the-law-this-shits-mine! It’s extremely hard for **anyone** to take your crypto’s away from you against your will or without your cooperation. 
Imagine two twins each being stuck in a unhappy marriage with a hateful wife falling into a coma for 10 years. One twin had a bar of gold and the other three bitcoins. Who of the two will wake up to his shit still being in his possession? Yeah, maybe the bitcoins are worth shit after ten years in a coma, but at least the bitch didn’t get shit.

I’m not seeing how not having bitcoins would have helped in any way, shape or form in that situation.
Bitcoin just as likely to outpace inflation. That’s what happens if you try to fit a couple trillion dollars into a 250 billion market. It blows up.

I think because they often do it in a way that worsens them in another way. Like having higher speed by being more centralised, less secure or under control of a company or few individuals which in turn might be subject to local laws.
I’m not aware of a coin that has **all** of bitcoins advantages while doing away with some of its disadvantages. Not saying it isn’t out there, there are like a thousand coins out there.
There is also the historical aspect, few coins older than two years had a better RoI than Bitcoin over that time. Two years ago Bitcoin had 38% market capitalisation and Ethereum 31%, now they are at 64% and 8.5%. And ethereum isn’t even considered a shitcoin ... Bitcoin cash peaked at like 10% and ripple at 15%, both far lower now. I mean I rarely refer to a specific coin as shitcoin, but I’m fine with throwing every new coin into the shit bin and have it crawl out of it on its own merit, preferably by having actual success instead of the most awesome white paper.

I don’t think that’s how money laundering works ... the entire point is turning suspicious money into inconspicuous money, so you can explain how you can afford your mansion and lambo. I don’t see how involving a serial less gold bar would help there. It’s not exactly less conspicuous to be caught with that vs having a lot of dollars with you.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:06:25
I don’t see how you can get around the problem that if your not in possession of something than your ownership of said thing becomes precarious. Your dependent on a 3rd party to enforce it in your interest. Like a judge ruling in your favour to be granted possession of the thing. That relies on two uncertain provisions:
1.	The thing being in the judges jurisdiction or reach.
2.	The law being in your favour.
Last point is especially critical. If possession of gold gets prohibited for example, or if possession is unclear(as in the thing was bought from a shared account and there is a disagreement) ... it’s the same reason smart contracts can easily contain digital things, like wrapped btc, but have a hard time linking to physical objects. Without actual possession they are not enforceable, neither by math nor by judges, which renders them worth less(not worthless though).
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:26:02


That’s not money laundering though which you mentioned, thats literal gold laundering, I.e. obscuring the source of gold. It’s useless for money laundering because of this:
Dirty money —&gt; Dirty Gold —&gt; Dirty money
It may or may not be easier to transport than your regular currency, in Venezuela sure, US and Europe not so much. If your problem is having money you can’t explain and want to transport, I don’t see how turning it into gold that you can’t explain would help much. Also gold bars are not that easy to buy and sell in bulk, either way you end up with two tainted things you need to **actually** launder. The guy that exchanged your cash to gold in country A has to explain where his cash comes from and his gold went and the guy in country B has to explain where his cash went and his gold came from.
It really only helps with the transport and seems like a logistical nightmare otherwise. And even transport is questionable, you can fit about 1 million $ into a briefcase. That’s about 20 kg of gold ...

That’s the whole point of my comment. If you wait until they **do** have problems with USA it’s a tad bit late to do something about it. Again, Switzerland’s banks had no problems with USA either. Until they did. Even if you get your coins off in time, they could hand over a paper trail 10-20 years later that proves you evaded taxes back then and the IRS will **ruin** your life. Or at least make a decent attempt for it.
And I’m not even talking about intentional tax evasion, might simply be a oversight. Like not understanding FIFO can get weird if trading crypto to crypto. Some exchanges also delete your transactions after x months, or they go under and you have no access to the logs anymore. That can get nasty tax wise.
The right thing imho is transferring it to a unknown(new) wallet under your control and take it from there. For example if op follows your advice and would directly transfer his coins from Coinbase to a foreign exchange not cooperating with the US ... that’s not gonna look good to the IRS and we already established Coinbase **will** inform them. If you send the coins to some unknown wallet, you can claim it was a hooker, drug dealer or some paper wallet that got eaten by your dog. But a foreign exchange? Yeah good luck with that.

Gold is unnecessary for conductivity, which is why it’s use in electronics is down while total electronic devices still climbs steeply. It’s used for its non corrosive properties while still being a decent conductor. Expect less gold use in the future.
Jewellery is another poor example, there is no way to distinguish real gold earrings from cheaper gold plated fakes while being worn. So yeah, I could buy jewellery for cheap that looks real and keep the difference in bitcoin. Still it’s a fair point as most people prefer real jewellery. Which is a poor idea though as it holds its value poorly compared to gold bars(changes in style etc of jewellery). If you ever tried to sell a vintage gold necklace you would know that it will **not** sell for more than its weight in gold. If it would everyone would be investing in gold jewellery instead of bullions and bars.
What I meant was that bitcoin can do x transactions per second now and maybe x1000 in the future. While gold is a poorer conductor than copper now and always will be. Also there are new materials coming like graphene. Last but not least about half the gold is held by central banks around the world, if we get in some financial crisis and they start liquidating en mass gold is fall like crazy. That’s a property of gold as well, being subject to the whims of central banks.

I mean the physical exchange of gold vs goods. You would be scalped since gold isn’t really that easily portioned. I.e. you want to buy a loaf of bread but your smallest gold denomination is a 1/10th ounce of gold. The change you get will be whatever the merchant has, likely something far less stable than gold. If you complain he could just not sell you his bread, more likely than not someone else will buy it.

The infrastructure I get, but protect the currency? How? And from what? Rising vs other currencies? Falling against other currencies? Either can be positive or negative.
And how do they do it? If Trump doesn’t like the exchange from dollar vs Euro does he tell a general to call Angela Merkel and give her a ultimatum? What could she even do? The exchange rate gets determined on a public market.
Lastly some of the strongest currencies in the world are held by nations whose military power projection is a total joke compared to even the national guard of a single US state(Switzerland’s for example). Not to mention that your debt isn’t that big at all compared to your GDP, again, plenty nations with anemic military power have a greater debt to GDP ratio.
So in summary I don’t think your military has much to with your debt or currency at all. The dollar and your sovereign debt is backed by by your GDP and myriad of world leading companies fair and square.

Maybe we just have a different perception of what makes a currency strong ... to me if I get less every year for the same amount of currency that’s not a growing strength even if more people use it. The ultimate purpose of any money is to exchange it for goods. If I get less goods, for whatever reason, that’s not strength.
Even if it was the only currency in the world, you would still have to exchange it for other things, like gold, to preserve its value over time.

Eh, it’s no fault of any currency that in extreme situations people will value specific need items(like water, food, shelter, medicine or warm clothes) above value exchange items(like money, gold or bitcoin).

Don’t confuse a cute saying with actual laws. If you steal someone’s private key those are not your coins, you just have control over them. Possession and ownership are distinct.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:42:56
That’s why I said **or**. It’s different from country to country. In some the the government gives out the currency in others they have a independent reserve.
What I mean with the owed part is that if you hand over $1000k to a bank the money is no longer in your possession but the bank now owes you this 1000k. Which is why you can loose money if a bank goes broke. If they where just sitting on that money it could never be gone right? But they do stuff with it instead, fractional lending being the least worrisome of it. 
Again, the details vary from country to country. Most places there is some sort of reserve the bank pays into for each customer, some limit to which your money is guaranteed. Above that? Well sucks to be you.

Man, so many misconceptions. 
1.	Bitcoin are not on pcs or phones, they are on the blockchain. Your private key can be on a small hardware wallet, you can pretty easily hide that and leave a fake one with some Satoshi around. Better yet have half a dozen with lots of movements but little balance on them so you can hand something over if they threaten violence or your family.
2.	They can’t trace much unless they have all the addresses involved, which they won’t. If you spread it among many addresses, phones etc they will never know wether they have a part of it or everything. The reason addresses are known is because most people receive the coins in them from kyc exchange. A business like this doesn’t do that, it receives it from non kyc sources(OTC).
3.	This was a shakedown by a couple corrupt arseholes, not a sting operation by the IRS with months of planning behind it. Bitcoin addresses are as private as Swiss number based bank accounts, possible to trace but not likely by some backwater pos government flunky in a banana (dictator) republic. No offence to Venezuelans intended, I only refer to your current state of government.
Basically it is extremely hard to prove for someone else that you have a certain amount of bitcoin. I mean sure, if I buy 0.1 btc from Coinbase and transfer those to some never before seen address, Coinbase and anyone they share that data with can be reasonably sure that I hold those coins and the address is my wallet that I created.
It could also be my cousins wallet though, who lives in China half a world away and asked me to deposit some btc for him in **his** wallet because he doesn’t have access to an exchange. And that’s already the easiest situation possible, a kyc exchange that has my personal information and a government that has access to said exchanges transaction data.
If that had been some random dude buying 5 bottles of whisky otc, that he got from some other dude for fixing his Harley, who got his btc from some drug addict that runs a mining farm in his basement... your not tracing that shit.

Ofc it’s relevant. It’s meant to show the rarity of bitcoin. The point is that even if all the billionaires and millionaires wanted a bitcoin and where ready to sell everything they owned it would be impossible for the millionaires to get 1 btc each.
It’s meant to put the current price in perspective. $10000 seems expensive, but that’s only because demand is low. If crypto becomes a asset class people diversify into like gold or bonds(you should have x% crypto in your portfolio) and bitcoin keeps its market share than it will by necessity go to the moon. Or, well, maybe the stratosphere.
@_date: 2019-08-08 08:39:03
How much of that is historical wisdom though? Habits die hard especially if they weigh billions and for the last century it was a extremely smart and good way to diversify your risk for a still very respectable return.
I mean in the 1990s Germany sold 10 year bonds at 10%. I would be 50% bonds if we still had yields like that, it’s a no brainer.
But a negative yield? For arguably a **higher** risk? If the Euro zone goes belly up you’d be lucky if you got your old bonds recognised in the new currency at cost. The exchange rate prolly won’t be that favourable, given the desperate need for money the EU states will have.
I just can’t look at a negative yield, with a fairly sizeable inflation on top mind you, saying "this is fine".
It’s ok now, because as the central banks further cut rates the already existing bonds will rise in resale value, as they offer a higher rate than new bonds. But at some point there are no further rate cuts, and some poor sod needs to pick up the bill and actually hold these bonds to fruition. Likely someone required by law to buy them, that’s not going to end well.

There is no holy grail for privacy. It’s very many things, technological, behavioural, sanitary computer environments(if your pc or smartphone is compromised there is no privacy) etc.
Bitcoin is already fully private **unless** someone makes the connection between you as a person and a wallet address. Which is rather easy for the exchange that sold you your btc for example.
But if you buy btc at an ATM, and then pay your buddy on a new never before used wallet. That’s fairly private. It’s the other things we do that break privacy.

It’s also pretty likely that the next recession will have something to do with the whole debt and central bank money printing as well as **bond buying.** 
I mean does that fill you with confidence when the central bankers of your country buy the same assets as you with wild eyes and shaky hands? 
The last thing I want to be invested in if **this** recession hits is fiat money. Yeah, sure. Bonds are very save. A large part of why they are save is because the government can always pay them back. If they can’t pay them back they just print more money, here is your money in nice $10000 bills.

Buying in bulk gives discount, avoiding kyc costs extra, taking cash or exposing oneself adds extra risk(forged bills, gunpoint transactions) which also costs extra. 
10% extra is normal given your situation, ATM takes around 8% but there are limits making it a drawn out process. So you pay 2% for the added convenience. It’s a fair deal.

That a nice explanation of what to do with 10 billion. But those ten billion sure as shit didn’t get accumulated that way. So anyone with that kind of money will probably just keep doing what made him a billionaire in the first place.
There are two kinds of people that buy these bonds.
1.	Traders. They get sold at a discount, if you buy now and the rate lowers further they will rise in value. It’s a decent bet that works well because:
2.	Fond Managers that are legally required to hold a certain percentage of safe government bonds like pension funds.
Nobody sane bids on these and then holds onto them. Burning money is burning money.

There are already decentralized exchanges that allow crypto to crypto conversions. The key is that they **need** to be decentralized, otherwise they just get shut down immediately.
For fiat to crypto currently the only way is p2p meeting at a cafe and paying cash or using a bitcoin ATM. I don’t think that’s gonna change anytime soon either unless you could convince your boss to pay you in crypto. And even then, they would know you as a crypto holder. I think p2p is gonna be king for the foreseeable future. Until they start asking you where your bitcoin went, can’t cough them or a receipt that you spent them up?

It’s not FUD but highly misleading. Typical quality agenda driven journalism where they first decide on the story and then try to create a situation that more or less fits the narrative.
It’s not the paying with bitcoins part that didn’t go well. What really went on was him going to a so-called bitcoin cafe to test paying with bitcoin, only that he didn’t **have** any bitcoin. That kinda complicated the payment side. So he did what any sane person would do in his situation and asked one of the patrons to spot him some bitcoin for a twenty. No I’m kidding. He decided to use a bitcoin ATM, because obviously that’s part of the normal everyday bitcoin experience. Unfortunately he decided to buy such a tiny amount($25) that the ATM provider lowered the transfer fee next to nothing, so it took obviously a long time to clear.
I don’t quite understand what kind of point he was trying to make apart from him being totally unprepared for the topic he decided to report on. I would like to read a CC payment report from him where he decides to go somewhere and pay with a CC, which he does not have... so he goes and buys a prepaid one, which he then has trouble filling with funds because he insist on doing it via his banks voice controlled phone banking system. Man ... it sure takes long to pay with a credit card ...
You know why it’s dishonest? Because during his entire sob story of him failing at using technology he never questioned wether he is doing something wrong. In fact he manages to blame the bar for his poor experience with the ATM. Which is nuts. Read the fine print on the ATM man.

Ah i get it now, it’s public but not really common knowledge.
You know how paper money is also called a banknote right? In the past it was basically a piece of paper issued by private banks that was legally redeemable for a fixed amount of gold or silver at every office of said bank. You didn’t own the Bank note, you owned the asset briefed in it.
Like a token you get at a hotel when you hand in your luggage, you own the luggage, not the token.
Then came the age of national bank notes, now you could redeem your notes at **every** bank for the declared amount of gold and merchants where forced to accept them as they had become **legal tender**.
Well and then they stopped giving you gold or silver for them. It’s essentially Monopoly money at this point, if you borrowed the board game that is so you wouldn’t even own the fake money.
Which is why dollar lost &gt;95% of its value. Nations playing around with worthless Monopoly money is essentially the source of our financial crisis.

If you went in at bitcoins "IPO" at $0.10, you could get back your entire initial investment by selling 0,001% of your current worth.

It is sort of a red flag to see it rise like that, but the only way you can ever experience buying a Apple, Google, Facebook at its infancy etc is by not selling the moment you have xx% profit.

It’s literally in the history books. The US started fractional holding of dollar to gold, everyone held their horses and kept their feet still.

Sounds backwards since you specifically chose the option without insurance behind it. Also overestimating ones intelligence and abilities is one of the most prevalent problems our society has.
For example storing paper in a fire proof safe does not mean it will survive a house fire, it depends on the fire and the safe. But some people assume fire proof safe means fire can’t harm the contents.
If we are realistic the safest way is probably a 3of5 multi signature wallet. 1 key owner, 2 keys trusted friends/family, 1 key notary and one key in a bank vault. 3 keys required, no key holder but owner knows about other key holders. 
That covers all eventualities while making it very unlikely you loose access to your coins due to an accident.

Not easily. 
For one they could render the devices inoperable via firmware update, those have to be initiated by the user though. Another way would be to disable the application you use to interact with the ledger hardware wallets, there are third party wallets that can interact with them as well though.
The most reliable way would be first a change in the ledger live software regarding firmware updates, and then force a new firmware on your ledger device the next time you allow access to it for the app. Which afaik only occurs when you install apps on it (sending or receiving afaik does not grant the kind of access necessary for firmware changes). That would be both very obvious(your device is bricked) and hard(impossible?) to time in a way that it affects all users concurrently before they hear about it.
All of the above however couldn’t prevent one from using the 24 word seed phrase used for initialising the device to derive all your private keys and gain access to your coins in any number of other soft- and hardware wallets.
**Both** of these things have to happen to loose access to your coins:
1.	Loose 24 word seed phrase.
2.	Brick ledger/forget pin.

Outlawing is extremely easy, enforcing that is harder. But it places you in extremely dangerous situations, imagine a bad breakup and your spouse accusing you of having a illegal btc wallet. Or a state Trojan infiltrating your pc, maybe a sting operation where a cop poses as someone that wants a payment in btc from you or the other way. 
That’s 10 years right there in India’s proposed law, there goes custody of your kids and **any** hope of a normal employment for the rest of your life. Who would risk a 10 year prison sentence? That’s a harder punishment than rape or murder in some first world countries. At that point really only hardened criminals would use btc, you’d be in one group with terrorists, drug lords and hitmen. Silkroad would look like a college pool party with beer by comparison.
I think there is room to improve bitcoin, but there can be no privacy in a unfree society. The real fight for privacy happens in the voting booth, not on github. Projects like Monero etc are a important bandaid for people in unsophisticated unfree societies. In a sophisticated unfree society ... you only need to slip up once, get your trust betrayed once, underestimate your enemies once and the consequences would be horrible. 
At no point will any form of **money** be able to protect your privacy. Money is something that is used for exchange and barter at its core, it’s at that point where they get you, when you are exchanging your money with someone for something. When the digital world crosses the real world. Like I said the both of us could exchange bitcoin all day already, if that’s all we do it’s private. But if I want to sell you my cannabis sapling, i have to know your address, i have to go to the post office, it would compromise the both of us if I was under observation.

Depends on the exchange. Coinbase for example **never** has been hacked afaik, and they serve 20 million customers. Take a random group of 20 million non exchange coin storing users and I bet you will probably have thousands that lost access to their bitcoins in varying ways(there are estimated 3-5 million "lost" btc).
So ... define safety. Without a single successful hack you can’t even put a percentage to the risk of getting hacked, add to that they have insured every single account up to 100k(or was it 200k?) with Lloyd’s in London which is **kinda** reputable and your risk shrinks basically to government intervention(ordering Coinbase to freeze your funds) which is a entirely different category of risk.
To make a informed decision you basically have to compare the likelihood of getting your account frozen vs loosing access to your secret key held by yourself. Considering quite a few people believe **paper** is a good way to **permanently** store your seed phrase ... from a statistics POV a exchange like Coinbase might actually be safer since most people never experience a account freeze(that isn’t quickly reversed) but loose even important documents quite a lot.
Most bitcoin advocates don’t like people storing their coins on exchanges because it creates a systemic risk that incentivises an attack that would otherwise have been deemed unsuitable(talking about government intervention). So safer for the individual doesn’t mean safer for the network. We are prepared to have the weak gazelle(careless or extremely unlucky user) be eaten by the lions(forgetfulness, carelessness, house fires etc) to protect the herd(bitcoin network).

Proof? None of the ones i named are know to possess significant amounts of gold or bonds. Warren Buffett outright advises against it. 
Investing is about Total Returns, it doesn’t matter wether you have $20 billion or $20.000. If one investment strategy nets you 10% on average and the other 2% on average the choice is clear for both. That’s especially true for rich people since they are hardly affected by even a 80% drawdown. 
In my country we have several billionaire families. They don’t diversify. They don’t sell stocks. Ever. Some are already in 4th generation, each richer than those before them. And that was during times where you could get between 5-10% for triple a government bonds.

And where do you store the password to your encrypted keys?
Amnesia is a thing. As is death. I kinda like the idea of my family actually being able to access my money if I die in a car wreck.
It’s a risk assessment. The risk of someone breaking into my house and finding that steel plate is damn low, it’s a small steel plate and a large house. Immediate family knows where to look and whom to ask about how to access it(but not how much it is worth).
The risk of me forgetting a secure password, or suffering a accident to the same effect on the other hand are comparatively high.
One has to be realistic about these things. This is no Apple account with 50 movies in it we are potentially loosing access to. It can be potentially millions of dollars and I have forgotten my fair share of secure and unique passwords.

Venezuela doesn’t have a military costing over half a trillion each year. And they didn’t have to worry about knowledge of their intent to sell influencing the global market. Just look at why the gold standard was abolished by Nixon in the first place though. I mean yes, on the surface it’s the French’s fault and they are to blame, as it should be. But with the right stimulus and experts influencing the government(such as facing a ath with expected weakness to follow coinciding with a crash in dollar value **and** being in a costly war) we could see them acting quickly.
I mean is it really more far fetched than abolishing the gold standard from a 1970s POV or outright outlawing private gold trade or possession from a 1930s POV?

Debt free semiconductor companies are also good. People will keep using phones, 5g will still be a thing, competitors will likely suffer enormously due to debt...

I dunno man, the US scares me like no other nation. They are a great ally as long as you do what they want and give them their share. They are also ruthless as shit and not above strong arming you to get their way. Better believe they will threaten withdrawing nato support, technology embargo’s or other shit while giving go ahead signals to your nations enemies.
Pretty sure that battle will be fought within the US, if bitcoin stays legal there it will be legal in Europe, SK, Japan, Australia and co. If it doesn’t we’ll get the Mexican treatment, they have no problem blaming Mexico for drugs in the US, why should crypto be different?

It’s a global trend by now. The reasons are different country by country, but the solution is the same. I’m not 100% sure why that is, maybe it’s enough that both the dollar and euro do it and somehow pull the other currencies with them? 
Point is they find a way to milk you, they have become very creative. Any solution used by many people to escape their measures will quickly get targeted as well.

Not sure wether it’s in effect yet. And yes things would change. You would be a criminal twofold. Firstly because you use a illegal currency, that’s not the bad part. 
The bad part is you pay no taxes on it. Tax crimes usually have no statute of limitations, they can get you 10, 20, 30 years later for it, demanding you pay it back with interest and a  fine. And since it’s a open ledger they can follow the bread crumbs easily, look how they took down Silk Road.
All it needs is a single informant, a single undercover agent you transfer bitcoin too. You can bet your ass there are already three letter agencies that create databases linking people to bitcoin addresses. All it takes is a single information exchange 20 years in the future. Kinda like the stolen Swiss bank data that was bought by German authorities. 
This idea that laws don’t matter comes from people that think they have nothing to loose. If bitcoin becomes successful and moons ... you have a lot to loose. Imagine being a millionaire and you can’t spend your money anywhere but dark alleys.

Contrary to popular belief it’s not your money to withdraw at your leisure. It’s a debt of the bank towards you as a creditor. Ask anyone what happens if someone that has no money owes you money. They are paying joe with jills money.
Fortunately I have solved this problem. We should just put money printers at every bank. Then when a lot of people want to withdraw at the same time they simply give them a coffee and ask them to wait while they print their money.
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:46:22
Yes, but the point is in the near future, namely the next recession, no interest isn’t going to be enough to stabilise things. To fight a recession central banks usually drop base rate by 5 basis points but if your already at zero... you need to go to about -5% interest.
That would start a bank run, either cash to home or into non negative interest digital currencies. That however would mean the base rate cut wouldn’t do anything. Can’t have that. They **clearly and openly** state that they need to drop interest way into the negative rates and prevent people from fleeing into cash. Your supposed to **spend** your money to safe the economy and create growth.

True for India. But it’s likely there will either be a international agreement on it or not. Not like there are many truly sovereign nations, we still have 2-3 power blocks in the world and they will not look idly as people use bitcoin to siphon billions of dollars out of their economies. 
I mean look what they did with cannabis, isn’t it strange it was outlawed pretty much everywhere given that it’s hardly that dangerous? 
World is changing man, doing things your government disapproves off, especially on the internet, is getting harder. Better worry about the kind of people you elect because if you think they can’t do shit to you ... your wrong. Just because the government can’t get your bitcoin doesn’t mean they can’t get **you**.

China is a special case. When we talk about crypto and other things proliferating we assume natural or sociological drivers in a liberal society. Ofc things don’t exists in a sufficiently controlled environment where they are outlawed.
My point was that the desire to use Facebook exists there too, otherwise there would be no point outlawing it even if you where opposed to it ideologically.
I do not attempt to predict laws that may or may not get made. All I’m saying is if your interested in a social network you are more likely to join the one where all your friends and relatives are at. That situation never came up in China as Facebook got banned before it reached that critical mass there.
But it’s all the same, they prolly have their own Facebook similar in all but name that people flock too for the same reason. There could be a similar development with crypto where most of the world use bitcoin and China goes another way. It’s an result of their non-free society.

I think you confuse private and anonymous. I could create a btc address, load it with some btc from an atm and transfer it to another address created by someone else and it would be pretty damn anonymous.
If bitcoin wasn’t anonymous exchanges wouldn’t be required to follow kyc rules for aml. Without you actively giving out your identity and establishing the connection between yourself and some btc it’s pretty damn hard to connect transactions to people. You wouldn’t even know which **continent** a transaction originated on not to mention which person did it.

That’s only useful if there is any connection between the two of us or the person I sent it to. Also fairly simple to use a exchange that doesn’t require kyc for crypto withdrawals. You can trace those btc right back to 12 hops and then ... binance! Yeah, that limits the possible suspects down.

Yeah, we have different things serving different purposes. But something serving the same purpose coming up and replacing something like Facebook? Nah. Even if it was technically better, faster and provided every use Facebook did it wouldn’t work. Because it wouldn’t have a large userbase.
In investing that’s called a moat. It’s why we have google play and apples App Store yet other third party app stores struggle. Without users app developers don’t go there and without apps users don’t use them. Bitcoin is similar, people trust it because so many people trust it. At the end humans are herd animals.

It’s greed. They think they missed buying bitcoin because it’s "high" and want to buy the *new* bitcoin for that sweet 10000x.

I wish I could be as eloquent as that...
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:40:02
That’s true, but if the hash rate rises faster than the technological progress that means your cost per block goes up doesn’t it? Say difficulty doubles because the hashrate doubled, so instead of x hashrate per block you need 2x hashrate per block. But if the hardware only became 20% more efficient... it becomes more expensive to acquire the hashrate for one block making it more expensive to attack the chain.
Maybe that’s what your saying and I’m misunderstanding, it just seems to me that an increase in hashrate above purely technological progress means it’s becoming **relatively** harder to attack. I just assumed the hashrate is growing faster than technological progress alone could explain due to its extend, maybe that’s incorrect?

Not just a number though. High hash power afaik makes it harder to rewrite parts of the blockchain by malicious actors, especially recent blocks.
If you had a POW chain with very low hash power compared to available hash power it would be kinda vulnerable to attacks given a suitable incentive.

People ignore that bitcoin itself can change. I heard someone call these altcoins testbeds for bitcoin, there ideas and new concepts can be tested and played around with, if they work then the changes can be implemented in bitcoin, if they fail horribly no large amounts of value where put at risk.
It’s like saying there will be a new internet or a new Facebook. I don’t think there will be, part of the value of bitcoin is the concentration on bitcoin. Just like people go on Facebook because everyone else is on Facebook. Not everyone uses it of course, but there is no competitor they go to.

You don’t. You either distribute the bitcoin for fiat yourself or exchange it for dollar in a business that’s preferably not subject to the government your protesting against.
Or you can have your donations be stolen from you without recourse. That’ll show them.
Let me break down what went down for you:
1.	Someone wants to donate you something like money in a way that can’t be censored.
2.	You ask that someone to send this censorship resistant money like thing to someone else so he can sent you censorable money instead.
3.	Your transaction of censorable money got censored.
4.	You got nothing.
Shocking idea, how about we skip step 2?

Ah yes, the dunning kruger effect, very good example.
I can clearly see how Chinese factory workers put backdoors into microchips on behest of American intelligence.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:46:12
Good lord what a wall of text. First I didn’t dispute the factual things you said, I disputed the crazy illuminati conspiracy level bullshit you sprouted.
Like that all microchips have backdoors. Really? **All** of them? Even the ones used by government agencies themselves? They put backdoors into their own servers? How does it work out for US chips fabbed in China? Whose backdoors do they include and how do these backdoors manifest in relation to crypto currencies which is **kinda** the topic here.
Also all those links ... that’s common knowledge by now, 90% of it is just the usual 5 eyes watching internet traffic bullshit. Again, what is the relation to crypto specifically bitcoin? All the transactions are already public, all the common **online** ways to acquire btc already employ kyc, all the **offline** ways of transacting cash to btc do not get monitored by these programs.
Don’t take it personal, but to me It’s just the usual conspiracy bullshit enlightenment that adds **nothing** to a discussion. 
There two kind of views in this world, one side despairs over a worldwide connected conspiracy that’s controlling every aspect of their lives. It’s run by super sophisticated secret agencies that can do nearly everything and control nearly everyone. The other side despairs over the gross incompetency that’s rampant in nearly every aspect of our lives that’s managed by governments.
The very links you use as proof for your points, to me that’s proof of this very incompetency. Yes, they do all of the things those links say. **But that doesn’t mean they do it well**. They can’t even stop the PotUS from chatting national security details over WhatsApp on his android phone or directly tweeting raw spysat images.
**Nothing** I see in today’s world hints at any sort of competency of the scale required by what you imply. I mean one of the programs hat a budget of 50m usd ... no government agency can get **anything** useful done on that kind of budget.
And don’t even get me started on the entire snowden affair. Just the fact that **that** guy, in **that** position, had access to **that** kind of data ... aaargh! He even got away with it! To another country! And leaked it all to the press!
No offense to all the brave men and women working to protect our way of live, this **very** much not their fault or any individuals fault. It’s a symptom of incompetent elected officials appointing woefully inadequate individuals to head and administer these agencies and then running a dog and pony show around the actual hard work happening.
Incompetency wherever I look.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:17:40
You assume there is a they. As in a group working together monitoring and connecting all this data. That’s the conspiracy part.
In reality the agency monitoring cellular data is different from the one monitoring the blockchain, which doesn’t talk to the one tracking fiat transactions and the guys putting backdoors into smartphones are not talking to anyone because they are terrified of their zero day exploits getting patched. 
If what you believe was true crime wouldn’t exist. The FBI would know the exact position of every drug dealer, mass shootings that get basically announced on Internet forums wouldn’t happen and laundering money would be impossible for anyone but state actors with extremely sophisticated counter measures. 
Reality is they can’t even reliably trace fiat bank transfer internationally unless it’s a national emergency with the Vice President screaming at them. They are extremely competitive and secretive, and data on the level of even petty crimes is simply not shared between the agencies to be connected. They can find out a lot of shit on you if they tried, but they won’t. There is no dossier of you on some internal Wikipedia of government agencies, you are not actively monitored any more than algae is intentionally pulled out of the ocean by fishermen. 
Also I find it ironic that your post is full of unprovable statements and feelings. Because black budgets exist you can link intelligence agencies to the 21 trillion debt. If that was true they would have fuckall to show for it, the incompetency would be even higher that what i insinuated given how much is going wrong in the US currently both domestic and internationally.

Why do people think more transaction means more value? Gold is used **less** for transacting money than in centuries past yet its value was unaffected by that.
I mean sure, more people wanting to pay with btc more people buy btc. It also means more people are going to **sell** btc though to cover taxes and expenses.
People are too focused about using bitcoin or other crypto’s to pay for stuff. Like another poster said, you can built a payment system on anything, some companies literally pay their employees in stocks. There is atleast on company that lets you process CC payments based on gold in your depot.
I mean it’s neat, saves you one conversion. But you don’t have to built a whole base layer around that. The whole decentralised, PoW, non custodian, non correlating part is what’s important. The buying coffee with it niche-use is adequately covered by layer 2 or 3 solutions.
If there is one fallacy in the crypto community it’s that people don’t believe in trade offs. They think it’s a matter of clever software only to be decentralised, secure and private. It’s a bit like those plane-car-submarines that where popular in the 70s and 80s...

Technically they only blocked **companies** selling you bitcoin for fiat. You can still buy bitcoin on places like localbitcoin.com in p2p. 
You can check for yourself, plenty buyers and sellers using local payment methods like Alipay or bank transfer, kinda unlikely it’s illegal considering those are very non-anonymous payment options.

Kinda reminds me of China, first fucking question there always was "you American"? You one of them China trolls paid to spread bullshit on your nation on the net?

The thing is, the other stuff funds what you want. Electricity for example depends on infrastructure and 5 out of 6 things you need depend on electricity.
If the other stuff fails, the government has a big black hole in its budget. The corporations might not pay much taxes, but the people buying the crap do. Not to mention there are boatloads of taxes on stuff like dividends.
It’s all well and good if you live frugal, but that can’t sustain our way of living. Who says electricity can’t cost 10x what it does now? If we all live frugally, living frugally will become very expensive because many of a nations expenses like law and order, military, infrastructure and social security won’t scale down.
The restaurants being dead is due to stagnation in the wages and exploding costs to run such a business. I’d like to eat out more, I can’t afford it though. 
In other countries it’s different, in Thailand for example the price of food at street vendors in front of the supermarket gets like a 20% surcharge. Many people don’t even have a kitchen and eat out every day. In the developed world a pizza costs like $16 for $3 worth of ingredients due to the external costs like wages, rent, etc.
