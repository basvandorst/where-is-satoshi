I don't go to cinemas anymore since they show only trash.
But when I was a child i always liked to see the ads when they where really good. That's for sure a must, that it's a really good ad.
Google mercedes benz chicken....
Plus the cinema atmosphere is very special because it's dark, a big screen a deep seat and good sound..
But yeah i think the best channel to advertise bitcoin or this specific campain hast to be found. So far it's online.

I emailed them and told that we really need bitcoin :)
They could solve it with a thrird party app...

Yep, that's why Bitcoin is such a great tool to teach money theory
Inflation and the ability to produce it with printing money out of thin air is the real problem. We will overcome it with bitcoin :)
"...In theory, under this system, the total supply of paper currency was limited by the amount of gold stored in vaults. But in practice, the goldsmiths would sometimes create fake receipts, not backed by anything; it’s called “fractional-reserve lending,” and it’s a topic for another time. The important part is this: the monetary system relied on trust placed in goldsmiths. You had to believe that the paper receipts were tied to something concrete — that they weren’t just created out of thin air.
Here’s where it gets really exciting: if bitcoin is held as this sort of meta-currency, one feature cannot be overstated: it is inflation proof. Paper is way more convenient than gold, but it has a catastrophic Achilles’ heel: it can be printed out of thin air. Bitcoin is way more convenient than paper, and we don’t have to worry about its inflation. It merges super portability with super security. Historically speaking, no currency has ever existed with both of these properties."

That's exactly the point. When people understand the power of bitcoin they are willing to go for it. The market will solve the problems sooner or later..
What platform do you use?

Perhaps the market will find a solution to reduce the impact of scams, me thinks.

Good lineup, just grabbed my ticket.

Some call it blockchain island :)
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:28:39
Correct but the data there is not updated.

Why should this be a problem? 
Why should it be a wrong reason to get rich with bitcoin? Why should I care about other's people reasons, can't I let them do their thing?

What exactly do you mean with "types of people"?

The good thing about the crypto world is that it's easy to support or not support a certain group or company. Some invest in Ethereum others think it can be used for control. 
The time is over to complain or demand and the time is right to act and make decisions. There is probably no right and wrong but the perspectice of individuals based on their level of understanding.
