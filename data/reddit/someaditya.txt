Has it been solved ? I am encountering the same error on my Web Wallet

I read around 20+ posts in different forums by different people who are facing the same issue. Password is stored in Google Passwords and it can't change automatically. One or two might forget password but not 20+ people at the same time. All this started after November. Worst is people having 2FA also not able to access Wallet with correct password. This is highly impossible thing.

May be there was a mass hack , but they never acknowledged or may be they did on their own. And the statement they say that they don't store Passwords, they do. They store all your information.
Online wallet is the worst idea, lesson learnt hard way.

I know.. at that point I was Naive. Now I store in wallets. But this Blockchain.info was something un natural.
