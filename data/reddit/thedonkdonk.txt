Not sure about the color scheme but I am not an expert. User name is thedonkdonk.
So, is there a place where it shows my balance?

Provide proof. Source code, in this case, should work. That way I don't have to listen to anyone. I can verify for myself.

The post time on that article is 2013-07-20 23:21:18 UTC.
This works out to about 3 hours *after* this post. Also, it says "A nice show in the ASIC market can be found in one hobbyists custom printed USB ASIC miner".
What it actually looks like is someone saw this post and *then* wrote the blog post. I'm gonna assume OP is not a faggot in this case.

You are thinking they would slowly add more hashing power. If I wanted to actually break bitcoins I would plugin my 500THash *all at once* that way the difficulty would take longer to adjust.

Related, mining is an md5 calculation right? md5 calculation of what? How do I show proof of work?
I'm technical, but bad at Google...

TIL that one Internets is worth $0.25 USD

But the goal of an attacker is not to mine bitcoins. They want to break bitcoins making them worthless in the process.

Looks much better.

Where is the data for that image?

No. It's an ASIC or Application Specific Integrated Circuit.
