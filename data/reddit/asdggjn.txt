good luck fixing bitcoin's problems without forking. It was already attempted once and nobody went for it.

They are literally wasted. All the resources used to build those asics, all the electricity burned through, it's completely wasted. The amount of waste only increases, and you're wasting valuable resources on this hash bruteforcing shit that everyone likes to call a "puzzle" or "mathematical formula", neither of which is true.

I like how you fuckstains actually think people need to be paid to see bitcoin for what it is.
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:51:23
It does have fees. They come in the form of the gap in their buy prices and sell prices. Bitpay also isn't on the blockchain, so until someone actually has to move your or somebody else's bitcoins around, they technically don't incur any fees. UNTIL you actually get into bitcoin.

I don't think you understand that people aren't born on the internet.

Problem is, Bitcoin needs work from the ground up. the changes required woul kill all current mining.

I don't think you guys understand that the bitlicense only applies to things like exchanges and other money moving businesses. It's not even as strict as actual banking regulations. You guys are nutso. "Down with BitLicense! I want to be scammed! I want to lose all my money!" That's you, guys. That's what you're saying.

And how do you know what he does or doesn't understand? You don't. You aren't him. Fuck you.

Actually, It took me a month and a half to log back in to reddit because it's full of dipshits like you who only see what they want to see, and put too much importance in a site that rewards circle jerks.
Fucking pathetic moron.
Also please take note that even among bitcoiners, yours is not the popular opinion.
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:36:06
None of you in this reddit are experts either, so what are you getting at? The only time anyone is considered an expert here is when they say something bitcoin-positive. That's not expertise, that's bias.

What a joke. Wagging your e-penis around as if reddit karma means something. Continue proving that reddit is a worthless circle jerk site, thanks.
Also fuck your karma, what would matter to a sane person is the score of their CURRENT comment, not dick sucking past comments that people upvote not for quality, but because they want to believe the magic.

You people are whiny douchebags. Your only arguments are "you didn't read it" or "you don't understand", when the problem is we do understand, we understand too much. And you're fucking psychos. And stop calling yourselves innovators, you didn't innovate shit. There's a reason the "1%" Is the 1%, and it's not because they're lazy and steal all your money.
I told you exactly what it does, and I fucking told you that it's NOT as strict as banks. You don't even fucking know how banks are regulated! You're too busy telling me how much they're cheating and stealing from you and being evil and corrupt WHEN THE REGULATIONS ARE EXACTLY WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM HAVING THAT HAPPEN. Every fucking time some exchange or payment service gets really big, they take your stupid fucking play money and run! Then they post a message saying 'oh no we got hacked' and then you all believe it, because you love trusting complete strangers over any established, trustworthy, liable source!
Why do you need people like coinbase, bitpay and the rest? If you want to be independant, learn how to fucking be completely self sustaining! As long as you keep trading your shitty bitcoins for real money and vice versa, you're just still on the damn dollar! Idiots.

Oh look, ad hominem from a retard. I'm so fucking owned guys.

Then why aren't you buying them? The price hasn't risen, so obviously you haven't bought all the cheap coins up.

Says someone who doesn't comprehend how to tell something is a joke article.
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:38:40
the massive and ever increasing amount of resources wasted on mining and the halving rewards say otherwise.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:29:21
Unfortunately for you, the slide you photoshopped bitcoins over is not about technology, and the article that contains the photo you changed isn't even remotely related to bitcoins.

You just said it was base camp. As in, not even beginning to climb yet. How is this supposed to impress anyone? People go to mount everest FOR THE CLIMB. People put flags and shit on the mountain BECAUSE OF THE CLIMB. You don't just party up the easy part of the mountain and call it quits before actually getting to the part everyone goes to everest for...
