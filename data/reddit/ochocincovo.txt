Yes they do. Maybe I’m not describing it right in the technical sense but my coins don’t just sit there in limbo. They’ll come back if I don’t bump the fee

do you understand how many times this has been said? You must be new to crypto.

He’s just joking or trolling. Hence the “I got in late and have ONLY 225 coins”
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:52:47
I think he was just talking from his personal perspective because otherwise yeah, Im sure GS is sitting pretty

I’d retweet this if he didn’t monumentally screw up 2014. Twitch? Lmao
Edit: downvote me all you want. No one genuinely cares about twitch. It’s at least a step below every single other thing on that list fad-wise

you just need to "Deposit" USD via the website. its an ACH transfer, you dont need to go to the bank. I dont have access to the website currently at work or else i'd explain better but look for a "deposit" button on the website

Every time you spend some, ya just instantly replace it at that same price! That’s the true essence of Hodling imo
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:31:52
Hmm that's odd. Might have something to do with verifying your identity as you said above. From what I can remember it was just the usual Name/Address/Photo of License, etc.
Hopefully someone else that knows more can help ya out more than I did because I switched over to Gemini from Coinbase/GDAX a few months back and have never looked back!

McDonald’s in Singapore is already partnered with OmiseGo (OMG), a Blockchain payment system in development. I don’t know too much about it and I’m  not invested in OMG but I definitely remember reading up on it. That might provide u with more information on what you’re asking

I’m surprised she’s not a fan. She’s gonna need some other way to launder money now that her CFPB slush fund is getting shut down

Please keep your uninformed nonsensical comments off Also, Glenn Beck is a hack.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:39
Glenn Beck isn’t alt-right. He doesn’t  even lean right.  He leans wherever the money is.

Yeah because the elementary and high school systems nowadays are just so enlightening. Gimme a break.

Didn’t change much!?? I’d probably be dead in a ditch somewhere without GPS.
