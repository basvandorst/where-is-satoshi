I have made a little money using faucets. Doing faucets, for over a year, or, so I have about a half of a bitcoin. Without risking any of my own money. I love risk free money its like finding a nickel everyday it adds up. Now if bitcoin goes to 3000 I make around 1500 with no risk. To the moon!!!

I have right now 350dollars worth of bitcoin because of faucets. It takes a long time. It took me and my wife about 3 year to do this! I looked at this as free money and risk free! It's hard work and you need a system to do it. My wife and I did this together so it made things easier. We still do it today and its starting to pay off.  
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:32:45
I was using a lot of different ones over the years. Some of them were, even fun, like playing games for bitcoins. There are not as many faucets now as there were 3 years ago. I figure how can it hurt picking a few free coins. It's free and just takes a little time each day. Try using the faucet that will give you coins within 5  to 15 minutes. If you see any out there that give you coin right away then do if. its free. If you find a nickel on the ground everyday you would pick it up right! It all adds up. Plus when bitcoin rises its not a nickel any more!
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:12:27
It's not like we were working 24 hours a day! We have set up a system to work as little as possible. We made about 1/4 of a bitcoin doing this. Now when bitcoin some day hits 10.000 or 20.000 that's a nice chunk of change free and clear. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:21:11

Getting rid of debt is good! But don't sell all your bitcoins you will regret it later! 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:59:34
You can never be sure. But that's how the first set of bitcoiners got rich. They held bitcoins for a long time in the beginning. And stuck with it no matter what! It paid off for them in the long run. And it still is today. Bitcoin is going through the government /banker attack right now as I predicted. I thought bitcoin would go down to about 150 or so. The bad exchanges really keep bitcoins from going up. But what it really comes down to is do you trust the bankers or the blockchain.  And I believe as people learn more about bitcoin the blockchain will win out hands down.
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:19:55
You are the one that seems young. I see you have a lot's of negative thoughts about bitcoins, by looking back at your passed comments. You need to find a new hobby!!! If you don't like bitcoins do something else!!!! Have fun trusting those bankers!!!!

Agree! Love how the new world sounds. We as bitcoiners need to make it happen!!
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:19:28
The object of bitcoins is to make money, but also to build it's own economy. Where there are no 3rd parties involved. I do believe the price matters, of course you want the price to be as high as possible. At least I do! If millions of people join bitcoin  by 2017 price will go up and start to stabilize. That does not make it a scheme.  The only scheme I see is government around the world telling us what to do by force. Even more then the Making Money is (I Want control of my money)!!!!!!!!!

I love buying thinks with bitcoins. I don't care if the price goes up after I buy something. I bought a computer not long ago. So now the business I bought it from makes money on it and then some. Then they explain it to someone else, and they like the idea. Then they go buy more bitcoin, which makes my bitcoin go up again!! A the cycle goes on!!
