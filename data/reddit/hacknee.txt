I started using Cubits around a week ago after experimenting with many services for easy buying, storage and management of Bitcoin. I am incredibly impressed with it's features. I say this as someone entirely unaffiliated with the company. I'm based in the UK and would say Cubits beats anything else out there for my needs. Indeed, I'm beginning to see it as my potential future primary bank. It offers :
- good aesthetics and a very well designed site, fabulous design. German engineering, obv :)
- good exchange rates, equivalent if not better than Coinbase, small fee of 0.9%
- multi-denominational cash accounts with many currencies held
- Banking via large Austrian banking group, Raffiessen
- allows free SEPA deposits with reference numbers from Transferwise.com and others (so much cheaper than via UK banks)
- deposits can go directly into cash account for later 'instant' Bitcoin purchases
- withdrawals via SEPA UK banks in GBP for only €0.85
- 2FA via Google Authenticator
- Cold storage
I cannot fault it and highly recommend it to European and particularly UK users.

Cubits isn't primarily for the UK but it works for the UK. Just stepped away from Coinbase as their Euro deposit account was not processing my deposits via Transferwise. Kraken has been the best but it has SEPA charges and transfers in and out must be via the same account.

My mistake, only on withdrawals. The requirement for your name on the deposit means UK customers can't deposit cheaply via transferwise or others unfortunately. Most UK banks charge between £10-20 for a SEPA to Europe, excluding rate conversion. I like Kraken and am still a user, great service.

I agree, the current UK offerings are pathetic.
After a quick and simple AML/KYC sign-up with Cubits.com and Transferwise, I can send Euro transfers with my debit card, taking approximately 24 bank working hours to the cash component of my Cubits account. Low fee and highly competitive rates with Transferwise. I can then monitor Bitcoin price and buy instantly through Cubits when needed. Cubits can exchange to pounds and do another SEPA transfer in GBP to my UK account for 0.85 Euros.
I haven't found anything that beats that.

I don't think Kraken offer SEPA withdrawals in GBP though, only Euros, which means taking a poor UK bank exchange rate back to pounds.
