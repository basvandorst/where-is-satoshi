You don't understand this scenario. If the majority of miners switch back to the 1 mb chain, it doesn't matter what the BU miners do.

Edit: Olivier Janssens deleted his tweets after some minutes. He was probably told that the scenario is possible :)

I would have transferred a small amount to my Trezor, wiped it, restored it and checked that everything was OK before i moved larger funds to it. But I guess that's already to late for you?

I think it would be wise if I could set the fee to 0 if the transaction is bringing my channels in better balance (against 50/50 on both sides) and only charge a fee if the transaction is bringing my channels to imbalance.

Ok. Thanks.

Not if the 1 mb chain coins are valued higher.

Here's the problem. While the miners switch back to earn more, people that has been doing business in the BU chain get all their transactions destroyed. Why would businesses and users risk this?


Is it rational if the economic majority stays on the 1 mb chain?
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:39:46
You expect every user to know and do that?
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:02:50
But they didn't lose 13.2. You agree to that?

I bet she is afraid that you will dump her when a Bitcoin is worth USD 1 million in 5 years time.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:32:27
I guess that is much less than 13.2 BTC. Fake news.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:52:43
I understand how it works. But they didn't spend 13.2 BTC in electricity on that block.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:42:44


I understand that, but they didn't lose 13.2 BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:13:01
But they would probably not be the lucky winner who were allowed to produce the real gold for that period. So it's wrong to say they lost 13.2 BTC. They lost what they used in electricity.
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:03:56
So it's more like fishing. Either way, bitcoin.com wasn't promised payment when they started to work on that block.
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:23:31
Because they used at most ~24 minutes on that block (the time between block 450528 and 450529). If they spent 13.2 BTC / 24 minutes, they spend ~790 BTC every day. That's not sustainable with &lt;10% of the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-01-29 23:45:51
How did they lose 13.2 BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:39:20
But they was never promised payment when they started working. It's more like writing a book. If it don't sell much, have you lost the potensial income of a good selling book or have you lost the time and labor you put into it?
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:14:20
But you also have to take into account other miners using the same software with the bug. If an other pool had discovered the bug, it wouldn't have costed bitcoin.com anything. So it is wrong to say they lost 13.2 BTC either way.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:31:51


Would they? A smaller block would need a different nonce, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:39:46
Sorry, I don't mine. But I wonder how anyone can say that they lost 13.2 BTC when they didn't.
(I have a problem with both sides in the block size debate bringing us fake news.)
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:20:34
But they never had the coins, so they didn't lose anything? Right?
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:17:55
The BU camp knows that time is runing out for them. When Rootstock (and Bitcoin Extended?) comes in June, Bitcoin Unlimited is dead.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:19:50
We are near a solution. Sidechains are coming in June.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:05:23
Sidechains, coming in June, will help.
