Don't buy Apple Pay Cash.
Only buy the original Apple Pay!

In what year can I buy a coke in the grocery store for 10 sats?

Can you recommend a service with the lowest possible fee using a credit card?

Less volatile? How bout a stable coin? ��

If you're comfortable with it, you could also download a wallet app to your smart phone. There's lots to choose from, and the same applies with the seed/phrase.
My favorite is Ethos (ethos.io), but I've used Bread/BRD, IMtoken, Jaxx and bunch more.

No way?! Still going to tip random people?

You're correct. It seems it's a fee of €.99 for €10 of Bitcoin. Thanks.
I'll see if I'm awake by midnight on the big day. Small kids... ����

Yeah, ease of use is important.
I'm just not sure where to buy for just $10, and if it's possible, it'd be best with a low fee.
And it would be a low entry for new comers.
