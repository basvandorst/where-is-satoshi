Fair, I had a Gox account since early 2011 and jumped through all their hoops to get verified up to the 100k level. I arbitraged the exchanges and knew the risks associated with dealing with Gox. I waited 13 weeks for them to give me a USD withdrawal and then moved some funds out of their. Their were so many red flags that I really failed to notice how dangerous they were. Let this be a lesson to recognize the shady from the good exchanges...I have had no issues with btc-e bitstamp campbx and others...

'usual blood donation infrastructure', what does that mean?  The core is all custom code.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:02:21
Right on, yeah I guess I'm playing 'jump to conclusions' as the course of events has just been so shady. I just hope Gox realizes the damage they are doing...if they are serious about making thinks right they should reassure us that the number 1 priority is to get customers their funds.  If they said this I would sleep good tonight knowing that I would get the funds eventually.  I can wait 3 months, hell I'm long bitcoin I'll wait 9 months...just let me know.

Many people's money is tied up at gox...
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:13:05
exactly, what did Gox know and when did they know it? Would any investor come in to bail them out? Seems like an odd business case if they are indeed significantly underwater. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:51:50
Indeed, the signs were all there and I choose to ignore them out of sheer greed...to be frank.  I got caught up selling btc at the higher price at gox and now have paid the price. Let me be a lesson to others, there is no free ride and every investment has risk...truly knowing and understanding that risk is the part I missed and others should focus on.

To provide more context around this...my vision is simple.  What if there is a way we can create a decentralized way for blood donors to connect?  That way we won't have to rely on a centralized blood bank when a disaster creates a run on the blood supply and a deadly blood shortage occurs. 
The currency side is around how do you create a monetary distribution model that gives incentives for adding blood into the pool. So when you pledge to donate blood, you get BloodCoin, which you can spend to request blood when you need it.  
The BloodCoin currency represents the labor (and actual real blood) that it takes for a donor to physically go to a blood donation center and donate.  Just like the United States Dollar represents the “labor and property of it’s participants” BloodCoin represents actual real-world events that have value.
Ask yourself, does it make sense for people to have an anonymous relationship with others in their community with compatible life saving blood? I’d say absolutely yes. These are extremely valuable relationships that we haven’t been able to tap into until now using cryptocurrency principles. Social norms didn’t allow us to ask people within a 10 mile radius to connect that have compatible blood.  We’ve always had a centralized system of giving blood to a bank and having it fail when a crisis happens. 
As far as the currency distribution rate, a person can only donate blood every 44 days, so the ‘block time’ is slow and allows for fair currency distribution open to anyone that can donate blood. 
No asic devices or even an array of basement warming GPUs needed...just connecting real world commodities only available from healthy adults :)

Thanks this is good advice, I'm letting my emotions take over and can't stop crying on my dog. Nothing is set in stone, life goes on and we all benefit from lessons like this in the end. I still have my health.

okay 38 is better then a punch in the face...let's see how this could playout..maybe they put in controls that everyone can only withdraw 10 btc per month until they get paid back...I've already emailed gox telling them I will work for free to solve their problems.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:32:47
Help me understand what is terrible about connecting people with real value to each other in a decentralized way to create efficiencies and scale?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:55:56
This is it, I kept believing in Gox and was overtaken by sheer greed.  How foolish indeed to not see the nuances (lol or rather giant waving red flags) that Gox is just not capable of being trusted.

wise thoughts about the fancier version...so true! Live in the now and enjoy what you have and don't waste time dreaming about what could be. I'll tell you, it been one hell of a ride...and I wouldn't trade it for the world as I learned SO much about everything.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:30:46
Right on, I really thank you for your words...I worked my ass off for those coins and will do it again. This will not stop me and will make me stronger and wiser to rebuild a better business and life!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:45
Thanks yeah just thinking about laying on the psych couch and how this is part of life. Idiot deals with shady company gets taken...pretty standard.

Some very interesting projects there...things are going to get very exciting in the bitcoin 2.0 space!

The invention of Bitcoin technology solved the seemingly impossible Byzantine Generals Problem in computer science and has huge implications beyond just being a currency. Visionaries are building Bitcoin 2.0 to take advantage of a system where consensus is derived in a secured and decentralized public ledger. Exciting ideas around smart contracts that have been around for decades are now possible. Distributed autonomous corporations pose a new way of providing ‘Security by Math’ and thus making current financial relationships inefficient and even irrelevant. History will repeat itself as we will say, “I just replaced your entire industry with 100 lines of Python code”. Like it or not, you can’t un-invent a technology, and solving the Byzantine Generals Problem is creating completely new paradigms for how we can communicate globally. All businesses should learn about “Bitcoin the technology” to understand why so many people are excited about the greatest invention since the internet.

Thanks, this is the mindset of the champion that I want to tap into with this pity party...tomorrow is a new day and beginning for a whole new chapter, I will not let my family down!

@_date: 2014-02-25 22:53:21
That is the hard part, how do you remove emotions from the brain?  My stomach is a constant knot and I'm in shambles...how can I shake this funk?
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:47:15
lol yeh I would imagine that weird al would be about bitcoin...rumor is that takemybitcoins.tv is trying to get him to host!

Settle down, there is still full testing and blood banks involved.  This isn't a needle to needle situation that I know you are thinking of...The concept is to have this safety net so you anonymously contact local and compatible donors to get them to donate to a real registered hospital or blood bank on your behalf.  The blood donors aren't anonymous, obviously they need to be known for screening purposes once they check into a blood center, the relationship between the donor and recipient is though.
