Damn and he just “gifted” two more, when he got them they were top of the line And I was excellent to get in the game, but a good friend of mine said I’d be getting 50-80 bUcks a month... I think it’s two that run 1800 watt power supplies... I think I’m gonna try it out just for the experience... pics incoming

Sorry if this has been posted, I can only use mobile right now and it sucks... is there any thread or tutorial (preferable text but I’ll take anything) image incoming as soon as this Imgur app gets it together

Thanks so much for the this! I can’t stand watching videos online at all, and always appreciate when there are transcripts!

Ha! My brother just installed two or three more 220 lines in the basement... it’s SO HOT in there... we’ve already seriously discussed using them as heaters in the garage for the colonies of feral cats...I’m only worried that the sound of like 6 tiny jet engines would scare them, XD

I like this attitude. He just gave me two more that should give me between 50 and 80 bucks a month. Pics incoming (learning the Imgur app. I’m stupid)—they were top of  he line about 3 years ago. Now the new ones he bought are seriously a couple powers of ten more powerful . Like the guy above said —every hash counts

Yeah even getting this set up just seems like a pain in the ass
