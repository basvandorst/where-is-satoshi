If security conscious, using an offline wallet gives considerably more security than exposing your wallet.dat when in use. If a key logger was used, it could all be compromised.

You think an internet kill switch improves security when creating a paper wallet? It doesn't.
Software can monitor what you are doing and upload information when the internet is next available.
And a kill switch is just ultra nerdy and unneeded, just unplug the modem/router power or unplug Ethernet it hit the airplane mode button.
The best method is a dedicated offline computer. Second best is a live cd boot that I'd never configured to use the internet.

So many coins are available sure to vast premine and limited availability in exchanges puts price up. Market capitalization is number of coins times price. It I'd very misleading with quarkcoin.
How about I create a coin with a trillion coins and only distribute a fraction? The market capitalization well be huge.

they are just making recommendations for the new president. Small dogs have good loyalty. The biggest problem is that they shit everywhere but if we keep them in their office, it should minimize the impact.

This is my understanding. 
A block that is twice the size and solved at twice the difficulty would target 20 minutes to complete on average. It still gives the same rate of increase to the block chain on average.

Your investment strategy does sound like luck is a major factor.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:45:49
I agree. Running a business cannot rely on a currency that can lose 50% value overnight. Businesses will want to cash in to dollars immediately unless they want to gamble a percentage to hold. Bitcoin comes with significant risk that will command a premium unless the business is bitcoin oriented and focused in choosing bitcoin business.
Making companies go broke and unable to pay employees if bitcoin becomes blocked in some company is disastrous for example.

It sounds like shares, not a ponzi scheme. No returns are promised. People pay the price based on supply and demand.there is no investment capital that runs out so only the early investors make money. 
People just don't like paying more than other people. They don't like missing the boat. They don't realize how few people get on the next boat compared to the one after it.

That is such a seriously bad issue to have with software. there should have been many warnings all over it if it is going to do something crazy with the fees.as a software engineer,I see it as negligent to write software that doesn't give big warnings to making a fee vastly larger than the transaction and larger than what is considered a norm and also have at least a couple of confirmations needed from the user before continuing.
