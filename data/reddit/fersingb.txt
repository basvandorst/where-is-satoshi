The **private** keyword is supposed to prevent the "verify"-like message, right?

For some reasons the proxy settings don't seem to work. I've to enable transparent proxying in Orbot to make Mycelium use Tor.
@_date: 2014-10-01 23:28:57
It shows "enabled" but Mycelium is not actually using tor
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:06:37
I was checking changetip.com for the **private** keyword but I couldn't find anything. Is it me or that keyword is not documented?

Please don't force people to use tor. You can make it the default if your want but give the users the option to disable it.

No, I think we'll have to wait for Circle to accept canadian chequing accounts

It looks like it's not using tor. I'm experiencing the exact same issue. When something is using tor, you should see some arrows in the orbot notification icon, which is not the case when you refresh the rate or the transactions.
If you're phone is rooted, enable the orbot transparent proxying for Mycelium, you'll see the difference.

I'm having the same issue, the form doesn't like my canadian routing  and I don't want to use the Credit Card since I'll have to pay interest on cash advances...
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:02:25
Wouldn't the input be the full 4btc with 1btc sent to a change address? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:01:02
For now, the only thing that seems to work is the Credit Card.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:18:29
True, cards with chip have been present in Europe (at least France), since the 80s. The first time I saw a debit card without chip was when I moved to Canada in 2007.
In 2011 my canadian bank sent me a debit card with a chip, telling me it was a "new" technology, I almost laughed while reading the letter.

Since it's not documented it might also be an urban legend...

It is open source, but not free software.

They have been accepting bitcoin for years, nothing new
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:45:21
I bought a keyboard years ago on Newegg.ca with btc

Let's hope the "out" will win.

Actually, there are some exceptions:


Developers offering virtual goods or currencies within a game downloaded from Google Play must use Google Play's in-app billing service as the method of payment.
Developers offering additional content, services or functionality within another category of app downloaded from Google Play must use Google Play's in-app billing service as the method of payment, except:


* **where payment is for digital content or goods that may be consumed outside of the app itself** (e.g., buying songs that can be played on other music players).
The last one might apply to BTC...

A solution would be to change the license from MS-RSL to something that is free software friendly and submit the app to F-Droid

Before trying VoS I'd like to get more information about that company. The post here is not very reassuring: 
In short, the address provided doesn't seem to match anything and the guy couldn't find any incorporation information.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:38:19
Agreed, but at least it would be a move to the right direction, IMHO
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:30:59
That's cool! I hope more shops will start accepting BTC in Montreal.
I also contacted the Canadian Red Cross to ask them if they planned to accept BTC. I'm waiting for their answer.

According to this [post]( you won't have to back up your wallet again. 
Mycelium sends the change to the address that contributes to the highest total input.

Apple is also less present in Europe.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:23:31
That's for the US only. The worldwide market shares are quite different:

And Google already allows the devs to use their own billing system in some cases:
