What is the point of escrow then? If both parties are trusted and can agree, no escrow is needed. Money are paid from an escrow upon fulfilment of conditions defined in an agreement signed on it's conception.
You don't need a separate lawyer and he would also be useless, because only one party manages the escrow; what you could do you could have three lawyers, or any other odd amount of lawyers (damn you must have lot of Bitcoin spending all this money on lawyers :-) ). Even number of lawyers would not help you.
If you're afraid the lawyer screws you over, they have insurance for this case.

That is impossible; only credit institutions which manage client deposits are able to participate in [deposit-guarantee schemes under directive 2009/14/EC]( however the bank that bitcoin.de uses to hold clients fiat deposits are a mandatory members of such scheme, which means that all fiat deposits are insurred up to 100k EUR. However that does not apply for a situation when the exchange is hacked and funds (even fiat) are transferred from the bank account to e.q. foreign country (like Nigeria) using SWIFT.

Ethereum has the same in not greater liquidity.


Ethereum has greater decentralization.


There has been attacks on Ethereum and except for Crypto Kittie attack I don't think any did anything to the network.


Thats a business quality, besides Ethereum is accepted almost everywhere where Bitcoin and there are places which accept Ethereum, but not Bitcoin; so let's call it a tie.


Not a technical quality; also being branded as "the network where transaction costs 30 USD" is not a benefit at all.


Legacy is a bad thing in terms of tech.

@_date: 2018-01-23 11:13:57
Well, I am not going to outright say that's impossible, however I am going to mention that during my 9 years of providing governance, risk management and compliance professional services for hundreds of large businesses I have came across only one  such client who voluntarily subjected themselves to unnecessary governmental regulation; one of TOP10 BigPharma, "suprisingly" at least other 4 TOP10 BigPharma companies who I also consulted for were not as "paranoid".
Also the document I have linked (it sucks it's in Czech and not English) explicitly mentions - "trading with Bitcoin does not require license from CNB (and CNB cannot issue such) and does not fall under CNB supervision".
In addition; it is also not how government (financial) regulation / supervision works; even if you were to provide payment services for your clients (transfer FIAT between accounts) the bank would only mandate you to audit your fiat related bank accounts and accounting accounts; they would not demand you to audit e.q. cryptocurrency wallets and report their balances.
Truth be told, under EU regulatory framework in order to subject crypto-currency to government regulation, all other forms of virtual currency (e.q. online games virtual money) would become subject for the same government regulation; that could easily meant end of the pay-for-win gaming industry (which might not be a bad thing :D ).

Could not agree more, I'd say you become a whale at 1k+ BTC; which is still just 0,1% of the (daily) market (so let's call these a dolphins); but 10 dolphins make one whale :-)


HODLing (not only crypto) currency is a zero-sum game also; crypto-currency does not create any value (it's not a company stock which generate value by making goods, providing services - thus paying dividends), in order for you to buy at your entry price someone needs to sell at that price; in order for you to sell in a future someone needs to buy at that price = zero-sum; ok PoS coins with staking support could be considered non-zero-sum... :-)


Volatility increases both your losses and gains; if you day-trade on FOREX you often increase leverage to achieve the same level of volatility as crypto has. But yes, more fundamental data is reflected in FOREX markets than crypto markets, so in a sense they may be more predictable - at least you know that day central bank is going to hold meeting and review interest rates,...


Day-trading (without access to insider-information) any asset-class including e.q. real estate (if there would be a market for that) would be a gambling.


Poker isn't a gambling, poker is about social skills; don't play the odds, play the men - applies only to face-to-face poker games; does not work for online games :).

If you define capacity as a metric of amount of transactions per seconds you can achieve, then the limiting factor will be your database ability to process those transactions.


Bandwidth (aka capacity) is "amount of something" per "unit of time", if you have normal care which has certain size (not an infinitely small mathematical model), than you can fit on a highway is determined by an average cars size and the size of the road (length and amount of lanes).


Well and that's where you're wrong, because while Visa has one accounting ledger for each of three continents where they have a datacenter (and thus even now breaking your assumption of centralization as this is already a decentralized solution), Lightning Network uses for each channel one ledger, so it does not have to maintain strong consistency; only blockchain is used to maintain strong consistency in LN.

No it does not; you could do the same with Bitcoin... Let's say you want to punish hackers who stole money from Mt. Gox and you know the TX outputs used in that hack, you write a piece of code that looks at a blockchain on flags all the TX outputs that has ever conducted any transaction with the TX outputs from Mt. Gox hack; you just achieved the same result. As long as you convince other users in Bitcoin ecosystem to not conduct transactions with those flagged TX outputs, people who stole Mt. Gox coins are screwed - and all those other people who chose to conduct business with those flagged TX outputs because those have contaminated TX outputs; but you could also unflag those if they chose to return the amount of contaminated coins in their TX output to an address of your choice...
Think of it as a ultimate blockchain based anti money-laundering mechanism; as long as enough users choose or are forced to participate all the thieves will be screwed. Any blockchain technology that has public ledger is susceptible to this.

The network bandwidth within IP network (aka Internet) is totally irrelevant metric, because your ability to transfer transactions on current internet infrastructure is never going to hit limits determined by that; LN network packets are minimal in size.
Simply imagine three citties; in one scenario you have one highways from A to B and B to C (aka centralized scenario - B being the HUB location; HUB and SPOKE topology), then you have A to B, B to C, and C do A highways (aka RING topology) in which scenario can more card travel from city A to city C? It may take longer for some in second scenario, but there will be capacity for more cars to travel at any given time - and thats what network capacity (aka bandwidth) is... And in payment such as lightning it does not make a big difference if transaction time is 5s or 25s... Network latency increasing the transaction time does not play a large role, because that is milliseconds...

Transactions stealing those funds are recorded on BTC blockchain. No, the ETH chain was not hacked, one contract on ETH blockchain was hacked, but the amount of assets hacked have been large enough to motivate some people to lobby other people to make something stupid and that's that; same thing could happen with Bitcoin blockchain if 50+% of people can elect a despotic president, then 50+% of people can fork a blockchain regardless of your opinion about it; and you can keep using the old one, or move on to the new one where statistically 50+% of your business partners are going to be.

You got free BCH on all your wallets that had BTC at a time of a fork... See here on [how to claim more of your free money]( I say SODL 50% and HODL the remaining 50%.
Hard forks work the way, that everyone who holds some amount in a wallet on the old blockchain will own the same amount on the new blockchain; you can think of it as a stock split when every owner of a stock gets two stocks on a day of the split... however on a stock market it usually works that way that the price of the stock will drop by 50% so you endup with double the stocks but same monetary valuation.

Coinbase has free withdraws on GDAX. You can think of it as airlines, the ticket for your flight is going to cost you same money regardless of how the plane is utilized; I even flew once with only three other passengers on board of a plane that has capacity for over 180 people. But I still paid the same 200 EUR for the ticket.

E.q. Facebook is up 365% since it's IPO, that's 5,36% monthly growth... Bitcoin is different in a sense that it's much more volatile and that it's easy to get in with even a little money... Bitcoin (ICOs in general) should be compared to pre-IPO stock deals... As it's what it is... an early stage technology venture investment... Look how early investors in Facebook / Google / Amazon benefited from their investments.

Well actually the hashpower continues to raise because lot of FOMO miners started to plan their mining operations in December last year, ordered the equipment and there is a lead time between order and delivery.
What you're saying would make bitcoin mining the only industry with low barrier to entry that does not get it's profitability leveraged which is obviously and economic nonsense. And since its called mining I'd recommend you look at how long the coal mines continue their operations even after the price of coal drops below costs of mining. The market does not react to change immediately.

Exactly, I have no problem with people at Coinbase "insider trading" as it was no Insider trading; it was announced publicly on Coinbase  website that they will release the Bitcoin Cash to the holders (I even got an e-mail about it from them) and the announcement also mentioned that they will consider to put it up as a listed currency.

It has nothing to do with transaction verification; in order for the network to work, there must be mining, mining is currently rewarded by new bitcoins; if you can get 12.5 BTC worth a total of 3M USD, people are going to spend nearly that amount of money to get it.

Do you even realize that there was also a possibility for most people to sell their BCH for BTC or you completely disregard that? People who engage in BCH trade had no inside information as they had no information about what will the HODL'ers do with their BCH.
If you run a publicly traded company and say two days before quarter end that "profits are on par with our predictions from last quarter"; you're not engaging in providing inside information, that would only happen if you say we are below or above expectations as that would change people behaviour towards your company stock.

Actually, amount of power consumed grows with the hashing power and hashing power grows with price - at fixed reward per block the amount of hashing power will grow as long as there is an upside between cost of production and the market rate for BTC =&gt; there is some [5 tr.

USD if you include broad money =&gt; at this capitalization, price for 1 BTC would be approx. 239k USD or 3.8M USD =&gt; at minimum 40x the current rate =&gt; power consumption of Bitcoin network if it would replace fiat money would be at minimum 40x the current power consumption.

The problem is that in order for this to work, you'd need both parties to commit same value in the beginning, significantly increasing the cost of doing business. If you were to sell something worth 1 BTC not only you'd have to ship the item to the buyer after he sends the money to the smart contract, but also deposit 1 BTC to the smart contract. Worst case scenario, the buyer has the item, he paid 1 BTC, but he also didn't release his payment, thus while he paid 1 BTC for the item that cost's 1 BTC, he also made you loose the item and 1 BTC deposit; thus doubling your downside.

Difficulty is direct representation of hashrate, if difficulty is decreasing, the hash power is decreasing, thus making the 51% attack more likely.

Well, in that case... I've got thru your article, and it does nothing regarding how your node connects, it just makes your node available as hidden service... You [should follow this one](

Do I need to say more? How many people have been selling bitcoin for fiat in the last year? Given the price development, I'd say quite a lot...
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:25:45
Really? How?
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:02:36
Communism and socialism is about the distribution of wealth, what you're talking about is direct democracy and you don't need a blockchain for it, yet you have much greater problems to worry about. You think a layman who is not a full time legislator has the ability to read, understand and decide on everything that's being governed by law in a country?
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:20:28
The fact that it was planned on a social media means nothing to the exchanges and rightfully so, in order to improve security, exchanges hold the tokens offline, if people want to participate in a stress testing, they must withdraw their coins over a long period of time, not at a last minute. If exchanges would move the funds online in expectation of large withdrawals it would only make them a bigger target for an attack.

The amount of issued stocks have not changes, so yeah, immutable; it's the market price what changed, not the amount of stocks in circulation.

In a same way every buyer needs to find a seller. Given the market price declined significantly, bitcoin market has a shallow market depth.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:21:08
Supply of stocks is also limited, and yet Enron went belly up, as did many other companies.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:48:58


Another amateur economist? Price is a function of supply and demand, fixed monetary policy puts cap on supply, but does not affect demand in any way.

Both sharp declines and sharp inclines indicate the same thing, shallow market depth and inefficient market.

And BTC payment would be without a fee? 
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:14:48
No, you're not, we could always trade real world assets for those virtual coins of yours if we wanted to. I mean, it's nice to have a Bitcoin, but when SHTF you can't eat it.

Daily volume today is $5bn, would you like to reconsider?
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:16:48
Again, you're talking about a limited supply side, but what makes you confident that the demand will raise?
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:05:06


But is's not paying more for a same thing, it's paying more for service with expanded scope. Government that pays for kids school lunches needs to collect more in tax revenue than the one that does not.

I am not talking about the government (the institution), but governance (the reason why government exist).

Selling all assets and burning the cash would make it possible as well.

Because the is no incentive in running an open node.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:19:21


Yeah, that would be great, value of bitcoin mooning, but no food at a table as the economy collapse due to move of all wealth into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:42:52
If all wealth were to move to bitcoin, all nocoiners who own stores and farms would sell those assets for bitcoin, that's how wealth moves around.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:50:34

He has same stand he has towards gold and bitcoin towards USD, he considers them nonproductive assets and tries to avoid them, he only HODLs fiat to buy another stock or another company. Holding the funds in anything other than cash and cash equivalents would introduce unnecessary liquidity or volatility risks.
