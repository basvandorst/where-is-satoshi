So you are 16. Bravo then. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:00:15
I'm using Linux version. Am I safe?
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:02:53
Ok, I'll update as soon as posible. As I have a strong pasword and I dont usually browse with that pc, I'm not very worried. Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:57:10
What about LTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:46:15
Electrum, not web wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:32:13
You are not 16. Good click bait though.

@_date: 2017-12-23 21:22:36
I'm sick of this threads. We are not wooo-girls.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:13:37
Because if you support BTC you cannot support anyone attacking it. It means treason.
And this is real.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:38:19
Where can I compare the fees non segwit against segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:48
I just did it.it cost me 5% of my BTC holdings but I'm supporting this. My address is still not visible in the explorer....but it's showing fine on Electrum. What should I do?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:08:58
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:14:54
I'm going to be downvoted for the BCH holders, I'm aware of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:16:25
Thanks you are on my side! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:17:05
You can commit treason to different things.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:22:04
Hi! I have a question, I set up a segwit address with Electrum, so I may have problems sending funds from exchangues,but in the future my address is perfectly fine,isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:57:00
Because I had such a low amount of BTC, and I had it in a non segwit address. So I paid fees.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:18:26
But you did explain things like they really are. BCH is attempting to kill the sovereign of BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:19:54
I'd like to make one. Can you send me a tutorial?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:37:29
I followed your advice and I'm on segwit now. It was also my first tx from Electrum. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:43:28
I say yes.
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:54:16
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:52:07
Move it. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:07:50
Yeah, why?
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:57:55
W H E R E  T H E   F U C K   A R E    Y O U ? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:39:59
The hackers steal nothing. Am I right? 
@_date: 2018-11-10 23:50:12
I just own 0.xx BTC. If I had more I could make groups in my country, encourage my friends to use it and speak about it.
I think people who owns hundred of BITCOIN should finance TV ads, and stuff like that.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:45:50
Not me.
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:29:33
Spain, immediate bank transfer costs 1$. Fixed time 21s (even between different banks). You can't lose money, you can't get robbed.
BTC,still expensive. And still slow.
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:27:27
I got you. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:56:48
Ok got it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:59:31
My goal is 0 within 2018. I own 0
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:04:00
I hold because I'm the worst trader in history. I caused all dips.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:27:48
For free?
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:37:28
You did right. I don't really need Bitcoin. Better to give to someone who needs it. Well done.
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:26:57
Oh fuck this will make market crash so we can remember this guy in 6 months.
Just kidding,I hope you get your dreams.enjoy it!

For people like it should go back to those prices again. 
Never give up 
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:03:36
