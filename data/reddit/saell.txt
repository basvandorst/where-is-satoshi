Should've waited for the crash, tbh.

Wait for the crash then DCA.

I completely agree with you. Unsure whether he was a HODLer or daytrader.

Look under your bed.

Sorry, but I'm still a little bit confused. Just transferring the money to my Coinbase wallet requires no fees instead of buying BTC instantly? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:00:38
I see, thanks. So you just HODL? Are you not active onGDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:11:47
I want to buy portions.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:19:23
Everything's clear now. Thanks for your help.

Wait, so I actually can't buy bitcoin portions on coinbase.com if I'm not from the USA?  &lt;- this says otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:10:54
Now I understand. Option 2 it is. But why should I transfer €5 first to verify my account?
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:35:08
3% of €1000 is still €30... I don't know if it's worth imo. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:05:53
I'm not from the USA.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:46:59
The only downside to this is that it doesn't store my BTC instantly? What about transferring my BTC from Coinbase to GDAX and vice versa? Can I do that instantly and without fees?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:20:42
So delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:41:49
Option 2 has no fees? Yes, I have a few days to spare. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:53:01
Is 30% now, 25% before fork and 45% lowest point after fork most effective? If not, what do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:50:38
What about the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:34:27
That's not a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:32:42
Desperate, I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:34:13
Dutch? I'm waiting for it to drop some more and then I'll enter.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:34:45
Good advice, thank you.
