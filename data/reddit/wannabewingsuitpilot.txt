@_date: 2016-08-27 18:21:45
It may seem that way at first. But that's actually not the case. If the difficulty continues to rise at its historical average pace, a given piece of mining equipment will earn less and less each month. For most older equipment -- even if they could run forever and even if they had free electricity -- they would never pay off their initial purchase price.

omg. That's not good.
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:48:51
If that does end up happening it will have to be by way of a service like shapeshift.io. The OB trading protocol doesn't just use Bitcoin for payments. It also uses the Bitcoin blockchain to store certain commitments in order to prevent certain kinds of ratings fraud. So the escrowed funds will almost certainly always be in bitcoin (as that is cooked in at a low level of the OB trading protocol).
However, by way of services like shapeshift.io, payments into and out of escrow can be done with alt coins. It wouldn't surprise me at all if shapeshift integration eventually made its way into the core OB client.
@_date: 2016-04-16 06:09:21
That's not how development works these days. First you push out a minimal viable product (which is where OB is now) and then you add features. They are doing things as per industry standard.
@_date: 2016-04-16 06:06:26
The two key significant differences between OB and taaki's hopes for DarkMarket are:
(1) OB is incompatible with tor by design and
(2) OB openly claims to NOT be for illicit goods (which runs counter to taaki's anarchist intentions for DarkMarket)
Otherwise their technical approach (including hosting your own store) came directly from taaki's original DarkMarket code.
The world still needs a decentralized AND anonymous (at the network level) marketplace. OB doesn't fill that need.
But OB is still a game changer. It really *does* remove the middle man, and that really *does* reduce costs in a big way. You have to give credit where credit's due.

I looked into these folks before. They're a private blockchain company that is trying to be the "Ethereum" of private blockchains.

smaller than the competing alternatives at the time.
In the present case, most merchants in my area are charged $0.30 + 3% every time I use Visa or Mastercard -- and naturally those costs get passed on to me.
So for the time being, as long as bitcoin fees are less than $0.30, I won't give it a second thought. 
And most of the time my btc fees come out to about $0.04. So I'm not concerned.

Actually, this kind of time stamping isn't useful for proof of prediction. The reason is that only the hash of the prediction is time stamped. So an attacker can time stamp two opposing predictions (say, "Hillary will win the election", and "Hillary will lose the election"). After the election the attacker reveals only the plaintext for the correct outcome, showing everyone that she timestamped it and thus "called it".
This is fixable, but requires a touch more than timestamped hashes.
Tl;dr: never trust someone who claims to have made an accurate prediction when the only proof they've shown you is a timestamped prediction.

In OB the user Wil be able to specify whether or not she wants her IP associated with a given trade. There will be many 'modes of operation' of OB trades... Ranging from fully verified meatspace identity type trades, to pseudonymous type trades, to anonymous trades... Even trades in which the vendor and buyer don't know who each other are at all (not even their network IDs). The users will have some pretty incredible control over their information privacy wise. We're just ironing out the last of the protocol details now and will implement the new trade flows soon.
EDIT: what would be cool, though, is a competitor version that operated exclusively over Tor. Such a competitor could scoop up the DNM market pretty quickly...especially since OB has no interest in (directly and intentionally) serving that market... And then the DNM community wouldn't keep looking to OB to fill that role. Hint hint.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:33:26
Oh, hey, cool!
Good to know it's not affecting others. I'll DM you and see if we can figure out what's happening.
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:51:31
I spend most working hours of my day following OB and contributing where I can. I read everything in the OB slack. I've never seen anything but devs trying to avoid censorship. In fact, doing everything they can to make censorship *impossible* in OB.
Importantly, the code is very modular. It would be relatively easy to modify the networking layer to operate over Tor -- although, from what I can tell, that won't even be necessary.  Brian has made it very clear that they aren't going to do anything to prevent Tor access.
They don't seem realize it yet, but accessing from Tor will be very easy once things get up and running, and it won't require forking the code. Very simple solution to it.
In fact, when you see some of the privacy capabilities being worked on right now, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. There are methods of private/secret (and yet still verifiable) trade that are, quite literally, not even *possible* in a centralized forum.
You have to understand... these guys are working on this thing under their real life identities... very publicly. They have funding. They need to distance themselves from the DNM image as much as possible. They'll NEVER say publicly "yeah, this going to be an unstoppable DNM".
But make no mistake, this thing *is* going to be used (by a subset of the userbase) as a decentralized DNM. And there is nothing anybody anywhere can do about it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:35:56
This is a good point. Although (from your link):"...Top of the authenticated data structure is generally published in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media like printed newspaper..."
So it did rely upon a trusted third party, who could unilaterally decide to censor 'blocks' if it so chose. So linked timestamping was resistant to forgery, but susceptible to censorship.

You are right. I went looking and realized that those convos are happening in a private chat (we sometimes need a place to discuss things with a high signal to noise ratio). Public docs are being drawn up and will be public as soon as they are polished a bit more. Sorry to have sent you on a wild goose chase.
But to give a preview, users will have many privacy options (from fully verified meatspace IDs by third parties, to pseudonymous, to anonymous.... Even an anonymous option where nobody - not even the vendor or moderator - know the buyer's network ID).
We're also working out blackmail-resistant data blinding protocols that will prevent malicious vendors and moderators from blackmailing buyer's by threatening to reveal their personal info.
It's exciting stuff... And many of these privacy options have never been seen before, even on centralized DNMs.

Right. Tor nodes connecting directly to other Tor nodes would require every node to be a tor hidden service -- and then also somehow have all those tor hidden services be searchable in a peer to peer way.
Moreover, that would cause the OB network on tor to be disjoint from the OB network on the clearnet. That's not desirable. So we can't have OB tor nodes communicating directly to one another *at the networking layer*.
But they can communicate via rendezvous points in the clearnet.

Right, and even then the point inflation is monotone decreasing. It's like this: The block reward is monotone non-increasing, and the total number of bitcoins in existence is monotone increasing, ergo the point inflation is monotone decreasing.

The file is hashed, and then the hash of the file is stored in the blockchain. That's all the timestamp is.
Then later, I can verify that your timestamp is correct by hashing your file and searching the blockchain for that hash. If I find it, in say, block X, then I know the file was created no later than block X was discovered.

Rendezvous points won't know they are being used for illicit activities, and the illicit trades will be indistinguishable from legitimate asynchronous anonymous trading in the network.
The trading data on the rend. points will be indistinguishable from random to everyone but the vendor and buyer (and ...in the event of a dispute... The moderator).
The rendezvous points are just nodes in the network doing their job - holding info stored in their section of the DHT - with no way of knowing what the data is... Nor anyway of distinguishing or censoring illicit trade data from legal trade data.

Will a pile of money be sold for more than the pile of money is worth?  Instant reaction is "no", but it's a little more subtle than that.
The key here is that anybody wanting to buy 30000 btc has only 3 ways to do it: buy the SR coins from the fed, buy them on the open market, or invest in mining equipment and mine them.
Naturally they will choose whichever is cheapest for them.
Everybody knows that (unless you have near-free electricity and cooling capability) mining is not currently profitable (unless you have customers who are buying your mining equipment for you on preorder).
Buying 30,000 coins on the open market would cause a price increase *as they were buying the coins*.  How much of a price increase I don't know (because I don't care enough to calculate it), but it could be estimated by looking at the prices/volumes of the current sell orders on the various markets.  Not hard to do... Very basic stuff... And I'm sure many have already done this.
So each bidder is simply going to estimate X (how much it would cost them to mine 30000 btc, adjusted to reflect how long it would take them to mine the coins and the time value of their money), And Y (how much it would cost them to acquire 30000 coins on the open market, adjusting to accommodate the price increase caused by their purchases).
Then (depending on the style of the auction) they will max bid min{X, Y}.
Note that Y is certainly greater than the current market price.
And (unless the bidder is a big ASIC manufacturer that pays for it's rigs via customer preorders, and also has access to near-free electricity and cooling) X will also be greater than the current market value.
Ergo, either the coins will sell for more than the current market price, OR all of the bidders are colluding (which is unlikely... But certainly possible since the Marshals leaked the list of bidders).

It hold your priv-keys on an extremely secure piece of hardware. So multibit (or whatever wallet you use) doesn't even know your priv-keys... so even if your computer were compromised nobody can steal your keys.
Then when you use multibit (or whatever wallet you use) to send funds, your wallet will be like "hey, I need to sign this transaction, but I don't have the priv-keys..." and it will prompt you to plug in your trezor.
When you plug in your trezor, it displays the proposed transaction on the little trezor screen and asks you if that's what you really want to do. If it is, you click "yes" on the trezor and it signs the transaction and hands the signed transaction back to your wallet and then all is merry and bright.
Note that your computer never sees the priv-keys on the trezor. That's why it's so secure that you can even use the trezor safely on a totally compromised computer (even one that you found at a bustop outside of a Defcon convention).
The trezor is also protected by a pin number, so if someone steals it from you they'd have to brute-force the pin to get at your coins. And the trezor makes you wait 1 second after your first failed pin entry, two seconds after the second failed entry, 4 seconds after the third failed entry, 8 seconds after the next one, then 16 then 32, etc... (it grows exponentially with each failed attempt, so brute forcing is not feasible).
You also get a backup seed which you can write down, put in a jar, and bury in the desert while you are at Burning Man, so that if your trezor is ever lost or stolen you can recover it by digging up the seed and putting it in another trezor (or other deterministic wallet).
It's like a secure paper wallet without all the suck.

Be very, very careful when dealing with systems that try to remove third party arbitration.
The "both buyer and seller put up 5%" ideas (and several of its variants) are not incentive-stable (or "game-theoretically stable", if you will).
Open Bazaar's model handles arbitration correctly.  BitXbay should copy their model.  The one bitxbay proposes is going to open both buyers and sellers up to coercion (unless they can tie it together with a very sophisticated reputation system that prevents sellers from falsely propping up their own reputation)

This is false.  With &gt; 50% of the hashing power they can theoretically double spend from as deep in the blockchain as they desire (though it will take longer to achieve such a double spend the further they go back into the chain).
All they have to do start mining their own branch of the blockchain from the block in which the double spend occurred.  Since they have &gt; 50% of the hashing power, their branch will eventually become longer than the "real" branch.... At which point their branch will be accepted by the entire network.

I could be wrong, but... I don't think percentages work like that.
Say you start at 100%.
If you lose 50% one week and then gain 50% the next week, your cumulative total is not 100%.
To put it another way, it takes a 100% gain in order to break even after a 50% loss.
But what do I know.

"Highly volitile" is a relative phrase.  BTC price volitility is on par with what Argentinians experience already... but at least BTC has its ups and downs. The peso is all downs. There are people in Argentina that will buy new cars as a store of value (knowing they will lose 30% of their value as soon as they drive it off the lot). Think about that. That would be *insane* behavior in the states, but it's perfectly rational in Argentina. That's how bad their currency is being debased.
Moreover, black markets for alternative currencies (ie USD) are booming. Everybody is dumping pesos as fast as they can.  They get USDs (illegally), gold, silver, etc. The legality of BTC is not as relevent as you might think. And BTC is even harder to confiscate than gold (presuming you know what you are doing).

I suggest TAILS OS, as it is designed to "forget" everything that happened while you used it (even securely wipes memory when shutting down).
You can also use any live distro intended for forensic purposes (ie: Kali linux used in 'forensic mode'), as they tend to be very good at not touching any system resources (such as your HDD) unless you explicitly tell them to.

No additional limits are imposed by BIP38. Consider the following:
ShA256(masterkey||counter). If 'masterkey' stays the same, then 'counter' can be incremented from 0, 1, 2, 3, ... etc.  Every time you change 'counter' the SHA256 hash will give you something new and unpredictable. The hash can be used as the basis for a private key, and the corresponding public key can be computed.
This isn't exactly how BIP38 works, but the principle is similar.
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:53:03
I've been following this for months. I'm a very paranoid person. I (for real) keep offline-generated BIP38 "paper" wallets (actually etched in metal, but that's besides the point) buried in the ground in the forest outside of my town. I leave my cellphone at home when I go to the burial sites so my cellphone company has no record of me being in the area. 
I use a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated hardware-encrypted thumbdrive, with an encrypted linux partition (on which I have a TrueCrypt container) to store my wallet. I only plug said thumbdrive into a dedicated device (laptop) which doesn't even have a HDD.  I'm so paranoid that I actually flashed the BIOS on said laptop with openBIOS. I run Tails OS to access my secure thumbdrive, and I carry the thumbdrive with me around my neck all day (yes I even sleep with it). I'm basically a paranoid nutcase when it comes to my data -- especially my cryptocurrency.  
I just ordered a Trezor and I'll be storing most of my funds on this device. I hope that gives you an idea of how secure this is. These guys really know what they are doing and have addressed every concern I could imagine.

The more you know about the history of money and how it's created, the easier it is to sell you on the idea of bitcoin.

GPG is good for communication, but it's not ideal for disk encryption.  The reason is that, with GPG you need to decide where to keep your private key.  Obviously you don't want to keep the private key on your HDD, because if your HDD were safe then there would be no point encrypting the data anyway.  I'm not saying it won't work... I'm just saying GPG isn't a natural solution for disk encryption.

It seems like the real story here is that some implementations of RSA aren't checking the factors to make sure they are of the appropriate size. For example, the factorization they mention in the article has 3 as one of the factors. That's insane.
No complexity improvements have been made in the factoring algorithm, and no composite number consisting of two LARGE primes has been factored.
the next step for them is to discover what software generated these public keys. If it's well known software, then they've stumbled upon something big. But if the weak keys were produced by shitty software, then there is nothing new here.

- find all addresses with exactly X bitcoins (where X is a value I determine)
- given an input address, list all addresses that have paid to that address
- output the ip address associated with a given transaction
This would be a good start.  And if we could do it with Python that'd be sweet... but I'd learn any language for which you made a good "how to code with bitcoin" tutorial.
I have lots of interesting bitcoin projects I'd love to start.  I have programming experience, but it's all heavy math-related stuff (topological graph theory, searching combinatorial spaces, etc) and have no idea how to write a program that interacts with anything "external" like a blockchain (or even a file on a harddrive to be honest).

No, that's not what this bill does. It's like this: If the FBI logs onto a dark net market and watches someone commit what is (in the FBI's jurisdiction of choice) a crime, then the FBI can go get a warrant that would allow them to remotely infect the target user through Tor -- and they can do so from any judge in any jurisdiction in the US.
Without this bill it can be hard for the FBI to get a warrant to do that because -- since the user is behind Tor -- the FBI doesn't know which jurisdiction the user is in -- and so the judge (not knowing whether or not the user is within his jurisdiction) would often decline to issue the warrant.
This bill basically lets the FBI and judges say "since we can't know what jurisdiction the suspect is in, we're just gonna go ahead and pretend that the suspect is in *our* jurisdiction, so we can get the warrants we want".

Not secure?
It's just a sorting/ordering algorithm. Security has nothing to do with it. Anyone with access to the blockchain can find/confirm any firstbits address for any Bitcoin address. It's simply a way of truncating btc addresses to the minimum necessary length while still preserving enough information to lookup the original address.
IIR the primary complaint against firstbits was that users would mess it up. If you don't truncate exactly right then coins will be sent to another address.

It has a lot to do with socioeconomic status.

They emptied my pockets and found a promise ring I had bought the day before and was intending to give to my girlfriend at the time. He said "I think this was stolen. People like you don't walk around with things like this" and he slipped the ring into his pocket.
I protested, was threatened with arrest so I shut the hell up. They searched my friends too, but didn't take anything from them.

That's not how firstbits works. Given a truncated (firstbits) address, you find the corresponding btc address by finding the *first* address that appears in the blockchain that has those same first bits.
Finding a "collision" isn't enough. You'd also have to go back in time and be the first person to use that address.

No, it doesn't apply to Bitcoin. It only applies if your block-creators are a closed/fix set of "authorized authors". In that case, you just use majority voting on blocks (by signature). Proof of work is only required when your system is open to everyone (as in the case of Bitcoin).

No I never got it back. I even visited the department a day or two later (when I worked up the nerve) and they claimed ignorance.
That was years ago, and I'm over the ring (and the girl). But the experience was one of a handful of negative police experiences that make me nervous as hell whenever I see a cop. And devices like this "bank account emptier" scare the shit out of me.
I live in a place in Nor Cal that is known for people growing weed. During "harvest season" (late fall I think) the police start pulling a lot of people over.
I don't do drugs, but if I get pulled over I'm nervous about whether I'll have my (admittedly meager) funds stolen from my bank account.
I can't afford a lawyer to help me if I do.
Probably won't happen though, so I shouldn't worry too much.

Have you read the IOTA white paper?
Page 3 bullet point 3.
The purpose is to prevent spam. The PoW difficulty will need to be adjusted up as the number of txns on the network grows.
Right now the difficulty/cost it is negligible (just like bitcoin fees used to be), but will necessarily increase with the number of txns on the network.

It's located in the current, unadulterated firmware. Am I missing something?
My understanding is that this vuln requires custom (unsigned) firmware installed on the Trezor in order to exploit.
Starting with a Trezor with known-good, patched firmware, an attacker would have to flash the firmware (and thus destroy the keys) in order to exploit.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:24:24
If you try to replace the firmware with unsigned firmware the device should wipe the keys before installing the new firmware. It's a simple fix. u/slush0 can you verify?

Trezor for the win. I've been loving mine for years. Have never had a problem. I use it for storing coins, U2F, and as a password manager.
I also intend to use it replace my PGP key (or least for a subkey).
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:32:01
Enable the "password" feature on your Trezor. Every password you use results in a different master seed, and therefore different wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-16 04:34:14
Exactly. If address A and address B have been used together as inputs for some txn, then A and B are linked.
And linking is transitive. If A and B are linked, and B and C are linked, then A and C are implicitly linked. See "bitcoin closure" for more info.
This can actually be used to your advantage in the case of Coinjoin (which basically achieves some level of anonymity by intentionally linking a huge number of addresses from the community at large).
Also if you've ever released your master public key to any service ever, then that service will be able to identify any key as having been generated from that seed.
Achieving anonymity with Bitcoin is possible, but nontrivial. But, OP, you're asking the right questions.
EDIT: various grammar and autocorrect-corrections.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:23:12
If at all possible, I'd use a hardware token (U2F) using Yubikey or Trezor for your second factor authentication. 
That way you never have to worry about uptime of a third party auth service, and compromising your second factor requires physically stealing your hardware token.

If your system isn't "open to anyone" then there is exactly zero need for a blockchain. None. Period.
If your system consists of N "approved" users, then sybil attacks are impossible, and so proof-of-work is not necessary. Reaching consensus in such a system requires only digital signatures. If you have greater than (N/2) digital signatures from "approved" participants then you can resolve any dispute.
They are excited about the buzzphrase "blockchain technology" and want in. And yes, these people DO throw money at things they don't understand. See repackaged subprime mortgages for example.

Awesome. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for answering.
How is initial store/product discovery done? I get that if I already know a vendor and am subscribed to his store, then I can see all the products he's listing. But if I'm a brand new user and I'm not yet subscribed to any stores, how do I search the network for "red medium sized widgets"? Is this something that has to be done out-of-network? That is, do sellers have to advertise their stores outside of the network in order for new users to find them? Or is there a discovery mechanism built in?
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:52:28
I think you are making a mistake by including initial-currency-dispersion (block reward) in the computation of the cost-per-transaction.
The block reward is simply a way to fairly distribute the 21 million btc, and incentivise people to help with the bootstrapping and creating of a network effect. The block reward is NOT needed for the long term security of the network (transaction fees are). So I think it's inaccurate to include the initial currency dispersion in your computation of the cost-per-transaction.

As others above have suggested, I've never heard the "other side" of the argument. Only Mike and Gavin's.
Can you provide links to clear, coherent arguments from the other side of this debate? I, for one, would like to read them. 
Currently I fall on the "increase it now" side of things... but that may well be because it's the only side of things I've heard. Gavin's arguments sound reasonable to me. What are the arguments against blocksize increase?

@_date: 2015-08-21 16:01:25
Nope, not all.
The transaction spending beta is no longer valid after the transaction spending alpha is broadcasted.
So if Carrol chooses Alice's bid, then Bob's bid/transaction is no longer a valid one. So his coins never move. He still holds those beta coins in his wallet.

We don't have the resources to host our own at the moment.
One of the reasons we're not using a server-side proxy is that we want the app to be 'stand alone' in the sense that folks don't need us to be around for it to work. If users simply save a copy of the webpage they'll be able to use the app even if our page goes down (so long as the API provider is still accessible, obviously).
Definitely nothing "wrong" with using a server side proxy, per say. But our design goals are better met by everything being client-side in this case.

Consider that the collection of files being hashed to generated the privkey can contain not just images, but also a PGP public key.
The verifying entity (say, Target) verifies your ID and also has you verify that you have you control the PGP privkey corresponding to the pubkey in the file (say, by requiring you to sign random bits provided by them).
Now your ID can be used remotely, by cryptographically signing challenges with your PGP key.
This has further, interesting, implications.

MAD escrow is in no way better than 2-of-3 escrow.
Build in 2-of-3 escrow to allow for third party moderation and you might have a chance.
Otherwise, unresponsive buyers (where the buyer recieves the purchased item but then forgets/neglects to go back online and release funds to seller) alone will make this thing flop.
Not to mention the fact that MAD escrow is game-theoretically unstable and will result in sellers strong-arming buyers after delivery of goods.

Why not? You can access BC.info via their .onion address -- so network level anonymity is solid. No personal info is needed to "sign up".
As for btc-level anonymity, the coinjoin protocol either provides it, or it doesn't. 
If you believe it does provide anonimity, then all that matters is whether or not BC.info has implemented it properly.
If you believe the coinjoin protocol doesn't provide anonymity, then no implementation of it (whether BC.info, DarkWallet, or otherwise) should satisfy you.
What am I missing?
EDIT: Answer to my own question: because the BC.info implementation is controlled by BC.info... we can't know that they don't keep logs. Derp.

We intend this to be the first of many very-simple free, open source tools that demonstrate the basic techniques used to deanonymize bitcoin users.

*How is escrow handled (2-of-3 multisig, 2-of-2 multisig, no escrow, ...)?
*Where are product listings posted (on the BC, in a DHT, in bitmessage, centralised forum, ...)?
*How do you handle user reputation (where are the ratings stored, how are they calculated, etc)?
The answers to these questions define your decentralised market. The rest is window dressing.

coinjoin can also be used to make closures larger and larger .. which makes closure analysis less and less useful (as the closure becomes more "polluted" with coinjoin inputs it becomes less useful to those trying to use it for deanonymization).
So the following trick is interesting. If you take any address in the closure of an address A and any address in the closure of address B, and you create a transaction with those two addresses as inputs... then the two closures *merge* into one.
That is, in pseudocode, closure(A) &lt;-- closure(A) union closure(B).
So it's possible for coinjoin to confound closure analysis even more than it already does in it's current state.
tl;dr: use coinjoin often.

We used that idea in one of the early proposals for how the vendor-rating lookups would be done in OpenBazaar (in that case, the vendor would send a few bits to the escrow address used for a given trade... the bits sent would be from his "vendor confirmation address" as a way for the vendor to publicly and irrevocably say "yes this escrow address is one connected to a trade that I'm involved in and I agree to be held to whatever review/rating comes out of this transaction").
I really think this IDchain thing has a lot of potential.
It's also new for me to think of btc private keys as not needing to be private. In fact, in this use case, the btc private keys are (by default at least) publicly known. That one paradigm-shift alone will likely unleash a flood of new ideas.
Thank you.

I'm saying that BC's implementation of the Coinjoin algo *does* provide anonymity. You can access it via tor, create wallets with exactly 0 personal info, and coinjoin your coins in a fully automated way (it even auto-joins the coins for mulitple rounds... between 3 and 7 depending on your needs).
It is far from "... a piece of shit that no one should recommend...".
It's not perfect (centralized, therefore risk of logging), but as far as I can tell they are implementing the protocol properly, and they make it very easy to access via Tor.

95.2% = (200/210) = ([absolute amount paid as a fee] / [total amount of the transaction]). So you could say that 95.2% of the total money moved in that transaction was paid as a fee -- so you are right in that sense. 
But fees are usually expressed as ([absolute amount paid as a fee] / [absolute amount not paid as a fee]). Which in this case is (200/10) = 2000%.

IMHO Bitcoin, Etherium, and Zcash are the only crytpocurrencies worth paying any attention to. [Possibly that Ddos coin too if it's ever actually developed.]
Those three projects collectively contain all that is good about cryptocurrencies in general.

That's a good question. The PoW mechanism prevents the network from being flooded with txns. So if there are too many txns coming in at once (whether it's because of spam or legit use) the PoW will have to adjust up until the number of transactions comes down to an "acceptable" level (however that is determined).
It's analogous to the bitcoin txn fee -- which goes up when the network is flooded with txns.
More importantly (I don't have a page reference handy, but it's in the IOTA white paper and I was reading this section last night) the security of IOTA *assumes that honest participants have majority hashing power*. That's actually stated explicitly in the paper.
What's not stated -- but can be inferred from their design -- is that security is only achieved if BOTH (a) majority hash power is controlled by honest participants AND (b) that the honest participants are continuously *using* that hash power at all times. In other words, honest participants need to be creating txns _continuously_ in order to prevent parasite chain attacks by attackers.
They don't seem to realize it, but their underlying security assumptions are nearly identical to Bitcoin's, but their security guarantees are weaker.
I genuinely wanted to be excited about IOTA (I have a graduate degree in mathematics with an emphasis in graph theory -- so IOTA and their DAG approach was super appealing to me).
But IMO the design is irreparably flawed. :(

It doesn't need filecoin anymore than bittorrent needs micropayments. Filecoin is just a way for them to fund themselves.
If you want to host data in IPFS but can't find any nodes that want to host it for you, filecoin gives you a way to pay ppl to host your stuff (using some clever tricks to make sure they are *actually* hosting it and not just scamming you).
But if there are folks out there who are willing to host your stuff for free then you don't need filecoin.
OB1 will be hosting everybody's stuff for free on their IPFS node, along with many other people who volunteer their machines to help support the IPFS network.
Filecoin is not needed, and IMHO is a scamcoin that the IPFS folks pumped so they don't have to go through traditional funding routes.

It's not clear to me why blockchain technology is needed for this use case. All I'd need is a digital sig from the site owner to know the content I got was authored by the site owner.
I suppose there is the issue of knowing whether you have *the most up-to-date version* of the site though... and I could see where blockchain tech could be used there in cases where that is absolutely critical. But for most use cases (blogging, etc) I think the time it takes for site updates to propagate through a DHT wouldn't be critical.
Also, it seems to me that having site owners 'push' content to the DHT, rather than have users pull from them when they are online, would be a very easy thing to implement.
Disclaimer: I know nothing about either of the above projects. I'm just thinking about P2P web-hosting in general.

It's complicated. We have a particular use case involving escrow that requires a particular member to signal (in a verifiable way, that uses only info on the BTC blockchain to verify) that they are involved in the multisig txn *before* the escrow address is fully funded.
One easy (though not optimal) way to achieve this would be to have this member be permanently associated with a particular BTC address that he controls (call it address A). Then, when the 2-of-3 escrow address M is created using pubkeys B, C, and D... The special member can signal that he is involved in the transaction by sending a small amount of coin from A to M.
The problem with using this (naive) method is that our design goals necessitate that the protocol work even if this special member doesn't have access to any BTC. So we can't assume that there is any coin in address A that can be sent to M.
As a modification, I'm working on a proposal that would create a P2SH escrow address that would require sigs 'A and 2-of-3-of-{B, C, D}' to spend from escrow.
Before escrow is funded, A will presign a "blank check" txn spending from M and pass that sig to the other participants. Once the other participants verify the sig, escrow will be funded. The other participants now have (effectively) an old fashioned 2-of-3 multisig situation.
When the money is spent from escrow, the redeem script will include a sig from A, proving that the party controlling A admits to having been part of the transaction. Same end result as the naive approach, but doesn't require A to have any coins to begin with.
It sounds weird, I know, but some very restrictive design requirements led us here.
Coupled with other pieces of a trade-flow protocol that we've already ironed out, this could (in the future) be one way to provide cheaper/better/more reliable censorship resistant commitments and storage of negative ratings in OpenBazaar. Our current method has shortcomings under certain edge-cases that can (again, under special circumstances) allow a malicious vendor to censor negative reviews about him from future buyers.
We discovered that if we can have the vendor signal that he is part of a given escrow txn BEFORE it is funded, then this problem is solved. I'm trying to come up with as many different protocol designs as possible that achieve this goal, so we can have some options to analyze and choose from when it comes time to address this in the future.

When people spend less than the whole amount of btc from a paper wallet, their wallet software will (unless otherwise specified) send the change to a change address (a different address than the one on your printed paper). This has caused confusion for people in the past, and has resulted in the loss of coins.
As a result, it has become a commonly cited precaution to always sweep the whole amount of a paper wallet when spending from it.
But you can send coins *to* a paper wallet as many times as you'd like. No worries there.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but it is *very* unlikely that you wrote down the wrong seed, and the seed that you accidentally wrote down is actually a valid seed.
The reason is that (again, correct me if I'm wrong), the last word acts as a checksum.
It may be that you have the correct seed but an incorrect password. Were you using a password with your Trezor?

TMP did, but it never took off. The user experience wasn't easy enough for most users. The Multisig UI needs to be joe-sixpack-easy. There is nothing preventing someone from implementing this...it just takes 1 part desire, 1 part UI design skills, and 100 parts feinding druggies demanding the service because they are sick of getting ripped off.

Multisig would have helped because buyers and sellers in the middle of a transaction would have the opportunity to settle on their own. Yes, the small number of transactions that were being disputed would essentially be frozen (since the third party escrow wouldn't be around to weigh in), but the majority of transactions could be settled directly by the users of the 2/3 escrow.
And concerning the "no reputable company is going to escrow an illegal drug market" comment... This is why it's so important to have third party escrow services being offered by someone other than the market admin. Many people would be willing to act as third party escrow, and they'd be incentivized to do a good job if they were competing for business. When the escrow market is monopolized by a single site admin, they have less incentive to do a good job. On the other hand, if users had the ability to choose their escrow service provider, said providers would need to do a good job if they wanted to be patronized again in the future.

It's very easy. For your use case just write down your seed (or memorize it) and choose a decent PIN. Don't use an additional passphrase (you don't need one for your use case). It's very easy to use.

Their argument is basically: the mainstream media keeps mentioning bitcoin, and a few powerful people from the finance industry have gotten involved in some bitcoin-related ventures... Therefore bitcoin is actually a conspiracy created by the elitist globalists to keep everyone in the world enslaved.
People like this are why we haven't inhabited space yet (also cosmic radiation, but you know what I mean).

First, they may have already.
Second, because m-of-n addresses (as currently implemented) get larger with n.
You are def right about "knowing *how* is important". But that doesn't matter if you don't know *that* you've been breached. Alarms have their place.
Also, if I'm a money-motivated attacker, why would I breach all 2000 servers when I can claim the funds after breaching just 1?
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:07:43
That is true. The same person can make a DNM and also serve as an escrow service. If there are many escrow services being used, though, then the DNM operator's share of the escrow market should be low... Hopefully low enough that it is more profitable for him to collect market fees than it is to run off with what few coins he has full control over.
At the end of the day, though, decentralized markets are the way to go. That way we don't have to worry about site-wide shutdowns ever again. Disappearing sellers and maligned escrow services, sure... But no more of this "running off with millions overnight" bs.

That's a great idea. I'm definitely interested. I live in a place with exactly 0 businesses that accept btc, so I don't know how helpful I can be, but I do visit San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Portland, and Melborne, so perhaps I can be of use occasionally.

'solar' is incorrect. 'plastic' is correct (because it's a mass noun). 'artificial intelligence' is correct (it's adjective then noun). 'digital' is incorrect.
No pronouns, lots of problems.

They're just referring to companies/people working on projects that involve blockchain technology. If they don't specify then they probably *aren't* working with the bitcoin blockchain or ethereum blockchain.

'Bitcoin' is a pronoun. 'Blockchain' isn't. That's why your sentence is correct and theirs isn't.
Your's is akin to "Here are 5 ways Bob can change the world".
Theirs is akin to "Here are 5 ways ledger can change the world".

IIR, Bitmessage doesn't use blockchain tech at all. Just classic encryption, authentication, and a p2p relay network.
Edit: it also uses hashcash to prevent dos attacks.
Edit: also, Twister incentivises miners in their blockchain with tokens that allow them to post "promoted messages" (read "paid ads"). These tokens are the analogous to "bitcoins" in an obvious way.

Perhaps user identities could be "bought" with a proof-of-burn of some coins.
The more coins you burn, the more valuable your identity is to you, and the more you have to lose by ripping me off.
If you have a brand new $50 identity, I'd take a risk and sell you &lt; $50 worth of product. That might work to bootstrap the trust process... From there it's good old fashoined rating systems.

Say I have 2000 servers. I can can created a 1-of-2000 multisig address, put $1000 in that address, and put one of the 2000 privkeys on each of my 2000 servers.
Now if any one of those servers is compromised, the $1000 will be stolen, and I'll know exactly which server was compromised.
In this way I get an early warning system for 2000 servers that only costs me $1000 -- rather than 2000*$1000 = $2M if I were to try to set up an equivalent system without using multisig.

Yep, this is totally possible. The reason nobody is doing it now is because getting people to use a new network is very difficult. Nobody wants to use a network that doesn't have anybody on it.
