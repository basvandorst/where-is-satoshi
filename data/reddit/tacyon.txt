Start the next bubble and sell at the top.  It just takes money to start the next bubble and it sounds like you have a lot of it.

Closing someones account does not mean they kept their bitcoins, they didn't and as a customer of theirs, I am constantly looking for evidence of such behavior.  In all cases, the account has been frozen(no buys\sells) but they are able to take possession of their coins.
For the vast majority of people, coinbase is a good provider.  But if you want anonymity, gambling, drugs etc, don't use them.  And if you do, don't be surprised if they tell you to take your business elsewhere.
  
Again, provide proof that coinbase has taken someones coins or stfu.

You tricked us!  You will do well around here... (lol)

But you said you were asking for a friend..

There it is!  It's refreshing to see it at the bottom.
  
So what is it for you?  Because he's Ron Paul's son?  He's a carpet bagger?  He might be a libertarian in disguise?  He's on the red team?  What??

And the very next sentence that you omitted is: "According to the United States FDA, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the British National Health Service,[64] the benefits of vaccines **vastly outweigh the risk of rare side effects**."
  
The article even acknowledges it can happen, but rarely.

I don't have time to check everything you said, but I suspect it's all wrong...

Safer route is Coinbase since you have to ask.  Once you are familiar with bitcoin and how wallets work, you'll just know what is best for you.  As long as you aren't using bitcoin for anything illegal or breaking their ToS, you will be fine.  Their whole job is to secure other peoples bitcoin.

I think it is silly and I love it.  I want to be able to hide my payment sound in a regular soundbite so that I can subject people to movie soundbites at the checkout stand.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin, this person is attacking a political ideology.  Bitcoin is money and money doesn't care what political party you belong to.

Being easy to use doesn't mean they understand the implications of what they are doing.  The person admits to being new.  Don't be a conspiritard, Coinbase is not a wolf and this person is not sheep.

Of course the facts don't mater, they get in the way of your smear.

And how is he wrong?  I personally think all marriages should be contractual and the government should stay out of it unless the courts are needed to argue the contract.

Coinbase is a good wallet.  Not everyone is computer savvy and knows what they're doing.  If they're here asking these questions, they do not know what they're doing and they should learn before they take control of their coins.  This is just common sense.
  
Every wallet you suggested invites the possibility they will lose their seed or private key(multisig) and lose everything before they have had a chance to learn.

Maybe you can cite a case of someone having their coins confiscated by Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:43:49
That is not going to happen.  He is going to create barriers and then he is going to create a company that makes money helping other companies get through those barriers.

That's not true, no one has had their coins taken by Coinbase.  Everyone has had the option to move them somewhere else.

Don't use Bitstamp in the first place.  They will report just the same as Coinbase, Circle etc..
  
Send from Bitstamp to a paperwallet you have created(and backed up!).  Then use an exchange that isn't going to report you to your government authorities.  BTC-e and Chinese Exchanges.  Also, there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin Core.
