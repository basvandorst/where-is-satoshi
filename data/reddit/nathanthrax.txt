Holy crap!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:14
Looks like that was it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:34
Seems like a steal now at 16500, considering we were just at 19+
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:50:44
Holding for correction! If it dips under 12, I plan to jump in again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:57
When they sell off, I wonder how much will surge back into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:09:08
This was great! I was rather concerned with the shorting aspect of futures and how it would impact bitcoin. This brought me some confidence.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:15
And I shall buy!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:04:36
What’s your comfort level? Is this money you’re willing to lose? I’m waiting for a correction to follow. If it goes under 12k, I might buy some more. That’s my comfort spot with my current finances. I’m curious to see what the CME will do to BTC in the next few days too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:46
Looks like it's correcting a smidge? Bitcoin is in super beast mode right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:46
17400 and dropping

Maybe I’m mistaken, but it looks like tons of sell orders around 4pm before BCH went live. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:05
15k now... where’s the bottom?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:25
I just started watching Andreas the other day and holy crap. He has a way of making everything seem so clear. It even made me feel better about my investments in general. Wish I would have heard about him earlier. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:01:23
It’s already back up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:19:39
I feel for him. Hopefully they had money to burn.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:37
I just posted gains and peoples responses ranged from “my husband and I were looking at that,” to “it’s going to crash.” That was last week.

How do I transfer my coins to this? Is this more secure than keeping them on the exchanges? I think I might return my Ledger Nano now.

I jumped on the hype train back in August when I first heard about it. It sounds interesting, but the development has had a few hiccups from what I understand. It was cheap, so I threw like 30 dollars at it that time. In the grand scheme, I wish I would have put that into antshares/neo, but I was just starting. Do I think it's better... (define better?). Is it a threat to bitcoin... no. People hardly know of crypto. They may have "heard" of Bitcoin, but Verge... It's going to be awhile, and there are so many other coins that claim to be the "best" at what they do. There always seems to be a flavor of the month.

Almost!!!! Where are the 14k memes?

So I finally got it to work. Since I didn't have a webcam, I've spent the last few days attempting different lighting and alternate angles until I got locked out. I've read through a few forums and it sounds like I'm not the only on. I even tried Kinomi to use my cellphone as a webcam, but it didn't register with coinbase. So I caved and purchased a c270 for 20 bucks. Success! Kind of a pain to have to go through all that to get verified.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:19:09
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:27
Just purchased one myself
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:54
Is this something that caused/attributed to the dip?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:23:01
If you link a debit card, isn’t it like $5000 a week?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:36
Oh,thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:45
I hope it stays above 10k. I'm going to say ~10,200. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:25
Think the day will end above or below 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:39
What do you think this will do to the other coins? It seems that BTC's value rather dictates the rest of them. This is just based off personal observations from coinmarketcap and blockfolio.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:06
Think it will get back above 11k?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:37:59
I just spent ~$2,200. I guess we'll find out. I'm curious as to how things will changed 12/11/17 after CME stuff goes down. I've been doing cryptos as a hobby since August of last year (late starter). Since then, I've spent ~$440, and made $120 off it until today's purchase. While not much, it has still been a lot of fun. I'm not a very good investor (obviously), but the idea of being part of something is exciting. I'm pretty much a "basic bitch" when it comes to investing. I do 403b, ira's, and savings account. This is just more for sh*t's and giggles. I ended up spending that $2200 among btc, ltc, and eth today. I probably should have put it all on btc, but I like diversifying. I think you have to have the mentality that the money never existed once you spend it. That is easier said than done though.

and above 10 again... phew
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:12
Yikes! Going down hard!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:08:16
Do you think all this traffic is contributing to it? I noticed coinbase keeps going down. How about the other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:50:54
I understand the consequences. I've been purchasing since August of last year. Some I've broke even, some I've lost. I've probably only spent around $500 dollars so far on cryptos. I just wish I had bought more BTC instead of other coins. I was wondering what people thought the CME would do to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:54
Do you think it will go down, up, or bounce around a bunch? I saw nasdaq talks of picking it up too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:43:23
Starts around 57 mins in. That was painful.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:06
Thats crazy! Is this speculation or actually legit? If so, do you think this would hurt Bitcoin's prices? I guess the CME will be a good testing site for this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:49:31
This is a very valid concern. If I were a guessing man, I’d go the latter. Do you think some nations will try to buy up BTC though? What if Bitcoin became like gold is, and the nations create their own tokens around bitcoin? I’m sure there will be something done to gain control over the situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:52:48
Not enough...
