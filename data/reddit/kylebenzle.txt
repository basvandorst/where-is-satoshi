No, you are misunderstanding what Bitcoin is and how it works by asking your question.
@_date: 2016-03-22 13:23:32
Great on you but I would get out of the r/bitcoin sub looking for advice. Not saying where to go, but these people will lie to you and give bad advice in general. Good luck!

So, a centralized database built to track a decentralized database? Wow, so much database links!

(1) Fuck these insidious bastards! (2) Yes, the author is saying that the battle is won as now they have $70+ million, and presumably the large blocks are no longer going to be an issue.

"No" is the answer to his question. Bitcoin (btc) does not do that.

Did you try it? Have you been to that site, it does not do that.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:41:21
Do you really think that is the dynamic? Core "not letting" Gavin "back in"?
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:06:32
*Will*, it already *has*.

Wow! A 173.6 tb monthly cap, sounds like he's doing just fine. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:46:16
OK, I can see that, maybe he is annoying.
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:33:25
This can't be real, why would a real human use a site like that?
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:23:23
What OP is asking... The question makes no sense! What does it even mean to buy and send btc in one step with no account? He is just asking, "how can I buy btc without any verification?" which is just asking, "how can I buy btc?", the answer is, get verified then buy it. So you see, the bitcoin infrastructure is not set up in anyway to do what this person is asking.

Sorry, I was just saying that your comment makes you sound like an idiot because you are saying that Bitcoin's ex-lead developer is "more annoying..." just because he twittered a tweet agreeing there are LN concerns. So  guess I'm an idiot too for commenting on your idiot post. But basically, your an idiot is what I was trying to say there.
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:40:49
Is that a joke!?! That site DOES NOT do what op was asking AT ALL. I just tried it. It is an "exchange" with 1 (ONE!) seller! Again, the answer is, No, you can not do what OP was asking. The Mort, seriously, what point are you trying to make here?
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:14:40
Whats a mouth breeder? (did you mean cock sucker?)
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:37:50
Yes $/cost is best, but choose your own time line... but, if it was me and I had the time, I would set up a series of (increasing) buys starting at $370 and going down to around $150. Give it a month or two, then reevaluate your unmet bids. Key is to not hurry your buys IMO. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:49:21
I don't trust you but I don't think you are annoying (an idiot maybe (probably)). Not trusting someone does not make them annoying, and Gavin's perspective is valid (so is yours).
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:39:48
That's funny :)  That's like when you are getting ready to quit a job for a new better one the boss fires you before you can quit so they can save face. "Oh yeh, we didn't want bitcoin's lead developer working on our project anyway!"
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:57:59
PM me your bitcoin wallet address, I will send. When you get it, paypal me the $7, if you want.

Yeh, don't bother, they just "rolled back" $1000+ out of my account!

I just bought, so if he does only have 2 customers, he is now doing 50% of his business in coin! Even better news!
