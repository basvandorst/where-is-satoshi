Well, I've seen others in here fall into the same "if you don't agree you are a troll" trap so I was hoping others might take something from my comment as well.
OP is a lost cause, so no point addressing the rest of the comment.

The discovery of hashes (and therefore blocks) is fundamentally what allows the transfer of BTC between wallets, yes. The difficulty of solving the hash is the security of the network.
People (in theory) will continue mining when there are no more block reward because they will still receive the transaction fees that people pay. Those fees will still be small for the individual, but will add up to make mining worth it.
There is *no way* to steal bitcoins directly. If you send them to a secure address and the block confirms they will literally stay there until the end of time. On the other hand, if a hacker got your private key s/he could steal your coins. So the system is fundamentally sound and secure, but coins could be stolen if your computer gets hacked or you lose your private key in any way.

I would have ordered but the site doesn't use TLS. I'm not sending my address and e-mail across the tubes in plaintext.
Will order as soon as this is fixed.

Hah, as if MtGox were competent enough to run an attack like this.

Everyone who disagrees with you is not a troll (and especially not a paid troll! lol). The fact that you think otherwise makes you look straight up delusional.

Sell all my bitcoins and keep running my pre-fork node.
This is a legitimate slipperly slope. Fork the bitcoin today to fix the Goxcoins, how about next year when 200k coins are permanently lost or stolen? The whole point of the blockchain is that it is *immutable*. Manually hacking blocks into it is a terrible idea.

I have a VPS with them (paid for with bitcoin) and I've been quite happy with it. I'm running a bitcoin node (updated from git daily), a tor relay, and my personal website.

What? I haven't seen my instance killed due to excessive bandwidth use. Is this mentioned anywhere on their website? This is with chunkhost?

No, I don't think so. Unfortunately: "We offer a 5% discount when you pre-pay with Bitcoin, and our prices are pegged at the MtGox exchange rate (which everyone knows is too high!)"
So hopefully they have updated who they peg their prices to...

Yes, this makes me sad as well. :(

Yes, and furthermore the great divisibility of a bitcoin solves any potential "scarcity" issues the gradual loss of coin would otherwise cause.

I get 2TB of traffic a month. I believe I'm charged 2 cents per extra GB. Either way, I just monitor my bandwidth. If I were to go over my allotment I would shut down bitcoind for the rest of the month.
