Obviously you've never been in poverty. Go visit a third world country, outside your privileged sheltered life to see the real face of capitalism

Um, no. In no way is it voluntary. Wage labour is institutionally coerced onto people. Who would want to work at a fast food chain or a retail store without the fact that if they didn't work there, they wouldn't have any money to buy food.

So its not coercion if I *choose* where to be a wage slave? lol

I would if I could but land is now a commodity thanks to capitalism.


Nothing except for me not wanting to live out on the streets. Fuck their property, all they are doing is exploiting people.


The police only exist for social control and protection of private property.


The difference is that I'd be doing something that I want to do rather than being coerced into working for some jerkoff to make ends meet. They say that if you do what you want to do, you'll never work a day in your life, which is true. But in capitalism those who are unfortunate enough to be born into poverty are not provided the same opportunities, and usually wind up being poor their whole life. And that's only in today's society. I would imagine it would be way worse in "anarcho"-capitalism.

The capitalist system is coercive. The very fact that whether or not you eat depends on whether or not you have enough money is the coercion. It's systematic. Who the hell would 'voluntarily' pay rent? Also, this is not counting in the fact that you need a violent police force to have private property privileges.


Again, it's systematic. One must be employed in order to have enough money to pay the rent and put food on the table, but sometimes even that isn't enough.

Capitalism isn't free trade. Capitalism didn't even exist until about 2 centuries ago.


The very fact that you must sell your labour (or time) to a capitalist in order to exist on the planet is coercive.

It isn't "hierarchy" to ask someone who is knowledgeable to a certain subject for advice. What is hierarchical is a boss having control of whether the worker can feed himself or his family via wages.

Give an example of "voluntary hierarchy".

"It's coercion that creates problems."
How do you not see the coercion in capitalism?
