2 btc makes trezor a good investment. The UI is very simple to understand and use.

That cannot happen with bitcoin. An incorrect blockchain, or the public ledger, will be invalidated even with a tiny mismatch. Probably an interface error. You could try adding up all transactions if it's not too long for you to check.

Wait, is it possible to soft fork to 2x? Soft fork means that nodes will continue to accept non 2x transactions, right? Sorry for a noob question.

Isn't Cryptosteel a paper wallet (made of steel)?

No. I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh wait was it a transfer fee?

Market cap in crypto is the same meaning as that of stock. Btc value * number of coins in circulation. Right now bitcoin's cap is around 51 billion.

Actually banks are very inefficient. They also have to use computing power for secure transmission. Plus their employees ultimately waste energy going to work and back for example. On top of that the physical buildings have to be built and maintained while bitcoin uses minimal physical resources aside from the computers.

Most of us are in it for long term gains so we withdraw the btc and keep it in our wallet. I don't have a price I'm aiming for... I just sell when I need the usd. But day traders would keep it in the exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:53:11
I am very confident that the current price of btc is undervalued. The market cap is $65 billion, but it should be 10x that or more. Most people do not know of bitcoin, but we should see major adoption everywhere and worldwide soon. Therefore, I believe the price of btc will continue to rise.
There are obstacles to the upward price trend: forks, credit card sponsored fud, competing alts, exchange takedowns, etc. These cause price drops, but since bitcoin is a highly adopted, decentralized, open source system, it continues to evolve and get through all these obstacles.
So yes you should invest in bitcoin if you like money and you have the patience to ride though price drops.

Yes it's called Bitcoin Cash. I will refer to it as Bcash and people here understand what I'm talking about.

But I think it's kind of necessary to make the network secure and fairly distribute new bitcoins. I do know there is an alternative called proof of stake which is not energy intensive but someone else could probably fill me in on why proof of work is more advantageous...

I'm pretty sure the algorithm can't be "reused" because it's ment to do one thing only. I looked it up and this top answer explains pretty well  Hash functions are the most efficient for bitcoins, and that is why everyone likes this system. There are altcoins that can fold protein for example, but they aren't as efficient in terms of block mining.
Great question, I've definitely asked myself this before. I'm sure many newcomers ask this too.

Although Coinbase's fees are the highest out of any exchange, it's still cheap imo. For a bank account transaction in the US, it's 1.49%, or 1.49 dollar out of every 100.

Your BCC public address is the same as your current one. There is no magic tool that shows it to you because it's basically the same numbers you see in your wallet, just different currency name.
I BELIEVE the method to send your bcc to an exchange is, in your case, download a bcc wallet, copy the wallet.dat file to the new wallet, then send to your exchange wallet address. BUT don't do this without someone else's advice because I'm not that sure and I don't have experience with the core wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:14:34
I believe gdax is an exchange, thus you don't control the private keys? If so, you will not receive your share of bcc, unless you export to something that does by aug1. But don't worry, there is a slim chance of being able to sell bcc before it crashes. Bitcoin's price shouldn't be too affected by it.
*I meant send to, not export
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:59:50
You should go to the blog page of your exchange/wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:49:08
That's a good point. I do think the exchanges are missing out on potential profits but yeah that makes sense though.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:37:55
Go down for a few hours, zig zag a bit, then shoot up    on aug 3rd.

Yeah, I second this question. All other exchanges have terrible reviews as well.

You do not need to do that. You will get bcc on Aug 1st. Which wallet is it?

Okay, my recommendation is to buy the drone at the latest date that the drone would still be on sale, if you really want it. I asked to make sure you wouldn't be selling at a loss. But also consider that if you were to wait a bit more you could buy many drones and hook them all up to a couch so you have your very own personal helicopter.

(serious question) If you were to sell that amount of BTC now, would you have made profit or lost investing in BTC?

Over 0.2 btc? Trezor

Indeed great timing; you are one of the 1% of future bitcoin investors who bought it when it was still $3000. In two weeks or less the price will recover and soon after a difference of $500/btc will seem like nothing. Never wait for a drop otherwise you will miss out on record climbs.
