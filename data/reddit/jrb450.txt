Quick to 'splain what happened,  but no other details. ..
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:09:30
I couldn't close my positions either despite multiple attempts. I lost only .05 BTC and $1.08 cash- Now my acct shows a negative balance of $10. There are others that are in worse shape- so sorry. I hope they refund my acct! Here's what Bitfinex told me today:
please find below a summary of what happened last night:
1) The system had so far 2 filters checking the collateral position of every user placing an order, the first was taking place when the trader placed the order and the second was taking place when the order was executed.
2) Yesterday during some Alphapoint testing, the second filter was lifted in order to speed up the process and all seemed to be fine, both Phil and Raphael thought that the first gate was enough to prevent traders taking excessive leverage
3) at around 9.45 pm gmt after we went back to our old matching engine we had a spike in volume that caused some lag and people started panicking, placing multiple orders probably due to the system lagging and these orders were not filtered by the second filter as this was temporarily lifted. This caused the strange behavior that you have been experiencing.
4) Raphael took back the situation to 2 filters ( the old one) and now everything works fine again. We are now checking what went wrong with the first filter and will probably keep it there unless we are 101% sure it won't cause any problems anymore.
I hope this helps, please let me know if you need any further details

Is an increase in block size the only answer? Just saw a video on the Lightning Network that looks incredibly promising!

Yeah, Coinbase for sure....TipTop customer service! Had an issue just come up today and it was handled in a matter of hrs.

Send Whitey Bulger's boys after the Son-of-a-Bitch....

Oh man, do I ever feel for you! they have the WORST customer service...ever! 
What worked for me is to write a post on Facebook (ok, it was nasty and mean, but I was pissed!)- there seemed to be more of a response to that than anything else- not to say that your situation will get resolved quicker but at least you may be acknowledged. They suggested to not create and submit multiple help tickets for the same issue. Try posting a reply to the ticket you already submitted- helpdesk&gt;view tickets&gt;chose ticket&gt;click on post reply&gt; make sure to click send. They told me to use this method to move an existing ticket higher up in the queue. I like CampBx but they take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to resolve anything.
Good luck!

Strip4bit is always a treat.....
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:15:30
Yeah, after the fact. That message only started showing up today. This all happened yesterday.
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:57:01
I know, right? I'm no developer and maybe I didn't look hard enough, but I found little information about how to do this.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:49:09
Excited for mine!!
Way to go Mixed Tees!
@_date: 2013-08-26 17:23:27
Sorry to hear that. It is extremely frustrating! I just bombarded them with help tickets and wrote the Reddit post hoping that visibility would be raised. It sucks it had to come to that.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:14:53
Biggest joke you say? How about CampBx customer support!
That's right....Boom, I said it! You know you all know you wanted to!

My android Bitcoin Wallet (Andreas Schildbach's) kept crashing and I thought my Bitcoins were stuck in my phone forever. Here's what I did to recover them.

I got that message by merely clicking on the account funding option that said "fund via dwolla". I wanted to see what was involved with that option, but had no intention on following through. this locked up my account for a crazy long time despite help tickets. Best thing to do is to reply to a current ticket, this apparently moves it up in the queue. New help tickets about the same issue doesn't help. CampBx customer support is notoriously sucky. I got more customer support response by complaining on their facebook page! Best of Luck!

I wonder which "recent interest involving virtual currency and its exchanges" they're talking about?
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:02:09
Thanks, working through it!
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:49:47
Ur probably right, point taken....

After my experience with CampBx, Coinbase was a breath of fresh air. Yeah, there was a hiccup with a high risk txr- maybe some of it was my fault. Coinbase responded to my concern (sorry for being an ass, btw) and handled the situation in a timely and transparent fashion. They seem to be up front with their limitations and are quick to acknowledge them when they arise. In my situation, I couldn't have asked for anything more!

Got this from Coinbase today. Tried to buy a small amount to wait the 30 days. I guess they consider .15 BTC "High Risk"....
Edit: Holy shit am I ever impressed with their customer service- this was resolved all within a matter of hours, not days or months! 
Suck it CampBx!
