No it's not.

This is such a boring argument.

Because he was making a point. Duh. This wasn't some objective analysis, it was arguing that Dorian isn't Satoshi.

It's far too early to say. This new libertarian movement is still very young, though I'd argue that it has already affected the political conversation in this country, especially within the Republican Party. Several lawmakers have been elected from whom a straight line can be drawn to the modern liberty movement, and many more have run and lost, but forced the conversation in a direction it would not have otherwise gone. These things move slowly, but clearly political change has happened. Total victory is too much to ask only a little under a decade after this thing really got moving.
Besides, government is the most boring area to look at. Far more interesting, and influential in the long term I think, is the massive growth of libertarian intellectual and social circles. Ask the young political theorists, philosophers, economists, students, authors, and thinkers who have found libertarianism in the last five or so years, I'm sure half if not more would say, directly or indirectly, Ron Paul. 
Looking at things calmly, the liberty movement has seen explosive growth in every area. Political change is always the last thing to come. Give it time, maybe it will peter out, but it wouldn't even have a shot without Ron Paul and the platform he had access to as a congressman. At least that's how I see it.

This isn't a democracy, thank God.

I don't think there's a single individual who can take more credit for popularizing the liberty movement over the past few years than Ron Paul. 
That would have been impossible were he not a congressman.

In what sense is it?

I don't think it's the thanks itself, it's how painfully lame the phrase "kind stranger" and the like are.
