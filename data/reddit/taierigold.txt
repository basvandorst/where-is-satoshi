Be honest, you're just asking the question so you can have a conversation about Bitcoin (edit: which is perfectly fine). There is no way in hell you earnestly asked the question expecting even the remotest possibility of an affirmative answer.

We've been doing this in New Zealand since the 90's. There is almost nowhere in NZ that doesn't accept debit card as payment even for a pack of gum. Whenever I go overseas and try buy a coffee with my debit card they give me a puzzled look and say something like "$20 minimum transaction".

Actually it seems that while she campaigned for the remain vote, she has since realised she bought into the fear mongering and has changed her stance since the referendum result. Still, I wouldn't take her tweet as being pro bitcoin. She's still using it as an example of something that is unstable to make the pound look bad. It's like saying "Michael J fox has steadier hands than my brain surgeon lol."

She's not promoting Bitcoin, she's using it as an example of something that's really unstable but "more stable than the pound" because she's a commie and she's obviously still incredibly butthurt about Brexit.
EDIT: I just looked at the tweet. Her fucking twitter avatar is the fucking Turkish flag. She's doesn't give a shit about the UK or bitcoin and has obviously totally gone off the deep end.

She doesn't value bitcoin she's just trying to make it look like the pound is doomed because she was anti-brexit and is still crying about it.
