I've been splitting my buys (a little each month) between both BTC and ETH.
Hopefully both grow, but even if they don't maybe the winner will take off enough to cancel my losses in the other.  :-)

Meh. Just buy it. Dollar cost averaging helps take the bite out of it.   :-)

Great app idea! Love it

I'm buying a fixed amount monthly, similar to the dollar cost averaging approach in traditional investments.
Price might be up or down when I buy, but I don't care. I'm convinced that the long-term trend will continue upward.
We'll see.   :-)

If you can't afford to lose the money, no.
If you could set fire to that cash with a match and never miss it, go ahead.
I'm not being negative about btc future, I just try to be realistic about my financial situation before speculating on it.

Just bought some thru another app about 15 mins ago and it hasn't cleared yet either.

And only slightly less, at a somewhat predictable rate

Here's my big picture question about btc as an actual currency:
Why would I want to spend {x} bitcoin on a BillyBurger combo meal (or a guitar, or a motorcycle, or whatever you're into) if I believed that btc was going to multiply in value 100 times or more?
I'd have just bought a $500 burger (when looked at in terms of future profits.)
I realize the answer (if you don't spend it, it's valueless to everyone), but I'm having a hard time talking myself out of just hodling forever.
Anybody else have this problem?

I'm a hodler bc I can't figure out how to spend the stuff for goods/services
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:02:19
You can.
