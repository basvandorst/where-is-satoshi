Grooveshark is definitely looking forward to adding recurring support. We're following BIP-0700  and hopefully we can add recurring at some point!

It has less content partially because its mobile only and needs to support a lot of different devices.
As far as taking a while to load, are you saying the html5 site takes a while on your desktop? What specifically is taking a while? The homepage? Playing a song? Etc.

Grooveshark can't pay you if you don't reach out to us. If you use OneRPM they distribute to Grooveshark and you can make money that way really easily.

If you subscribe to people sometimes give away codes. Good luck!

If you're having trouble paying please contact support or msg me on Reddit. We do offer a yearly and monthly payment though.

For non-label artists, that definitely is an option that Grooveshark is not dismissing ;)
