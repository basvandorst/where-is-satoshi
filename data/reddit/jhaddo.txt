Illegal drugs are very hard to obtain in China except in certain foreign quarters of the largest cities like Beijing.  I've spent several years over there recently and have "seldom" seen any evidence of drug use.  I know!  That doesn't mean that they don't exist.  But the consequences of getting caught far outweigh the benefits of use, and and 99% of the people stay completely away from them.  People caught dealing drugs in China are routinely killed and these events are highly publicized.  This definitely puts a severe restriction on their use and sale.
If the Chinese Central Government wants to restrict or eliminate Bitcoins, it will happen.  You can say it will go underground, but believe me, when and if that happens completely, it will be the end of their use in China.  And right now the Chinese people hold about 40% of the world's supply of Bitcoins.  What's that going to do to the price of Bitcoins after Jan 31st????

Wall Street is coming.   What happens then is anybodies guess.  But it may well take Bitcoin away from those to whom it belongs.

I also am a small business owner who is interested in seeing the adoption of Bitcoin.  Not too long ago I began accepting credit card payments as a more convenient form of payment. But I didn't realize how convenient this would be.  
Now approximately 25% of the payments I receive are from credit cards, and it's growing significantly.  This convenience is costing me 2% which I can't afford.  So I began to pass this through to my customers.  They understand, thank goodness.
  
But in order to help my customers and still remain profitable, I am considering the adoption of taking Bitcoin payments.  My concern is about the difficulty in setting this up, the volatility in transferring to Fiat, and the overall effectiveness of proceeding with this avenue as a small business owner given the uncertainty of the future of Bitcoin.

I also ask this same question.  What will the Chinese people do after Jan 31st?  from what i understand, they will not be able to withdraw their bitcoins.  Will this make these bitcoins essentially having no value?  Will these coins be moved into another place or places where they can be utilized somehow?  China has approximately 40% of the bitcoins in production.  Will the Chinese people begin selling them as the deadline approaches?  Will this deadline cause panic selling?  This could create a nice buying opportunity.  Do the vast majority of Chinese people even know that they won't be able to access their coins after Jan 31st?  if they do, then what are they doing about it right now?  I see this as being a potentially earth-shaking even which does not seem to be showing up in the price of the coins, and I want to know why!

I'd like to see better accounting between my bitcoin purchases and my accounting software, including the capitol gains aspect.

Being able to trade 24/7 is one of the many things that attracted me to Bitcoin.  No more being at the beck and call of stock market exchanges that keep normal people from trading after hours while the institutions move the market in major ways leaving the small guy helpless until the exchanges open

Just a small point here Kertronic.  The total amount a person is able to transfer out of China is $50K USD.  If you need to do more than that, ask a Chinese relative or trusted friend, which is what I've done.

so what happens to these coins that are "lost"?

Hello Robert.  Good to see you're still pitching in with regards to Bitcoin development in China.  As we discussed previously in our correspondence, I'm still interested to see if there's any way I can get the proceeds of the sale of my home in China out of the country.  My wife is there now working on the sale.  I'd like to know the latest on what's happening in this regard.  JEH

I like your ledger tool.  I have created one similar to this for my own transactions.  But it is not quite so sophisticated.  However, one thing that I recommend you incorporate is to add a feature where the person using this tool can calculate FIFO (first in, first out) accounting.   For me, it's the only way to truly calculate profit and loss.  Thanx for the good work

Nice article.  I wrote you an e-mail, hope you reply.

That is very impressive.  Not only does it clearly demonstrate the use of your product, but also the way bitcoins can be used in a typical transaction for those of us who have yet to use it in such a way.  I think you have a winner!

I just caught this on the news

It's going to continue to be battered up and down, but finally find a resting place at about 1375 the last week in December.

Maybe I have a simplistic view here, but I do have extensive experience dealing with Chinese business people.  It seems to me that of presently the Chinese miners control the greatest percentage of the hash power, and therefore the greatest amount of the mining revenue as well.  This is a big mistake and will cause serious problems in the future.  All they want to do is try to keep that power and money in their hands as long as they can...no matter what that does to bitcoin as a whole.  I don't think they care about the long term future of bitcoin.  That's not the Chinese way.  If they restrict bitcoin until it finally strangles, then, for them, so what.  they'll just move on to another new opportunity.  This is the Chinese way!  The future of bitcoin should not rest in the hands of Chinese miners.

I say "These are the developers!  They've been doing a good job all along! Leave them alone and let the do their job.  Period!!!
