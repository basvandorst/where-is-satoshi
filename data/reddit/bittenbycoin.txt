If visitors from Neptune came to Earth and looked at the btc charts the last few weeks, they would come to the conclusion that some force (whale(s), market makers - let's call them "market coordinators") is providing a service for large buy and sell orders by moving the btc price up or down to some new strike price and letting the trading begin. Neptunians would conclude some outside party behaved like a wise-ass and shorted the market without their permission to a level $300 below the strike price they manipulated, and they(market coordinators) took advantage by immediately buying back to the most recent strike price of $9500. Earthlings would never actually be able to do this, but this would be the prevailing btc market view from the edge of the solar system.

Problem: Someone has a blog following of 1,000,000 people. They ask for tips from their audience. No one wants to pay the minimum $5 through Paypal.
Solution: Bitcoin + Lightning Network: if 10% of the audience were willing to tip 2 cents each (yes, they got their 2 cents worth), blogger could earn $2,000 from such a large following. There is no solution to micropayments other than crypto.

Is there a precedence to something like bitcoin, where it can be considered both a currency (accepted at many businesses) and an asset, at the same time?
I mean, it's easy to see why I can't go to the supermarket with Apple stock (or precious metals, or a barrel of oil, etc) and buy groceries, and therefore not consider those assets currencies. But bitcoin? Isn't the primary reason for its existence to transact in a digital environment with the equivalency to cash? If there's no precedence to something like bitcoin, it seems like its classification should be accompanied by concise reasoning.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:33:21
Perhaps, but in the hierarchy of things, it is firstly a way to transact digitally with the equivalency of cash (even if it only has small amounts of value), that is to say you could easily transact 10,000 of them for a pizza, but it wouldn't be taken seriously as a store of value if that was it's worth. Only if the the marketplace assess significant value to bitcoin, can it then be seen seriously as a store of value. 
Anyway, it is something in its own category, as far as I know, and reasons should be explained very clearly before throwing an 17% VAT tax on it and significantly hurting its adoption.

Yeah, one of the confusing things about mining for me. On the one hand, the word "puzzle" is used as the thing you're trying to solve, and I associate the word "puzzle" with something 6-12 year olds do. But the result of solving the puzzle is called proof of work. So using the concept of "puzzle" and "work" for the same process was kind of confusing for me for a long time.

So as I understand it Segwit is one of the, if not the, most complex upgrades to bitcoin. And this group of miners and some businesses now want this complex upgrade to be led by this Jeff fellow, and a few other people who didn't have much to do with the design, development, and testing of Segwit? 
What am I missing here?
Is segwit actually a breeze to understand, update and maintain, and you can put in the hands of pretty much anyone, and it will be OK?

Bitcoin is  digital representation of cash, such as a $20 bill you may have in your wallet.
Bitcoin's digital representation of cash has many of the same properties as cash, i.e. many of bitcoin, and cash  properties overlap.
Bitcoin has some limitations that make it worse than cash.
Bitcoin also has some properties that are much more impressive than cash.
As people in the world find out more and more about bitcoin, they have come to the conclusion that the benefits of bitcoin's strengths, compared to cash, greatly outweigh the limitations, so much so that the value is being assessed at surprisingly non-zero prices.
In order to make a desirable digital representation of cash,such as bitcoin, and not a junky crappy digital representation of cash, such as other "cryptocurrencies", several difficult technical problems had to be solved.
I will tell you if you want to know more.

And now you can only buy 100 candy bars with that same $100? Those 20 extra candy bars were eaten away by your central bank's printing press. Now because the central banks ate so many candy bars from everyone in the country, they have to go to the dentist and may never eat solid food again. So bitcoin has come to save everyone and promises to let kids keep all their candy bars forever.

Since getting my first bit of BTC, the 5 best days for me personally have been:
1. The first day I received a w/d form a sportsbook in BTC
2. The day I created an Electrum wallet from a blockchain.info seed, and was therefore able to control the blockchain.info wallet using electrum. Wow, that was a great feeling!
3. The day I transferred some funds into my new Trezor. Looks like a bank account to me.
4. Meeting the very sweet Alice (Meeting Bob still on my bucket list)
5. The first day Electrum can support lightning payments. which means most moderately serious bitcoiners will be able to transact in peace, harmony and privacy.

Deposited some BTC, worked fine for a few weeks. Then one day the channel I was connected to (via their autopilot channel connection feature) status changed from "Open" to "Incative", and stayed that way for a few days. 
With no info available to me, I decided to force close the channel. A new channel funding transaction appeared shortly thereafter. But after a few days of being stuck in "Pending" state, I forced closed that 2nd channel as well.
 I am now trying to open a new channel (3rd one), with a new funding transaction. It's the 3rd day now, and the old channel (my 2nd channel) closing transaction is in "Waiting close" state, while the new channel transaction is "Pending open" state.

I thought a crash was when things sink so quickly there is little time to react and exit, like when BCH went form 0.5 to 0.2 BTC a few months back in less than a few minutes.
Anyone who felt uncomfortable about this pullback had plenty of time to get out at any % loss they wanted, most levels for several days, some levels you even had several chances to get out. Crash seems like too harsh and paints too negative a picture about BTC imo. I thought this pullback was orderly and everyone had plenty of opportunity to get out at any % level loss if they had the foresight to do so.

"The ‘Troika’ of creditors have agreed the final deposit levy on Cypriot accounts will be 47.5 percent for shareholders, bondholders, and depositors with more than 100,000 euro in the two largest banks."
And bitcoin rose from around $35 to $250, just like that.

Bitcoin is not "an exchange of private keys between parties", it is the transfer of units of digital scarcity (in this case, called bitcoin) from the owner of one private key to the owner of another private key (although the owner of both keys may be the same person). 
The digital scarcity, i.e. Bitcoin, is only created when a block is found and paid as a block reward, and from then on the bitcoin gets transferred from one private key to another private key,forever. The last thing anyone wants to do is exchange private keys with anyone else.

I think he does serious analysis by measuring bitcoin wallets, especially their lengths and widths (j/k enjoy listening to what he has to say)
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:43:40
He keeps asking micro-use questions, like, "what's better about using digital currency than the US dollar. Nothing! Therefore only criminals would use it" and nobody answers him in macro-economic terms, like the financial crises of 2008 and the near collapse of world economies would never have happened if an open decenrtralized digital currency like bitcoin had been in wide use.

I think ebliever is thinking on the lines of one good punch to the gut should make them think twice next time. If there's a POW change, consider how much lost revenue in not finding blocks, the need to design and manufacture new ASICs, reduction in sales as miners will now be more gun-shy about spending for new-algorithm ASIC if the threat of more POW changes can occur - can't imagine it would be too easy for a manufacturer to absorb that kind of blow and then immediately start with the power grabbing any time soon....basically no need for repeated hard-forks, one and done should send the message. Sure, security of the network is reduced, but the choice is between the lesser of evils, not between ice cream and cake.

This is an ELI5 thread, and many of these answers are for at least 10 year olds and up.
Can you be clearer for the 5 year olds?
If you opened a wallet, and you got a 12-24 word seed, are you good, regardless of what the wallet provider supports? For instance blockchain.info, if you got a 12 word seed when you opened your wallet there, (and can therefore move to another  wallet using the seed) does it matter whether they (in this case blockchain.info) support BIP 148 or not? It gets ELI10+ very quickly, somebody please write clearer. Thanks

Oh man, when BTC was at $14k and they were saying it's headed for $7500 we were all like...say WHAT, TA fools???....so I know exactly what you're talking about...NOT

But wouldn't it be the case, if 10 superior traders got ALL the stock of a company, say Apple, that would be great for them, as they would now own a $700 billion company, but if 10 superior traders got all the bitcoin, BTC would be worthless with a network of only 10 people? Will the greed of people trying to get all the bitcoin for themselves ultimately bring bitcoin down?

Went to BTC.com accelerator for the first time yesterday ( to try to help move a 0.0015 btc transaction. For $3 USD I could have bumped it up to 75% probability in 1 hour, 98% in 4 hours.
I guess you can Roger that as well.

Bitcoin cash is not the real bitcoin?
What's next?
The earth is not really shaped like a frisbee?
This is getting totally out of control.

I withdrew a bit of BTC from Poloniex yesterday, first BTC withdrawal in many months.
They charged me 0.0001 BTC fee (that is correct, 3 zeros after decimal point)
If I had sent BTC from my wallet with that fee, I'd probably have had to wait between inf to inf for a confirmation (see bitcoinfees.21.com)
Amazingly, my withdrawal was sent in the next block!
So, I gather one of two things is happening. Either Polo is only charging their customers a nominal fee at withdrawal, and then adding a HUGE amount to that, or, they have some sort of acceleration agreement with the large mining pools.
And if Polo has such an agreement, I'm guessing other exchanges do as well.
If so,  it seems it would be a bit difficult for them to support UASF, if it means risking such an agreement w/miners.
How'd I do?

Well I don't see this BCC as "free" cash, to me it is the offset between the current bitcoin price, and its true price, i.e. current BTC = 2500, + BCC = 100 (for example) =True BTC price of 2600.
If this BCC isn't available, we no longer have the market value for bitcoin and its offspring, until things settle down and the offspring goes away or is banished - maybe a long time from now.
Please stop calling it free money, and make our bitcoin funds, in whatever form they currently find themselves, easily available to us.

Is there a difference in censorship definition if the censorship takes places after something is written, or before something is written? If the President of bitcoin nixes something before it sees the light of day, is that considered censorship?

Will i be able to profitably mine on my laptop before next halving? Last coin I mined profitably on my laptop was BCN, turned 50 cents of electricity into $20 worth of crypto, baby! Longing for those days again.

"...and cannot main stability vs 2.6 million coins of minting over the prior 4 years." 
2014 thru 2017 was more like 4 million coins (25 BTC reward until mid 2016)

The bitcoin only has to be in one of these coin splitting exchanges for a few minutes, right? The exchange will take their snapshots around 12:20 UTC Aug. 1, then you can send your bitcoin back to where it came from right after. Unless the exchanges are exit scamming at
 say 12:30 UTC Aug. 1, or is there another legit worry I'm not aware of?

Who are the fish who have been backing these short positions from 20k down to 4k? Who are these endlessly deep pocketed people who have no problem losing gargantuan amounts for the past year (or are you betting against the CME's money?)? Just a little too fishy if you ask me, something stinks here. No one can be so eternally optimistic while handing their funds over to the short players....can they? Almost no question about it, there is some huge, and very questionable, money transferring going on here.

Possible reasons for overly depressed price. 1) Still way too hard for average person to buy and store, huge advantage leveraged shorters? 2) So easy to park BTC in stablecoins these days and buy back later, just a click of a button 3) Angry parents tired of kids whining that they didn't buy them BTC long ago joining shorting train so they can say " I told you so"? 4) Early adopters that couldn't resist cashing out life changing amounts of fiat this bull  market? 5) 4 million + coins mined since last bear market began need to find strong handed owners? 6) Party poopers who just plain hate bitcoin, I mean hate as in hating spinach hate, are now shorting away with the other poopers. Probably other reasons as well.

Seems huge for bitcoin. So I guess the price will drop about $400.

Market newbie here, but couldn't this be controlled somewhat with more short squeeeeeezing? The only real squeeze there's been all year is April 12, when the market went up over $1000 in a couple of hours. Wouldn't more of this behavior (with even more upwards force) have tamed the Bitmexers?

Do you mean exchanges lending out same bitcoin multiple times?

I have 3 separate blockchain.info wallets.
As a test, I took the seed from one of the blockchain.info wallets and created a new wallet in my Electrum wallet (version 2.8.2 - couldn't do it on version 2.6) - You can create/restore many separate wallets (different seeds) simultaneously on Electrum.
I was able to see my blockchain.info wallet account in the Electrum wallet, and was able to transact through the new electrum wallet I had just created. When I checked the original blockchain.info wallet, I could see the transaction I had just made through Electrum wallet there as well.
So  I can definitely control the wallet from either blockchain.info or electrum - for now.
But what if the network splits, and blockchain.info follows one chain, and electrum the other? I assume any transaction would be broadcast from that wallets node, so I would then have access to both chains, depending on which wallet I use (blockchain.info or Electrum with the same seed).
That's what logic seems to say, reality may be another story. Can anyone shed some light for us so we can be absolutely sure?
