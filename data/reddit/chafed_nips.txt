Bitcoin died the minute day traders got involved. They have deterred millions of investors by fluctuating the price and the massive sell offs. Bitcoin is dead. See you all when the next crypto takes off in a decade or so.

Where do I buy? I've tried to buy it off coin something but they couldn't varify my ID (I have a vertical ID, idk of that matters). Really frustrating because I was trying to buy a couple thousand worth back when it was under  $1200

This is the advice on the robinhood chat

Easier than expected 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:42:33
What I don't get is why people expect/want Bitcoin to start doubling over night again. It's not sustainable or realistic. I would much prefer Bitcoin to be a long term way of saving wealth. I plan to set up small automatic buys every pay period and forget about it.

Robinhood has no fees. You'll have to check in your country but it's free in the US. There's also a line so you can't buy for at least a few days. GDAX also doesn't have fees for certain types of orders, but I haven't used it yet. Coinbase rapes you with fees

Yeah if you look on Robinhood there's a list to buy bitcoin. I was 2.5 million Tuesday and now I'm 1.2 million in line. Do I get direct access if I get Gold membership?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:04:03
Boo hoo "I don't want to see 6k." Give me a fucking break. It's not magic, either everyone sells and it takes or we hold and it goes up. All you scared pussies are ruining the value.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:56:39
Look at how bitcoin recovered after the news that India/China banned the currency and that most banks won't allow crypto transactions on credit. If you think we're doomed to downswing then you're really not paying attention.

What's stopping it from stabilizing at 9000? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:46:09
They rationalize it by saying the coin could shift and they take a risk, but I bet they're just slimming off the top.

3 Years from now I'm going to buy a house with my .5 BTC

@_date: 2018-02-09 00:51:25
I'm still new to the crypto game so I'm stuck with coinbase and their ridiculous fees. I'm waiting on Robinhood but they don't let me own the coin. Is Binance a good alternative?
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:35:42
Everyone needs to stop reacting so sharply to these trends. Everyone is trying to make money, but these fluctuations make Bitcoin unstable. Ironically, its being rejected and losing so much value because it fluctuates so much. You're not making money by day trading and you're not out smarting the swings. Only invest discretionary income. HOLD!!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:08:09

It's going to go back up you tards
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:45:13
Massive drop out of no where.. Is that just a massive whale buying at 8PM and then selling at 2:30PM today? Anyone have an analysis of the buy/sell orders today?!

Fuck coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:25:12
I think another big drop would destroy investor confidence. Which would make a strong rebound to 10k+ less likely. Bitcoin seems to have stabilized over the last two days. This could be a new era of bitcoin, less massive swings and more stability.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:52:26
LOL @ all the idiots selling off in the middle of a huge upswing
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:06:30
I don't think so. First comment is right though, we're in new territory. However, over a million people are waiting to buy bitcoin on Robinhood. Which might cushion the Chinese/India sell off (if they sell off).

9000 LET'S GOOOOO
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:27:49
I would much prefer a slow increase to these wild fluctuations. Bitcoin would become a nicer long term holder of wealth
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:25:05
I think relying on cycles will cost you if you're trading with % fees
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:25:55

@_date: 2018-04-04 15:28:46
Lol how naive can you get?
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:08:24

@_date: 2018-04-05 05:29:59
Whoever buys the bitcoin takes on the risk of the volatility. (For example, the store isn't taking the risk because their instantly converting $22.71 worth of bitcoin).

The facts are that the progressive movement is being crushed by the establishment. Either you're with us or you're against us. There really isn't a middle ground when it comes to the elitist agenda, brother.
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:46:11
Also, this is good news in a way. There's nothing suppressing the price except skewed media coverage and some whales working together to create a lot of sale orders. Bitcoin is ready to bounce back once people realize this.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:24:46
I don't sleep right unless bitcoin dips hard. Good night gents
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:44:56

@_date: 2018-04-01 20:50:21
Yeah but since it went over your head, I guess I'll just let you know that you're a tool.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:25:16
Absolutely hold. Wait a year, 3 yeaes, hell even 10 years. Maybe then you can buy a lambo. If you don't believe in it then don't buy more but I wouldn't be hesitant to eat a loss when it'll bounce back to at least 9k+ in the next few months
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:47:14
Just sit on your coin for 10 years. Stop stressing about daily, weekly or monthly fluctuations. Also wire me 10k pls lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:33:00
I think one of the biggest pieces of evidence supporting a cartel is that bogus story that came out in February with all the other Bitcoin badnews about China cracking down on Bitcoin. I think that was a big contributor to the huge sell offs that happened in the beginning of February. I could be wrong, this is my opinion and if anyone has sources backing or arguing against me, please share.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:45:25
Who shorts under 8k lol?
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:48:40
Just buying Bitcoin really isn't enough to raise the price at this point. We need to come together as a community so that we can educate the public on block-chain, lobby our governments for fair taxes laws on cryptocurrencies, and develop payment methods for regular purchases. If we could start using Bitcoin as an actual currency, instead of a stock, then we'd see a lot more adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:41:30
Yeah but I did recommended my girlfriend to RH. Days after she signed up and deposited $100 I moved for 2.5million on the list to 1 million, about a month later I was given access.

@_date: 2018-04-17 06:31:39
What the fuck does taxable transaction mean? So every time I have a slight gain I have to pay taxes on it? Does that mean I get to write off every time I sold at a massive loss?

@_date: 2018-04-29 18:48:19
Do you consider DNC emails "classified"? If they are then should they be? When the current DNC administration is abusing their positions of power and "right to privacy"? The DNC and RNC should not be operating and making secret deals behind closed doors. This is a democracy, and if we can't even decide who runs for President then it's a mute election. You can argue that the RNC and the DNC are private parties but if they're abusing that privilege then we should make them public organization's.

My girlfriend just got laid off today. She graduated in December, was hired in February, and got laid off today. She got laid off because she made the mistake of becoming an American teacher. She got laid off because Trump wanted to cut 8 billion from education. Trump got elected because he was up against a weak candidate. He was against a weak candidate because the DNC FUCKED BERNARD SANDERS OUT OF THE NOMINATION. We could have student loan forgiveness, increased social spending, a close to two centuries of perpetual war. BUT YOU WANT ME TO BLAME A JOURNALIST FOR POSTING THE STORY? Please, kindly, go fuck yourself with a cactus.

That's where bitcoin needs to go. Some technology, like a bitcoin debit card, needs to be developed that can either cheaply convert the coin to whatever currency the vendor uses or have the vendor accept the coin as payment. That's where I can see crypto going to the moon

Who sold out our country? They published a story about how a corporate shill stole the primary away from a populist who would have ended student debt, guarantee healthcare, and ended several of our wars.

There's a lot of false information from the cartel that's deterring old and new investors. That's why the price isn't rising.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:09:21
I agree with you about how what he did was criminal because our laws are designed to support those in power. However, I think he did it for the right reasons. They stole the nomination from Sanders, brother, and gave us Trump. Now they want us to blame those who told us the truth? I respect you and your opinion but I have to disagree.

I think a lot of us have lost site of the big picture. Short term up swings and downswings shouldn't determine if you jump ship and sell. Where is bitcoin going to be in 2022? 2030?
