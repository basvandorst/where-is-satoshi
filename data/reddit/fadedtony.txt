My thought process was, at what point in the price increase do you see it going complete nuclear where you're compelled to buy. Does that make sense? 
Like if it keeps going up and up and think wow maybe I'm waiting for dip that won't come, let me buy.
I just used 14,000 as a superficial marker for being that time

I'm waiting for $14000s before I start hammer buying 
Edit: added an extra 0

Nice! I tried to buy in at 15,900 but coinbase let me down :(

Honestly this needs to be stickied. 
Lot of new buyers coming in (which is great) and what you are talking about is one of the golden rules of btc that all buyers should be aware of. 
I only have about $50 worth of btc that I have on an exchange and am looking to buy a ledger this week before I buy up more 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:40:05
I bought too soon at 16,400 and price dropped to 15,500 15 min later smh 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:02
In your opinion, at what point would you take btc out of the exchange? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:58
Thank you Reddit CEO 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:06:45
So you only file if you've had btc for over a year? What if you never take it out of an exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:44
Nice! Good buys, I got in around the same time as you at 7,900. Good luck fellow hodler
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:47:47
Same here looking for a good time to buy, at which point would you just jump in? 14,000? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:56:04
No I think I read somewhere on here it's a famous typo of "hold" and it's now a running joke or something like that

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:49
I don't lol context?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:45
Awesome thank you so much for the detailed analysis. And depending on the exchange it usually costs money to transfer to your wallet I'm assuming? 
Also you are able to make purchases with the wallet as well?
