Wow wow wow slow down man, "uncovered shorts", "hedging", "stuff going to zero overnight", "options" let alone "collared options" etc... People here have no idea what you're talking about, they have 10% of the financial literacy of goldbugs, barely understand macro economy, monetary policy or even the basics of trading (margins, stops, etc). Leave them alone with HODL, FUD and BANKSTERS lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:25:56
Value of BTC is sub 1k
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:24:38
Not a hill u want to die on.   
BTC (and the other coins) are a just and old school scam, u won't be the first nor the last to be ruined by classic pump and dump
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:26:15
Sub 1k
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:27:58
Absolutely wrong.
Won't even pass as a decent goldbug comment on a zerohedge article circa 2011
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:15:35
LOL the "pump &amp; dump" market manipulation works the other way   
1. Acquire asset  
2. Pump the price on low volume, using techniques that would get you in jail in any regulated market : insider trading, spoofing, wash trading, tape painting, ... the limit is you imagination you can do anything in these "markets"   
3. Greedy future bagholders inject real money during stratospheric rise, while scammers start unloading.  
4. Shit keeps climbing, and is manipulated into not correcting too much to give the time to scammers to unload all their holding at inflated price.   
5. When they're done it's just bagholders staring at each other wandering why did it stop climbing exactly when they got in.   
6. Capitulation, rush to exits, shit overshoots downside to pre1 levels.  
We're between phase 4 &amp; 5 in the scam, act accordingly
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:41
Or really the time to get out. It may be already too late actually. The exchanges could go belly up and you wouldn't be able to withdraw your balance
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:38
Technical analysis is just a clutch.   
If you're into charts you should know what most of them tell about parabolic rises...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:59:47
I think 300$
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:16:34
Not dip, it's crash from delusional valuations, it will probably overshoot below cost of extraction, return to 500$ very possible
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:22
The levels of delusion

Fundamental analysis + Experience + Dozens of red flags
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:36
Do you understand that this cannot keep going indefinitely. Look at the chart of a martingale.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:58
Yes for real.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:14:45
Bitfinex seems to be also near death.
USDT margin lost 35%
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:38
I think it'll crash below 1k
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:13:21
No. Price is going below 1000$
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:23
We're in the delusion phase

This is the same kind of delusional talk peddled by goldbugs during silver/gold hyperinflationista hype. That's the lowest form of understanding of macroeconomy and monetary policy. But you all convincing yourselves that experts who know all tortuous ways markets loot the "unsophisticated investors" are just defending the old order and the banksters when they warn that BTC is such an obvious bubble  
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:34:54
Blockchain is an interesting technology but nothing earth shattering. Decentralization AND centralization have both their advantages. All the rest is ideology and pipe dreams.
And certainly nothing justifies the present valuations: for instance BTC price shouldn't be too far from the cost of extracting it (&lt;1000$) that is if ppl keep being interested in BTC at all, otherwise it'll drop to pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:00
It's a scam
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:26:40
Your wife is smarter than you
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:56:26
More like classic scam "pump &amp; dump"
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:18:54
I agree it's surprising. Means that scammers need to keep the retreat to be coordinated so they can unload the rest to muppets averaging down or buying dips
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:10:33
Good point. People and companies took loans for this BS, it could trigger a domino effect.
Most obvious answer is probably seedy asian companies who gambled on BTC.
Do you have any idea what to short ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:24:28
You could see it for miles away. 
Scammers already out, tiny exit for bagholders, it'll end in tears.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:13
None taken, maybe it'll recover and go to 40k but the endgame is always near extraction costs ... or pennies. This is how ponzis work. And I feel that we reached peak "greater fool"
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:56:00
Other coins are worse, they should go to zero. The saving grace of BTC is that it's backed by something (an economy of sorts)  
Like I said I never had any sort of speculative position on coins, but given how you are stubborn here it gives me the idea that I should short the shit out of this into oblivion. I d gladly short it to you at 10k which is at least ten times too expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:30:37
yes 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:34
Many of internet giants like facebook used open source technology to build their success. You need to find the company that will create a huge market (or disrupt an existing one) with blockchain.   
So far it's an elusive task despite thousands of very smart people working on it. IMO it won't be related to payments and currencies.    
Yes blockchain is elegant and smart tech, but we don't really have uses where it's more convenient and cheaper than legacy technologies.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:52:24
Regarding point 4: yes and no.  
Governments have no reason to let smth like BTC drain money away from them. They will create virtual money of their own, BTC will stay as a "collectible", and be valued for it's pioneering and nostalgia values.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:19
Sup bro. How you're doing with all those cheap coins at 11-12k ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:44:02
Famous bagholder quote
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:52:06
Yes you're right. 
The tech will be used but not btc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:48:23
People like you don't understand that we already peaked. No more muppets to buy into the ponzi. Who will buy ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:27:39
It's a fallacy to think the future will be like the past. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:52:12
I hope you didn't buy at 12k
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:31:45
Futures were introduced so that whales can unload their massive holdings.

How are you doing now
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:33:00
Good luck. You wouldn't listen.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:29:23
I first posted here in december trying to strike some sense in "unsophisticated" investors. They all laughed at me.   
If I convinced at least one of them to get out I'm happy, good for my karma.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:47:02
Anybody who knows a bit about markets will tell you that a peak is reached when your shoeshiner or bartender jumps in and starts giving you stock/coin tips.    
These are the greater fools you're looking for to unload your crap at insane valuations, and that point was reached in december 2017. We won't see anything like that for 10 years at least.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:56
So much delusion. The grind down will be painful for you. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:02:03
Disingenuous people come here to say "u shouldn't invest more than 5% of your capital".    
The reality is that the majority who are sucked in by this scam don't have capital at all to invest in such speculative venture, or no capital at all. Paycheck to paycheck or even on borrowed money.    
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:13:15




Doesn't add up
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:43:02
You're delusional if you think pros and institutionals want to hold any of these coins.   
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:45:06
A lot of inefficiencies make arbitrage between market costly I guess. To make prices converge you'd have to sell big amounts on one exchange and buy the same amounts on the other. You would also need to move bitcoins and usd between these exchanges seamlessly. Not the case right now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:58:20
That's what I said 6 weeks ago. People laughed at me here. I hope I convinced a couple of them and saved them from ruin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:50:33
OK your loss
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:37
There are actually people who know better and have seen manias/ponzis play out in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:18
Sensible strategy if (and that's a big IF) your analysis that it'll go higher is right.    
Personally I don't think so, I've been saying for the past 2 months that it's going sub 1k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:24:20
Not mocking you. But serious ppl don't put money in virtual coins.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:47:20
Stocks are a piece of a company doing real business in the real world. OTOH coins are a piece of code giving you rights to... nothing ?

You're out of your depth.  
Source: I worked for the kind of institutions that move tens of billions each day. The tech angle sold by cryptocultists will not be the revolution advertised.

Not so much overgeneralization but mostly wishful thinking.   


You're not the only one from 2013, that's the problem with you people. Actually there are a lot of people from 2013, 2008, 2001, 1999, 1996, 1987, etc. There is a trove of past evidence to draw from but you all keep saying that with bitcoin "this time it's different". It's only different in the eye of the beholder, and this bias peaked in december 2017. There will be never as much positive coverage and enthusiasm, actually the opposite (with all the scams and personal bankrupties). Regulations and taxations will reduce drastically the drive to operate bitcoin.    
Your rosy scenario rests on the hypothesis that everything will stabilize and banks will operate and legitimize bitcoin. That's a HUGE LEAP OF FAITH. I know banks and institutions, they're not interested at all in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:26:23
Fundamental value of BTC is around 1k
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:32
Not how it works it will overshoot on the downside and stay there for a long time. The bottom will not feel like a buying opportunity at all...
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:32
Ok I must be the idiot
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:26
Then it will go back sub 1k when normies were out of the picture
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:52:43
But people keep conflating the two when they talk about their confidence in the underlying technology. Having coins is not like investing in a company with a promising technology. If the tech succeeds and the company you bought in is part of it, you will reap rewards. But coins ?
