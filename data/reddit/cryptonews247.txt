I live in Georgia, we are sitting around our state of the art self adjusting smart charging conference table located 30+ stories up in an Atlanta luxury business building discussing crypto and smart contracts. We would like to extend a sincere merican redneck fuk you

I read this out loud in a “Lord of the Rings/GOT” voice.

If you give them $50 and in a few years it increase to several thousand and they sell, will you be then one responsible for the realized tax gains? Since you made the purchase via your Coinbase?

Thinking more on this, kinda just using OP as an example. In your opinion does the responsibility to “keep up with” /“activity seek” the cost basis fall on the donee or donor. For instance, would the responsibility fall  on the donor to include a cost basis (purchase price and all other relevant invest info) with the gift or would it be the donee’s responsibility to request that information as they would need it whenever they report the gains on there taxes (possibly years/decades later? I’m purely speculating on a “what if” BTC hit $1,000,000 scenario. I feel like all this would become very relevant information. Thanks in advance for any information contributed. 
Side note: Not trying to call out OP and not necessarily trying to play Devils advocate, just genuinely interested in this.

I misinterpreted, my apologies. However, I’m still wondering. He’s gonna have that “buy” on his Coinbase records, i know it’s unlikely however if audited, he will have to show the IRS all “trails” of where the investment went IE his friends. Therefore, he is setting his friends up for a possible major tax event in the future (depending on the price), possibly unknowingly to them.  But he obviously doesn’t care so....I’m just curious 
Edit: not trying to be overly critical guy. Just seeing a lot of these “ I gave my friends/family crypto gifts”. Just wondering if these people are also taking the time to explain the legal/tax side of the gift, not that I’m advising this, just genuinely curious. It would be similar to dumping a 401K on someone and being like “Happy Birthday and good luck!”
