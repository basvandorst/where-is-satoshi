This is why I got rid of all most all my bitcoin cash.  Bitcoins main spokesperson antanoupolos is positive towards almost any direction bitcoin takes.  And now i see Lopp doing the same.  I had to also unsubscribe to r/btc because Ver seems to spread contamination to his community.  I believe there is enough money out there waiting to be put into any good project.   But if you substitute an opportunity to boast about your project with denigrating your competition, you not only look desperate, but you lose credibility.

I don’t like this. 
1.  If officials are forced to do it.  The people are gunna be forced to do it.  In the US we have an antiterrorism and money laundering bill that was introduced into congress.  It states that all citizens should reveal all vehicles in which one keeps their money.  The only reason why it’s not getting any attention is because rich people who lobby our politicians want to hide their money. 
2.  Maybe people who get into cryptocurrency speculation should be more careful when panic buying/selling.  I knew bitcoin was way over priced when it was $13,000-$19,000 usd.  I think everyone did.  I just HODLed and I never lost my position.  
It can be tough to newcomers who bought in really high.  But if you bought high, you probably believe in Bitcoin therefore you should be thinking long term.  It’s not a get rich quick scheme.

@_date: 2018-01-01 17:52:37
Well sure.  But that person who gave you the bitcoin acquired it from an exchange.  If they want to assume tax liability for you then, there is no problem.  Unless you cash out via exchange.  Then you assume taxes.
If you sell it under the table again then you are in the clear from assuming any taxes.  But say you made $10,000 from holding that bitcoin and you go out and buy stuff, you will set off massive red flags.
If you are making $100-$1000 I don’t think the government would give 2 shits.  But if you start trading under the table for 5 digit figures, someone will figure it out.

I'm not trying to debate wether Bitcoin will ever capture dominance again, that is highly speculative.  I tell all my newcomer friends that bitcoin may not be the king forever, I still believe in it for now.  But I'm skeptical.

I’d like to add. That it would be bad for cryptocurrency if Bitcoin ever got overtaken.  I’m invested in alts too, but especially bitcoin.  If something were to make bitcoin obsolete, what sideline investor would put money into cryptocurrency?  There needs to be a safe bet that old stock investors can hang their hat on without being up all night staring at a computer screen.  Bitcoin is good for every cryptocurrency, even bitcoin cash.

I have a little in many others. I'm not saying there isn't great new tech coming every day.  I'm saying people who avoid Bitcoin and get burned, throw conniption fits on social media when Bitcoin goes on huge spikes.  I think Bitcoin is about to moon again and you'll see what I'm talking about.  It has been that way for the past 2 years.  Maybe there was a time before that where people didn't hate on Bitcoin so much, but I wasn't aware of it then.

I think the hardest “is bitcoin a currency” obstacle to overcome, is loans.  Either you have bitcoin or you don’t.  How do you take out a loan in Bitcoin to buy a house?  And if you were able to.  How would you pay it off?  If you took out a $1000 loan last year you’d need to pay back $10,000 today.  Maybe someday it will be mass adopted and stabilize.  But until that happens it’s going to be hard to use it as a substitute for currency.
But as to OP receiving it for Work especially how low it is at the moment.  Congrats, if you can afford to HODL it for a bit.

Say down the road the government ever passes that money laundering law and we have to give up our keys.  You hold your HODL stash  in one wallet and say I can’t find it anywhere, if the authorities ever show up.  And you hand the small stash that you trade.  Then when you want to cash out you say.  Oh shit I found it.  Report it and cash out.  
Also it’s good to split your money up Incase anything were to happen you won’t lose everything.  
Some of us bitcoin holders in America are super paranoid about our government trying to fuck shit up.  They may not be able to shut down bitcoin but there’s other ways they can come down on It.  We are still the global reserve currency holders and bitcoin is starting to look like a threat.

I understand that there are a ton of people that are completely new to cryptocurrency and don’t do their research, then get burned when they try to use bitcoin as cash.  But I see veterans posting about how they get burned which is either to spread FUD or lack of doing their research.  Use fiat. If you wanna make transactions until there is a coin that can do what you need.  Sell your Bitcoin if you hate it or STFU.

This Christmas people will be flooding the market with young dumb money kind of how I got in the game.  I bought my first bitcoin at $420 to hedge against my stocks.  Once the price started rising I started researching more and more.  If the environment in cryptocurrency was as hostile as it is now I would have not invested another dime.  But the ecosystem was really encouraging.  Now if you bring up Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash on any social media platform people on both sides start frothing at he mouth.
My goal isn’t to get rich quick, it’s to introduce my whole family and all of my friends to cryptocurrency, and continue to help people from all over the world to have a chance to change the world.  If we work together we can make cryptocurrency not only useable, but possibly the next global reserve currency.  We aren’t going to progress nearly as fast or even at all if everyone is this divisive.

There are tons of coins better than bitcoin and bitcoin cash and I highly doubt either of these coins will ever be used as a currency.  But someday something will come along and I will buy that when it happens.  For now cryptocurrency is not good for everyday purchases, especially in my country, the taxes alone would be a nightmare.  So I use them for speculation only, and so do most people.  You are in the minority of people actually using these coins as a currency right now.

I’ve been a HODLer of bitcoin for a few years now, and I’m doing great.  I never trade it, I still think it’s gunna go up quite a bit until something better gets mass adopted.  But I believe the blockchain will revolutionize our money system, it may not be bitcoin but it will be something like it.  I didn’t buy Roth IRAs to trade.  I bought them to Forget about.  I think there are a lot of people like me left in Bitcoin that see a bright future.  These corrections can be scary for a lot of people especially the one who have over invested.  But getting a tiny foot in the door in the cryptocurrency world, is something I encourage people who are looking into investment ideas.

The US government can legally seize your assets in times of war or social decline.  If our country goes into a recession, our house, bank account, retirement funds and much more can be taken.  Bitcoin has always been a way out because we control it.  If the government knows we have bitcoin, Monero, whatever, how much and where.  They can come after that too.  
This bill worries me.  But I highly doubt it has any support of the house or senate.  Think of all the huge campaign donors who have money offshores or stored in cryptocurrency.  I highly doubt the people pulling the strings want any part of this bill.

I used to loved bitcoin when I got involved.   2 years ago, it was almost free and instant.  But now that it is the standard of trading, bitcoin is super slow and expensive.  This will happen to any coin that becomes as big as bitcoin.  Litecoin, bitcoin cash now take 20plus minutes for confirmations during spikes.  4 days ago I tried to send litecoin from my Trezor to Bittrex and it took so long over 30 minutes, I had to go to work and couldn’t trade it.  Imagine if they were used as much as bitcoin?  But they are still way cheaper.  So what bitcoin cash and litecoin would do if they ever became as big as bitcoin is, they would allow people to pay large fees to have their transactions initiate faster.  Roger Ver was asked the question 3 days ago on MSNBC “how will he address the scaling issue when bitcoin cash increases its load to the point of bitcoin.  He dodged it by calling bitcoin slow and expensive.  I haven’t heard how Charlie Lee plans to solve the issue of scaling if litecoin were to process 7X as many transactions per day.  But I have heard Bitcoin core discuss the need for litghning network.  It sounds really easy for people to hack, so I’m skeptical.   I don’t know what coin will ever be used as the next Global reserve but I do believe the blockchain will take over the money supply.   so I tell everyone to diversify and understand the market or get left behind.  And keep your finger on the pulse in this crazy market.

Basically nobody uses cash anymore.  We send money back and forth on cash apps. And we scan our phones and credit cards to buy goods.  Bitcoin has tons of support and developers working 24/7 to support the network.  The Bitcoin blockchain is very sturdy and proving more and more challenging to hack.

No problem ask any questions you want.  I don’t mind answering publicly either.  
From what I know.  (My computer knowledge is very limited, so I may be saying things wrong)
    The business was hit with Ransomware because their internal server was hacked.  And ransomware disabled all of their business files causing them to close their business.  The hacker demanded Bitcoin and would give them the passwords to unlock the ransomware.  
    That’s where I came in.  I am the only one they knew that had Bitcoin.  I hurried over there and paid their ransom within a few minutes around 6:00 PM pacific time.  And then I left.  
   My friends texted me the next morning saying that the hacker kept their end of the bargain and sent the info they needed to unlock their business files.  It took several days for their IT guy to unlock everything but they got 95-99% of their files and they could open shop again.
    They learned a lesson: always back up your files offline in case all of your saved data gets compromised.  They had not backed up their files online for 11 months.
From what I’m assuming:  the hackers were from another country, because they would communicate early in the morning until about 3:00pm which tells me they go home and go to sleep at that time.  So there was nothing the FBI could do.  Also this was not a very big business and the ransom was NOT in the 6 figures area.  So I’m guessing these international hackers are going after small businesses, with barely any IT or understanding of security.  And they are asking for reasonable ransoms that can actually be paid.
If you have other questions I will answer to my best ability.  It really sucks that this happens, but it was a learning experience for me. And everyone I knew with a small business I called to tell them how important taking seriously IT and making backups  is.

I think bitcoin has exploded to the point that most people are leaving it out of their portfolio. (It's too expensive) They spread FUD to scare people away from Bitcoin and move toward coins they are invested in.  Hype via Social media is a huge decider on what happens to coins right now.  Honestly when everyone was freaking out about Neo at $4.00 I bought a bunch before I even had a chance to read about it.  Same with Ark.   it worked for me.  However I will never sell my bitcoin.

I was horribly untech savvy.  I threw $418 in a little over a year ago and bought my first bitcoin, and forgot about it, until I saw it on the news at $1800 a few months ago.  I started researching everything I could, and got into other cryptocurrencies through Bittrex and started investing more and more and researching more and more.  My curiosity caused me to get tech savvy.  I got my mom in, my brother in, and several friends in.  I even bought a bunch of shares before the coin split for Christmas presents for my family members that aren't following bitcoin (YET).  Now I have a circle of people calling me daily and showing an interest in this phenomenon.  Yes there is a lot of tech that needs to be learned, but when you start seeing massive profits, educating yourself seems to take over your free time.

If you are a US citizen, you might research Capitol Gains tax in Puerto Rico.  Buy some land there and cash out.  I think I heard a while back there is zero capitol gains.
Also maybe buy a farm in the midwest somewhere, Farmers can write a lot of money off for farm equipment, it might offset your capital gains losses.  then sell the farm.
I'm really Naive when it comes to tax law, but these are things I have read about in the past few years due to people asking these questions in 2017.
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:30:58
The federal reserve prints money for a lot of reasons.  Yes to replace old money.  But also to keep the cost of the dollar low so that we can pay our loans off at a lower cost to us and so we stay competitive with foreign markets.  Every country prints money to devalue currency so that they can make more money selling goods.  Also we recently started something called quantitative easing, where the central bank will buy financial assets/bonds from commercial banks to increase liquidity.  This leads to lower interest rates with increases the money supply.   Also Americans already went through a Great Depression where the dollar was worthless.  And today several other countries like Venezuela have hyper inflated their currency so much that a million Bolivars 4 years ago is worth 16 Bolivars today.  Hyperinflation happens so fast and the people that made it through had diversified in things like gold.  An asset that cannot be printed out to make more.
That leads us to Bitcoin, you can not ever make extra Bitcoin.  21 million Bitcoins is all there will ever be.   There are currently 17,530,000 or so bitcoin in circulation, in the year 2040 the last bitcoin (21 millionth) will be mined.  That is the whole point of Bitcoin.  To protect us against the fraudulent monetary system.  You should read the white pages, it’s awesome.

Hey I bought my first bitcoin when it was at around $425ish.  I didn’t know anything either.  Just needed to diversify and already maxed out a Roth IRA.  
But over the years I have done lots of research and I continue to learn.  People can hate all they want but you made a decision and it’s yours to keep.
I would suggest 1st looking into hardware storage wallet like the (ledger nano) or the (Trezor).  Learn how to transfer your bitcoin  to and from your new wallet.  Never send a large chunk of bitcoin to a new address that hasn’t been tested.  I always send a small amount then make sure I can send it back, before transferring a large amount of bitcoin.
Also try and read the white pages and listen to all the Andreas Antonopoulos videos you can.  
If you need help there are always people on here that can lead you in a good direction.  Just be careful, there are a few dip shits as well.
Cheers and good luck.

A lot of governments including the US government can legally seize your assets(bank accounts, property, retirement funds, precious metals, IRA, 401ks, etc) without you even committing a crime or in times of economic collapse.  Bitcoin would be not only impossible for them to steal (if private keys are kept hidden), but it’s worth would sky rocket if the economy started to collapse.  
Also they can ban the exchanges but they cannot ban the amount you already posses.  Say I had 6 bitcoin and they closed the exchanges.  I can just keep it and consider myself one of the lucky ones to HODL until I have enough to travel somewhere to pull it out, or research a way to get around the exchange ban, like most Chinese people are doing.

That’s a good idea.  I feel for your girlfriend.  I lost $1000+ on the NXT/Jelurida ICO and followed the rules made by the developers, almost to a Tee.  It was pretty discouraging at first, but I chalked it up to a learning experience.
I understand that the nature of blockchain being open sourced is going to have tons of scammers trying to fool people.  But there has to be some way to make it safer.  I’m not a CS major, but I like your idea.

Mt Gox was the biggest and one of the only exchanges back then.  Most people held all their money on Mt Gox because there weren’t many storage options available, and people didn’t really see the need for taking bitcoin off an exchange.  After the CEO “supposedly” stole billions of dollars of Bitcoin from people.  The price plummeted.  The CEO is on trial right now for this event.  And since then most people just use exchanges to buy and sell bitcoin but keep it secured in tons of the different style wallets available.  Also consumer confidence has gone back up, knowing that there is justice happening.  Bitcoin is traceable and the governments around the world especially the us government and the SEC are making laws to watch out for things like cyber criminals and ICOs.  Also there are tons of different exchanges out there and most CEO/employees of these companies are seeing what happens when you steal.

You have to keep in mind net neutrality only affects Americans.  We are only about 30% of the trading volume.  Same as China was when their country regulated ICOs and fiat exchanges.  Bitcoin dipped for a week or so, but it rebounded like crazy.  If the US government or US Banks try something silly, it won’t have much of an impact.  I’ll for sure HODL through it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:25:18
The way I understand it is: it’s not buying stock in Bitcoin, it’s buying stock in a company that offers futures.  People either buy stocks long or short.  So people can gain from a short, by bitcoin going down in price, and they can gain from a long, if it goes up in price.   wether bitcoin goes up or down, as long as people are buying futures in these companies, their stock will raise.  But I could be mistaken.  I’m actually wondering how futures Work myself.  Thought someone else here would know.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:54:08
Yeah.  I had to pony up over $50,000 when I bought 600 bitcoin last week.  But I made it back the next afternoon.  My advice don’t send it to a wallet, keep it on the exchange, it’s too expensive.

I graduated with my associates in 2018 and was an intern for the county government for the past 2 years making $20/hour.  Tomorrow I start my new job in the private sector making $25/hour as a tech.  
It’s like engineering but not nearly as much math.  after 4 years of education/experience you can take your first test LSIT, doesn’t mean much, but you are competent enough to be a party chief which makes $25-$40 an hour sometimes more depending on the job plus all the benefits.  After 6 years you can take your final test the PLS, which gives you a license and a ton of responsibility.  You can pull in $100,000 here in Washington state if you have your own business or lead a firm. But it will generally take a little more experience than 6 years.  There is a lot to learn as far as understanding and interpreting property laws.  
The average surveyor is about 67 years old and there are not enough young people to fill the gaps.  Nobody knows it exists or what it is.  But as land prices go up so does the value of a survey.
Surveying is basically measuring the land, you need to know trigonometry even though the machines do most of the work for you.  When I worked for the county we did a lot of different types of jobs.  I could be in a kayak measuring the sea floor, measured the scouring around bridges, staked roads and sidewalks for construction, searched for survey monuments and preserved them.  Located and marked people property boundaries.  Measured the topography of the localized chunks of land so engineers could design future infrastructure.  I loved it.
But I just got a new job which does mostly logging contracts I will be walking in the deep woods all day treasure hunting for ancient survey monuments and parceling out land.  I will most likely not get GPS in the woods so I will need to cut lost of brush and tree branches in order for my total station to shoot a laser to a prism, so that I can measure property boundaries for the logging companies that way they know where they can log or plant new trees.  
It’s all very new to me still so I’m sure there is a ton I’m missing or am wrong about, but I love being outside and I can not imagine myself being as happy in any other job as I am right now.  I would advise anybody who is interest just call up 10 local land surveying firms and say you are interested in starting a new career.  They are generally desperate and are willing to teach you the ins and outs.  You must have a good work ethic.  There is a lot of pounding hubs and lath into the ground and brushing out blackberries.  Also you need to carry heavy equipment up and down hills while getting stung by the occasional bee.

I’m 41  I was a short order cook for 20 years, rode my bike because I couldn’t afford to keep a car running.  I was about $10,000-$13,000 in debt.  I got an inheritance of $100,000 in 2015 which is almost gone now.  Paid my debt, maxed out a few Roth IRAs, put 20% down on a home, bought a cheap but reliable car, took a vacation (hiked the PCT), got an associates degree at a community college, got an awesome job in land surveying, and bought some bitcoin which I have completely HODLed.
All of this in 4 years with $100,000.  If bitcoin can take you to that magic number you can change your life.  You don’t need a million bucks to be happy, sure I have to work still, but I love my job which is basically treasure hunting in the woods all day.  And I’m happy.

You’re probably right on.  Judging by the recent correction percentages we’ve had in the past, that would be a good estimate.

And I don’t see it diving down to sub $5000 if that happens.  But we will see.

Totally disagree.  Around December 2016 I put equal amounts of money in the US stock market and bitcoin.  Since then I’m up 20% with stocks/bonds and about 1500% with cryptocurrency mostly bitcoin.  But with stocks I notice very little fluctuation maybe a 2 or 3% change per month.  With bitcoin I notice I can be up 100% in a week and the next day I’ll be down 50%.  If that’s not the definition of volatility then I don’t know what is.  However, If I had invested everything in bitcoin I’d be waaaaaay richer.  But I would have stress hemorrhoids the size of Australia.

Somebody on here had a really good idea a few years ago.  Instead of storing your seed in your safe.  You take a sheet of metal and use a cheap set of metal stamps to engrave your seed on the metal.  Then dip it in plastisil which will coat the metal and hide the seed.  Then bury it in your crawl space or garden.
But this is only necessary if you are a crazy conspiracy theorist who thinks the government would seize your private property.  Your safe would be the first thing they would go for.

I know, I lost a lot of money in the stock market recently, and my Home keeps losing money in a city that’s growing at 6%.  We are back to mortgage back securities, relaxed mortgage standards, and low sub-prime interest rates.  It’s as though my government didn’t learn anything from 2008. 
But history has shown the US economy is still a very stable investment.  But I’m worried about more than just a crash I’m also worried about our geopolitical position in the world right now.   Maybe OP wants to move to another country?  I would most certainly like to have the ability to try.

I used to say Bitcoin was speculative but After I heard Martin Shkreli talk about primary and secondary markets, I just got more confused.  I read a lot of interesting articles about how to tell the difference between Speculation and Investments.  But to be honest I don't know the difference.  I used to think it was just volatility and time.  But when does a speculation become an investment?  For instance I own a home in a country where the housing market just crashed a few years back.  Banks are allowing still using the same methods of looking past peoples credit to sell homes and I think its due for another crash, I just don't know when.  Is my house an investment or a speculation?  Same thing with stocks, I believe with our current Geopolitical stance in the world the Dow Jones is due for a massive correction.  I can't prove it, but I believe its true.  Am I speculating when I buy stocks?  
    The only thing that I do know, is that I'm not going to call people out for not knowing the difference between speculation and investments.  that's just trolling.  I will let them call it what they want.  I do know a few things.  Bitcoin is super volatile.  But I have made 1000% more in just the fast few years investing in Bitcoin then my house.  and almost 2000% more than my stock investments.  I have done my research and I understand Bitcoin enough to feel safe.  I really don't think it will ever crash and I am pretty sure it will be used as a utility in the near future.  I'm going to continue Speculating/Investing/trading/buying/using (however you want to call it) Bitcoin.

Negatives:  Historically the fees have been really high for purchasing coins.  The way to avoid this is buy transacting USD first but that takes days to clear.  Brian Armstrong rags on bitcoin and didn’t announce Segwit adoption until he was threatened with Robin Hood (my opinion).  Also they still haven’t given people their bitcoin gold.  There have been people locked out of their accounts for months, transactions that are missing.  Their support team is non existent at processing and handling claims.  
But the positives are: they have had such an influx of customers, hiring costumer service to keep up would be hard.  They follow the strict rules of the US government, so at least we have a reliable exchange.  They rarely get hacked, at least I can’t think of a time in the past few years.  It’s a really easy exchange use and using GDAX to move bitcoin is cheap and fast.  And when somebody on the inside leaked the Bitcoin cash addition, they dealt with it appropriately.  
I have a love/hate relationship with coinbase.  Not a fan of Brian Armstrong.  I hate the huge fees and the time it takes to make checking account purchases, which I hear they’ve changed.  But I’ve never had my account hacked, and I’ve never had to deal with customer service.  It’s been flawless for me.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:17:55
The only way it would ever go down to $500 is if most of the  major countries involved decided to close the exchanges to its citizens( like China).  If that happens nobody will be able to buy, except computer geeks, but why would you want it at that point?  But I don't see this happening.

I like the way you're thinking.  During prohibition alcohol was rare, which drove the price up.  Also the same with illegal weapons.  But if the government shuts down exchanges, the rarity of bitcoin will not change.  There will be the same amount of bitcoin with way less people able to control them.
What worries me isn't so much supply and demand.  It's our country's current geopolitical status.  If you dig deep enough you can find some slimy things in our recent history.  America got the global reserve in the 40's because we were truly an honest and fair beacon of light that the world looked up to.  Our military was noble and fought for a constitution that was written by genius minds.  Our people were proud and happy.  But we have had a hard time staying on top lately.  I don't think our government will lose the global reserve without a fight.  And my guess is they would love to bitcoin it before it becomes mainstream.

Thank you for some honesty.  I feel terrible for the People of China right now.  So many are confused by what's going on also Bitcoin seems like the only way out of poverty for people all over the world.  I hope other governments don't follow suit.
Also a side question.  In case this happens in my country, wouldn't it be wise just to hold your Bitcoin in a Trezor and wait out the storm?  Surely the chinese government can't ban all the exchanges forever without reason.  And If they do, couldn't one just swing across a border and cash out in the future once they have amassed huge gains?  
I told my friends that if the SEC did this in America, I would be HODLing on my Trezor until my fruits are ripe to pick.  I haven't sold a dime and don't intend to for years to come.

Am I the only one here that is confused by people who are trashing China for Banning bitcoin, then reading posts about how a government can't possibly try and ban bitcoin?
Reddit is full of People gloating that China is now gone from bitcoin (I'd guess most of the sell off was probably done by traders around the world, the Chinese people in the cryptocurrency market are most likely holding Bitcoin in wallets through this temporary shutdown of exchanges.)  But Reddit is also full of people gloating that our government can't ban bitcoin.
I don't think for a second that the American Government along side our financial institutions aren't taking note of what China is doing.  And if you think the US government can't shut down Coinbase whenever they want you are not thinking clearly. Or maybe I'm not.
I watched the US government emulate a lot of the Chinese censorship and monitoring tactics of it's citizens through out the Bush administration, even unanimously giving us the US Patriot Act, which restricted our 1st, 4th, and 6th amendments.  We need to be a bit more open minded toward the differences between the people of the world's intentions and their governments intentions.

HODLer gurus don’t sell.  The definition of HODL is Hold on for Dear life.  The people who are selling aren’t the rich whales.  The top 100 bitcoin accounts have increased their stacks.  The people who are selling are the noobs who bought in after it hit $10,000 and it was in a bubble.  
I don’t think you’re being nasty, you and I are just reading different information.  The mass media and the bankers are throwing as much FUD as they can at it right now.

I try to educate myself on every investment I make before making moves.  I learned my lesson when trading stocks on Vangaurd in my Roth IRA.  One of my stocks boosted in 6 months and seemed high so I traded it for a promising stock that seemed low.  The fees cost more than I made in the whole six months so my position actually decreased in that trade by $200.  
Then I started reading about bitcoin and realized that it wasn’t that different.  I kept my bitcoin in my Trezor on the legacy chain until last week and sent it to a Segwit address in my Trezor for next to nothing.
You should definitely do your research before making moves or you will lose.

This is the discussion most people are trying to avoid.  I wrote a post on my concerns about bitcoins future.   but it just got thumbs downed and my questions went unanswered.  
I worry about my country (US) feeling threatened by bitcoin because we hold the global reserve currency, which puts the US government in the drivers seat on most negotiations.  I'm not proud or happy about it, but its the way it is right now.  I'm worried The US could try and form a larger than life deal with Japan that is to big to back away from and close all the exchanges.  That would carve out about 75% of the trading volume of cryptocurrency.  What would a bitcoin be worth then?  A lot of traders and investors don't know how to get around a government ban, so I think it would be a huge enough blow to destroy Bitcoins critical mass.
I believe in bitcoin and I think this scenario is highly unlikely, but it is probable.

Agreed... Cuban was Bitcoins worst troll.  He tweeted  “got no shot as a long-term digital currency.”  And “Biggest risk to btc/eth bubble is when a better crypto comes along and smart money moves there leaving the little buyers in the mud” and “Anyone anywhere can buy a stock.  is like gold. More religion than asset. Except, of course, gold makes nice jewelry.  notsomuch” and “I think it’s in a bubble. I just don’t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $ = bubble.” To over 7 million people.
This reminds me of how people now think George bush is an Okay guy, because he is starting to show emotion and compassion.  Forgetting the 8 years of misery he put the world through. This is obviously an exaggerated example, but Mark Cuban was a super huge douche toward Bitcoin for a long time.

1) Hey Peter WHEN do you think Bitcoin is going to Crash?
10 years?
40 years?
And why should we trust you for being wrong about it in the past?
2) Why would you encourage your friends and family to buy gold vouchers.  Everyone knows Gold has no value unless you are holding it in your hand.  Same with Cryptocurrenies and private keys.

Pretty awesome.  2 comment.
1.  I have seen a lot of people make false statements about their bank being the reason for a screwed up transaction, when it was a personal error.  And they go all over social media and blast their bank before they figure out the truth.  Your web site allows people to rate the bank based on feelings and not actual facts.
I also had a problem with US bank where they locked my account because I bought a Ledger Nano S.  I figured it was a crypto thing, but in reality it was because I made a large purchase overseas.
Most people would probably down vote their bank for that, but I have never had any issues in 2 years with US bank and I’ve made well over 100 transactions.  
In summation most people like to vote with nerves. So people are more willing to search something out that they hate, then something that’s working.
2.  Maybe make your search engine more user friendly.  It couldn’t find usbank.  I had to type in U.S.bancorp with the periods in place.  This is just nit picky.  
But have my upvote for something I can show my friends, and for taking the time to promote and educate people in the cryptocurrency realm.  Good job.

This is good advice.  All my friends that I got in last year understood how risky it was and to not only do their research, but to buy an amount that they weren’t afraid to lose.  Also the ones that became research addicts and wanted to put a good chunk of change in did so over a long period of time.  It’s called cost averaging.
It was really refreshing going through a crazy but necessary bear market and not harvesting angry texts from my friends about how they lost all of their money.   
Keys:  research and know what you are investing in, and when it’s risky like bitcoin don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Also protect yourself with a hardware wallet.  And understand how they work. Also I’d say to avoid asking strangers online for invest advice but most people chiming in here seem to be giving good advice.

This is a Bitcoin Post.  It is to inform people about trending news in the bitcoin arena.  When a top CEO thrashes bitcoin to hundreds/thousands applauding people, it has shown in the past to sink the value a little bit.
ALSO... Jamie Dimon said he wasn't going to talk about Bitcoin any more Because Social Media and Silicon Valley ripped him to shreds.  If let people (like Jamie Dimon) who know hardly anything about bitcoin try and sink the ship, it will have an impact on all of us.
I Was talking to some dudes at work who thought it was only used by Criminals (I wonder where they got that idea???) 
This is news about bitcoin (like it or not) and if we shoot the monster in the heart maybe less people like Dimon and Cuban will stop fueling hatred for it.  Allowing more people to jump on board.

Depending on your worth I would send them a reasonable amount that they can get excited about.  I have given 7 friends $50 each.  And they constantly tell me how they are up to $150-$200 or whatever.  I love how excited it makes them and how many times we’ve hung out at bars discussing block chain tech, different coins etc.  some of these guys/gals have gotten really into researching it.

I took out my initial investment during the rise which brought me to 1000%.  When I first invested I wrote down this plan.   
      the fall didn’t hurt that bad because I had no skin in the game.  I intended to just hold everything that I had left, but pulling out my initial investment was a bullet in the chamber.  I put it back in 2 weeks ago and greatly increased my position.  
     I would advise everyone to have a mid range plan and a long term plan.  Take profits sometimes and enjoy your investment.

@_date: 2017-10-10 21:45:16
Ok that makes sense.  I guess a lot of people buy to trade. Rather than hold.  When I buy bitcoin I don’t trade it at all.  It’s a long term hold so the 7 day waiting period means nothing.  If I want an alt coin i research it until the cows come home and instant buy bitcoin then trade to the coin of my choosing because I believe in it, not to trade it.  The only time I’ve ever traded was to get rid of NXT/Ardor because of the botched ICO and shrinking press/community.  But otherwise I treat my coins like my stocks.  HODL until the news turns sour.

Sorry, I wasn't calling you skeptic.  I'm saying that predicting price fluctuations is something everyone does.  But the notable skeptics who predict that its in a bubble (Jamie Dimon, Peter Schiff, and Mark Cuban) never ever give any indicator as to when the bubble will burst.  Maybe December maybe 2020 maybe when it hits $7000 maybe when it hits $25,000.  Unless you like taxable events, I would just HODL, it always rebounds.  Besides don't have to monitor the media or use any Fibonacci sequences using this method either.

The latter.  I would buy a little now and a little later. I think if you wait things will go up and you will have a hard time justifying buying a $7000 bitcoin.  But I really can’t predict anything.  I have so many notes I’ve taken over the years, but everything I think I know, contradicts its self, constantly.  Actually today looks like a really good time to buy any cryptocurrency.  The market seems to be in a small correction.  But buying all at once is never a great idea.  Good luck.

Thanks for the video.  A lot of people in my inner circle have been made fully aware of the volatility before they invested and they only invest what they can afford to lose.  But I still get asked what’s going on.  As a veteran of Bitcoin, I love how you listed everything I was thinking and more.  I would never have expected to hear it on all major networks so frequently when I first got into bitcoin.  I’ve seen the FUD and thankfully fought the temptations to sell low.  Now with LN on the horizon and the fact that most people don’t keep their investment on hot wallets.  Also there isn’t one major exchange like there was in 2013, there are numerous a hack like MT Gox seems impossible.  Also the core group of developers are so talented and they have a patient approach to making changes to the code.   I can list more and more positive things about what bitcoin has going for it with the help of people like you.  
Thanks for the video and keep up the good work.  I am not at all worried about the future of Bitcoin.  At least not yet.

I helped my brother open a bitcoin account last week and he forgot that I told him if you make a deposit using your checking account it takes 5-8 days to get your money.  His intention was to buy $2000 BTC and put it all into Bittrex and divy it up between NXT, ARDR, VRT, ANS, and BTC.  He called me panicking that he bought high and possibly, lost tons of money, and had to wait a week before he got his money.

 A month ago, I tried understanding the crypto market by trading 20 litecoins back and forth for a few days.  My goal was to learn how to read the flow of the market, and the roll the media plays.  I was confident I could learn how to become a trader in the cryptocurrency world and start trading all my bitcoins.  
I learned that no matter who you listen to and how good you are at paying attention to trends, it's just luck.  I left my bitcoins alone and stopped trading altogether.  When I see a coin I want I buy it and leave it in a wallet.  
That's my strategy.  I haven't sold anything or traded anything.  Just buy little bits here and there and do a ton of research before buying anything new.
Don't give up, just learn from it.  Hope you have a better experience in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:07:45
I think it's a great idea to buy and use Bitcoin.  By using bitcoin as a currency you are casting a vote that tells the world to start accepting it as a currency.

That is actually a question out of my scope of knowlege.  I know that Tether is  a cryptocurrency tied to the dollar, so some people buy it to weather out a storm.  But Im not sure what exchanges offer Tether, Coinbase and Bittrex don't.   And to answer the second half of your question, I believe you are correct.  I think you only have the opportunity to have Fiat/Dollars on an exchange not in a wallet. (I could totally be wrong about this.) I am a long term HODL'r not a trader, so all of my Fiat goes to beer and more beer.

It depends on where you live and what's available.  For me Washington state doesn't allow many fiat to bitcoin exchanges, so I use coinbase and then if I want alt coins I send my bitcoin to Bittrex.  Then I use my Trezor for storage, of bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.  Before I got my Trezor I used electrum for bitcoin only.  I also have several other wallets for each of my other coins.  My rule of thumb is "if I have over $100 in any single coin I take it off of the exchanges and put it into a wallet.

Bittrex is just what I was looking for.  I got enhanced verification within a half hour and I was able to put a couple bucks into the top fifty coins with the highest market cap.  Much Appreciated.
