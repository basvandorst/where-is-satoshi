Looking at your comment history makes me wonder what mental disorder turned you into a digital beggar motivated enough to go through the trouble of posting so many requests for money.
Not that I look unfavorably upon people begging; there's usually a reason and I'm usually sympathetic to them. I'm just curious how this works digitally. Are you actually taking effort begging like this, or are you just a crafty person who set up a bot to do so?

Possibly, but the postal service wasn't quite as powerful as the financial world. We're in for quite a ride!

First of all, if you meet in a public space and make sure that your way home is similarly 'public', you should be fine.
Second, while there are plenty of 'bad' people involved with bitcoin, I don't think the street thugs have quite picked up on it yet.

It's trivial to spoof a sender email address, so no need to compromise on localbitcoins' end...

Services. I don't think bitcoin was ever meant to be just used the way it is, and already now clever people are building services on top of it. Nothing would keep them from building a system where one can buy with more protection. In fact, aren't there already suck services popping up?

I had similar issue where the problem appeared to be a too-low transaction fee. I contacted support and they 'cancelled' the unconfirmed transaction for me.

Exactly. And i'm sure of neither, so I rely on neither option too much.

Isn't the biggest risk of a 25% owner that this person could play the market to increase his share, or for other gain? It might not be a huge problem, as this individual is likely to not want to disturb the market too much. Or this person is a good person.
However, it reminds me of the theories (conspiracy?) that our economic ups and downs are almost entirely fabricated by big players with the goal of, well, getting bigger.
Regardless of whether these theories are ridiculous or not (I have no strong opinion), the *concept* itself could be applied by this 25% individual.
At least, that's from a layman's point of view. I'd love to hear what you guys think.
