Very very awesome, but it's a bit cheeky to use the NOT-Satoshi guy's photo

"He signed off with a quote that there is a lot to cryptocurrencies than meets the eye."   
I highly doubt Woz said that.  
Great proof reading guys.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:29:25
Yeah, that's great as your uninformed opinion.  
Past performance and extrapolation is not perfect, but it is what the business world revolves around.  
If it works for the biggest NASDAQ companies, I don't know why you discount it entirely for bitcoin.

This should be part of the title.

talking about charity and then not giving is one of my triggers, bruh
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:36:56
You need to get some real friends.
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:18:06
Friendship is about trust.   If one person has done the research, someone close to them can trust it, without re-checking the research.  
Yes, this can be abused.  This is why we don't trust everyone.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:34:33
They 'MAY' not profit ever.   But historically it's inaccurate for you to specify "many, many years".   
Given past performance they can expect to see it back above $17k within a couple of years at most.

I'd give a picture of me whacking one out to anyone who wants it.

If someone doesn't 'know' that they are losing money by selling at a lower price than they bought, I feel bad for their education, not their wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:19:24
then you never make a gain.  
still doesnt change how simple the maths is for selling something at a lower price than you bought.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:11:56
Agreed.  It's only worth trying to beat them at their own game when they are not cheating.
@_date: 2018-10-21 08:16:45
I wish i could short short-sellers.    
I'd happily throw all my earnings at making that farce disappear.

HODL is a bad term - but selling half when you 2X is not necessary.  
How about sell 10% when you 10X.   Over the long term that would have paid very well, and still have a huge percentage "in" or HEDL.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:32:20
It would be odd if it went below $2000, or if it doesnt go back past $20000 in the next few years.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:43:01
It's logical that it 'might' settle back to 2x previous ATH, because it's already done that about 7 times.  
Count how many times it has fallen back to exactly the previous ATH and then begins climbing again.  
There is a reason people have made comedy youtube videos about this.

They need to create some kind of trustlesstee!

That sounds logical to me but, a friend who has a 6 figure investment portfolio with a private bank asked about transferring some BTC monies and they just said NO.   (happened UK, Nov 2017)
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:32:13
"$2,000 seems like the logical bottom since it is near 2x the previous ATH of around $1k"
No need to say it again.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:35:35
I was just about to retaliate, when I reconsidered...  You are right.   I count myself as 'long haul' and yet i'm checking the price way too often.  I'd love to be able to actually not see/hear it for months like it was a while back.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:58:23
Don't worry, he's basically been trolling every thread in this post.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:18:50
That's useful and well written.
The only part I'm wondering about is 'choosing' which coin to sell.   I thought it was FIFO or LIFO  ?
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:59:28
Ever seen how high Christie's &amp; Sotheby's percentages are?  
(iirc just the 'sellers fee' is 25%)

Exactly.  Now when the whole cryptospace can support an ICO big enough, spaceX can float with a MARScoin, where each token represents a seat to go there.

It's most likely all just coincidence.

Because it's happened like that about 7 times already.

Pedantry is to point out a slight difference in a fact that was merely referenced.   When the entire point of the post was to specify an exact number then I think correction is not pedantic.
