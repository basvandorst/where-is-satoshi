Similar experience with my investment club this weekend.
A couple older guys coming from a more traditional finance background were telling me that most in their circles were generally concerned about Bitcoin, while not knowing much, because they feel/have heard that it has the potential to weaken governments and disrupt economies.

Absolutely do the Bitcoin Gold last though. Been hearing too many reports of sketchy happenings.

Why does TOR make a difference with the ISP? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:02:04
In your experience, would any ISP assume the worst/throttle connections on tunnels/TOR/VPN?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:18:00
Thanks... Read that wrong, thought the reference was using TOR to mitigate data use with ISP. 
But yes, using TOR is like a VPN or tunnel, right?

Brilliant insider trading hack! What a world.

Physically impossible for it to be a Ponzi scheme... Yep. Couldn't agree more.
Though I do see the common attitude within the crypto scene still seeing it as an investment scheme, not the new financial paradigm/form of money it is.
People should not be saying "cashing out" or even quoting gains strictly in fiat terms, IMO.

I saw it on r/unexpected earlier.

Probably should've kept the bitcoin instead.
