Please elaborate friend, the comments so far have been well received. Your opinion is valid too ��

Fiat man ( would be crying right now ��

Yeah look, I see where you’re coming from. I think it’s too early in the piece to wish either of them ill-will. Crypto needs to be more established as accepted in the world before we should think about doing away with Bitcoin.
With so many pairs relying on BTC as a gateway and the media not being able to explain BTC to the world let alone all the other great projects. The community needs to promote the crypto economy in the best possible light.
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:30:35
And how does that help anything, beyond the price of your precious BCH?
It just seems to me the point is lost on you too. The infighting is ridiculous, it hurts both currencies.
I was prepared to support both, held equal quantities of both. Once it became obvious the market had spoken, so did I.
When all is said and done, there are better projects than both BTC and BCH. I would like to see them all do well and each find their own place.
The petty, deceitful crap however can go elsewhere.

It was never call Bitcoin Core, the only person that calls it that is Ver trying to mislead people.
It’s called Bitcoin, get used to it Roger, stop dividing the community to benefit you own back pocket.
If Bitcoin cash proves to be successful, let that be from the merits it holds.

Auscoin was shady, from what I gathered it was a way to raise capital to fund the rollout of the ATMs. Beyond that there was no value, unless you like to subsidise the adoption of BTC mainstream adoption. The Auscoin ICO, well because there was no real use case, the coin is doomed, you were totally better off just buying BTC and using it wherever possible.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:28:43
Well that’s for sure, I remember thinking we’re never seeing a sub $10k BTC ever again. Glad a got another shot to load up more.

I see you trolling, spreading FUD across the posts. How’s that working out for you?
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:18:49
What an asshat, seriously - grow up.
If you’re so successful, do something that makes the world better.

Nobody said Australia is a leader in tech, you fail to address the issue at hand.
I’ll repeat it for you since u seem to misunderstand.
Where are you from so I can tell you how dodgy you country is too. Maybe I don’t need to, you inability to back ur claim with any decent evidence, leads me to believe your country raises clowns well.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:01:22
Nice troll, but it doesn’t take a genius to work out the number plate is photoshopped 
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:07:04
+1, yep, start staking those longs ��
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:11:30
Ok... thanks the unsubstantiated generalisation of my country. Where are you from? I’m sure I can pull a few of the same out of my ass to annoy you too.
It doesn’t matter what country it’s from, it’s the con artist running the ICO that matters.
Where do you think Power Ledger came from? Oh yeah, here in Australia ����

Fiat money is not “fine” fractional reserving banking is a fraud, printing money out of thin air. The world is spinning into a never ending spiral of debt for which a  reckoning is due. Saving money in a bank account is pointless due to inflation and banks continue to get a slap over the wrist instead of learning from their mistakes and paying the price.
The transfer of value should be independent of state in a true market economy where all people decide what things are worth. They manipulation of value by those in power has gone too far.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:26:20
No one knows where the bottom really is, for all we know it’s already in. But sure, idc if it goes lower, just makes me buy more. But I ain’t contributing to it dipping further. HODL is fine, don’t let the banks get their greedy hands on more BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:54:13
The issue is you say ‘especially from Australia’ I pretty certain wherever you’re from can take the number of scam/weak coins created and times it by at least 10.
I’m done.

Such an angry little person, do you need a hug?

More sellers than buyers ��������

Which one is still the same as before the fork? Core is, it just now has optional second layer solutions to augment it (Segwit &amp; LN). BCH is not the same as before the fork, ergo not Bitcoin and equals a an altcoin, btw which needs a new name.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:37:46
Wow, you’re a special one aren’t you. When I said the traditional stock market may have a few years left, I was referring to how long the bull run can continue before the next reset.
Crypto’s future is bright, I’m not even going to give reasons why, which are numerous, if you’re so smart you can look it up yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:15:35
While the traditional stock market “MAY” have a few years left to run in on it (debatable considering how much money had been printed out of thin air). 
Discounting a completely new asset class like crypto could be nieve. Yes, there is potential for more downside and investors would be shortsighted for not hedging against it. The bottom of the crypto market is substantially closer than what’s in store for regular investments and the outlook for crypto is considerably rosier for crypto over the next 5-10 years.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:07:52
Yep, smart people will give their keys to trusted relatives or their spouse. You would mad not to or have other measures in place to secure the wealth of your loved ones.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:34:18
Surely the market has spoken, if not categorically by now, but very soon.
BCH was created almost a year ago now, if the coin had any claim to the name, it would now be becoming obvious.
Facts that stand, Bitcoin (not Bitcoin core, it was never called that) holds the most value and hashing power. BCH - Bitcoin Cash, as named by its most prominent proponent, does not.
I was willing to hedge my bets and held equal quantities of both, now I don’t. BCH needs to accept it is an alt coin and work out how to best support the ecosystem for the benefit of the whole.
Edit: for typos
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:56:54
Roger needs to chill and be grateful BCH hasn’t been relegated to the bottom of the top 100 list.
Let’s not be spiteful, it helps no one, lets encourage a better dialogue and get BCH accepted everywhere BTC is.
There is a solution, but infighting isn’t it.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:12:04
Oh, that’s where I disagree, a cheap price is where the clever people are looking to buy. It is also clever to be able to hedge short to protect yourself from downside.
In any case, the topic is what to tell people.
I say, if you have no clue, use the crypto.com app invest feature. At least people will be buying the real bitcoin and other established crypto’s that we all want to see succeed.
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:42:04
Link to your last post dude, I suspect your ego is getting in the way of reality.

Are any of the forks worth the same as Bitcoin, no. So there WILL only be 21 million, many of which are unrecoverable, that are worth keeping.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:00:16
Sure the paper futures have inflated supply, it would silly to ignore that. But anyone that cares to understand crypto will hold the underlying ‘Real’ bitcoin, which the futures derive their price from. If Bitcoin is in short supply then the price still only has one way to go.
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:49:58
Volume dropping even after a pump, as much as I want it to go back up, people still aren’t interested in buying.
The pump was probably market makers testing interest or establishing a position based on their risk profile. 
I suspect the bottom will be tested again and am positioned accordingly.
