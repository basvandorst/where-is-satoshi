You know high volatility isn't good for a Currency?
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:32:25
Same in Thailand. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:03:32


Average Joe gives a flying fuck and they are the backbone of a successful BitCoin future.

yay 3 digits volatility. sure this is a good currency /s
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:12:04
what's your definition of performance? do you understand the fundamentals of a currency? 
If you want to see it as an investment, fine... it's highly speculative. But stop pretending it's a currency in sense of FIAT. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:39:49
I'll make sure to read about that, this topic is very interesting. cheers 
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:32:11
A volatile currency is good? Ok then... 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:39:00
Yep, I don't want to own a "currency" that volatile compared to the (so hated - why even compare?) Fiat money.

Paid via bank wire 
@_date: 2016-09-24 01:03:09
Shouldn't an alternative currency be stable? Don't understand that you guys want to see it rise (if you really are behind the idea of btc) 
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:02:13
You guys are a prime example of why being biased is so dangerous. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 20:39:41
Every time I'm surprised about the awesome money they have in foreign countries. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:42:02
Hey look we have such a volatile currency I'm sure that won't scare average Joe in buying and using some! /s
You guys are speculating and not really behind the idea of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 11:31:41
That's why average Joe never will trust more than a few bucks 
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:47:29
You guys are really happy about such a high volatility? 
@_date: 2016-05-14 21:08:27
