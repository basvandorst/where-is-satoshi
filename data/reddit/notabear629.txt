No, what happens is if you deposit $1000 with bank A and the reserve requirement federally is say, 10%, they'll be able to give out $900 in loans after they reserve the required $100.
And then the guy with $900 makes a transaction and hands the money over to a 2nd guy who deposits the money in bank B who stashes $90 and loans $810 to another guy, and so on and so forth until $10,000 of total credit was created from $1000.
If the reserve requirement was 25%, there would be $4000 in total credit.
The total final credit is the initial deposit divided by the decimal form of the reserve requirement.
It isn't all the same bank, it's generally a slow process, and it doesn't work remotely the same way you say it does.

It's about what happens if this turns in to a trend and they adopt the craig wright method as a permanent strategy

Are you fucking retarded? He was talking about the fact that selection pressures from the mention of Wright being Satoshi would then favor people who didn't show a reaction to Craig Wright being Satoshi, thus over time the population would show less reaction, presumably because they didn't find it as laughable.
