Unless we manage to break through the 2-3GHz clock limit we've had on CPUs for the past 6-7 years, or add more cores then we could, but there's no way to make any of this that much faster on a CPU, unless we move to using ASICs to validate signatures.
The openssl used with Bitcoin core currently probably could scale to 50K if it used many cores, maybe 16+. But then you're introducing specialised hardware for anyone that wants to run a node and it becomes difficult for latecomers to catch up as 50k new signatures would be made per second and they can only verify 50k per second, meaning they can never truly validate the blockchain by themselves.

Use a normal address in the middle? Multisig is great, but you have to remember it adds heavily to the transaction size and fees when redeeming. 
I wouldn't consider it high priority. I also wouldn't trust green addresses with your funds, they're only marginaly better than blockchain.info.

I hope you're joking? You've just cleaned up 50BTC from your "provably fair" gambling site and you're saying you don't understand the basics of random number generation?
The randomness depends on the amount of non-deterministic data available to the computer. 
The problem with android was that the number was only pseudo random and it generated two or more identical r values when signing a signature for the same public key, thus revealing the private key. If two or more machines don't have a good source of random data, such as network wireless or audio noise they can end up with the same number and thus have the ability to spend from the same address (public key collision).
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:13:39


You could certainly argue that point for the federal reserve, but there are still many other countries that operate a much more conservative banking system.
I've argued before that BTC doesn't have to be deflationary, it can keep the 50BTC block reward forever and still be a stable currency that increases in value, as all new funds generated need to have a proof-of-work for them and it still wouldn't be "fiat". This would help prevent a single person or group from having a certain percentage of all of the units of currency that would ever be created.
This just seems like one of those brash anti-bank comments that doesn't really help the look of the community.

I've been thinking this is a good idea, introduce a new block version where every 2016th diff retarget block contains the merkle root of the utxo set before that block is applied inside the coinbase input, then let nodes cache that set to distribute to new peers.

This ends up with a 20 byte pub key hash, which is used internally when sending funds. 
You then append a 0x00 byte and prepend a 4 byte checksum and encode with base 58, to get what most people consider to be the address. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:17:03
You need to have the entire utxo for a certain height to validate a header, that makes lightweight clients much heavier. 
This will force miners to hold the whole utxo but it won't necessarily mean that they're actively sharing the data and act like a 'full node'. It also doesn't prevent anyone getting 51% or make the pow more secure.

Someone "debunked" it claiming that, but the accounts used by the bot had different credentials than most users and it still managed to trade at times when MtGox was known to be offline. The willy report had a lot of data behind it which other people could see was their own, where as the debunking didn't really stand up to scrutiny. 
If it was a trading bot for high-net-worth accounts, then Karpeles should have the funds for those people, or a significant legal contract if he was shorting the money, but he doesn't and the bot also seemed to push up the price many times, when if a buyer wanted to buy in a large amount they should be trying to keep the price as low as possible while they invested.
What is more likely, that he was running this bot for high value investors without taking the money beforehand, or that he had added unbacked money and was running a fraudulent exchange?

The soft limit is meaningless most miners use custom rules for building their blocks ignoring this limit, the hardfork required for changing the hard limit, will be a controversial decision as it will change the nature of Bitcoin and possibly make it more centralised. You can't implement something that 90% of nodes are incapable of doing and just hope their hardware will eventually catch up.


2 TB is a lot when you can only use an SSD, so is 52GB. Spinning disks simply wont be able to cope with an increased transaction volume. 


Again, why would it be profitable for a miner to confirm transaction that **don't pay a fee?** It's like saying I'll wash your car for you for free, because I'm worried someone else might come along and beat me to it.
You've consistently not answered anything I've mentioned about this, or your statement about the block size increasing because miners choose so and instead decided to attack my statements.
Bitcoin has to keep it's low volume to stay as decentralised as it currently is, increasing the block size above ~10MB will mean only people with SSDs can run a node, destroying what is possibly a large part of the network. The costs for those people are then significantly higher than what they would have been if they were using a spinning disk.
Please realise there are actual issues here and despite what you might think as a programmer, Bitcoin can't scale in the short term without becoming more centralised.

I'm not expecting the worst, but this is more than speculation, this is basic market economics. The total supply of network throughput is and for the near future will be 1MB/600seconds and it will become competitive for miners to choose only the higher paying transactions, otherwise they'll make a loss. 
The fees will go down if either, transaction volume goes down or the block limit is increased it currently doesn't look like either will happen for the near future, so that is what by statement is based on. It's more than just rampant speculation.

We also have to remember that ASIC mining isn't safe from being controlled by government.

The problem with embedded micro controllers like this though is the lack of randomness needed to make a secure ECDSA signature if we are reusing addresses (which this device seems to do).

Those shop terminals are still proprietary hardware which link directly to visa/mastercard and others which then take the money from your bank account or credit your bill statement, a long chain of processes that involves fees and risk at each step. Don't expect any of these terminals to get a "software update" that suddenly allows them to use Bitcoin. 
ApplePay only shows that the consumer methods of spending are changing as people begin to spend with phones, not that they're going to start using different currencies or cut out payment processors and banks.

Side channel attacks are present in virtually every algorithm.
While this certainly can be used to steal private keys, it assumes that the victim is consistently reusing addresses and is running on the same hardware as the attackers software, it is no where near as bad as being able to recover the private key from repeated r values.

I read the market.cpp a while ago when I went through the original source code, the market wasn't necessarily a completely decentralised one though, nodes had their own store and peers could connect, pay them directly (perhaps similar to the pay-to-ip method) and then leave feedback (atoms) which got shared among the peers. Hadn't noticed the poker lobby though.

Blockchain.info uses 2 factor auth too and any added benefit from using multisig is lost, since your service would just sign the transaction anyway if it received a valid login and 2fa, so the only the user is then burdened with paying higher fees for redeeming multisig outputs and paying you, with no benefit.

Visa handles ~10,000 transactions per second on average, which would require 1.3GB blocks to be created every 10 minutes and propagated across the network, which is clearly unfeasible.

You're assuming that all of the BTC and USD inside the trading engine was accounted for, Karpeles can run an SQL query like
    UPDATE users SET btc=10000.00,usd=10000.00 WHERE username="willy";
then willy has a load of "fake" goxcoins and goxdollars and the system becomes fractional reserve as the sum of the funds in the trading engine is less than the sum of the funds in the bank account and bitcoin wallet. Do this for 2 or more users and you essentially have some whales that can make big orders and move the market.

Their electronic transfer system is centralised around the providers, like SWIFT, SEPA, BACS, etc. Even then, it only provides a medium to transfer debt (an IOU), rather than something of actual value, which the banks then have to settle between themselves.

I was supposed to be involved with darkwallet, but I've unfortunately been busy with some other things since January.
There are major privacy additions due to be built into dark wallet such as stealth addresses and coinjoin, which have already been implemented in the backend service libbitcoin/obelisk and are awaiting frontend/ui implementation.
Some other things to think about are that this isn't just another wallet built upon blockchain.info/bitcoin core, it's a full reimplementation of a bitcoin client, a query server and a wallet. It isn't just another standard wallet that stores keys and signs transactions.
All updates can be seen on github, last commit was 12 hours ago and there's been 500+ commits since the project started, it's unfair to say this is a scam, when you can openly see all the hard work that has been done by many people.

It's good to see an in depth discussion about this issue on scalability, usually most of the posts about this are from Andreas Antonopoulos saying all we have to do is remove the block limit and everything will be fine, when in actual fact there is a massive change that will lead to every node having to store more data and do more work, just to sustain the network. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:08:27


I'm not saying a pool would fork against the communities wished, you've consistently said more mining power *increases* the max block size, which it doesn't and that anyone can buy a miner to confirm free transactions and make a profit.
Pools follow what the software dictates and what the consensus should be, otherwise their blocks are worthless. 


That isn't the problem, the problem is if we use 10MB block sizes, that's 520GB per year and the minimum requirement for a node archiving the full chain will be a 520GB ssd. Which means most of the decentralised nature of Bitcoin will go out the window as you'll need ssd hardware to run a node.


Well bitcoind isn't running inside your $50MM data center, it's running on my and other peoples computers in order to achieve consensus. The fact that you can't see how the competition for inclusion in the 1MB per 10 minutes would increase fees (basic supply &amp; demand) or how the block limit can be changed without creating special hardware requirements and breaking consensus is astounding to me. 
You seem to think it's fine to just implement a feature that will make a large proportion of nodes in the network unable to function and just leave them like that until their hardware catches up.
Sorry but, you still haven't answered any of my questions as to why you think you can buy a miner and confirm transactions for free and make a profit, or how mining increases the max block size?

OP_RETURN outputs pay the transaction fee too, there isn't really any "extra" cost over just having regular transactions. At least this way the network can discard time-stamped data, rather than keeping it in the unspent pool.

You'd also essentially have a CPU bound problem while you wait for that to calculate the signature, your ASIC/FPGA/GPU will have to sit idle or put other nonce increments into a queue. 
I don't really have a big understanding of the currently layouts used for the big mining companies, but if I were designing an IC for mining, you'd pass it a header and it'd calculate the hash and check the target/value before incrementing and going through another clock cycle as thats the best for power/performance/silicon optimisation. So it'd be impossible to do anything else, even a brute force attack on sha256 (Some machines might be able to do this).
Then there's validation, the signature is 64kb which is much more than the 80-byte header currently used for validation and the time it takes to check a lamport signature would be much longer than the dsha256 bitcoin core currently runs to check if a header is valid, so this would open nodes up to being attacked and temporarily halted while they check that signature, where as sha256 is relatively quick, even on a CPU.
Trying to get rid of pools will never work without crippling the PoW and then essentially opening  up security issues with hash power control. I think the best way to go is to improve mining software like p2pool and bundle SPV clients with mining software, so the miner will always mine with a pool advertising the longest known chain. But every solution will probably create other problems.

Yes but all of these spikes and crashes have been based on MtGox and were effectively the exchange rate between goxBTC and goxUSD. 
People still haven't woken up to the fact that 2011 and April/November 2013 were all gox bubbles, not BTC bubbles. 
I'm sure there will be another bubble again, but don't expect there to be a 10x increase in price over just a couple of months. Eventually as more legitimate exchanges start, it should start to be more of a steady growth rate with a few minor bubbles involved, rather than jumping by factors of 10.

One good thing to take away from this, is that currently what we call the price of Bitcoin isn't based on anything to do with actual trading, rather it is based on what you believe to be legitimate exchanges.
MtGox and GBL have shown us that just because an exchange says "1BTC sold for $1,000" doesn't mean that event actually happened. 


This report is damning evidence of a large scale fraud and proof that we're still in a correction phase, maybe Karpeles wasn't actually behind this and it was another hacker than managed to insert fake funds, again.
Overall I think this is good news, I doubt we'll ever see any of the massive rises like April or November again (I'd argue that we didn't see them anyway, as those trades were fake). But we might go back to a period of steady growth, which is overall better for the Bitcoin economy and long term holders.

If you want to make an edit to bitaddress or any other site, then issue a pull request to them as they have some amount of trust from the community and already have a system for signing releases and providing confirmed changes through the git commits. 
This site doesn't even separate out the JS, so it's just one big page of source to look through, I've had a quick scan and there doesn't appear to be any vulnerability with key generation, or any method that sends the private key to a third party, but that doesn't mean that there isn't.

Ultimately, no we aren't protected. The buyer can take your BTC then chargeback the payment to amazon, then you lose your BTC and your purchase.

This market will disappear once blocks start filling up, it'll be pay a certain minimum or it will never be included. The "reasonable" price will be pushed up a lot if transaction volume increases.


Miners have no choice over this, the network is hardcoded to reject blocks over 1MB. Consensus rules will reject anything over this. Why do you think adding hash power creates more block space?


Max block size is dependent on the storage space and bandwidth available to the average node, 52GB per year as it is currently is a sizeable amount for some nodes to store. It has nothing to do with any of the sha256 hardware.


It's not an obsession, mining is becoming more centralised, the formation of pools and the large percentage of hashpower they account for shows that. It's in the miners best interest to increase their profit margins and with limited block space, they will do that by only including the highest fee per tx. They could also become more political and choose to not relay certain addresses or scripts.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:02:35
If those limits are lifted, there aren't any current plans to do so any time soon. 
Increasing those limits will also increase the blockchain size per year up from 52GB, so it would move Bitcoin away from being a decentralised system that anyone can run on their pc, more towards a supernode system.

To add to this, uncompressed keys are prefixed with 0x04, compressed keys are prefixed with either 0x02 or 0x03, depending on the value of y mod 2.
If y mod 2 == 0, 0x02 is used.
If y mod 2 == 1, 0x03 is used.
So keys can look like this,
0x02 &lt;32 byte x&gt;
0x03 &lt;32 byte x&gt;
0x04 &lt;32 byte x&gt; &lt;32 byte y&gt;
Bitcoin originally only used uncompressed keys, but since v0.6 compressed are now used. 
Your address is a prefix byte of 0x00, the ripemd160(sha256(public key)) hash and then a checksum postfix.
The checksum is the first 4 bytes of the dsha256(0x00 &lt;&lt;ripemd160(sha256(public key))&gt;&gt;)
So your address looks like 
0x00 &lt;ripemd160(sha256(public key))&gt; &lt;checksum&gt;
which is then encoded using base 58.

Neither of these make you anonymous though, they only change the nature of how someone views you.


An attacker can now tell you're using a tor exit node and that you're privacy savvy and they can tag your inputs like that.


How do you establish trust? People "trusted" mtgox, inputs.io and instawallet to relay their transactions, along with manage their keys, that didn't end up well.


This can still reveal information about you, since the attacker doesn't see your tx in their mempool until the block comes in, they can see pretty good evidence that you're capable of mining a block and that the inputs to that tx were potentially used in a double spend.

It doesn't use fixed point math anywhere that could affect consensus though. Floating point ops are pretty quick on most CPUs, so there's no real difference in speed though.

Popcorn time consolidates torrents, not movies. They would then appear to be profiting of the distribution which would likely land them in a lot of legal trouble.


So both popcorn time and the production companies have the keys? That's a terrible idea.


According to what market? The minimum allowed dust amount? It would still take thousands of payments for the company to earn a dollar.


So then don't include money. Just let people use popcorn time for free and eventually the production companies will have to compete.
But if you think this is a good idea, then implement and publish it. Writing a couple of paragraphs on reddit won't accomplish anything, write the code and show that it works.

You're a bit full of yourself calling me a meat head when you clearly show no understanding of some very basic economic definitions.

I doubt satoshi did this to protect against quantum attacks, originally it was just to shorten the public key from 65 bytes to a 20 byte hash to ease sharing. Most coinbase outputs aren't using hashed addresses and neither is satoshis 1M coins.

1GB is a large size for a block, the volume likely wont reach that size for a long time (or ever).
Note though that using the current system, the new block gets broadcast with the transaction list. It might be more efficient to just broadcast the block header and a list of transaction hashes, as most nodes would have already downloaded the transactions included in it, due to them being propagated earlier. 
Signature verification would be the major hit before this though, modern CPUs can really only handle ~4000 tx per second on the secp256k1 curve.

This is kind of off-topic.
The SEC or no one else has any proof of your transaction to cryptsy, you can't even prove the transaction to this community until sites start implementing the payment protocol, or something similar. Unfortunately the crypto scene is still in the early days and it's the wild west for fraud. How did your coins disappear? Did they claim they were never deposited, or something else?
Cryptsy will implode soon, hopefully people aren't stupid enough to keep a large amount stored there.

Currency isn't "the first app", having a reward is crucial to increase competition and prevent people from trying to build their own branches off the chain. If you aren't worried about attackers rewriting the chain, you don't even need miners, a blockchain type database could be used internally by a company to store their temporal based data safe in a distributed manner.
The price doesn't just follow the electricity usage by miners, as we saw in 2011 when difficulty dropped following mtgox being compromised. There are more factors at work in the market than just mining 1BTC costs x amount in hardware and y amount in electricity.

This show it takes ~30 seconds+ for blocks to reach the 90th percentile of people. It might be a good idea in the future to have each block require a minimum of around the average included in the past few blocks in order to stop miners being overly selective about transactions.
Larger blocks don't take any longer to mine, all you mine is the 80 byte block header, that contains the merkle root of all the transactions inside. It would take longer to build the merkle root and verify the tx, but that's mostly negligible.

Multisig is only as secure as the people with the keys, and greenaddresses.it hold their keys and deliver the javascript to decrypt your keys.

Launch 2 regtest nodes and mint some coins by solving 120 blocks. Then disconnect them from each other, send your transaction to one node and create another block to confirm it. 
On your other node import the private key and create another transaction, mine more blocks then reconnect them, the original node which had your tx confirmed should notice the longer chain without the transaction from its node included.

Uncapped supply isn't really a big problem when the final reward is much less than the initial one, the inflation rate will still tend towards zero. 
The bigger concerns I have is that they've already changed the reward schedule numerous times. It used to have a random reward that was based on the previous hash, then they decided to remove the fixed supply and leave in a continued reward which really does nothing for the monetary supply, but its essentially the devs playing a dictator and hardforking when they like and the users willingly go along with it.

The ssd cost will go down, but bitcoin growth doesn't follow Moore's law, its likely that storage will be a massive choke point, its currently 52GB per year for 1MB blocks, 5TB per year if we use 100MB blocks like you claim we can. That's a massive cost for the average Joe. Especially when usage will increase further over time. 
Coin join only mixes funds between 2 people currently which is still easy to trace. bip32 is a deterministic key generator, and stealth addresses only offer diffie-hellman key exchange for a new address, neither of which affect the traceability of funds any better than just exchanging a new key between parties.

Similar idea to what I've had for a while. It's only a matter of time until crypto currencies mature to handle high volume and a government that isn't dependent on the banking sector will create something like this, giving each citizen an even amount, or letting them trade in their old currency for an equivalent amount of the new one. This would allow trade to flourish, people to invest directly with each other and lower the barrier to trading with other currencies, like Bitcoin, on an international market.

There is a hard limit of 1MB for each block, trying to "just mine bigger blocks" means you're wasting your hashpower, the network will reject the block and you earn no money.
There's also the problem of propagation speed, it will become better for miners to only broadcast half full blocks and ignore low fee paying transactions as most miner profits come from the coinbase.

It seems more and more likely Gox was intentionally running a fractional reserve for a long time. I'm willing to bet they lost a lot of coins back in summer 2011 and it wasn't just their trading engine that was compromised.
I'd even go as far as to say they intentionally caused the April 2013 crash by slowing their trading engine, so they could have a better control over the market. Only Mark Karpeles and Gonzague Gay-Bouchman really know what's been going on, the truth will come out eventually.

They don't, pay to script hash addresses start with a 3, if you notice, the length of a mutlisig address is the same as a single address, this is because the payment script is hashed inside it.
The script for a multi-signature script looks something like.
    m {pubkey}...{pubkey} n OP_CHECKMULTISIG
where m&lt;=n and n is the number of pubkeys
You hash that, then append it with the script version byte, then once it's encoded it becomes a 3.

This fact extends to your gox/coinbase/inputs.io balance, unless only you have private keys and you can validate transactions to those keys against the longest branch of the blockchain, you have a liability. At least bank balances are actually somewhat protected by the government.

It will grow, but that depends on the when it is increased, the figure cannot currently change without causing a hardfork.

Assuming we need a full-ish block 800KB - 1MB, otherwise it's rejected and not considered valid. There are could be many transactions in queue that could be added to the next block as soon as one is mined, but if volume drops and miners have to wait a few minutes for a larger mempool before they can begin mining then hash power and security drops, leading to a less secure network. It's far better to leave it as it is and have some miners being "cheap" by dropping low-fee paying transactions.

There are very real dangers than can have a serious affect on Bitcoin right now, rampant fraud in exchanges, large holders having too much control over the currency and a hash power attack by the government is very possible.
The US government has a long history of managing computing systems, it's very easy for them to put in an order for some 14nm chips which would be 4x more efficient than the current ASIC line shipping to consumers and then gain majority hash power of the network and hold it, possibly forever.

1. Your site has no https or ssl, meaning I can't validate I'm actually connecting to you, any middle man could send me different data and I have to check the whole source every time I visit the page (all 10k lines). If you kept the javascript files separate, I could confirm the hashes of each one and check to see if they change, but it's all lumped together, so if even if I check the whole thing, you can change a single character and my stored hash changes, meaning I have to re-check the 10k lines.
2. I don't trust you, why should I? Bitaddress has a much longer history than you. You wouldn't trust an executable that I posted somewhere, so why would anyone trust the code you have, when you can change it at any time? There's a reason bitcoind uses deterministic builds. 
I'm saying that you shouldn't be hosting this, bitaddress can't really confirm your version is valid as you have merged all the files into one html file and made a lot of changes to it.

If someone managed to get over 51%, then they could effectively attack the network, forking double spends etc.
Other than that, it's bad due to the centralisation of wealth. The botnet owner is getting a lot of block rewards for effectively no work on his part.

Privacy, like anonymity isn't a boolean option that you either have or don't have and neither tool can make you completely anonymous. 
You're right to be dismissive of "moon math crypto", as SNARKs don't significantly add anything to the identity linkage/computation cost ratio that can be seen in average sized bitcoin transactions.
Coinjoin is workable between friends, but in a public matching service an attacker can just submit multiple requests to receive a peers utxos and refuse to sign the transaction, you can now link those utxos together as being from the same person and prevent that service from operating until/if they can ban you.
Stealth addresses are a good scheme for random payments, but they don't offer any extra benefit over two people sharing addresses over a secure connection.
[There's a lot of things wrong with PGP]( and while it's still mostly used in emails a middleman will always be able to see that you are communicating with someone, that isn't "pretty good privacy", that's just obfuscation a message.

Any possible backdoor in secp256k1 can lower the security of it, but it isn't just a license to spend the money it would still require a large amount of calculations to do in order to steal your 1mBTC.

Unfortunately there's also paper wallet generators that are generated on the server.
One of the cool features of ECDSA is it allows some magic where you can give me a public key and I then do the work finding a nonce on top of that key that gives me the vanity address you want. 
There are some services that do this and are legitimate, however it seems people recently have been tricking people into handing over their private key.

It's quite easy and possible for the US government to do a 10,000% attack if they wanted. They have the resources, they have access to the intel chip fabs in the US which can make chips that are much faster and more power efficient than the current ASIC manufacturers. 
Someone with a lot of money can put in a chip order and no one at intel will even be able to know that they're producing dsha256 chips.
Everyone could switch to another hashing algorithm, like scrypt (but they can produce ASICs for that too) or X11, but that only increases the possibility of a CPU based 51% attack and the governments of the world can easily get a lot of CPUs.
In any case, it's still more profitable to just mine blocks, even when you have 51% of the mining power, as visible proof that some is performing double spends would likely tank the price of the currency.

I'm not sure and the article doesn't mention that much, but I think this kind of attack is delayed a lot by using a double hash instead of a single. 
Bitcoin hashing like hashcash is unique as its a proof of work, rather than trying to get a collision detection. We haven't until recently seen many researchers looking into pow attacks.

Changing the 1MB value would require a hard fork, this release just changes what the bitcoind client will produce up to 750K.
Most miners don't use bitcoind to build their blocks, or they change the limit, as seen recently there was a 900KB block which is fine by protocol rules, but the client wouldn't try and create a block over 750K, unless you tell it to.

Signatures already are done in parallel. My machine maxes out at ~4,000 per second per core on secp256k1. GPUs might be able to take that a bit further.

You can't get a secure shared secret using ec group operations, what you're looking for is ec diffie-hellman with a nonce and hash to get a secure temporary secret for aes.
 Public keys aren't revealed until the receiving address has spent at least one of its outputs, there's no need to include blockchain.info or addresses into the mix. Early coinbase transactions don't have the public keys known as satoshi hasn't spent the funds yet. 
Also this seems very sketchy when you're wanting access to peoples wallet.dat, if you were just wanting a little toy, why not just show that encryption is possible using ecdh rather than something that looks like wallet stealing malware?

The root of the tree is hashed, so it's always 32 bytes in the block header, you could do something like just hashing a list of all the tx, or a list of the txhashes, but it seems like satoshi built it with the merkle tree to make the most disk space savings possible. 
I haven't done any analysis yet, but much of the blockchain data can probably be thrown away by most nodes now as it's sufficiently buried under enough new blocks.

Can you provide a citation for this? Everything I've read has pointed towards it rising by a currently undecided amount, not being completely removed.


52GB is still a large size for some people, it's 1/4 of my current hd space which I don't upgrade that often and any increase that if any increase takes the tx throughput above ~100 tx per second will *require* an ssd (spinning disks can only do ~200 seeks per second), which are still significantly more expensive than spinning disks.


So am I and I have done a lot of research into the scalability of Bitcoin. All of my statements have been justified, Bitcoin is not magic, there are real issues regarding its scalability, security and consensus.
You still haven't answered my question as to why you think increasing hashpower would increase the block size and why people with a minority of the hash power would mine your transactions for free? Could you elaborate on this, rather than telling me to do more research and stop spouting rhetoric?

It's a good thing if Bitpay chooses not to engage in guns and drugs if it gives them a better public image to continue servicing the rest of their customers. 
Bitcoin is moving past the point where it can be blamed for bad things, because more and more people recognise it as just being money, however we're in a shake out period where many companies are closing due to many reasons, it's better for Bitpay and Bitcoin if they continue to keep a good public image, if they start accepting payments for guns, marijuana dispensaries and wikileaks, they'll end up attracting much more attention than they'll be able to cope with.

Define "fail", drop back to $100 or $10? Being banned by a certain country? Mt. Gox collapsing? Being overtaken by dogecoin? 
Most security issues can be fixed and their effects rolled back by the chain forking before the effects of those issues were put into the blockchain. So you can't really call issues like being able to spend other peoples coins and minting 92 billion Bitcoins a failure, as they always rollback (both of these have happened).
I don't want to see the protocol or the idea fail, but I have some doubts about the deflation rate being economically viable and the large amounts of the current wealth currently owned by a relatively few people. I'd prefer money to be more socially democratic, rather than wall street owning hundreds of thousands of BTC paid with debt and the man on the street only owning 100mBTC.

Thanks for backing me up, unfortunately krelotho seems to think he's right about everything, due to him running a massive $50MM data center and a mining pool. 
The network can certainly scale to visa-type levels, but it's a good 5-10 years before the average PC can be a node in that type of system. Even then real world transactions are much higher than visa, so visa isn't really the target for volume, more like a checkpoint.

There was very low hashpower during the early blocks as it was pretty much satoshi mining alone. Maybe he had some downtime.
Block 74637 was the last block prior to a integer overflow that appeared in a forked 74638 which minted 184 billion coins. So those were both exceptional circumstances, most times follow quite an even poisson distribution around 10 minutes. Two hours should be expected (as should two days) but those would be very rare while the network is operating properly.

From the article.


This is a pretty obvious dos flaw that can be used to take down the whole network, Bitcoin prevents this by only relaying signed transactions it knows are valid. Darkcoin would just allow you to send more and more "intentions to add input to the pool", until the network is saturated with messages. 
It's similar to coinjoin, both of which can be dosed, but this is decentralised and dosing this will slow down the entire payment network.

Addresses starting with a 3 mean they're redeemed by a script, you have no idea what the script behind that hash requires for it to be redeemed.

I have read into this a lot. With zerocoin, you can prove that you know the secret behind the zerocoin spend when you mint it, without actually showing the secret to anyone, the link still exists, otherwise people could just start minting other peoples coins.

Note I said transaction inputs, as each txin would require 1 or more signature verification, average transactions probably have 2-3 inputs, this takes the number of max tps down to the 300 ish range.
This is also for just keeping up with the network, if you launch a new node, or have some downtime, you then have to catch up, if the network is doing 1000tps and you can only verify 1100tps, it'll take a long time to do signature verification to catch up since the most recent checkpoint.


Data isn't just one way, you also relay to other peers and then there's overhead such as inv messages, so it's probably higher again. 


Neither do I and it is mostly necessary to scale, however this will remove the power from the users to decide network consensus and place it into the hands of the few people running the big nodes, just as we have seen with mining.

It's technically bad if a commodity is mostly created by slave labour, rather than recognised work. For all we know several botnets could have been mining for litecoins, or even for bitcoins before many ASICs came out. 
The problem is the liquidity you need to cash out, it's probably more profitable to mine the chain rather than perform double spends, even if you do get 51%. But you'd never be able to cash out to another currency without crashing the market.

That will not lead to an increase in Bitcoin volumes, because the volume is currently heavily limited to 1MB/10mins (~7tx/sec). You say this as if it's a matter of adoption, rather than the protocol being limited by constants and its current implementation, before volume rises much more than that the following things need to happen.
1. Increase IO buffers for network connections.
2. Use a new method for block propagation, such as Gavins IBLT, or sending the header with a list of tx hashes.
3. Create a method for sending partial blocks, otherwise block size would be limited to be much less than the size of the IO buffers.
4. Implement a method for pruning old blocks, so nodes don't need to store and share many GB of data that are created each day. (tx size of 500 bytes and 1,000 tx per second leaves us with 43GB of blocks each day)
5. Increase the size of the mempool.
There's a massive cost/risk/reward ratio to deal with, even then there's no guarantees that it will be successful, or even work.

zerocoin still doesn't offer much more for anonymity, their zerocoin spend/mint process and the zkp you generate proves that the spend is yours without revealing the key behind it. It also adds a lot to the protocol, the mint signatures take a long time to verify and a lot of space.

The only way around this is risk management, don't accept a $1,000,000 tx without sufficient legal agreements and the transaction being buried deep enough.
It's advisable to wait for value/current_reward blocks before considering it secure, otherwise the attacker can make more money by just mining the rewards than trying to scam you with a double spend.

It wasn't a unique or new site though, Farmers Market existed before SR although payment was with paypal and western union. 
Nor was it really anonymous, if you wanted to buy drugs you were essentially giving the site owner traceability over the bitcoins you deposited and the seller your home address. It's arguably more anonymous to meet a dealer in an alley and exchange for untraceable cash.
What it did offer was reputation, reliability and safer way to buy substances, with a lesser chance of receiving contaminated drugs.
It's effect on bitcoin isn't really that large pricewise, before silkroad opened each bitcoin was trading at around $0.30, then up to around $10 before the events in Cyprus last year. Bitcoin was only used as a repeated transfer of value.

scrypt / litecoin is worse because the common man can mine. The ability for any pc to compete will lead to a large amount of hashpower coming from botnets and since they don't have to pay electricity, they'll inevitably become a larger portion of the network as difficulty rises.
Inevitably you have to choose if the blockchain/proof of work function is one that can be easily centralised, or easily performed by slaves, although we haven't seen it yet, any of the scrypt coins will probably be attacked by increasing hash power from a botnet some time in the future.

I asked quite a simple set of technical questions about their service and how it works on their thread and they're yet to answer. Their white paper is a joke which reads more like an advertising pitch than a technical document and they're still to address exactly how "proof-of-bandwidth/storage" will actually work. 
It's strange that they've got a fancy video and such a large amount of funding, when there are such massive holes in how they describe the system would work, while using meaningless terms like "three levels of encryption" and how your data is "constantly checked" on remote peers.
I don't know if it is a scam, but it's definitely using some terms that are usually used in scams in the crypto-currency community, while being unable to even respond to basic questions.
Edit: There is some code on github, including a python file for performing heartbeats to see if a file is stored by a network node, but there's no mention of any encryption, let alone the "three levels of encryption" that they've promised. The code is pretty sloppy, with a lot of converting between bytes and strings, getting hashes as a hexdigest (using 2x the memory) and just some more fairly basic sloppy python with no networking, all it does is read a file then hash some part of it. 
I still can't find any code for their actual network node for storing and validating the consistency of files.

They probably saw the hot wallet was getting low and just topped it up from the cold storage.
If someone realised this a while ago, they could have initiated the transaction and changed the txid of each transaction broadcast, once one of the non-malleable transactions is included in a block redeposit the money and try again. Depending on what sort of connection mtgox and the attacker has to the rest of the network this has a pretty good chance of at least doubling your money on each withdrawal.

No, more like 200us compared to 2ms. Which can be excessive and lead to CPU exhaustion attacks more easily than ed25519.
There are plenty of other keychains and better methods to use than just generating a different bitcoin public key for each login. You cant pay for a service using an address and then sign with it, as the merchant would obviously have access to that key. There are also instances where it's better to have a username. Why not use a method like 
    login_key = master_public_key + G(hash(domain_name))
    private_key = master_priv_key + hash(domain_name)
Then you can have deterministic-style login keychain and only have to remember one root key. It's a cool concept, but there's no real advantage over SQRL and some big disadvantages.

Bitpay could still ship their own nfc terminals, but their support for the till software would be difficult to implement and the cc companies usually have a lot of anti-competitive terms and conditions for the merchant (you can't usually charge the customer extra for using the card, even though the company is taking a fee from you).
Apple might be able to push it a bit more than google has, but even without mobile there's still a lack of consumer uptake of NFC cards, people either don't know their card has it, or they choose to use chip and pin instead and many places don't support NFC and plenty still don't even support cards and are cash only. What use is it paying with my phone all night, if the taxi driver taking me home only accepts cash? ATM machines don't do NFC, so I still need to take my card, so then I may as well take my wallet.
I always see bitcoin as having more of an indy/anarchist/libertarian future, I doubt it will have major uptake as the currency people pay their morning coffee with (the network can't really scale that far), but it could be useful for people wanting to store value and pay with some privacy or have remittances. I also think the minting rate and past uses of it might put a cap on its valuation and uses, 50% of the coins were minted in 4 years and for that period a very small minority got very rich and most of the services for bitcoin like SilkRoad and Mt.Gox, were either significantly insecure or fraudulent.
You have to make the distinction between crypto and fiat too, cryptocurrency is based on value (the value of the proof of work being done), where as government fiat is based on debt (the promise that this paper is worth something), one requires a significant amount of energy to be consumed and can only be produced at a set rate, where as the other one is produced on the whim of politicians.
ApplePay isn't a new product or service, it's just a UI redesign with some mild security features, I can achieve the same level of use by sellotaping a card to the back of my phone, it's just a thin client into the card and bank network.

Difference is darkwallet and apps are fully downloadable and verifiable by the user before runtime, in browser JS is still vulnerable to a point where it shouldn't at all be recommended. I'm not trying to hate on your service, it is good, but there are drawbacks.

My wallet needs to be backed up somewhere, but not somewhere that can also deliver me the code to decrypt it.
Unlike electrum/multibit, blockchain.info can change the code that gets delivered to the browser and then read the keys, while they might not do this intentionally, their numerous simple security issues in the past like XSS and their poor attitude when dealing with customers and people notifying them of bugs.
Mark my words, one day blockchain.info will be hacked, an attacker will get into their servers and slip some JS into their client code which will immediately send your funds to their address once the keys are decoded, or more likely just send the private keys back to the attacker to prevent anyone noticing until it is too late.
It's just waiting to happen and it'll be a big disaster when it does.

No, but there is a centralisation of power at Ghash.io, Eligius and BTC Guild, I was saying the entirety of the miners are solely responsible, not a single person.
It doesn't at all incentivize competition for lower fees, the block limit will eventually force miners to only include transactions paying high fees. The competition is for which transactions pay the most, not the least.

Yes. But it depends on what merchants or receiver are on each fork. 
If the chain forks into 2 and merchant A sees fork A as valid and merchant B sees fork B as valid, you can spend the same tx output on each fork to different locations and each can get confirmed on that fork.
Although if the fork is corrected and one chain becomes longer than the other, the merchant on the shorter fork will lose their money and will probably not be happy. It depends what you mean by fork, forking the constants of the network, or a fork due to network partitioning or a bug.

I don't think so, all that code does is base58 your IP address and add it to the channel, along with downloading the list that is already there.
Even the initial client had socks4 support, so it was likely satoshi was using Tor, even then to hide his identity. It would be pointless to do that then let his nodes publish their IP address directly to that channel. He probably just used the IRC method in read-only mode, where he got a list of peers and connected to those listening over Tor.

Depends on what wallet you're using. You can save a copy of the private key, but the signature is dependent on what funds you're spending.

Plenty of things like that can be removed from the UI perspective, addresses don't really exist in the protocol (only the pubkeyhash part does).

Someone wont take the risk of including free transactions, when there's other transactions paying a higher fee, minimising the risk (basic supply&amp;demand).

That's entirely separate, it refers to deleting old spent transaction from the database.
Merkle trees are used because they can be used to efficiently and securely verify a large data set exists inside of it and it's always 32 bytes, no matter how many transactions are in it. Having a list of tx hashes would mean the block header gets bigger when more transactions are in it.
Edit: Seems I was a bit wrong about this, the merkle seems like it was intended to save space, rather than using a hash list.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:10:03


No it can't, the average CPU can only do around 1,000 secp256k1 verifications per second using openssl, which means you're limited to processing that many transaction inputs per second. 
Then there's the issue of home connections being slow and block propagation slowing down significantly due to the increase in size, it could start taking many minutes for a new block to propagate across a significant amount of the network, this means orphan blocks would increase and more hash power would be wasted.
Moving beyond home desktops to more centralised solutions also has problems.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:29:12
Because the fees are small compared to the size, a 300kb block propagates much faster than a larger one, which means that block is less likely to be an orphan. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:45:22
Bitcoin is hardcoded to have a Max block size of 1MB, this equates to about 7 transactions per second. Once volume surpasses this, miners will only start putting the txs with the highest fees into blocks. Making micro transactions impractical as the fees would be excessive. The only way to fix this is to hardfork and increase the limit, but that will have a detrimental effect on the requirements to run a node. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 06:14:59
No you can't, not without massively changing the nature of the network, any increase to the block size will significantly alter the work required by nodes to store, validate and share the data. 
To have 200k tps, your block size over 10 mins will end up being over 30GB, but you'll hit the signature validation limit long before then, as that maxes out around 4,000 per second per core. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 12:31:01
This means you'd have to save every hash in the list to still verify the merkle root hash. Merkle trees don't have to keep every entry to verify the integrity of the root (or root hash). You can snap branches off and just save the hash where it was broken off. 
It's the difference between having to save 32 bytes * n transactions, for the list or a lot less with the merkle system when (if) nodes start deleting old data.

But he said bitpay gave him his money back, not you. His account is still new and this looks like an obvious bullshit story to attract attention. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:31:53
Secp256k1 signature verification is the current bottleneck, it takes about 1ms (1000 per second) to verify a signature on my machine using openssl, lets say the average transaction has 2 inputs, that's around 500 transaction per second, assuming we're only using one core.
If each tx is about 300 bytes big, this gives us a throughput of about 300*500 = 150 kB per second, 90MB every block. Nothing too extreme, even if we have to store a few blocks in memory.
However before you get to this limit, there's the issue of seek times for random reads on a spinning disk, your 7,200 RPM disk can do about 100 seeks per second max, so unless you use an SSD the limit is going to be below 50 transactions per second. SSDs are also still very expensive, so you have to solve the issue of how to store the rest of the blockchain once it starts getting bigger.
Very popular concert isn't really a big problem, I can't find any limit for the memory pool (unconfirmed) size, so any rush of transaction should just increase memory pool until they're confirmed.

Bitcoin is more than protocol, there is Bitcoin the protocol which allows anyone to create a decentralised digital currency (such as namecoin, litecoin, dogecoin) and Bitcoin the network which stores the value of the currency and relays/confirms transactions.

Bitcoin is deflationary by design and we're currently playing a game of how much can be centralised into the hands of a few people before this starts to look less attractive, many people have 100,000+ Bitcoins hoarded to themselves, the FBI has 144k there are many sr and gox coins that are unaccounted for and held by persons unknown which can cause an affect on the market if they were ever sold.

I've thought this for a while though. Although the 850k figure comes from mtgox internal accounting. It could be possible that mark or an employee or an attacker injected fake funds into the trading engine in order to manipulate the market and withdraw funds. This is what caused the 2011 "bubble", when someone managed to do an SQL injection and give themselves millions of dollars of funds on the database. 
I wouldn't be surprised if 90%+ of the user funds are safe in that 200k and there's much more fraudulent things going on.

Switching from a standard block message for propagation to a message that includes only the header and tx hashes would be much more efficient, the receiver can check the merkle tree and ensure the header is valid and would hopefully have most or all of the transactions in its mempool.
But there's still the issue of how you sync from the genesis, syncing is currently easy because the limit is significantly less than resources of a standard PC and connection, if every block is 100MB and you can only download 100MB/10 mins you'll never catch up.

Yes he has experience in networks and computer systems, but his talks don't show it. As with many of the big players in the Bitcoin media scene, there is too little discussion of the technology and politics of Bitcoin and too much talk about how great it is and how people should buy it.

This can be a good thing for exchanges even without putting identities into the blockchain, as you can actually sign a message saying "withdraw 1.2BTC to address 1AbCdEf....." with your public key used on the service, the exchange then has "proof" that you initiated it off your authenticated phone. Rather than the current use of HMAC APIs or other 2FA providers.
It would mean the exchange has a signed copy of your actions and could show that proof and it wouldn't just be a case of one persons word against the other, it could also be used to implement 0-conf deposits easily and safely to exchanges.
I prefer SQRL to this implementation of BitID, this doesn't need to involve Bitcoin addresses, only public keys, secp256k1 is also significantly slower than curve25519, however public key verification is still going to be slower than HMAC or password authentication and it will demand much more CPU cycles.

All receiving pubkey hashes are valid, it's just 20 bytes of data, it's very easy to send to ones that nobody knows the private key for.
The checksum is just a user-friendly feature, it's nothing to do with the network or having a valid transaction.
eg, your address decoded is
00 692f5a82e43bb9ea08915b9d4bfa2110e0ea5aa6 172e36c6
00 is the address version
692f5a82e43bb9ea08915b9d4bfa2110e0ea5aa6 is the public key hash
172e36c6 is the checksum.
The network only cares about the public key hash and it can be anything, which is how some people in the past have timestamped data.

Bitcoin is more than just a "technology" though, it's also a constantly updating public ledger and its future is massively susceptible to public politics and its past uses. Mobile phones are a great technology, but that doesn't mean it's a great idea to only invest in Nokia because they were one of the most successful in the 90's.
The blockchain with a minting reward is a great system and OP agrees, but I think in many ways, Bitcoin was ahead of its time, we've had 5 years of coin minting while we were essentially dependent on Mt.Gox for trading (which turned out to be fraudulent), while I don't doubt that blockchain systems are extremely useful for free trade, I don't really care about the price any more as I think the apparent 800k Mt. Gox lost and the 980k satoshi owns, along with some other big players might end up putting a limit on the upper price of the market, due to fear of volatility and the markets still having very low volume. Although I could be wrong.

He didn't say to get rid of the reward scheme in the blockchain, he said that as it stands, the major bitcoin holders and its market, which has very little liquidity creates a dangerous market that people are currently using as a pump and dump scheme.

It hasn't been fixed, doing so would result in a hard fork. 
The genesis block coinbase is never added to the database, technically it's not even a "real" transaction. Look at the code. If an altcoin makes it spendable then that's up to them, but it would add add complexity for no real gain.

We aren't talking about SI units though, all SI units are based on the base units and are for attaching interchangeable units to real world phenomena, they're also fixed based on the speed of light and cannot change.
Perhaps you're talking about prefixes for multiples and fractions? 
Many people have difficulty dealing with sub 0.01 values as they're not commonly used by most people in everyday life, which is why it's difficult for people when they're paying 0.000987 BTC for a cup of coffee to realise exactly what it is, if anything wallet developers should change the formatting to uBTC as people are used to dealing with 2 decimal places, but this is all appearance issues, it doesn't change anything to do with the protocol.

Altcoins are good, scrypt is bad, as GPU only algorithms will inevitably lead to a mining distribution and money supply that is controlled by botnets.
They're certainly useful as a few hundred different testnets, where we can watch experiments on the economies of those coins.
I think there might be some coins in the future that can approach the market cap of Bitcoin, maybe even compete with it, it depends on how the political situation affects them. 
But so far, all we've seen is forks from bitcoind that have changed the genesis block and a few other minor elements, nothing has had a significant revolution that bitcoin could adopt.

@_date: 2014-03-12 20:15:28
I haven't shifted my original point. Miners do control what gets confirmed and there is a competing market for whoever pays the highest fee.


Adding hashpower to the network doesn't drive transaction fee prices down, like you claimed.
Satoshis original release did have a block limit of 32MB, but that was dropped, due to it being too easy to dos the network. The block limit is a solvable issue, but would require network consensus and would mean most people wont be able to run a node on their computer as casual people do now.
My original statement was that miners can choose which transactions to include and they can make choices based upon fees paid, size, scripts used and who sent/received the inputs/outputs. 
The miners and pools alone are responsible and that power is becoming increasingly centralised, if they don't like your transaction for any reason they can drop it.
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:12:35

Mtgox wasn't "too big to fail", you can't compare an exchange to a bank. They failed due to poor security and account keeping and probably fraud, due to not safely keeping their customers deposits.

I don't think that pow is unsustainable in that manner, it will always be that the network electricity cost for 10 mins will be approximately equal to the block reward and that is decreasing exponentially. 
Much bigger concerns are that large companies have a monopoly over asic production and would end up succumbing to regulation and mining would become restrictive. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:08:28
You don't need to force additional fees for extra transactions over the limit, miners would simply choose themselves not to include it, as it becomes more "expensive", due to the increased likelihood of it becoming an orphan block.

Yeah it looks as though a multicore CPU can probably compete with visa, but I've also seen some updated figures for visa where they peak at around ~25k tps over the holiday peak, so they're growing too, also people still use cash, visa is actually a very small percentage of world wide payment options.
Off-chain options have their own problems though, on some sites you're essentially swapping the security of elliptic curve crypto for a username and password and swapping the knowledge that only you own the private key for the funds for a promise that they'll pay you back.
It certainly can scale up a lot more, but there's really much more that needs to be done before then.

The more I think about this though, the less terrible it seems. It would effectively destroy most  high end ASICs and put the bottleneck on memory bandwidth (or the disk if the utxo set gets too big).  There's just the issue of lightweight clients not being able to check the chain (which they can't really do already without high difficulty and hardcoded checkpoints). 
Hopefully or someone else will make an altcoin with this built in.

Looking back, perhaps some considered them "too big to fail" as long as they had a working fiat system and kept it legal they would have been. But it seems like there's a lot going on with regard to their liabilities (BTC and fiat) that we aren't aware of yet.
Most banks that were "too big to fail", failed due to outside smaller institutions failing and causing a debt snowball effect.
MtGox failed not due to their bank cutting them off, or Bitcoin becoming broken, but due to them probably running a fractional reserve and committing outright fraud.

You can probably do 700 sig verifications per second. But can your disk also do 700 random seeks per second? Spinning disks can't, forcing nodes to use expensive ssds will make the network require special hardware and potentially alter the distributed nature of the network. 
Stealth addresses, coin join and bip 32 only offer minor improvements to privacy over just using the recommended practise of a new address for each transaction. 
The problem with the distribution is that it is much worse than the wealth distribution of fiat and security assets. It means that the big players can easily pump and dump the market, severely affecting everyone else.

ISO9001 is a standard for managing quality. Typically manufacturers get approved so they can show to potential customers that they have the ability to follow instructions well for their processes, it doesn't necessarily mean the instructions are good or appropriate. 
Basically this means they have a system for detailing the work that individuals do, like how call centre people have scripts to follow and the script won't let them give out sensitive info without answering appropriate questions or do things that the management don't want. 
In Bitcoin terms its quite meaningless and should be a low priority when compared against the problems presented by security issues.

They can do secp256k1 signature verification though and sha256, both of which are needed for verifying transactions and merkle roots. So there's a good chance GPUs or other hardware may become preferential or even required for a full node to keep up with the network if volume increases.

This is a good point, blockchains (chains of blocked data) don't have to be validated based on proof of work. A master node can create chained blocks of database transactions, sign it and broadcast it to a slave nodes, then all peers are up to date with the legitimacy and integrity of the data.

I think we're starting to see the same with cryptos now, investors don't really understand it, but think there can be "big gains", so companies like 21 give them a good presentation and some vague promises about building the equivalent of “56-KB Internet modems, international fiber cables, and wireless Internet towers” then they invest. 
They do seem to want to build some bespoke ASICs, which might give them an advantage over others, but they may still be a year away from completing design and production and actually getting a return, by which time the market could have expanded and they'll have many more competitors.

So just like the OP_TRUE OP_RETURN fatal flaw in the software that was fixed? 
I think success or failure will end up being a bit more complicated than just flaws in the system. It makes more sense for an attacker to report the flaw and claim a reward rather than steal the funds which would then become worthless.

You could probably go less, as the longest fork in March 2013 was ~100 blocks in length. 
2016 blocks is supposed to be targeted for 2 weeks, so thats a long time for everyone to store, I'd imagine to see merchants and large processors to keep that many, but smaller nodes could probably keep less without it lowering the security of the network.
@_date: 2015-02-12 10:05:05
You don't even need archive nodes. All you need to prove some OP_RETURN data is in the blockchain is the full transaction it's embedded in, the other few transaction *hashes* in the block needed to reconstruct the merkle root and the block header, then any non-archive client can check the tx is valid through the merkle root and that the header is in the main chain.
It means if we trust mining is competitive and the longest pow chain is the valid one, you have a small kb sized proof for your header, transaction and hashes in the merkle root and 80 bytes for every header in the chain (~27MB currently), it requires so little, even your phone can do it.

It's good they've managed to reduce the signature size, but it still takes more CPU cycles than Bitcoins elliptical curve cryptography to validate.

Amazon EC2 is a much easier, cheaper and safer way to do this. The cost of running an average pc will be much more expensive than running one in a datacenter.

That isn't what I'm saying, you only need a license if you're transmitting recognised currency. Selling digital goods for bitcoin is currently unregulated by the government, selling GBP for bitcoin is regulated as you're transmitting GBP.

Pcworld wrote a pretty weak article as always. The payments protocol doesn't use SSL. But it does use the X.509 certificates that SSL does. You can still make payments in the usual way. But this payments protocol will introduce a method for authenticating and receiving digitally signed invoices and receipts. To do that the merchant will need to get a certificate from a certificate authority, but payment connections will still be decentralized directly from merchant to buyer.

It would most likely be implemented ahead of time and users could be ready to start mining new blocks, so a future release would switch to a different proof of work after block number x has been mined. 
If the clients have switched, the miners dont matter, any blocks mined will be ignored and wont be added to the blockchain.
It would actually create a huge gold rush, people would start using their cpus and gpus again, it would mean that the people who actually run the client and sustain the network would be able to mine coins again, rather than just a few elitist miners who owned ASICs. 
However, this could end up with botnets claiming a large amount of the hashing power, just as is currently happening with litecoin.
I host a full bitcoind node, I have to pay for the increasing storage and network costs associated with relaying and storing transactions, yet I dont receive any of the transaction fees or mined, I remember seeing a post by satoshi, where he said that the currency and tx fees should be distributed to people running the client, due to the rise of ASICs, this wont be the case any more and it's currently leading to large organisations and pools having too much power.

They don't rely on the blockchain in the same way that SD does, they use a client seed and a server secret, they'd also have to keep the funds in a hot wallet on the play server.

The two servers aren't linked, the actual payout server which holds funds in the wallet doesn't need to serve webpages or communicate with the server that does serve the pages from satoshidice.com at all. 
The payout server doesn't have to accept incoming requests, it just connects to the bitcoin network and listens to transaction made to 1Dice... , processes the txid using the hashing algorithm and the secret and then creates the return transaction if the user is a winner.
This way, there are no secret numbers ever on a webserver or a publicly known domain, unlike say just-dice or primedice where you could possibly break in and steal funds/server secrets. 
I'm not a server admin, but that's how I would have done it.
Or maybe had the payment processor on the server at satoshidice.com, you'd have to see if he replies, it would be an incredibly bad thing to do though. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:25:52

It depends if you then make the max block size 1/600th of what it currently is, or have a maximum 1MB block every second. 
Assuming average tx size is 230 bytes.
If they decrease the size to 1/600MB for every block and 1 block per second, then they can still only confirm ~7 transactions (1200 bytes) per second. 
If they keep the size at 1MB for every block and have 1 block per second, you can confirm ~4200 transactions (1 MB) per second. But this is much larger than what is currently computationally possible, my average machine can do ~3000 ecdsa 256-bit verify operations per second, this would also have drastic effect on disk space.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:18:35
The database is stored on your system. But the indexes needed to quickly look up addresses transaction outputs aren't. Its best to use block explorer or blockchain.info for something like that.

This wouldn't give you free access, the wifi access point should allow payments to be sent to it on 8333, it can then broadcast the tx and check for double spends and that it is valid before letting the user log in.
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:02:56
True, its been a while since I looked at the protocol. I thought as I was writing this that blocks are only published with a list of the txids, rather than the full tx.
The txid is however visible to everyone else after the block is mined, so there is a risk your block will be orphaned and someone else will be able to claim the higher than normal fee.

They would take their own server offline because the panic would lead to an increase in trades. I don't actually think that, I'm just saying. I believe their issues are due to their incompetence. 
Cloudflare has seemed effective for bitstamp, but again it's really just supposed to be a cache for when your site goes down. It's true they have been working on an improved engine, but they've said this numerous times before in the past and little to nothing has been improved.

Bitcoin isn't really an extremely difficult problem to implement or invent, most of the work like the cryptography and hash trees are already well thought out and implemented in other software and the first version of bitcoind to be released by satoshi didn't really look like something produced by multiple developers.

Not really, since the user is paying the hotspot directly its very easy to send one tx to OP and another to the network. 
Granted most people might not have the knowledge to do that when radmondo launches, but eventually it may become common knowledge that you can send any tx and it will be accepted.
The method I was talking about here  infers that you don't actually keep any of the blockchain installed, so its impossible to see if a transaction is even legitimate (you dont have the database of spent or unspent outputs to see if they're used in the tx received). So if you don't broadcast the tx and do a radar to see how many peers accepted it then the user could just send you a completely fraudulent transaction which references outputs which never existed.
I agree on it being over the top for bitcoind for a while, but eventually it might become general knowledge that ragmondos wifi hotspots are vulnerable to double spends.
The method I was talking about using libbitcoin however requires you to broadcast and check peers to see if they accept the tx.

This is something to do with using signed integers instead of unsigned. The protocol calls for using unsigned (as in numbers above 0) for the transaction version. But bitcoind reads this in as a signed integer so it becomes a large negative number, rather than version 1.

You just get a much better way to interface with the transactions, compared to what bitcoind can do, there are also a few open bugs in bitcoind where listtransactions and listunspent doesnt return a full or correct set of transactions, if you spend an output using createrawtransaction, it still appears in the listunspent list and bitcoind may try and spend it again leading to a double-spent. 
You'd be able to use it to listen to all incoming tx and see if an address you own is in one of the outputs, you can also build a transaction radar (theres one in the example), where you can see how many peers accept a transaction with 0 confirmations, giving you a good idea if it will be eventually confirmed or if it is a double spend.
Overall its probably the thing you should be using if you're writing a service, bitcoind is really a reference client and not very fit for what you're saying.
Why not generate all the private keys on your local machine and only put the corresponding addresses on the server, then you dont have to relay them?

I dont really think it is, and the blockchain size means you need quite a large sd card.

No they cant.

None really, the server running the actual gambling software isn't directly accessable by the public. SD has a front end webpage and a back end to  interface with the block chain to read bets that are placed and calculate a result and send the return transaction

It depends on how many miners are after short term greed, instead of long term growth and stability of the network.

It isn't actively developed and the only reason it was created was because it was claimed scrypt could only run on a CPU, since it is an overly complicated algorithm to put on a GPU or ASIC. GPU Litecoin miners have since been released.

This info graphic isn't about time, it's about energy, assuming your machine does 1GHz and can do one increment instruction per cycle. (It can count to 1,000,000,000 in 1 second.) it would take [3.672×10^60 years](
So even if you had a trillion machines (1e12) and theres no overhead from networking it would still take 10^56 years.
I'm not a physicist, I'm assuming the smallest amount of energy required as said in this graphic is 3.4eV, the energy required to raise hydrogen from its ground state to an excited state. Not that it's possible to make a counting machine out of hydrogen.
Now not even counting all the bits, assuming the 0th bit is a hydrogen atom and raising it from its ground state to ionising it counts as a count and there is no losses. You have to spend 3.4eV 2^256 times to count all the way.
3.4eV * 2^256 = 6.31×10^58 J

I'm not sharpening any pitchforks, but their wording is stil terrible, gloating about their success meanwhile their customers were losing money in a bubble meanwhile being 3000 seconds behind the trading engine.
The 3000 second lag wasn't just caused by their 'success'  in gaining new customers, it was caused by their trading engine being terribly vulnerable to high-frequency trading and their failure to suspend trading led to people trading blind.
A bubble for bitcoin was well overdue, however yesterday people were selling off without even knowing what the current value was. This bubble bursting wasn't a normal sell-off, it was people panicing and selling off blind.

Obelisk is like a query server, so you can query for blocks or transactions, send transactions and see the history for an address from the data on your own server. 
You'd be able to build apps using your own copy of the blockchain, rather than having to rely on centralised services like blockchain.info, or the API provided by bitcoind which doesn't offer much needed API calls such as seeing the history of an address that is not inside your wallet.

You still connect to peers and they can send you data which you can validate before relaying it to others. The only difference is you have to initiate the connection to each peer, rather than one of them being able to connect to your machine.

Ever think that's a bit Many of the concepts of Bitcoin had existed for a while, hash trees, proof of work, decentralisation. 
It doesn't require a massive organisation to decide to apply these concepts to a currency, all satoshi had was an idea which he wrote an academic paper for and a basic implementation, it's far more likely that a single person though up the concept one day and implemented it himself than someone thinking it up and then requiring a large amount of people to write the bitcoind client.

Don't know why you're being downvoted, SatoshiDice uses the bet output as an input to the transaction which returns the winnings. So any bets that become invalid due to a double spent automatically get their winning transaction invalidated by the network. 
That wasn't the case when SatoshiDice launched in 2012, but they've updated their payment method since then.
SatoshiDice is so well connected that any miner is unlikely to accept a transaction which is sent there first. You could still try doing a finney attack where you mine your own block, but that would become very expensive to pull off.

It's sent to the merchant via bluetooth, but you need an internet connection to broadcast it to the bitcoin network. 
Currently nfc and qr codes only pass addresses and amounts from merchant to payer. 
In this method, the merchant received the signedtx and broadcasts it to the network, monitoring its propagation, once a large percentage of nodes accept it theres a good probability it is valid and will eventually be included in a block.
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:28:09

It should be confirmed eventually, if it isn't the money is not lost, but is respendable. However no node should relay a new transaction with a higher fee, as it should see these inputs as already being spent.

Don't trust your host, there have been numerous times that vps providers (linode) have been hacked and multiple customer servers have been accessed and drained of their funds.

Satoshi really envisioned nodes being able to mine and take block rewards and transaction fees in exchange for hosting the bitcoind client and contributing to the network.

That is not what I think, nor what I have implied at any point. 
The only information you posted from HMRC was about using Bitcoin as a currency, exchanging it for GBP is very different and does require a transmitter license. I'll contact HMRC directly to clarify this and reference your response from them.
I'm not willing to trade with you when you'll most likely have your bank account frozen and face potential legal action due to not having a transmitter license.

Increasing the max block size also doesn't have any effect on the number of transactions per second that can be accepted into the network.

That isn't the same because you're buying it off a website and you've technically already bought the product at wholesale. 
If you want to do a business where you can sell your own bitcoins then that'll probably be ok. (As most people on local bitcoins are). 
An exchange is just acting as a middleman, just as eBay will act as a middleman when people are selling digital or real goods. They need a money transmitter license. A bank wont work with you, unless you're operating within the law.

That seems like a pretty lame excuse, once someone gets your account number and sort code they'll know which bank you use anyway, so what's wrong with just telling us upfront.


I can't find any such information about this policy and it would seem odd that the HMRC would allow you to operate without a transmitter license, but require it from any other business which transmits GBP. The scanned letter on your facebook page only refers to using bitcoin as a currency, if you're handling GBP you still need a license. 
Could you tell us more about the infrastructure and technologies used by your trading engine and wallet management? I think after the issues over at mtgox and bitcoin24, people want to know more information about the systems they're trusting their money to. There seems to have been too many inexperienced people running a php/mysql combo in an unsecured environment, bitcoin24 is a great example of this.

Its not luck. A miner can include whatever transactions they want. There was news a while ago that asicminer was only generating blocks with the coinbase tx in as it is likely to propagate quicker and not become an orphan, compared to larger blocks.

A constant limit is usually a problem when sending a big transaction. When sending programmatically. I usually do a size estimate then assert the fees aren't more than 2x what is actually required. Paying 5% is not going to really be any faster than paying 2x the minimum transaction fee.

What about code that requires data from neighbouring nodes to run? You're limited by the nodes network throughput, which will be pretty poor compared to 10 Gigabit/s you can get from most providers.
Nothing can be parallelised as easy as you're saying. 
By all means, make a website where people can agree to sell CPU time for bitcoins and implement ratings, but the madness you've written inside your readme file is just impossible to accomplish.

None really, the server running the actual gambling software isn't directly accessable by the public. SD has a front end webpage and a back end to  interface with the block chain to read bets that are placed and calculate a result and send the return transaction

We can blame both bubbles on mtgox, the 2011 rise and crash was caused by a hacker inserting fake trades and the 2013 one was due to its trading engine becoming mostly unresponsive and causing people to panic sell.
Neither of these events actually has any impact on Bitcoin though, only its exchange rate and should be seen as short term hiccups, which only pump and dump sellers seem to care about. We have a much better landscape now which more trade at different exchanges than mtgox and much more interest from many people, we're on the verge of a correction, not a crash.

This is an insurance issue though, paypal will reverse the transaction and possibly do a chargeback against the bank account the funds were withdrawn to. BFL are almost certainly nearly bankrupt, so that transaction will just be debt against them. When all of that debt can't be reclaimed, anyone owed money will have to cut their losses.
Bitcoin certainly can have reversal features build on top of it, by using 2of3 addresses or other intermediate parties, this can be a plus for the consumer and businesses. But it wouldn't be effective in this case, BFL needed the money up front to get the product built in the first place. After their first batch of chips didn't work they ended up having to get another made (at a multi million dollar expense) and pushing them into this current ponzi model of asking for new orders just so they can manufacture old orders.

Yes but not everyone understands that the testnet is reset often and new devs could be naive enough to buy them.

Sorry for my cynicism, but I've seen many people saying they're going to start doing some great project that would be of great benefit to the bitcoin community, while showing no proof as such. Then with or without asking for it they receive many large (above 1BTC) tips before just disappearing. Your month old account and the content of your post just looked suspicious to me and with or without you asking, people could have sent you money thinking it might better their own interests and then you just disappear.
As for advice, all banks in the UK are terrible online. If you're looking to interface with them via an API you're stuck to web-scraping details most of the time to see the deposits and then having to do manual transfers when sending GBP outbound (possibly having to authenticate every one with a debit card and two factor authentication device). HSBC do offer an XML API, but from what little I've heard it's a monstrosity. 
Bitstamp are registered in the uk, but have a bank account in Slovenia, the bank they are using might offer some good API functionality, but I'm unsure. But then costs are higher for your UK customers when trying to do a SEPA transfer.

He meant you could redefine the value of Btc with respect to satoshis. Which is probably a good idea. More people are familiar with using values above zero.  Satoshis are the fundamental unit, the value of a bitcoin is only 100000000 because the software and specification says it has to be.

A 10 minute confirmation time is not broken though, it strikes a balance between preventing orphan blocks or slow confirmations.

How many businesses get paid $0.007? This is necessary to avoid blockchain spam, such as the mass 1 satoshi transactions that satoshidice send out.

In the UK you still need a license to be a money transmitter, it's irrelevant that the FSA has not made a specific statement about bitcoin.
If you run a company that transmits money from one person to the other you need a license, it does't matter if you're using bitcoin because you're still transferring GBP.

Put your money and trust in a bitcoin e-wallet then, find one which will let you set limits for maximum transfer amounts one that will insure you against losing your password and send you verification codes in the post, or make your own service. 
That service still has risk due to theft or irresponsible lending or acts of God, just as a fiat bank account does. Just as having bitcoins on your pc, or cash stuffed under your mattress.
So it's up to you to decide which you think is safer, leaving your bitcoin on your own pc, on an e-wallet or on a paper wallet. Just as you have to decide if you want your cash in your house or in a bank.

Yes you can accept 0 confirmation payments, as long as your merchant is only connected to well connected nodes and not straight to the buyer and the amount isn't very large it becomes financially infeasible.

I suggest you remove this post as your supervisor finding out that you have been asking others to do this project for you could lead to you facing academic disciplinary actions.

As far as I see it, they only care about profit. They don't care about the market going crazy, mass buying and selling is what makes them money. They could have put in massive anti-ddos measures long before now, instead they've done relatively little to improve their trading engine and service towards their customers.
We can't be sure they are even being dosed I haven't seen any proof posted by them. Maybe they just shut down some of their frontend servers every now and again to make it look like a ddos, so they can profit from all the sweet panic trading. &lt;/conspiracy&gt;

No it depends what sort of difficulty and time spacing they have chosen for the blocks. It means validating the signatures on transactions to ensure they are valid, which needs to be done before you can even think about putting those transactions in a block.

They posted about this [here]( the other day. 
Its pretty much impossible to implement in a decentralised manner, you still need a central authority to make bank deposits to and from some of the things they're written and the amount of times they've asked for thousands of pounds for donations it seems like a scam.

Transactions in zerocoin are the same as bitcoin but you can also do special minting transactions where the funds are cleaned using a zero knowledge proof. 
If you're sending to someone else the format is planned to be similar to bitcoins and there will be proof in the blockchain.

Strange that he's dumping it all in one address though, rather than sending each to a different address and making it look like the funds have been taken by lots of people, or just spent normally. 
Maybe he's only put it all there because he's waiting to publish contact information for people to get it back. Otherwise, all coins that have been in that address are now tainted.

Then it's a digital commodity, the exchanger still needs to be registered as they're processing GBP which is recognised as currency and if you call it a commodity then you'd have to pay VAT.
Paypal, western union, exchanges like mt gox are all transmitting GBP which is recognised as currency and is subject to transmission regulation. 
The reason there are no exchanges in the UK is because there isn't anyone who is registered and licensed to act as an exchange, the reason intersango / britcoin aren't running is because they weren't registered and their banks cut them off. It's mostly down to banks not wanting to work with unregistered businesses, not because they have a distaste for bitcoin.

some vps like linode are a bit different, their old security breach which lost thousands of bitcoins last year was due to a breach in their admin panel.
EC2 with an encrypted wallet and two-factor auth makes it practically impossible for anyone to get in. I can trust amazon with security much more than many other vps providers.

Biggest heap of PR bullshit I've ever read. All deposit addresses are generated randomly for each game and so all transactions in and out are anonymised. So there's no way for them to prove what amount of money has actually been paid in or out.


It's not like the house edge to any casino game is a "well-guarded secret", anyone can look into the rules of a game and calculate the house edge by themselves. 
Also there is no way to prove the results are fair, they are very able to change any result or even take your whole funds and say the deposit address doesn't belong to them and there is nothing the player can do.

Are you creating a site like local bitcoins, where buyers and sellers can contact each other, or have you built an exchange and a trading engine? 
If you're going to be an exchange you need a money transmitting license, otherwise no bank will open an account with you and you could be liable to prosecution.
Any chance we can see into your closed beta? It's pretty hard to take posts like this seriously, many people post saying they've created the next big thing with no proof using an account that is only a month or so old and people stupidly tip them.

They wouldn't just give up that much power though, they only have ~20% of the network and people seem to trust them. If they were having 49% there would be worries. 
I have to think it's power loss at the one of facilities they're running in.
Edit: Looking closer, it's been dropping since the 14th. Hardware failure? Them turning machines off because they want to be less than 20% would cause a massive drop in their share price.

They aren't currently accepting deposits, they'll likely take all the money in and run off with it, just like atlantis and black flag.

Thing is they needed to spend the pre-order money to manufacture the chips in the first place. ASIC manufacture is a $1m+ industry, just to get the initial batch made. I'm pretty sure they've burnt through all of their pre-order money re manufacturing chips that were faulty by design and are now reliant on a ponzi-type scheme, where they need the money of new orders just to manufacture the previous orders.

Despite what many people may say, accepting 0-confirmation transactions is very fast and very safe especially for small transaction amounts. As long as the network stays healthy, no node should relay any tx output that it knows has already been spent. 
I have accepted many &lt; 1BTC transactions with 0-confirmations by blocking incoming connections and waiting for the tx to propagate throughout the network, without being worried about double-spending, the cost of someone pulling off a double spend and reversing the transaction before 1 confirmation is very high. 
Still if you're transacting larger amounts and want to wait longer, that is fine, an average of 10 minutes to an hour, depending on how much risk you want.
Compare this to credit card companies, that can reverse the transaction up to 120 days after the charge.

The tranasaction you linked is still waiting for confirmation due to the low fee. There's information about the standard relay settings here. 


This transaction has only taken so long because some of its inputs were not confirmed for a while. 
If you send a transaction from your own node and you need a fee, but dont add one, most nodes around you will ignore and refuse to relay that output, depending on your client it may show back up in your wallet, but it wont have been distributed throughout the network

The difference is, you're receiving the money directly and forwarding it to someone else.
You can sell your own mp3s, or any data you want. However if I set up an mp3 exchange, I hold an mp3 or other data in escrow for GBP then I'm a money transmitter because i'm acting as escrow and I'm transmitting GBP.
If you're selling goods using paypal or an other payment method, then they're transferring the money and they need the license, but you become locked into their terms.
The problem with exchanges is that they're the middle-man and they're handling GBP, it doesn't matter that bitcoin or any binary string is being exchanged for it.
Picture this for transferring a digital good, bitcoin or otherwise, where you are buying this good off me for GBP. You send GBP through paypal or bank transfer. 
GBP  [gox] --------&gt; [paypal/bank] --------&gt; [bobalot]
BTC  [bobalot] --------&gt; [gox]
Now I own an exchange and I allow users to deposit GBP and trade whatever digital good they like.
GBP [gox] --------&gt; [exchange bank account] --------&gt;[bobalot]
BTC [bobalot] --------&gt; [gox or escrow service]
The exchange has acted as a money transmitter in this instance, they have transmitted GBP similar to how paypal would if you buy a digital good using their method to send money. If I wanted to open an exchange were people would exchange BTC for digital or real goods, I'd have to be registered as a money transmitter because I'm dealing with GBP, the governments stance on BTC is irrelevant.
VAT is a different matter that I don't really get into, if you sell an item, real or digital that is "enjoyed" in the European economic zone then you must pay VAT.

I meant they could play as a client as they know the server secret and what the result will be.

I'm unsure, but the medium which the money transfers through would have to be. Eg, eBay might not actually need a money transfer license, I worded that wrong. Paypal however would have to, since you're transferring GBP for goods. 
If Bitcoin becomes recognised currency, then it will probably be required that escrow services have to register if they are operating out of a country like the UK.

yes, basically when you go to a merchant, rather than just scanning a QR code or getting their address over NFC, they'll send a signed invoice saying to pay an amount to a new blank address 1AbCdEf.... 
Then the transaction in the blockchain acts as public evidence that the payment was sent and you have a digitally signed invoice from the merchant as proof-of-purchase.

Ha don't worry, but honestly, if you want to set up a service where people can pay btc for an hour of cpu time from users are rated and can be considered trustworthy then do. This just cant be done in the manner that you are speaking, miners mine because they can get the coins, not because someone else will give coins to them.
However, trust is still an issue, i've used amazon hpc to do a lot of research work in the past. Some people would end up with trust (and legal) issues if they start giving out their data to a remote machine to do calculations on.

I don't think you understand what I meant, why bother buying a miner for 10BTC if it will never create that amount in its life time. It is unlikely that you will be less well off, ignoring the fact that some companies have taken money and not delivered on their products. 
 It doesn't matter what you sell at the exchange rate for, what matters is how much you get in over how much you get out. Currently the market is saturated with hash power and that's increasing near exponentially. 
Why buy a machine that can make you $50 over its lifetime, when it costs $100?
