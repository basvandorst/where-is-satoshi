Hey does anyone have the high res version of this gif?
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:47:30
No, it will take at least three months. But hey, at least let this be a lesson about online wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:25:40
Yeah that does soften the blow.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:43:05
Thank you.

I think some places just request that you not use a credit card for small purchases, rather than require it. That could be a way of getting around this limitation.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:24:06
It kind of does, but I don't think ASICs are that useful for non Bitcoin related things..
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:55:37
Have you read the original paper by Satoshi Nakamoto? It might not be in quite the vein you're looking for, but could still be helpful.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:28:04
Out of curiosity, what else are they good at?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:39:48
It's generally bad news for miners, especially those who use GPUs, as profits (well, production at least) will be going down.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:20:48
With the right graphics card, that could still be after electricity costs - although that is something people tend not to think about.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:56:30
Honestly, even that amount is higher than I would have expected.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:00:30
Yes, though you may make more mining something such as lite coin and then converting to bitcoins at an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:33:38
Apparently not, could you please link it? Also, even if the operators of BTC Guild have the best of intentions, having the largest pool makes them quite the target. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:19:08
You don't get many bitcoins mining with a GPU, but it is still profitable. It will probably remain so until there is much wider proliferation of ASICs.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:54:55
It is technically optional, but you need a fee to guarantee that your transaction will be processed quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:51:50
Thank you. That was very helpful.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:27:59
It all depends on how widespread Bitcoin becomes, and how many people want a piece of that action - if Bitcoin someday becomes, say, as popular as Paypal, that is definitely within the realm of possibility.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:10:54
I suppose this is possible, but I believe a large drop in the hash rate would incentivise people with any hardware at all to begin mining, which could help mitigate the problem somewhat.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:41:15
That's true, smaller pools do have more variability to them. Then again, I think at this point MTRed is at a size where the variability isn't too annoying, we do find several blocks a day.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:23:45
Me too, and you're welcome!
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:07:07
I mine because I build a new computer with a 7950 earlier this year, and I have stupidly cheap electricity. Also it's still kinda chilly out.
For reference, this makes about 3 bit cents a day if I'm not using the computer for anything else. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:14:53
MTRed is a good choice, they don't have fees so you actually have the potential for a bit better payout. Also, over time the size of a pool doesn't actually matter for your personal profit - your hashrate as a percentage of the total hashrate is what's important there. All the pool size does is determine if your payout is in a lot of little bits, or a few larger chunks. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:18:23
To the first miner to include your transaction in a newly minted block.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:45:42
The escrow system might be shady, but the other transaction system worked alright for me - just make sure the seller shows you the confirmation code (or whatever it's called) before actually giving up the physical dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:25:42
How does that work anyways?
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:23:07
Yes, this is probably as close to anonymous as you're going to get. But you probably shouldn't use he escrow feature, some people on reddit have had bad experiences with that. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:57:19
No, because you would have created an unencrypted copy of it. It's like if somebody had an unencrypted backup on a USB drive and you found that.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:04:36
As far as I know it's more of a dollar bill on a string situation. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:43:50
This is likely true, but I think that most people don't actually require the maxiumum possible level of anonymity, and those who do can go through the trouble of running a full node. 
While this is inconvenient, it doesn't seem to me like it's a critical issue. Perhaps you could could elaborate on how this is necessarily a problem?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:42:56
It's too risky, there have been scams before where someone will sell a bitcoin via paypal, and then the buyer claims they never received it. There would be no way for the seller to be compensated in such an event.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:11:16
People seem to cash out because either they are happy with the current price, or because they believe holding on to Bitcoins is more risky than it is worth. Also, some people do cash out their initial investment and keep the rest to see what it does.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:16:25
Hey, that millibit could be worth a lot someday!
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:07:50
Gold is very nice if you want something that is tangible, although even if your internet access is temporarily cut, your Bitcoins are not destroyed - you just will not be able to use them for transactions until you are able to reconnect to the network. Also, Bitcoins have certain advantages when compared to Gold; they are much easier to divide and move around. So really, it just depends on what you want in a value store.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:26:14
@_date: 2013-04-27 07:40:15
No, this is not worth it. Also, I believe mining LTC has recently become less profitable than BTC, owing to the fact that 1 litecoin is worth about $4 right now, and the difficulty has gone up a lot recently.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:03:20
My understanding of the situation (which is limited, I admit) is that this limitation is caused by the maximum size of any given block in the blockchain. Since one block can only hold so many transactions, and because blocks are found on average every 10 minutes, only a certain number of transactions can be confirmed in a 10 minute period. 
To solve this, the maximum size of a block could be increased (this would have to happen with new versions of the bitcoin client, similar to what happened between versions 0.7 and 0.8). However, some people are wary of this change because it could enable more spamming of transactions. However, this is basically a requirement if Bitcoin is to surpass a certain level of popularity.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:38:02
file a claim once they begin the claims process. Details in the link. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:37:00
Well it does have scaling problems at the moment (the whole transactions per second thing), but those can likely be fixed in the near future.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:07:23
MTRedhas been great lately, and has no fees - something that BTC Guild can't claim. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:08:09
Could someone with relevant expertise vouch for the veracity of this information?
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:20:32
trc = Terracoin I assume?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:20:19
"They" is the operators of BTC Guild. It is easier because the miners in a pool are essentially controlled by the pool operators for as long as they mine for that pool. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:04:20
Has somebody placed a few extra zeros in the market? :P
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:11:44
Yeah, there's a DDoS or something been going on.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:57:38
Ah, that's a shame. I can definitely see how you wouldn't want to run up your electricity usage with prices like that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:23:58
More specifically, probably don't use the escrow feature.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:09:26
No only is there one, but it has no fees.
