actually it *doesn't* look like a bubble at all
    400 * (1.07^25) = 2170
i.e. the SP of 400 in 1990 (25 years ago) should grow to 2170 assuming a 7% increase per year.
the question is ... is 7% a reasonable growth target for SP stocks? i think i read somewhere that 6-7% is the traditional average .. since way way before 1990 :)

@_date: 2015-05-18 02:46:18
except that the tax would be in Euros
now here is the rub: how does the government put a value on his unspent bitcoins? Given the large amount of them, if he were to sell them today the price would plunge .. so you could argue they have a lower value than the theoretical.
in fact, he could argue that if he tried to sell any, he would fear US would hunt him down and torture him .. therefore his assets are worthless as he can never sell them

Unlike fiat money, Bitcoins will not be manufactured infinitely. We are slowly approaching the maximum number that the system will create.
Much of our economy is a ponzi-scheme is disguise - the promise of more to come by investing now. In the near future, Bitcoins will prevent this type of speculation .. and therefore lose part of its appeal. For this reason, it is unlikely Bitcoins will take over

i doubt he would be able to trade them for cash .. as the exchanges would have records of the transactions. 
i have no doubt the snoops are monitoring every exchange closely. so anybody who trades bitcoins would immediately be on their radar.
you cant even try to escape with those laundering operations which swap coins around - they are even more closely scrutinized -- anybody who used them is waving a big red flag and yelling from their rooftop "hey NSA, come and get me"
even if he exchanged bitcoins only for goods or services .. he runs the risk that the provider may be scrutinized by the snoops and have to answer questions which may reveal clues as to his identity. granted this is low probability stuff, but it can happen.
i would imagine if he traded only trivial amounts it would be hard to pinpoint him -- but any substantial amount of trade would already have revealed him. My guess is either
 (i) the NSA/FBI already know who he is, or
(ii) his bitcoins are effectively worthless bc he cant anonymously trade them
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:22:05
viruses and other malware is an unfair comparison - they are closed source. also, malware is only effective if you don't know you are infected.
with bitcoins, people are willingly engaging in its use. one could argue that satoshi is such a mastermind that he nefariously engineered malware into the opensource that has been able to fool the thousands of scrutineers of the code, but that would be drawing too long a bow.

this should help:
over the next 5 years there will be about 650,000 btc's created and given to miners. That represents about 5% of the btc's in circulation. This is the fee that i am talking about. 
Now, eventually, this handout will dwindle to nothing when we reach the max 21M bitcoins. But all that means is that the cost of minining will need to be recouped by direct fees.
How much will this be in the longer term? here is a crude estimate:
based at 650,000 btc's, this translates to $200M/year in payments to miners. In order for the industry to be viable, and given the current high risk of the industry. the cost to them to deliver the mining would have to be not 80% or 50% of the total revenue, but more like 20% .. i.e. $40M/year (or 1% of total btc's). For this industry to be viable in the future, i would expect the total revenue to be about double the cost .. i.e 2%. Now, it doesnt end there; moores law says computation will get much cheaper, but at the same time the current volume of transactions would be much lower than compared to credit cards. If btc were to go more mainstream, there would have to be a very large jump in volume (which translates to mining activity). I would say moore's law and extra volume probably will cancel each other out.
There you go: 2% is what i estimate will be the fee required by miners to keep the circus moving. That looks incredibly like the credit card companies, but even if you disagree with this analysis,  what should be not clear at all is that btc will have significantly less transaction fees than cc.


the overall management of the risk is much more complicated than printing your private information on paper. the underlying security mechanism are your private keys. but where are you going to securely store them?
your home is subject to burglary, fire, flood, tornado, earthquake, war, etc. So that is out. Maybe you will use the cloud, with your keys encrypted with a password you either commit to memory or write down somewhere. What happens when you forget either the password or the details of where to get the keys? ok, so you share your details with your spouse. do you trust them? what happens if you both die at the same time? too bad your kids get zip. ok, so now you think youll create a legal document .. do you trust your lawyer?? you may like to print this stuff out and store it in a number of bank vaults. Did I just say "bank" ? sorry we cant do that one.
now that's not the end of it. locking up your keys like this makes it hard to get to them. that means you cant really use this scheme for micro payments without designing staging areas in between. there's more than a hour involved in this, and the layperson is guaranteed to fuck it up
but all of this is not the real problem. at some point you need to get on the internet to transact. eeek. pray your daily-upgrade of firefox or windows or other has not been compromised in between. or pray your android phone has not received a deadly silent mms which gives the hacker full control of your phone, remotely. the amount of trojans and other viruses is exploding right now, and good luck if you go this route.
in my country if i did not do a cc transaction that appears on my bill, i call the bank and they immediately refund me. that's why it costs a lot to use cc's. they wear it (it doesn't happen in yours? that's a different problem ... american private enterprises controlling governments, not the other way around ... )

I am not sure we are in that phase yet, but I believe that Bitcoin will, in the longer term, settle down to be valued in proportion to a "weighted" average of all the fiats in the world.
by "weighted", i am envisaging an algorithm which represents how much fiat and their relative strengths exists in the world at the time. So BTC going to be very steady indeed. 
As an example, if the overall world ecconomy is printing 5% fiat (weighted average by say trade), and we have reached the max 21M bitcoins (i.e. bitcoin inflation is 0%), then I expect BTC to rise at 5% against this average.
Even if hyperinflation takes hold some third-world countries, you will find the weiighted average changes little. Bitcoin, as a "world" currency will dampen any shocks in certain countries.
However, we are not at steady-state yet. This year, i understand 10% of Bitcoins will be created and given to miners. For the next 4 years after that it will be 5% per year. But most importantly, the Bitcoin universe doesn't make or sell too many goods or services. The current value ~$250 figure is there to support only the speculators who got in since it all started. And at only a $4B cap, its actually an insignificant toddler in the big game.

that guy said some good things, but his analysis of gold seemed way off. Over the last 100 years gold has sucked vs Dow or S&amp;P. Just google gold vs dow for data and you will see.
he claims it keeps up. so that's bollocks (at least for the last 100 years). he also claims it is because it becomes harder to mine it. bollocks again .. there is plenty of gold in the hills, and mining companies hold back production artificially in order to maintain a decent price for their efforts.
gold has traditionally been a hedge against currencies because it was initially rare, and it was something you can hold and it doesnt decay. currencies may come and go, but gold was always constant and hard to get.
bitcoins are as much imagination as are currencies. i think it is flawed for him to compare bitcoins to gold because of his nonsensical time-restriction argument. but even if you could compare it to gold ... all the pointers are that in the long term it is going to be a poor investment.

btc is not immune to those forces, eg
* there is an inherent fee in mining .. everybody pays evenly by "printing" more bitcoins and paying the miners. And when this starts to dwindle as we reach the max number of bitcoins, miners will need to charge a fee
* unless you spend a lot of time (and are capable enough to) doing it yourself, storing your wealth "securely" involves payments to third parties .. whom you have to somehow trust ... sounds like an oxymoron to me
* currently there are about $40B worth of btc in circulation .. that's a drop in the ocean when seen globally. btc is not immune to market manipulation by big players. GE, Exxon, Chevron, and Berkshire Hathaway together have 10x as much just in cash reserves.

digital cash is available with Debit cards right now. Transaction fees may be low with bitcoin right now, but there is a lot of overhead underneath it (not just the blockchain maintenance, but also wallets, security mgt, etc) that will cost.


that actually doesn't address the issue. If I have greenbacks in my hand, i can trade these for goods in america (whilst it remains the dominant currency). Whilst the government wields power, it is backed by the government because, as Krugman puts it, you use it to pay taxes. This merry-go-round keeps the government, and hence order and security, alive.
until crypto is backed by US (or large trusted government) Treasury bonds, it cant be guaranteed by any one entity to be tradeable for anything. I.e. nothing backs it. This has nothing to do with the algorithm or the virtual nature of it ... it has simply to do with the fact that it is in no large-institutions interest to ensure it is worth fighting over at any point in time.
this cryptocurrency kryptonite (i.e. no govt owns it) is similar to the problem with the Euro (and Greece). Because Greece doesn't own its currency, it cant print more of it when there is good reason to do so.

i don't understand why you are treating A's REA as independent of A.

yes you are right with export/import
the thing is that Greece is crippled with a debt that has got too big. Its import/export balance sheet would actually look ok except for this huge debt.
and there is an argument that the debt was Greece's own fault but i think there is more to it. The banks were eager to lend more that Greece could pay, and the government probably got their budgets wrong. The problem that I see now is that a central manager should be stepping in and helping a country that made errors and are now trying to stay afloat with an anchor tied to is neck. They need help to wipe this debt clean and be allowed to start again.
now, as for printing .. yes it's like a tax .. except it's a bit more evenly spread, because the rich know how to minimise tax with offshore havens. but more importantly it's realising the money from devaluing assets (as opposed to taking income from its people) .. this is an important difference .. as many are asset-rich yet income-poor.
but this is not your point ... which is you cant just devalue assets to get out of trouble. Sometimes there are good reasons to print. For example, no private company wants to , say (it's a theoretical) lay fast internet infrastructure, because it is not economically feasible. But a government may see longer-term broader benefits to having it .. so effectively it will be an economic plus .. only it's for the greater community, not for any one enterprise. So here it makes sense for a once-off "making" of money ...which means everyone pays a bit for it. Another example is when a non-uniform demographics means a disproportionately high number of young adults are entering the workforce .. more paper is necessary, but that does not mean your real gdp will decrease ... it merely means that printing will put more money in the hands of new adults who will in turn increase the economy.

two problematic examples:
(i) IGOT is bigger than B's REA. B has no chance against his guns. Maybe IGOT is a bad example, but take Comcast or Exxon as A. Good luck finding an REA willing to go to war for you. That's assuming guns are even legal in this country. The only institution that can legally use guns to coerce is the government .. hence you need to falls back to one arbitrator
(ii) IGOT and B agree to negotiate. Both parties genuinely see themselves in the right .. even after all the facts are laid out. This is the equivalent of a stalemate. Your argument is that it is better for both parties to find a middle ground .. but each party doesn't agree with you. Each party and REA are 100% convinced they are right and don't want to budge. Do we fall back to "possession is 100% of the law" ? I smell another war looming.
The kingpin to your argument is "Enforcement". J don't want to live in a society where Enforcement is allowed to be delivered by private enterprises. Enforcement is at best left to governments. Even that is a problem ... because there is no one world-REA .. so who is right in say the dispute over Tibet?

although gold has some practical use (other than jewellery), there is plenty of gold to be found in the world.
countries have stocked up on gold as a hedge ... but that is not the biggest problem, which is that gold mines also have access to plenty of yet-to-be-mined gold
the gold mining companies scale back production when then the price is low (to create an artificial demand). but when the price goes up they mine more.
the bottom line is that gold is neither rare nor very useful .. so trying to use it as a standard is a flawed strategy

@_date: 2015-07-08 16:59:11
to clarify, does this mean that a transaction is "locked-in" as soon as the first confirmation comes thru? (10min - 24hrs depending on load/priority)? so if I draw a timeline:
     A  = 0mins   - transaction requested
     B  = 10min   - first confirmation
     C  = 100min - 36th confirmation
then can i abort the transaction up till point B?
more importantly, what happens if only ONE confirmation comes thru? Is that a valid transaction, or still pending? Exactly how many are required to make it valid ("you're *supposed* to wait for 36 .." does not sound exact )

@_date: 2015-07-13 15:28:58
yes, understood
i was implying that there is no limit to the amount of crypto-currency money ... we know Bitcoins will max out at 21M, but there are a myriad of alternatives which means the maximum of these types is "sort of" unlimited ... although granted it's not as simple as that
on a side note, not being able to print money is actually part (if not the major part) of greece's problem. A bitcoin-only world currency would amplify these sorts of troubles many-many-fold. It should be avoided at all costs.
In fact the maximum limit of 21M Bitcoins tells us that the value of BTC will (in the long term, i.e. 5+ years) only rise by an amount equal to the rise in the trade-weighted average of all currency inflation rates. Historically that's 6% or so .. not a bad investment but it wont ever be stellar. In fact, it will be a lot like investing in a broad stock index like the Dow, but probably more dull
However, not sure what BTC will do in the next 5 years, but if you put a gun to my head i would say it will maintain its current rate ~us$300 or maybe rise a few pct per year. But there is a lot of speculation to go before it settles to a steady-state ... so i'm not confident in this range.
