I've been in your spot. It's not easy. And trust me, I actually get paid to explain other complicated technology to people. The concept of Bitcoin or digital cash, the distributed ledger and least of all cryptography are so far beyond most people that explaining it to them is like trying to explain why the world is not flat to folks back in the day. We're talking about people who may not know how email works. It's not that these folks aren't clever, it's like speaking Greek to someone who doesn't know it. 
There is no question the best analogy I've heard of is that Bitcoin is like the Internet in 1995 before Facebook, Google and Yahoo. But it's worse than that. Bitcoin today is really like the Internet in 1985 before Netscape. Here's the problem, Bitcoin really isn't for the masses right now. If you know people who forget their passwords or need help getting their email or don't know how to upload photos to Facebook or don't know where on their computer photos get copied to when you plug your camera into the computer or can't figure out online banking or don't know what the "s" in https is or don't update their Windows or Mac or office - Bitcoin is absolutely, definitely, certainly not for them.  
Take a look on this very subreddit at how often people don't understand how wallets work or are suicidal when their coins don't show up after sending them or don't know why Bitcoin core makes their computer sound like it's gonna take off for space launch or use an incorrect tx fee. Two years after we see that last post is when Bitcoin will be at the very beginnings of hitting critical mass.

This is an Orwellian nightmare. ID, palm print and facial scan? What's next, dna and blood sample? Honestly, the only thing this will accomplish is identity theft. What is to stop someone from taking their legitimately bought coins, with all that identification, and then run them through any competent implementation of coinjoin or its successor?

Soon it won't matter.

Uh, how about like planes and satellites falling out of the sky, trains derailing, food not making it to your open maw from the places they make food, factories exploding, oh, and, the complete crash of the modern day financial system. 
So, ya, Bitcoin not working anymore is the least of our concerns. 
Have a nice day :)

What you're getting at is a distributed database/network. But mostly distributed computing. Bitcoin itself is a form of distributed computing. I work for Basho, we make the distributed database, Riak. Riak works in a similar fashion to what you mentioned, each node in a Riak cluster represents 1/Nth the data and processing power of the total cluster. Needless to say, a Riak cluster does not operate in a hostile environment. All nodes in the cluster work together, are homogeneous and are operated by the same organization. There would be much to consider to implement a system as you describe but I don't think it is out of the question.

Counterpoint. I moved a non trivial sum of btc out of coinbase earlier this week. No problems.

Thanks for all your hard work on this. Please pardon the noob questions. I'm familiar with the concept but new to the specifics implemented here. Thanks in advance!
-are market maker coins "deposited" somewhere?
-What is the market returning for market makers? Aka what are the avg fees to "join" some amount of btc? 
-How do those fees get paid? 
-To which address?

"...flows through cables anchored in the New York area."
See "carrier hotel." That's the building Google bought in NYC for 2 billion dollars a few years back.

Bitcoin is the killer app of the Internet. Also, Betarigs seems like a good time. That is all. Move along.

Haven't we established that's "not a good thing."
