The second they do I'm tempted to plop down for some FPGAs elsewhere and give it a go. We'll see.

You're making me scratch my head, dude.  
So I shouldn'tve felt like a dodged a bullet if I lost $4k?

Not to be a dick, but he was really poo-pooing ASIC machines about 8 months ago before announcing his site was going to be producing them last fall.  
One wonders if he actually was aiming to fail by keeping some big buyers out of the Butterfly Labs queue by offering his product and now that he's out, they'll be queued up behind everyone else over at BFL.

Yeah, but it wouldn't have effected me the way I was doing it. I'd be fucked; I was going to be purchasing boxes from one of his people that was going to be helping him with launch (buddy/friend/acquaintance/whoeverthefuck) in order to get him out from under it and I'd be outside of queue getting them before people who were in the queue.  
Now that *nothing* is shipping, there would've been no process in place to get my money back from a 3rd party, only those that are queued up.

0%, 18 month, absolute failure maybe recomp part of the cost by selling to the diehards...  
No, I know of worse places to borrow money.

But I wasn't buying bitcoins, I was buying hardware.  
It's good to have responsible amounts of money back up a credit purchase, but honestly, I'd rather have taken a chance with this on credit so that I'd just have collection agencies after us rather than not having money for, say, rent and food.  
Ultimately I backed out entirely after I did the math in a best case scenario after estimating the difficulty the machines I was going to buy weren't going to pay themselves for at least a year.  
I understand the community trying to tow the line of "it's not about money", "you're supposed to be assisting in reinforcing the strength of our commodity", yadda, yadda, but really, that's garbage. If there's not reasonable compensation in setting up boxes to suck my power and then the labor (mine) invested into it in order to keep them running, I've already lost interest.

And we just saw one fold it in. Avalon's announced product isn't as aggressive in it's price/performance and BFL is... well, there's a lot of FUD about BFL even though they've successfully shipped product in the past.  
Dunno. All these places (save for Avalon) said they were going to ship in January. BFL's site *still* says that unless they changed it last night. Maybe the Hardware Comparison Chart wasn't kidding in calling it vaporware which isn't a bad prediction considering they made it nearly six months ago.

Wow.  
One of his people on the forum very nearly convinced me to buy some of the units off him since he ordered more than what his investors were interested in financially supporting and it was tempting since he was way up in the front of the queue to receive. So a late comer like me would've had a shot that, even by paying a small premium, would get the leg up on everyone else.  
Let me tell you that I don't have $4k laying around. I would've been using my family's credit card.  
I feel like I've dodged a bullet.  
I'm incredulous.
