bspend here, we installed this btm (in parthership with easybit)..anyway, we are looking for a location for a 2-way, getting a good location and an owner who is willing to accept new technology is quite a challenge..so any Greeks reading this, please help if you can get a location, if you do, we are installing a 2-way ASAP
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:48:45
ok, already corrected :)
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:40:24
no KYC
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:43:09
No, but since it just became operational the liquidity is low to test things first, it will be increased
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:42:27
Because it is not easy to get a location for a BTM. I am looking for a central location for a 2-way. Also I didn't find it hard to access, it's less than half an hour by train from central Athens
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:43:27
Find a location
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:20:09
yes i have and no luck so far
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:19:40
some test settings remained, fee is 5%, you can check again
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:58:25
no it wouldn't :) it has a big cashbox :D

"Do you have a Bitcoin ATM network in Greece?"
First, it's incredibly difficult to obtain bitcoins. The most common method -- buying them in an online marketplace -- requires sending a wire transfer from a bank. But banks in Greece are closed.
they don't mention the simple buy by cash option at the Bitcoin ATM  no other requirements but have some cash on you :)

In the case of the larger retailers I believe it is a great marketing move that I think pays off itself.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:06:32
Yes it is a rising purchasing power but the more it rises the more people tend to hold to it no?

I was thinking about that as well, and while it seems at first that Bitcoin world would be no better than the old Gold standard world, there is one important difference. If ever Bitcoin economy becomes too centralized and corrupt and people feel it as oppressive, they can simply switch to another blockchain / crypto. You could argue that you could similarly switch from gold to some rare item X, but that's in reality much harder if you have to look for some new, globally fairly distributed, rare natural resource and get people in sync without the digital technology. That's why people in the past just had to deal with an oppressive gold standard economy where the few were financing wars etc. With crypto, imho, it is much harder for some elite to sit back and watch others fight their wars

yes it might be a question of a ratio... It is more of a speculation but maybe they spend a smaller ratio of what they gained by raise of the value

ermmm... bspend.com
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:33:05
I totally agree with it. Until you have an impulse to spend them with the combination of the price volatility the motivation to keep them is mostly greater than the willingnes of spending.
The major exceptions are enthusiasts and greater anonymity seekers. And I would also say that spending small amounts of bitcoins should not be affected by the hoarding incentive if the information about bitcoin payments and usage in general reaches more and more mainstream users. I believe some more time has to pass to reach that

that is weird..seems to be working for other players. so what do u see when u start? if you are a new player u should see the current map and in the top Start command?
But seems you already started if you have options such as Deposit etc..

Etherization is the first decentralized strategy game. On ethereum blockchain, but you can easily buy some ether with shapeshift through metamask plugin for chrome. Good luck!
More info:  A contest coming soon...
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:31:53
which claim? can u be more specific?
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:44:57
the title was just a joke. i am not a communist, but i was pointing out that bitcoin has self regulating properties that people promoting it don't mention. for example, you will have people saying how does a completely free market regulate monopolies, economic recessions etc..which are valid claims.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:27:52
why, i think open source crypto currencies have this self regulating property which is extremely important. u'd have to be very naive to think that traditional free market will just work on it's own without the need for anti-trust laws etc..but because users can easily switch to alternative cryptos, government interventionism becomes unnecessary. i think people misunderstood my post
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:54:21
that's exactly what i was trying to say, and is what's brilliant about it. people also couldn't accept that light is a particle and a wave at the same time. so bitcoin imho transcends all current systems, and u can't box it into any conventional category, it's like many things combined, but then again a new concept all together. it's exactly like quantum mechanics of finance, and it will still take some time for people to better understand it
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:24:52
haha lol, i'm far from being a socialist, but i think people overlook some sides of bitcoin and point out that it's a get rick quick scheme. so i think it's a good way to argue with communists
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:18:58
i know :D that's why i think it's interesting stuff, it really helps with the public image of btc
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:14:14
yes, it can be shipped to any country pretty much. it's also a nice gift for grown up ppl based on their old drawings to evoke some memories
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:02:46
no i haven't, but when you want to be taken seriously by the mainstream, it's not good to be that radical. people also say that switching to btc would end wars etc. it would end some wars, or some type of wars, but i'm pretty sure it wouldn't end all wars, people were using gold before fiat and there were wars. so mainstream gets this "cult" impression on btc

:D no. unique plush toys produced based on mostly kids' drawings
