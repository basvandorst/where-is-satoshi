Why bcash? If you're considering accepting an alt coin instead of BTC than both litecoin and dogecoin have cheaper fees, faster transaction times, and more daily transactions than bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:31:09
I know BTC has problems right now that make it often impractical for low value transactions. The fact is though most people if they know anything about cryptos only know bitcoin. BTC still far and away has the most merchant, community, mining, and development support of any crypto. If you're only concerned about fast and cheap then many alts are faster and cheaper then both btc and bcash... But none of them have the acceptance and support levels that bitcoin has.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:15:36
This guy is being an idiot describing a worst case scenario.
It is true though that fees can be high enough to discourage your customers from paying with btc if it is a low price transaction. But it's cool that you want to at least give them the option. Also transaction times can range from minutes to hours and in extreme cases days. As a service provider you have to decide if you are okay with customers paying and you waiting sometimes long after they are long gone to receive your payment. Most people aren't thieves though and I don't think there is any evidence that btc fraud is higher then things like credit card reversals.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:20:00
No they never announced they were giving full support to bch until the day they actually did it. The week before they actually made an official statement saying their customers would be receiving their bch on January 1 and a determination about making it available to trade or buy would come later. The way they sprung full support immediately after releasing that statement shows me they were misleading their customers for some reason.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:19:17
But that other coin can't scale to support the amount of transactions that lightning can... and both bch lead developer deadalnix and VP marketing Roger Ver have already publicly stated their intention to implement Lightning... While a big group of their supporters continue to spread FUD about the Lightning/banker takeover. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:22:20
I've only used a handful of wallets but most of them will show the transaction as pending within a couple minutes. At that point you know the transaction has been broadcast to the network. Actual confirmation times are slower though and depend on how congested the network is and the size of the transaction fee that is included. Since BTC (and BCH) process blocks on average once every 10 minutes the quickest you will get a confirmation would be about 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:42:27
Version 1 please! Thanks for making these.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:20:48
You can't quantify how likely the network is to be attacked. You can quantify which implementation is more susceptible to attack.
Most commits have been and are currently done by non-blockstream employees. There was a recent Medium post that explored this issue in-depth. ~20% of commits in the past two years were done by blockstream employees.
All signs and known evidence point to csw not being satoshi. He made the claim so it's his responsibility to prove it. We can't know for certain what the truth is but we can use our judgement.
It would be interesting to really nail down where those nodes are...but you don't need that information to know that bch is a highly centralized coin backed primarily by bitmain. Centralized because it really only has one developer, Amaury Sechet/deadalnix, and that one developer stated during a Reddit ama that bch is a contingency project developed by bitmain. He also stated that his work on bch is funded by a grant but didn't reveal who the sponsor is.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:28:16
Can you link to a bch road map that includes layer 2 solutions? My googling isn't finding it. I'd be surprised if bch developers were openly proposing layer 2 solutions considering the dominant message from the bch camp seems to be "off chain solutions aren't Satoshi's vision".
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:03:25
1. BCH uses about 2% of the hash power in the Bitcoin network so it is much more susceptible to 51% attacks.
2. BCH has one developer on one team that does the vast amount of development on BCH. Check out the Bitcoin ABC GitHub and compare it to Bitcoin core to see the dramatic difference in development. BTC has hundreds of contributors to core.
3. BCH has no scaling solution other than increasing block size. Some supporters are more honest and openly say they will just integrate segwit and lighting (both things they generally  claim to disdain) in the future if needed.
4. The public faces of BCH are a convicted felon, a guy who claims to be Satoshi but won't simply mine a coin to prove it, and a guy who calls himself the "CEO" of bitcoin.
5. +50% of BCH nodes are running on Alibaba servers in China so highly centralized and more susceptible to influence by a small group of people.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:51:06
Why do you say "payment channels/lighting network maybe"? You suggested earlier that second layer solutions were a part of the road map but I've seen no evidence of that. I've seen a lot of bch  supporters claim second layer solutions were anathema to the intent of the white paper and I've seen a few be open to integrating segwit and lighting. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:25:06
Satoshi did propose expanding Bitcoin by integrating off-chain and other second layer solutions in the future.
Your lead/sole Bitcoin ABC developer, deadalnix,  has stated he is fine with integrating lightning network in the future. Yet know nothings like you go on bashing it.
Replace by fee is another feature Satoshi initially included in Bitcoin which you bcash clowns claim "goes against the vision of Satoshi."
You guys also claim that a fee system is contrary to "Satoshi's vision" even though it was his/her idea.
What lies will you tell next? Bitcoin unlimited team is proposing to change the block confirmation time to every 1 or 2.5 minutes. Next thing you'll be telling us is that we need to double or quadruple the coinbase in order to pay miners because you don't want to pay them with fees. 
You guys are ridiculous. Bcash is a scam to steal the bitcoin brand and value plain and simple.

@_date: 2017-12-26 07:49:07
1. Much easier to attack Bch than btc.
2. Bitcoin ABC, and unlimited to a much lesser extent, are the only two implementations with sizeable node networks. "Several independent development teams" is an extreme  exaggeration consideraping ABC is the only implementation most people use and +90% of the commits are done by one person... and those occur days or weeks between.
3. Go tell r/btc and memorydealer that second layer are good. All I've heard is that "off chain" solutions go against "Satoshi's vision."
4. I know that Gavin was given control. He also thinks that CSW is Satoshi so has proven himself to be fallible. His record also shows that he ceased actively developing btc long before his control was taken away. I understand that the "CEO of bitcoin" thing was a joke but the viewers of RT and CNN don't. 
5. Please link to the "thorough discreditation. "

@_date: 2017-12-26 03:34:15
Thanks for the response and responding elsewhere. I don't see evidence that bch promoters or developers genuinely support layer two solutions. I don't doubt that you've seen discussion about it but it runs contrary to the bch marketing/differentiating narrative. If you have easy access to links with current developers discussing support for implementing layer 2 solutions that would be great to see. The ABC public roadmap doesn't support the claim either.

The bitcoin network is transparent and run on open source code. Anybody with the technical know how can audit the code and audit the ledger. How many bitcoin there are at any given time and where they are at is transparent and traceable. To me this is part of what gives it value. I don't see how you can compare that to our traditional banking system. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:51:01
Bitcoin is a public and immutable ledger that has been operating without downtime since 2009. The code it runs on is open-source. The inflation schedule is also well known and understood. Anybody with the technical skills can audit the code and audit the ledger. To me these are all advantages as a store of wealth over things like gold (how much is there exactly and how divisible is it?), putting your cash in your mattress (inflation), or investing/speculating in real estate or stocks.

Hmm... So you guys don't like fees (the solution Satoshi suggests in the white paper as a way to incentivize miners after the coinbase is paid out) and you're open to speeding up the mining time 4x or 10x which would disperse the remaining coins very quickly.
Looks to me like team BCH will be proposing a coin cap limit increase... and arguing that Satoshi didn't write the 21 million limit in the white paper so it's meaningless.
You guys pick and choose snippets to support what you want to do like a bunch of lawyers. ��
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:42:07
This. Sad but true. Many BCH supporters go and trash lightning unaware they their lead developer, deadalnix, has already stated they will integrate lightning. They just don't want to build it on top of segwit because segwit takes away bitmain/Jihan Wu's asicboost advantage... Hence all the fud about "segwitcore coin." 
For the record deadalnix has also stated that BCH is a "contingency project of bitmain" which should have put to bed the idea that BCH is some kind of grassroots community uprising.
@_date: 2018-09-15 03:34:00
Send BCH to coinbase pro. BCH transfer fees are tiny. 
Make market order to trade BCH for BTC. Market orders are free. 
Send BTC to hardware wallet. Transferring BTC off of coinbase pro is free as they pay the BTC network fee for you.
Whole transaction should cost pennies. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:48:02
It's not an assumption to say BCH is "centralized."
They have one developer, deadalnix/Amaury, who has done +90% of all the work on BCH. All the other "teams" (5! 6! 7!?) total about 10 people and are pretty much dormant. He proved during the EDA fix that only his opinion ultimately mattered. BCH commits since the fork are far and few between.
Deadalnix himself stated during a Reddit AMA that BCH is a contingency project of bitmain/Jihan Wu. He also stated he is paid to work on BCH using a grant but hasn't revealed the source of the grant.

They're getting down voted because their concerns are hysterical and ignorant.
1. Public addresses are public. Private info isn't. Roger had admin access to see private info that most people couldn't. 
2. Theoretically you can't "reverse engineer" a private key from a public address. 
3. Quantum computing... people do "have a problem with this" and are researching solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:41:23
They have one developer, deadalnix, who does +95% of all the development work. He has stated that bch is contingency project developed by bitmain/Jihan Wu. He has also stated that his own work on bch is funded by a grant but won't say who sponsors the grant. It's my understanding that bch largely exists to maintain Jihan Wu's asicboost advantage which the implementation of segwit on btc core nullifies.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:48:22
Nope. The network decides the longest chain based upon most accumulated proof of work. Nakamoto Consensus. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:48:53
Claiming all these bch development teams just makes you look like you're trying to stretch the truth considering one guy on one team has done +90% of all the work on bch. Bitcoin unlimited is the only other implementation with any adoption (~2-300 nodes if i remember correctly) and they barely update their code either. 
I've read both the ABC and Unlimited roadmaps. To me the most surprising news was that Unlimited wants to increase the block mining time to 1 or 2.5 minutes. You can't claim both "Satoshi's vision/white paper originalism" and stuff like that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:52:30
Thanks for that link. Lead me to interesting Reddit ama with Amaury. He does indeed say several times he is open to second layer solutions. I find this pretty fascinating considering the main message out of r/btc and team Ver is that off chain solutions are contrary to the intent of the Satoshi white paper. It will be interesting to see how the marketing team changes their message when they need their followers to get on board.
He did state in the harms that bch was a contingency plan developed by Bitmain/Jihan Wu which pretty much confirms criticism that bch is the miner's preferred coin. He also avoided responding to the question of who is funding him aside from saying he has a grant (from somebody).
Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:35:00
Bcash has one developer, deadalnix on team ABC, who does +90% of all the bch development work. He has stated in a Reddit AMA that bch is a contingency project founded by bitmain/Jihan Wu. He has also stated that his work is funded by a grant but won't say who sponsors his grant. 
When the faulty Bach EDA needed to be fixed he simply implemented his own DAA solution without getting consensus from the other teams. That probably wasn't too difficult considering all the separate bch development teams put together total less than 10 people... and like I said before deadalnix is responsible for the vast majority of bch commits and, in my opinion, likely being paid for his work by bitmain. 
Centralized enough for you to call it centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:23:27
Heck of a good reason! My apologies.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:40:29
No not the same time at all. Bcash basically has one developer working on their coin ("team" ABC) and if you check out their GitHub you'll see very little developing actually happens. Bcash proponents will tell you they have "five teams!" but if you look into it you'll see the "teams" each consist of 1-2 people and they don't do anything. Bcash supporters talk trash all day long about the work that hundreds of  Bitcoin core developers do and the technologies like segwit and lighting they plan on implementing... then turn around and casually say they will just take their work and add it to bcash in the future if they need to. There is a huge difference in the technical abilities and character qualities of the people behind each project with BTC being, in my opinion, much stronger.

Except that the NYA wasn't a "compromise". It didn't involve the core developers or virtually any well known supporters of small block scaling. It was an explicit attempt to remove commit power from the Core developers and place it in the hands of Jeff Garzik and the NYA backers. 
There were no lies or deceptions or weaseling out of a deal because the "deal" was never agreed to. Furthermore it's a good thing that segwit2x didn't succeed because it's development was inept. What happened to the long list of companies who pledged support for code writing and testing before the fork? It came to nothing and the code that Garzik wrote famously failed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:47:33
LN stands for Lighting Network and it is a brand new second layer payment solution that sits on top of the Bitcoin network. It still uses Bitcoin but transaction fees are much lower. It's cutting edge and poster suggested you use it because it's the future of how Bitcoin payments will work so a lot of people are excited about it. Not a lot of people can use it right now though so you should definitely not make it the only way you accept payment right now... But adding it on top of regular Bitcoin payments would make you stand out.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:45:44
Yes, please name somebody who didn't go through with their pact? The NYA was made by people who wanted to scale with bigger blocks. It wasn't a compromise with small blockers and small blockers didn't agree to it. Segwit2x was called off by the same people who announced it. You appear to be mad at the people who didn't support it instead of the people who did but then called it off.

I'm sorry you got down voted because I think your concerns are valid and I see no reason to assume that you yourself are trying to spread FUD. Down voting like that can push people away from this community which we definitely don't want.
Regarding your first concern I personally am holding but will consider hedging buy picking bch after this pump ends... Even though this attack is anger inducing and I don't want to reward the people doing it.
After the NYA I don't think compromise would have been possible given their stated intention was to "fire core" and put in place new developers (who? Garzik?).
I too am wondering what is being done right now to address these attack vectors. I'm not sure where to find the answers.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:04:31
Fwiw I don't agree with the down votes... Seems you genuinely are looking for information and answers to your questions. The miners attacked Bitcoin over the weekend by withdrawing processing power from the Bitcoin chain. This coincided with a large social media astroturf campaign to spread FUD about Bitcoin. Roger Ver is a leader of this campaign using the Bitcoin.com website to promote Bitcoin cash and promoting the slogan bitcoin cash is bitcoin. Also adding to this attack was a pump in the bitcoin cash price on Korean exchanges over last week and culminating on Sunday in a run up to $2400 and crash 5 minutes later to $1200. These attack looks coordinated to many people because all of these things have largely never happened on this scale and at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:49:45
No I think BTC can be used as a currency. Right now people are resistant to use BTC as a currency because it is rising in value like you would expect of a limited resource. Even if it was cheap to transact with people in general wouldn't use it as currency since it doesn't make sense to because of the natural tendency for a deflationary resource to rise in value.
That can change as the value of BTC increases and holders feel wealthy enough to spend it. Eventually it's value may stabilize enough for people to actually use as a currency. 
I don't see how cheap transaction fees are going to increase adoption of a digital currency that is designed to increase in value. Why wouldn't you be able to continue to trade your BTC for fiat or goods if it continues to rise in value? 
I think the things that give BTC it's value are things like obviously scarcity of the units but when more importantly the proven security and reliability of the blockchain network over the past 8 years. I think that wide acceptance as a payment method improves it's value but pursuing that is secondary to preserving security.

I think you guys are getting at something really important and central to the divide between people who want Bitcoin to be used immediately for everyday purchases and those who want it to be a store of value for now and used for purchases later.
There are only 21 million bitcoins. It's a deflationary currency. As more people use it it's value is going to go up. During this period it won't function well as a day to day currency because people are going to naturally be resistant to spending something that is steadily gaining in value. At some point it becomes so valuable that individuals feel wealthy enough to start spending it. Then some time after that it is more widely distributed and has a more stable value so people feel more free to use it as a currency. At least that is how I think this is going, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:51:20
If you're friend bought $5 worth BTC and only got $3 worth then I'm guessing she bought it on an exchange and paid a hefty fee for doing so. That is a fee charged by the exchange, not Bitcoin, and the fee would have been the same no matter what kind of crypto she bought.
When people complain about Bitcoin fees they are usually complaining about transfer fees paid to miners which have been going up because the price of BTC is increasing and because blocks are more full and fees are a competitive market.

Point was that the Bitcoin could move around off chain and every transaction doesn't have to happen on chain. Steam could use an off chain payment processor...

I know there are obvious concerns about risks of double spending BTC off chain or trust concerns with off chain processors.

A lot of the alt coins are focused on solving different problems than Bitcoin and Ethereum using the blockchain. Some examples: Factom/records storage, Siacoin/data storage, Iota/free micropayments (doesn't use blockchain uses decentralized acylic graph... You'll have to look it up!), Civic/proof of identity... and at least hundreds of not thousands more. If there is a problem it seems like somebody is trying to use the blockchain to solve it better.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:56:00
Yes and that is part of the problem and central to the debate... Who do you trust to continue guiding and developing bitcoin? The miners or Bitcoin core? Segwit2x was backed by the miners and would have "fired core". Bitcoin Cash is being prominently backed by Jihan Wu, who dominates mining in China and also manufactures most of the ASIC processors the world uses for mining, and Roger Ver, who runs the mining pool Bitcoin.com, claims bitcoin cash is bitcoin, and also owns the bitcoin.com website he uses to promote Bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:14:54
I think of it like if you have Bitcoin in your wallet right now... Theoretically you could create an off-chain network say for example between you and your family where the money in your wallet moves around between only you and your family. From the bitcoin block chain perspective the Bitcoin is still in your personal wallet/personal family network. It is only when you or one of your family members wants to transfer some of that bitcoin off of that side chain network that it gets reconciled with the Bitcoin blockchain.

I see a basic contradiction in a lot of the BCH supporters thinking. They want their deflationary currency to (naturally) grow in value, moon, supplant BTC in market cap AND they want to use their deflationary currency which is steadily gaining in value to be used as a day to day cash currency... A use case which is better suited for an inflationary currency. How do you square those two seemingly contradictory desires?

You're also assuming that most Coinbase users were aware of this leak which is unlikely. The facts are in December Coinbase officially announced that BCH support in the form of withdrawals only would be coming in January. A week later they surprised everybody with full trading, buying, selling, and withdrawal support. People who were aware of the leak might have been in a good position to capitalize on it. But their mainstream users were relying on information from only Coinbase which was misleading.

My bad you're right he does hate bcash.
Using both terms though is basically a psychological marketing tactic to diminish the validity of the competition. Bcash used by many people is basically a pejorative while BCH supporters use the term Bitcoin Core to support the idea that BTC and BCH are two versions of the same thing. Which they are not. Bitcoin core software is compatible with the earliest versions of bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is compatible with no software that existed before it forked.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:18:18
It appears I was mistakenly remembering an announcement by Coinbase the week before that I can't find evidence for. The August announcement is the only "official" one I can currently find.
I agree with you that the leak contributed to the run up. Makes me wonder if they moved up there support date in response to the leak. Regardless they certainly did not stick to the plan they themselves announced which disadvantaged many of their customers who were only relying on "official" information.

They created all that inflation in about two months when the miners manipulated their faulty EDA/emergency difficulty adjustment. They seem to have fixed that after putting in a new DAA.

Why do you say it failed miserably?

Dan Larimer created Bitcoin! Ha ha ha.

Where did he say he thought it was okay to call BCH bcash?

And he gave it a different name and works with Bitcoin developers to test out new technologies like lightning network and atomic swaps.
Not the same as saying his coin is the "real Bitcoin."

Yes I understand that perspective. If BCH just wanted to be called Bitcoin Cash I don't think too many people would have a problem with that. But they don't. They literally want to be called Bitcoin (BTC).

I think a lot of the value is in it being the only form of money I am aware of that is transparent and auditible.
In general it is also less expensive and quicker than most other methods to make large value transfers with.
You can also use Bitcoin without fear that some gatekeeper like your bank, credit card, or government will reject the transaction.
Lastly you can buy stuff with it which is pretty practical especially when combined with the other qualities I just listed.

I think the world's first and most secure transparent ledger of value is worth more than zero.

Of course goods and services need to be offered in exchange for any currency to have value. I don't think the ledger alone has value but linked to a currency it provides a level of transparency regarding the money supply that many people desire and value.
Just because Bitcoin isn't mainstream to the point that many businesses only accept it doesn't mean it is worthless. Businesses and people use it everyday to exchange goods and services. Unlike most every other currency in the world there is no government who is going to mandate that payment be accepted in Bitcoin only. Yours is a ridiculous standard.
