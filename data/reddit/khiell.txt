By the way Tidbit is a proof-of-concept (not the first one of this kind) that won't work ^^'.
20kHashes/s per client VS Ads ... I have tried to implement the same system months ago and it was already a dead end thanks to the asics. ;p
So it's a plagia not an innovation, best creative culture ever seen... congratulation MIT.

Edit: They plan to swap to Litecoin and to use GPU but for now they claim to be innovative because users can choose between advertising or mining.

Op-return is Peter Todd ? Because if not it's just a little taunt from him.
About the title, you are right but people at /Btc or /Bitcoin are disrespectful between them so like we said in France "it's the game my poor Lucette".
