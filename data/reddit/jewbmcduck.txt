You are literally sticking a Bitcoin logo on art that was obviously not designed as Bitcoin art, in order to sell it to Bitcoin rich retards?
Kinda lame.

Ugh, people that self identify as "millennial"...so bizarre.
I suppose technically I am a millennial (barely make the cut off), but my god what a douchey thing to call yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:29:30
How's it feel to be 17?
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:15:26
...and that makes you a newb.

Dude, you don't know him or a thing about his family.
A formal education? You mean being taught propaganda in a school setting?
Are you 20?
Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2019-05-05 11:53:04
Sit ups won't do that.
Only diet will.
Edit: My god, these replies. You people need a fucking hobby.
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:00:39
Do you have actual experience with this? Or merely just a guy talking out your ass?
I have known many sex workers, many with "bosses", that would disagree with your misinformed opinion.

UH-OH LOOK OUT! WE GOT OURSELVES A FUCKING BADASS OVER HERE.
If the State wants your bitcoins, best believe they will extract them from you.
Your concealed carry permit means shit in the face of overwhelming force. Quit kidding yourself.

You're paying that much attention to a 90 year old man's tongue?
Uhhh, cool.
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:14:08
I just pooped.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:02:14


Is there a difference?
No, there isn't...only the illusion of a difference.
But hey, keep voting! I'm sure next time it'll work out!
YEAH NAIVETY!

You should stop talking. You're literally embarrassing yourself to those of us that have been around a while.
And no, 2017 is not a while. 2017 makes you a newb.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:27:38
Cool...concern trolling.
Cool bruh.
Tell me what I should and shouldn't do with my money under the guise of giving a fuck.
Enjoy the dopamine, loser.

Oh, don't worry....my wife is a dericate rittle flowra.

Tone Vays is a retard. But YOU sir are the loser if you think BTC won't see the $4000s again.
Or more likely, you're just a newb.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:55:10


I have a $5 wrench that says otherwise.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:15:57
Sorry, not 14 years old.
Does not compute.
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:13:13
$1.4MM is not enough to retire in your 40s...
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:43:08


The poor man's vision of what it's like to have money.
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:43:22


You might just see $3500 again...
...question becomes, will you pull the trigger @ $3,500?
Something something theory, actuality.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:01:38


That isn't a good thing.
The loss of this instinct is quite literally the loss of the very thing that makes you alive.
Get on TRT, or something.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:01:02
Anyone else here concerned with the timing of this rally?
Binance hack, Bitfinex recent subpoena...
Something seems off.
