Just wait it out.

No, you had a sudden moment of clarity and have now been talked it of it by people still drinking the kool aid.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:21:46
Pretty big if, buddy.

Thanks for that massive wall of text mate, question, after the apocalypse what use are your 1's and 0's?

I'm yet to see anything indicative of real long potential because of fundamental ways the currency works (or doesn't) in the existing financial frameworks.
I know everyone loves that about Bitcoin but it always strikes me as a tad naive.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:30:51
Yeah nothing about that looks manipulated.

As best I can tell there was another price crash.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:44:39
Yeah yeah it's bored wall street bankers playing games. Do you guys have any idea how you sound? My God.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:22:48
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:07:23
Vast proportions of what goes on in the bitcoin world world be illegal in a regulated environment.

Which is exactly why gold is the gold standard. It's stable.

How do you buy just after with confidence you're not getting the wrong side of the fork?

You can see what he's saying I assume, it's not complex. You're saying don't sell now while the price is low. He's saying better that than when it's even lower.
He's assuming it will go lower, you're assuming it will go back up. Neither of you actually know what will happen.

Reading this absolute shit that people who think they understand what's going on are writing is actually doing my head in. Two answers to the question "what is a hard fork" and not a single fucking sentence that makes sense.

Seems more than a tad likely he's trying to take the edge of the millions he's watching disappear from the value of his holding by blowing smoke.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:54:23
Painfully transparent that this is some attempt to take the edge off the bottom falling out of it. Even if he bought ages ago you know he had millions in it and is watching huge amounts of value disappear.
