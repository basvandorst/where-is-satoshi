I’m just beginning to think he didn’t send it, or if he did, it wasn’t sent to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:29:52
Elaborate a little. So if I copy the receiving address and it shows no transactions, it wasn’t sent? Because it shows nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:17:28
No, do you have an answer for the question though? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:21:10
Thank you. So the notification comes before the bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:54:46
How does he find his sender address? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:17:52
Not trying to be dicky, just stressed. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:36:26
Blue thunder you seem pretty knowledgeable, how detailed is the coinbase transaction history? Does it show the person’s name? Or any identifiers? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:52:02
Yea and I get nothing. 0 transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:52:29
Wait, how do I search his sender address? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:29
It will be in the 7’s by morning PST 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:50:03
Tell me the future oh wise one.
But seriously I just can’t deal with the stress. This is an anomaly market. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:11
I thought that at 11k too 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:59
No thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:44:58
Didn’t buy 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:22
Never bought 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:20:58
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:11
Never bought it in the first place

I used one of these in LA today when a customer paid in BTC.
You enter your mobile number on the screen, it then sends a text to your phone to verify a PIN. Then you scan the QR code of the receiving address on the screen and send from your phone. You’ll then get a text when the sale is finalized and can return the machine to withdraw your money. 
The money is dispensed one bill at a time from the bottom left slot. 
The glass pad at the bottom right of the screen is an ID reader to verify identify on larger amounts.

Which one? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:56:10
It was gifted from someone who could only offer bitcoin at the time. Before that I had 0 interest in it.

It’s a bitcoin sub, not a bitcoin holder’s sub.
