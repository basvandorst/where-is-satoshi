Stop making *argumentum ad satoshi* arguments. His opinion means as much to me as anyone else's.


That's your strawman but it's obvious to most people that a highly valuable service in high demand is going to be expensive. You don't even specify what you mean by "small fees". To some people $20 is a "small fee" when they are moving millions of dollars at 2am on a Sunday from a remote cabin in the woods.

Legacy nodes receive those ~1MB and store those. As I said, no more disk space is needed. If you run a segwit node you can get bigger blocks but that's completely optional. That's literally why it's a soft fork.

Yes because you need a Reddit account to own Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:57:05
There are two things you have to defend against:
1. the BTC itself, as in, if you have 1 BTC in your wallet today, you want to have 1 BTC still there when you come back to your computer next week
2. the value of BTC based on the network
If miners that were once mining coins based on the consensus rules that you use suddenly start mining coins based off different consensus rules then you lose hashing power and therefore security and therefore value. Your 1 BTC is worth less because a bunch of non-transacting nodes were able to pull hashing power away.

Okay, imagine a network with only 3 nodes online:
1. miner node
2. full transacting node
3. full non-transacting node
Let's assume that (2) sends some Bitcoin and then immediately goes offline. Are you still sure that (3) can't decide anything about Bitcoin? Are you still sure that (3) doesn't add any security to Bitcoin?
Now imagine that we change the scenario above by adding more full non-transacting nodes but also some of them are malicious. Do you still think it doesn't matter that we have as many friendly nodes as possible?

It's subjective. That's why the argument is pointless. Transactions are either valid or invalid. There's no objective thing as spam. However, that cuts the other way too. All hard forks are attacks. There is no objective thing as a non-attacking hard fork. That's why RSK and other Bitcoin sidechains are considered "Bitcoin friendly". Also, none of these terms should be taken personally. It's all about game theory.

I was on the Tor mailing list in 2009 and read up on Bitcoin then. I CPU mined some later and also bought a lot. Even then it was known that there would be scaling issues and that small transactions would be driven off of the blockchain into altcoins, sidechains or some other escrow-type scheme. Bootstraping quickly with scaling issues that will be addressed later is a common theme in successful tech.

Show me a faster and cheaper way to transfer more than $1 million USD. The problem is that Bitcoin is a bazooka when you need a fly swatter. Also, people like you bitch about LN not being a solution because "you have to open channels" but then you don't even run a full node. You keep your crypto on exchange or wallet that you don't control. LN is exactly what you'll be using when everyone else leads the way and you follow, as followers do.

Also, you never want to exhaust the channel like that because the disincentive against cheating is that you lose everything. If the channel is exhausted then one side has nothing to lose and therefore might as well try to cheat.

Which means little to nothing. 24 hour volume and market depth are more informative. Also, if you can GPU mine one shitcoin vs another then miners have no investment in that particular crypto. People see some premined shitcoin pump and get FOMO but nobody wants to hold 99% of these shitcoins more than 2 years. They are pump and dump.

I don't understand how you can't see the value in redundancy. There is an extra computation of the rules. There is an extra copy of the blockchain. We also need to consider that there are transactions happening without running a full node and your node is helping secure those transactions when the full transacting nodes are turned off or are getting DDoS'd.
Obviously, economically involved full nodes are more relevant but *the utility of redundancy is non-zero*.

Let's say you're a state actor and you want to spin up a bunch of miners to attack the network. The decentralization has been unchanged but the hash rate has gone up. The attack is therefore more difficult and costs more to execute. That is clearly a more secure network.

I know about CORS because I'm a web developer with 15+ years of experience, CS degree, Security+, PHP 5 certified, etc, etc. You should actually make an argument instead of just hand-waving to an article and pretending you made a point. Here, watch me.
CORS requires that you explicitly allow access from another domain. Unless your code is running in a browser from localhost using the same scheme and port then CORS would block any access assuming the API doesn't do something like setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*`.
Now, please stop being lazy and make an actual argument.

People point to the message in the genesis block but it actually serves another purpose aside from political commentary. It is a newspaper headline that Satoshi couldn’t have known about and therefore proves he didn’t premine a longer chain starting with that block that could be used to attack the network later.

Proof of stake just hides the waste. If controlling the next block is worth $10k then people will easily pay $9k to grab it, whether it’s mining or rewriting the chain or some other attack vector. The value of securing transactions has to be represented somehow.

Back in 2009, I gave Tor a $10,000 donation via my Torfox project.
Funny enough, Tor is how I first heard of Bitcoin. In December 2009, Bitcoin version 0.2.0 was released which included Tor proxy support. The announcement was crossposted to the Tor mailing list and I thought it sounded like an interesting project. Eventually, I got around to reading the white paper in 2010, after it was posted on Slashdot. I immediately solo CPU mined a few 50 BTC blocks on an HP netbook and later bought several thousand more BTC.
I don't believe in karma, but if I did, it would probably look something like this.

Off-chain transactions will speed up on-chain transactions because it will free up space. Even after that boost is gone when more people adopt BTC you will still be able to make 1 slow on-chain transaction to get thousands of fast transactions. How is it not obviously a scaling improvement for frequent transactions? And if you are doing rare one-off transactions then why do you care? You clearly aren’t using BTC as money anyways if LN doesn’t speed things up for you.

You don’t understand Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin for small transactions is killing a fly with a bazooka instead of a flyswatter. Nobody needs their coffee purchase to be globally decentralized, censorship resistant and stored on the public blockchain until the end of time.

1 Siacoin = 202 satoshis (0.00000202 BTC) but if the price of BTC goes up while the price of SC stays at 202 sats then the USD price of SC goes up too. But what does that tell you about SC? Not much. Altcoins are tiny boats floating in the BTC ocean. When the waves come, the boats  ride it but they don’t really make a difference.

In 2009, I was on the Tor mailing list and I read about Bitcoin 0.2.0 coming out with support for using Tor. Later I heard about version 0.3.0 coming out. It was at that time that I read the white paper and realized that Bitcoin would be huge someday. I was right.

You should ask. Approach it piece by piece. First ask them if you can spend some money if you find something you want to invest in. Don’t mention what you want to invest in yet. That is a separate issue. First get permission to invest small amounts of your own money and explain that you understand the risk of losing all or some of your investment. Once they agree then explain crypto separately. Don’t do this all in one day. This would be a week long process of slowly introducing them to the idea of you investing in something THEN days later bring up crypto. If you can’t wait that long then you aren’t being thoughtful about it and this is just a FOMO/gambling urge. We don’t need anymore weak hands. Best of luck.

It’s how the markets work. There are very few fiat markets that aren’t BTC. Most altcoins are soft-pegged to BTC. It’s often more useful to look at the price of altcoins in Satoshis because of this.

It does discount them. Bitcoin doesn’t need your help and you are kind of egotistical to think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:38:56
Most altcoins are paired with BTC on exchanges. For example, you can’t buy Siacoin with USD directly. You have to buy BTC first then buy SC with BTC. That means if the value of SC compared to BTC doesn’t change but the price of BTC goes up in USD then so does the price of SC. Most altcoins are like boats floating in the BTC ocean.

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:06:54
Technically superior if you don’t care about scaling globally. The reality is that Bcash won’t do VISA scale anymore than Bitcoin will. You need more layers and the ability to have private networks of money that are still connected to the main network. That’s what drivechains and LN are for. If you want to improve Bitcoin then support actual improvements not “get rich schemes” based on hijacking a name. If Bcash was called RogerCoin then we wouldn’t even be talking because nobody would care about it.

The sad part is that some of them actually believe it’s about big blocks instead of it being a cash grabbing ego pump for you know who.
Anyone that tries to pull hashing power away from the Bitcoin network is technically an attacker. Altcoins that refuse to 2way peg to Bitcoin are in nobody’s long term interest to exist. It’s like having two separate internets. Nobody should want that.

Cool stuff but one thing to remember is that domain name history doesn’t mean much. Just because some random company doesn’t have a record of a domain name doesn’t mean it wasn’t registered and reachable at that time. CW is obviously not SN, regardless.
