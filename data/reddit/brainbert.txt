Well I'm quite new to bitcoin...so I don't know exactly what happened in the past. The Bitcoin Show was one of the first source information I have stumbled upon when I have found out about bitcoin...though what else Bruce did besides that shit "show", mybitcoin and the mortgage fuck up? He didn't do any fking thing for the "community" as a whole, he only pursued his personal gains and interest.
You have to realize man, that this magazine it's not a single man effort (aka your nemesis Matthew). It is a team effort which in time will help bitcoin as a whole.
Quit fking around with downvotes and upvotes, let people enjoy their fking right to up vote something or down vote it -&gt;see that their vote counts. You are ruining everything for everyone.
What you're doing here it's destructive for the entire community in the end. Think man, think...grow up.

1.Blocking my comments doesn't make my comments less true...dig your hole big enough so your head will fit.... ostrich
2.Considering the amount of fake accounts you're using (for whatever reason) I think you're either the in-famous Atlas OR dankster/coineer/etc, the rest of your accounts from the forums (this would explain "why the hate")... *shock*
3.What paranoid BS is this -having a new account automatically makes me Matthew? 
4.I'm done wasting my time with your shitty posts...but hey, you can entertain yourself as you did before...having conversations with umm yourself ;-)
Get a life dude

In the last week we've had some nice designs in the Bitcoin landscape: Helpcoin, Bitcoin Magazine and coinDL . Way to go! 
I wonder what the next week will bring :D

You're welcome! Though I hate to disappoint you...I'm a real person, not some empty account used for voting (like your accounts).
Do you realize that your actions are idiotic, idiot?  
What do you try to accomplish with this BS?
@_date: 2012-04-05 17:39:18
Yeah...well that doesn't seem to be very important for the idiot(s) who keeps creating accounts and is down voting all the posts by BitcoinMagazine. 
@_date: 2012-04-05 21:22:23
I see that you've used your "down vote" accounts for some "up voting" also eh? 
I'm not sure about the rest of the guys here, but I'm expecting to read interesting stuff and articles from this /r/ - this isn't one of them. 
Not only you fked the entire equilibrium with your stupid down vote vendeta but you're also acting like an idiot. How old are you? 12?
@_date: 2012-04-05 21:39:56
Dude, it's obviously that you've created this topic from one of your fake accounts. 
Why the  you're pretending that you're talking with someone "real"? 
@_date: 2012-04-07 11:22:48
The website design looks nice. 
@_date: 2012-04-05 21:37:16
Dunno what to say about this one, we all knew that at a certain point this type of bitcoin usage will take off...*sigh* I guess now the bitcoin haters will say: "ah bitcoin is used only to buy drugs and weapons now pornography also" (facepalm)
@_date: 2012-04-07 20:02:52
Thank YOU for making time to explain it better!
@_date: 2012-04-07 10:43:07
It is ugly indeed, though you need to look at the general website design across the Bitcoin landscape. So.... it is ugly compared to "other websites" but it looks good compared to the rest of the bitcoin economy websites. I think it is a step forward from the geeky design that we've been used to see to bitcoin related websites.
@_date: 2012-04-05 16:16:04
Haters gonna hate. I think it has to do with Matthew (from the forums) being involved.
People seem to believe that this is "his" magazine (look at the other reddit ~Matthew scammer~) and take this opportunity to launch a personal vendeta against him. All in all I think this is BS and bad for Bitcoin as a whole. 
We should be a "community" and from what I am seeing these dudes are really trying to do something. I agree that it's a good read, they should receive support not down votes.

Hmmm..this is a magazine? Thank god it's free...otherwise I would be angry at me for paying money for this.
No disrespect or anything, I appreciate the effort...but I could do better than this with my modest photoshop skills. Today I've commented about the current state of (website) design in the Bitcoin landscape, I think this "magazine" is a perfect example.

Actually the banking cartel tell you what the money is and isn't. Most of the people think that the Government controls "everything"...they are wrong. Between the banks and the governments there is a parent-child relationship. The governments are the bank's muppets.
Nice read.

The forced upgrade "feature" is their open window for doing dirty things like inject coins into the system. Why would anyone need this when you already have something that works and it's superior -&gt; BITCOIN FTW
@_date: 2012-04-08 10:06:26
Interesting read - IN YOUR FACE MINTCHIP! 
@_date: 2012-04-07 19:22:02
Well I guess the reason for posting this here is to inform people about the "fraud", right? I'm one of the people around here (I may be dumber than some of the people here though) and I don't understand exactly WHERE is the proof of FRAUD.
Thank you in advance ;-)
"Hmmm" I think that actually making a useful comment and responding to my question would've been more useful than starting a trololing session.
