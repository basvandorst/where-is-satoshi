Hi Friend, 
In order to add your business you need to go to  and search for your location. After that, click edit, register/login, and add a point where your business is.
This page has a gif which shows him adding a location, hopefully this might help? 
After that, go to the tag section, and add the payment:bitcoin = yes tag.
I do understand why you cannot add the location, seems mighty hard if you ask me. It'd be nice to have a form to simplify the process, but it might be not be easy to create.
If you give me the address I can add it to the map. =)

They used to say that MAC was the most secure, because there were no viruses for it. They said the same about Linux. 
None of these are true. Perhaps Chrome OS is more secure against traditional problems, but maybe a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability results in the complete loss of all your private data, or a breach in google's servers results in the loss of everyone's private data.
We still need to wait. Me, personally, I think that it is a very bad idea to put all your things on the cloud.
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:27:42
Hmm... I wonder what the fuck you mean by that. It could mean anything, you'd need to be more specific. What problems does bitcoin network have regarding scalability?
Keep in mind, quoting Mastercard's transactions per second ain't good enough. =)

This is true, local bitcoin sellerst take a HUGE margin. Maybe even worse than western unions 10%. Just look at localbitcoin before downvoting.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:07:52
The problem with this is that there is no reliable way to accept credit card payments and convert them to bitcoin due to the fact that bitcoin transactions are not reversible and CC transactions are.
This always results in the merchant or payment processor being left holding the bag, or having their license revoked due to a high risk/amount of chargebacks.

The digits created with computers have mathematical properties that the current system does not have. I think you must read up further on bitcoin, and it's general properties.

LOL, bitcoin foundation? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:40:18
Hi man,
It is really tough to say. This being a P2P network, the protocol relies mostly on what the clients agree on, so you can't really see a separration as in client/server architectures.
Protocol level changes are not merged in without some consensus in the mailing lists, methinks. Being a noob, and having a quick through the issues closed, I would say 10% or less would correspond to protocol changes.
This one, for example:

The internet is for pornographers and geeks! Nobody could ever use something that is so complicated.
Plus, it is clear that anybody can publish ANYTHING, without any sort of regulation. :S
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:55:07
FUCK, THIS! criminal prosecution is a must in this case. A person cannot be that stupid without being outright malicious.

Don't thank him, he's being a bit of a dick. We all know what you meant.
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:12:19
You should not buy BTC in order to become rich: that is my strategy.
@_date: 2014-06-21 06:18:43
I think it is a social problem, rather than a technical one. 
Plus, a technical solution is p2p pools.

Who do you work for?
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:05:04
But don't they encrypt the wallet for you and send you the password? Or do you just send them the private key for them to print?
I honestly ask, have no idea.

Love the fact that in some countries you don't even have to bother with KYC.

Can you withdraw the BTC? because otherwise it is just numbers in a website.
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:03:18
Yeah, I agree its a serious issue, but I don't think it's nothing insurmountable. Fact is, we might even get through it, eh? and once we do, the network will be the strongest its ever been
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:23:56

This could be another effect of that.

Good stuff, nice work.
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:24:45
they are quite legitimate, but you should not use them for the permanent storage of coins. What I normally do is buy BTCs and then move them to cold storage.
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:37:42
Which one is it?
We've had plenty of slow days lately
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:43:45
that's not very canandian of you

It is your legal right to pay as little tax as legally possible. Everybody knows that.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:23:03
Undoubtedly the way to go. Why wouldn't anyone demand multi-signature transactions? It's absolutely the way to go.
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:45:22
Yeah, you might be right. The fee might end up not being worth it though, and CC dealers already charge pretty steep fees unless you are a huge merchant.

a) gets in trouble with his previous acquaintances
b) sells his ripple for less money because he already warned people he was going to dump a whole lot of coin
c) replying openly like that gives lawyers a lot to work from

fuck, not that I would know, but that is pretty smart
@_date: 2014-06-22 01:29:04
I can see what you mean now, and I can maybe see how it works. It'd be quite cool, actually, like using coinbase but actually owning your own coins.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:24:02
it seems pretty evident you are full of shit
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:12:25
This, but most importantly, put the bitcoin logo on your website. I've gone to several shops that are in coinmap, but if I am not sure that it accepts bitcoin, I get a bit shy bout asking.
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:50:53
Yeah, nah

Also, a BTC, today would be worth 0.000010 cents, or something like that :)

Well, you can't, because those payments are reversible :P

I like it too, I think it's awesome and completely offtopic. You may even think it'd be a bit of a dick move to bring it up.

Also, the impact is not limited to the US-based corporations of any financial entity, because the U.S. is known to raid companies in other countries for whatever reason.

Well, if I were to try and crack a bitcoin wallet now, I'd have a 0% success rate.
Given that, there is no downside, only upside. It is obvious that you have some hardware and skill that you can put towards that, and that's awesome, but not all people can.
Of course you need to only do it with people you trust, in very much the same way people trust other people with the bitcoins they haven't lost yet (!!!), i.e. coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-10 23:56:05

Sorry to be that guy, but I think that getting a paper wallet online defeats the purpose of a paper wallet, and I think you are better of giving your private keys.
What guarantee do we have that they don't store every private key they distribute?
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:48:40
I think a LOT of people are creating accounts just to control the level of conversation attempting to happen in this subreddit. Me, personally, I think there is no point modding, since these people are clearly stupid (most people are), but kudos on the attempt.

I havent booked anything, but from NZ I went to expedia.com and got to the payment page just fine.

@_date: 2014-07-22 22:14:56
Yeah agreed. I went with no because even though i "understand" some stuff, I don't really.
@_date: 2014-06-27 01:43:26
I would probably stick to one, or maybe two cold wallets, and that's it.

You are getting downvoted like fuck :P
@_date: 2014-07-30 10:30:01
This is not entirely correct, I am fairly certain that JavaScript, at stages, has access to the unencrypted wallet (this needs to be the case in order to make payments)
Any cross site scripting would likely lead to wallet theft? I am not sure about this.

@_date: 2014-08-01 22:47:03
I know of an instance where an exchange wouldn't allow people to withdraw neither cash nor bitcoin. =)
FWIW, they have yet to provide any guarantees that they are not running a fractional reserve (i.e. that the number stored in their database correspond to physical BTC stored somewhere). 
I think it is still too early for them to be focusing on doing this, though.
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:04:35

@_date: 2014-07-31 05:03:29
The value of the money you hold becomes worthless. One day you can use $10 to buy 2kg of rice, the next day one, the next day half, and so on.
If you held BTC you would be able to get more value out of your holdings than if you held argentinian peso in the long term.

Disclaimer: I don't know shit.
That being said, it is very hard for a computer to get truly random numbers. They obtain it by looking at the users' interaction with the computer, CPU temperature and many other things.
The USB will not have access to that information, and it will relly solely on a solid hardware design, which will be hard to prove functional.
Furthermore, I fail to see how anybody could/be willing to design such a complicated piece of hardware for only 20.000.
Also, printers are insecure as fuck, really, probably far more insecure than your computer.
Still, better than using a webpage to generate your wallets, I guess.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:42:11
fiverr.com accepts bitcoin, but I think it doesn't pay out bitcoin yet. Might be worth pestering about that!

It is the same here in NZ. You basically ring the bank and say "I've been scammed", and they'll reverse the payment no question asked.

OK man. That is fair enough. The more people trying to bring success to bitcoin, the better.
I just worry because I haven't seen anything come from them, but that is to be expected initially.
