If those are your only options, at least go with 1/2. Bitcoin could crash down to 5k in a week, or fire up to 20k. We are going sideways at hourly and volume is dropping. I'm not the optimistic as usual me in these times. Be careful.

That is an astronomically low probability.

Haha yeah, not much Turkish people are aware of it, even in Istanbul. Good to have BTCTürk and koinim though. I'm trying to spread the crypto love and already have some friends mining and investing on them.

A bit late answer, but I'm using multiple exchanges in multiple browsers to lessen the risk. Be sure to have at least one good anti-malware software. If you have a Garanti Bank account, they were giving away Webroot licenses for free, which is a decent software according to a lot of reviewers.
[Just checked, it looks like the offer is still valid.](

They only have one card setups, mostly 7950's as I've recommended when they were upgrading their old gpu's. I also have an old 6870 and 7950, plus 7970 on my main pc. I would recommend Vatan for cheapest parts, but due to recent rise of dollar/try parity they are now expensive. I bought my 7950 for about 600 try, another friend bought as low as 530 try a couple of months ago. If you are into scrypt mining, check Vatan weekly, there are some deals from time to time. Although I don't think we will ever see a 7950 cheaper than 700 try.
Feel free to tag me as a friend, it is refreshing to talk about bitcoin with someone from Turkey :)
