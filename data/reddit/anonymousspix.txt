@_date: 2015-01-18 20:16:56
Thank Youuuuuu
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:27:51
we must make a sub by the name and apply the code needed for this
by the way, THANKS for demonstrating the idea
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:02:29

check [HERE]( to see what we talked about
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:43:37
the bit will come out of the user who upvotes
if the user doesnt have bits, then either his upvote will go without any bit deduction, or his upvote will not be counted
and as for the receiving address, it better be the one associated with @_date: 2015-01-22 12:55:58
it will be run by a flair system, and an automated bot with no reply on every bit donated by voting
by this, you prevent begging, and spaming
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:38:14
WOW,  that a really nice link to share
but wow, the upvote is soooooo high in value (0.001)
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:56:33

especially after seeing this generous good deed from you.

It seems those ANTMINERS are cheaper and if multiple units are bought, they make more than the SP35 and cost less, and they Seem more "safer" having alot of features and cooling methods.
Idon't know for sure, but seems your advice and link are far more better than the SP series.

@_date: 2015-02-07 23:38:22
ok im sorry for asking too much,
to be clear, by now, ive seen at least 2 persons saying something like "here are 10000 addresses with their private keys, see if you can find anything in them"
and then they put a wink or a smily.
i just wanna know the process they do after they find these keys.
a previous comment said they use Mycelium, and i thought its like, they put the address and the key, and Voala!! instant access to the whole wallet.
i really dont know what they do, and in order to protect yourself from a thief, you need to understand his ways.

they use their own protocol, and the anonymous part of the deal is inside the coinffeine peer to peer deals, the banks can not see your transactions inside,
this has been described between minutes 13:30 - 19:00 of the podcast here
and based on what i understood, their main mission is to bring banks to the bitcoin market, and they did a great job at that in Spain.
they are aiming later for the US banks, and eventually train banks to accept bitcoin.

good for you, preventing yourself from doing what wrong is a virtue.
its addicting because its wrong, thats how we humans act.
whats wrong is wanted.
i know you dont need a 100 bits, but its not given to you to make you rich.
its only to make a smile.
and btw, when you post on the sticky post on the subreddit i sent to you, you will get a flair to participate. its not much, but the friendly environment is worth it.
have a good day :)
