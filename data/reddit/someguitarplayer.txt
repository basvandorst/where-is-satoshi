Serious sports gamblers do everything they can to reduce volatility. They study the game and only place bets when the math checks out. Throwing in a currency that has a value completely out of their control is worrying to some. If you read the article there's an interview with a gambler who voices these concerns.

I contacted my local NPR station a while back asking about Bitcoin donations. They were running a commercial saying that they take all kinds of donations (paintings, used cars and other random stuff) so I figured why not see if they would take Bitcoin. The operator told me she would get back on the idea, and about a week later called to say that they would not be doing it at this time. She was definitely interested but I doubt she wanted to go through the hassle. You should call them if you're interested though. If more people do they probably will start.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:16:43
Sounds promising. He sees the value of the technology which is better than many people. And he's right that the receiving side of the transaction is a big weakness at the moment.

Well I get that any predictions are bound to be inaccurate, but it's still an interesting discussion to me. At the very least I don't think it's that far-fetched to project a ball-park estimate for the hash rate.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:05:06
All you can do is point out the fact that it has made it this far. Does past success mean future success? Hell no. But the hardest thing for Bitcoin to ever do was get moving at all, make any sort of traction. And it did that. To me, that says something about the value of it's fundamentals if a currency worth nothing 5 years ago is making the news it makes today.

Thanks, this is the stuff I'm looking for. Anti-fragile means that Bitcoin should welcome shocks to it's market (think Mt. Gox failure) because they create the environment for innovation that strengthens the protocol in the long run. Silk road bust leads to Dark Market would be another.

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:33:05
Exactly. I've also been thinking about the other costs of accepting bitcoin. Even though there are savings from the payment processing side, you still have to invest capital in training your employees to deal with a completely different currency. Is a less &lt;1% increase in revenue worth complicating your process?

What I'm saying is a large part of the cost if getting into traditional big industries is dealing with the governments that regulate them. Since there is no Bitcoin govt, that lowers the cost. You are right as well, but I think you are overestimating how restrictive start-up costs will be. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:52:31
You seriously underestimate the smarts of professional sports gamblers. I'll give you that the majority of people don't know anything and are just trying to make some easy money. But the big money (the kind of players Bitcoiners should hope start using these books) takes much more calculated risks.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:47:21
You are right, for most people in first world countries Bitcoin doesn't give much of an advantage because we get services like this for cheap already. Where Bitcoin is going to take off is in 3rd world countries where people get gouged because banks aren't as well established. 
Everyone on here is overwhelmingly positive about Bitcoin's positive aspects, but in reality it doesn't revolutionize much for people in developed nations. 
Edit: There is the value of instantaneous transactions as well. Just confirmed a Paypal e-check I had to wait on for 4 days to confirm. Now I have to wait at least 2 days for the money to transfer to my bank.

Awesome reply, glad I got a conversation going. I understand these arguments, and agree with you about a lot of this. But you're preaching to the choir. Check out and ask around about the average persons perception of Bitcoin. They think it is shady, risky, and don't enjoy the volatility. It doesn't matter if you or I see the obvious advantages, they still don't get it. And until Bitcoin can be simplified they won't switch over.

Matter of time true, but how long will that be? Even with workable exchanges in each country, having to go through two middle men will probably cost more than western union. And right now there aren't workable exchanges in most of the world's companies. 
IMO you will need to see Bitcoin accepted for goods and services in other countries on a broad scale before this takes off. Going fiat - btc - btc - fiat just doesn't make sense.

I don't think it effects the price at all, but Bitcoin has a history of bubble phases and it's useful to try and guess when they'll pop. When you see a ton of new people flooding this sub posting about buying they're first btc and looking forward to the moon, you can tell things are growing a bit too fast. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:25:32
Very much a possibility. There is the fact that the mining difficulty will adjust to make it attractive if a ton of people dropped off the network...but in the situation you set out I don't think that would save Bitcoin. I think what it really depends on is where the price is when governments start with heavy handed regulation. Right now if the U.S. made it illegal Bitcoin would be done tomorrow. But if it's price continues to match the growth of the network itself (which hasn't stopped despite the ongoing depression) the worldwide Bitcoin economy might become too big to regulate away. Keep in mind, the US and EU don't rule the world economy like they used to and they make up less than 1/5 of the world population. Africa, Asia, and Latin America can do whatever they want.

Bitcoin is obviously unequal at this point in its history, that's why the article emphasizes the utilization of Bitcoin's technology instead. Piketty's research supports the idea that the financial sector is bloated and inefficient, helping to boost inequality. The article argues that new global financial systems built on the foundation set by Bitcoin will be able to offer consumers a better alternative to this, and in turn lower inequality. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:47:12
This is what inspired me to write the article. I believe in Bitcoin as much as the next person on this sub, but we're being delusional if we act like Bitcoin is the most convenient payment method for everything. With gambling, however, there is a convincing argument to be made.

It's a long interview, the quote in the title comes from an answer he gives at the bottom of the article. He also says: "They are looking at us as experts to help educate them on how it can provide value to their customers. It’s probably what we spend the most time talking about. Banks realize that this is a trend that is important for them to be a part of and they are looking at us to help them navigate and come up with an offering for their customers."

I thought that was an extremely well balanced talk that addressed the more abstract issues around bitcoin (need for trust in money) nicely.

True, you could very well see the United States make it illegal to use electricity for Bitcoin mining purposes (or at least create a large, regulatory system around the industry). 
But I would think this would just drive miners to other countries. Anywhere on Earth with abundant energy will attract the rational miners. I assume there will always be a country willing to accept the business. 
Edit: As for the other stuff (exchanges, businesses), of course they can be regulated. But the backbone of the network are the miners.

I know it's only anecdotal evidence but it seems like the Bitcoin economy seems to operate in contradiction to what classical economic theory would predict. When the price rises dramatically (think black Friday 2013) you see a lot of usage and people spending their coin. However now that there has been a prolonged depression in the Bitcoin economy, you are seeing less and less people using their coins. Coins are losing value and people are spending less, whereas you would usually expect that if coins were losing value people would be more apt to spend them.

Such a grand master you can't even spell his name right.

At this point I feel like if a business owner needs a simple FAQ to get started using Bitcoin they shouldn't use it at all. Only people that really get it should use it. Pushing it on people and trying to make it sound easier than it is gives them a better chance of handling transactions and their saved money improperly.

Those commercials were pretty awful as well. I was hoping for something professional, not an attempt at comedy featuring vague Eastern European gangsters.

I'm just responding to you saying "your not using a credit card anymore." To me, using your bank account and using a credit card are the same thing.
So you're telling me you're one of those people that gladly keeps 100% of their money in Bitcoin?

Why does anyone care what this guy says again?
@_date: 2015-04-01 00:47:44
It adds a middle man since you're probably buying Bitcoin with your bank account. Unless you're suggesting that everyone go out and find someone on Local BTC every time they want to make an online purchase.
I understand the argument for being the change you want to see, but to me that means going to meet-ups, talking to people about it, writing about it when I can, etc. This emphasis on using Bitcoin for every day to day purchase seems misplaced. If the technology is really a better system we shouldn't have to go out of our way to use it. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:00:48
Still holding that coin?
@_date: 2015-04-01 00:22:47
Why do that though? Isn't the point of Bitcoin to get rid of middle-men. Not to mention the price always seems to change in value a dollar or two.

Everyone needs to quit being so scared of alt-coins. There's no reason there can't be a rich and diverse universe of coins developed to fit certain niches, all with Bitcoin at the center since it is the oldest and the most trusted.

He's just saying the conspiracy theory idea doesn't work because SHA256 is only useful for Bitcoin.
It's an important experiment to the people like us who are interested, but you need to remember that the VAST majority of humanity could care less about crypto.

Confirmation times are a huge problem though. Humans love instant gratification.

When did you order yours? I put my order in about a week before Christmas and haven't received anything. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 06:03:43
I'd rather have bitcoins from selling something than those that were bought through an exchange like Coinbase or Circle. It's strange using my bank to interact with the world of crypto.
@_date: 2015-03-15 02:38:35
Nobody waits six months for their grocery store debit swipe to clear. We have centralized institutions that are, currently, very good at making sure that we have near-instant, reliable, confirmation. I believe Bitcoin can compete with that one day, but to act like we're there now is delusional. No business owner will put up with having customers wait an hour.

An episode of Ancient Aliens uses more convincing logic than that article.

The price is the heartbeat of Bitcoin. It incentivizes miners and creates the networks backbone.

Well thanks for having a good attitude about it at least. Looking forward to my entropy (and t-shirt). Already love your Android wallet.

Used it the other day to pay at a pizza shop that was trying it out. The cashier was stressed because she didn't understand why it would take so long to confirm. Be realistic. Bitcoin is great, but it needs more time.
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:12:59
You've obviously never owned a business if you think they would ever consider running everything on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:53:33
I'm not saying AdidasCoins are a good or bad thing, maybe it's stupid or maybe there's a way to implement it that makes sense. I'm just saying they way that everyone around here seems absolutely certain that there is no justifiable use for an altcoin sounds very similar to the way many people seem absolutely certain the ideas behind bitcoin are ridiculous. I try to keep an open mind. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:44:19
And lose a ton of money training everyone to accept Bitcoin. Then not make much off of it at all because currently there aren't that many people paying with BTC (see: WordPress).

Ever since the bubble popped last December the pattern is sideways action then a dump. We'll be under $200 soon.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:51:49
We just keep it separate from USD. Not many sales so far so this isn't a huge issue. For tax purposes, the sale gets added on to our normal revenue numbers and we pay the taxes while keeping the BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:06:02
Thank you! I might not be going about it the best way, but I figure as long as the taxes are being paid I should be ok. Best of luck!

Sometimes I think the same thing. I'm leaning towards a drop sometime soon, but I believe in Bitcoin over the long-term. The world needs something like this to make international trade easier. Of course it's a long shot. That's what makes it interesting though.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:09:16
Tough to tell. As any subreddit grows larger the quality of the posts descends. The fact that is attracting more people could be an indication of a bubble, or it could be a side effect of the idea catching on in the mainstream...which is what you would expect if bitcoin was a good idea. 
As has been said before...no one knows.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:10:15
That's what I hope, but I'm playing it safe for now. The gains from holding BTC have more than paid for the tax anyways.

Western graduate here as well! Decided I'd stick around for a while.The Elvis has a whole banana and chocolate chips cooked inside, topped with chocolate sauce, Reese's peanut butter, and whip cream. I keep hearing different explanations for what a true "Elvis" is, but our friend's Dad who's a Chef gave us this recipe and we're sticking to it. Quite delicious, I must say.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:06:42
Get yourself a nice iron. The recipes online are pretty easy. Most important part is to seperate the egg yolks from whites, then beat the whites and fold them into the batter at the end. That's what makes the waffles fluffy inside.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:11:32
With coinbase it takes a bit of time pending, which is worrisome but right now i'm going on trust. No problems so far. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:22:02
I'm on it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:29:10
Definitely better in that case. But if you don't care about changing to USD Coinbase works well.
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:50:23
Customers were stoked on the free waffles today! Educated a couple people on BTC. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:09:28
We've made liege waffles before, but lately we're sticking to the classic, large, fluffy waffles, made from scratch. They give us more options for specials. However, you can request pearl sugar cooked inside (the sugar rocks inside liege waffles) your classic waffle.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:59:03
I run a waffle food truck and we use an ipad running the coinbase app. When someone wants to pay you type in a request for x amount of bitcoins (depends on conversion rate) and then it will bring up a qr code. The customer scans it then is able to send the requested amount to your address. It's worked great so far...but if we get flooded with btc customers I could see it becoming cumbersome. ATM though I like how it is.

Awesome! I'll put out a Facebook message that the first six customers on Saturday have their waffles paid for.
