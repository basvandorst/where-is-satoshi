280 days is a long time in bitcoin though, do you think the current yield rate will stay as high as it is? I've gone ahead and bought 2 shares anyway, I'm still not sure if I'll ever see that $80 ever again though

Ehhh I dunno, there's large socialist factions within the Pirate Party, and they can be authoritarian on certain issues. They can be reasonable on some things though...

fuck off with these posts, they're not even slightly constructive. anyone that mines bitcoin knows what theyre doing, otherwise they wouldn't have an asic.

The protocol seems like magic to me because I don't understand it, but could you integrate something like namecoins domain registration system into bitcoin where you would register a name in place of an address within the blockchain?

I don't believe someone could be that dumb, got any links to people that have done that?

I'd suggest you use electrum instead.
It's deterministic, so you can write down a short phrase of words and then if you ever lose your wallet everything can be restored from the  phrase. Just leave it on your computer with a good password locking your wallet, then go write down your seed phrase (maybe password too) and hide them in your shed or something.
This will ensure only you control the private keys to your bitcoin. Keeping them on coinbase is more of having an IOU for some bitcoin, because you don't actually have the private keys to access your bitcoin stored within the blockchain.
This method of storing bitcoin is still pretty simple I think, and I'd say just as secure, the benefit being it doesn't leave you begging to coinbase if anything ever happens to them.

He is 100% correct. Bitcoin needs to be able to stand on its own to survive. If it cant do this it deserves to die, and will probably be replaced by another coin or fork.

I think you've missed my point. My point is software can be unethical by being closed source. Non-free software is unethical, and order for software to be free it must be completely open.

@_date: 2014-06-08 12:27:19
Me too, the bitcoin protocol needs to be able to survive on its own without neckbeards whining on reddit for people to stop mining on a certain pool. Let the market determine what happens. If we have to move to another coin or new fork, so be it.

You're completely right, its one of the biggest issues facing bitcoin, if a couple million people went and bought something in bitcoin now it would take a day or more to confirm all the transactions
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:03:53
We don't need that. We just need to build something else into the protocol.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:33:52
Im pretty sure N-scrypt basically just has much larger memory requirements making asic implementation harder, similar to what litecoin did but with an even higher memory requirement.
I don't see any reason why ASIC's couldn't be developed for N-scrypt given enough time and if they're profitable enough.

I would certainly say local storage with electrum and a backed up seed is far more secure than coinbase. You have to understand that with coinbase, you do not own any bitcoin, you own a claim to some bitcoin. 
Blockchain.info is the best solution to online storage if you want to keep bitcoin online and accessible through a browser. If you use blockchain make sure to print off the wallet backup.
