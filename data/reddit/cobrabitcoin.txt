Go fuck yourself. The way I type BITMAIN has no relevance in this discussion, and you only bring it up to sneakily hint at yet another conspiracy theory. Like yeah, I totally get into trouble with Jihan if I don't type it the *official* way.
And those names have all engaged in spreading and circulating numerous conspiracy theories and FUD, which seems engineered to divide. Have you even seen the toxic culture they help foster? Adam Back literally said to me in a public chatroom: ["you said bcash has advantages and didn't call it bcash"]( Samson Mow [blatantly lied]( and claimed my account was compromised, Greg also helps [spread]( similar nonsense. These people and their friends spend a good chunk of time just demonising people or attacking Bitcoin Cash. They are just political operators who want to create an us vs. them mentality and dumb down the quality of discourse in the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities.

If my opinions are not coherent to you, maybe take the time to actually ask me to explain? Why just post garbage like "Cobra is just a gun for hire" without even bothering to understand the person you are smearing.
My opinion is actually *really* simple, I believe that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash complement each other pretty nicely. Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency by far, the best store of value and the one with the best development team and history behind it, along with being the most decentralized. But I just think Bitcoin Cash is a reasonable way to pay for things when fees on Bitcoin are high, and because Lightning isn't even out of BETA yet or adopted well enough. Like, how is that *so* hard to understand? Does it really mean someone is sold out, or on drugs, just because they have that absolutely reasonable opinion? Me saying positive things about Bitcoin Cash doesn't mean I'm anti-bitcoin or a bad actor, it just means I can see that both project have their use cases and benefits.

Bitcoin Core needs to explain how a Bitcoin Cash developer is finding critical inflation bugs in their software.

I don't think he cares about being competent or strategically successful. He's just using his namespaces ([Bitcoin.com]( to push an agenda to help Bitcoin Cash, since he's so ideologically *and* financially invested in it.
When someone is *only* financially motivated, the extent of their evil is predictable and you have some hope of getting them to cash in to your side if you can convince them they'll profit from doing so or their present situation looks unfavourable. The real problem with Roger is that he actually believes, almost like a religion, that Bitcoin should strive to be P2P electronic cash for ***the world*** as soon as possible through onchain scaling, even if that means it becomes extremely centralized. We could throw as much money at him as we can, or he could have incentives to be strategically successful, but if that money or strategy makes his idealogical goals less likely to succeed, he won't ever budge. Best way to deal with such people is to infiltrate their religion (essentially what it is) and cause gradual disillusionment until their ideology crumbles away, weakening their resolve, and therefore making financial and strategical incentives to behave rationally much stronger.

I think this could have been promoted without spreading FUD about [Bitcoin.org]( There's almost no chance we'd ever promote "things other than Bitcoin". You are talking about a site that was viciously anti-contentious hard forks, a site that *still* doesn't list NYA companies (Coinbase, [BTC.com]( Xapo, etc) because of events surrounding S2X.
I do like Bitcoin Cash, but that **doesn't** mean I consider it Bitcoin (or ever would). I don't understand what's so hard to grasp about that. But if the intention is to turn users against [Bitcoin.org]( and divide the community (over a sponsorship agreement that we won't even renew?), then something like this is ideal. While everyone is attacking [Bitcoin.org]( and removing links over some minor grievance, you just add more legitimacy to Roger's site, and make it easier for his site to climb up the search rankings. Then once you're competing against a site with paid employees and millions of dollars, maybe then you'd understand why some sort of sponsorship arrangement for some extra revenue made sense.

Yes, it’s Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin will always be  crypto, but for payments, it’ll be a tough competition between Bitcoin Cash and Lightning. If Lightning works really nicely, BTC is much more valuable, but if it doesn’t, it’s likely BCH will grow in importance and price. So owning both makes a lot of sense if you want some hedge on future risk.
There is still something magical about sending or receiving value onchain cheaply, without getting some silly “routing error” message or having to be online 24/7 (or delegate watching to some watchtower) like you would have to be with Lightning.

Roger's fake coin won't ever be accepted as the real thing by any sizeable chunk of the community. It's an altcoin, even if it gets 100% miner support, even if all the exchanges try to force it on us, it'll never become the real Bitcoin. No matter what.

I don't think appending or prepending different words to "Bitcoin" confuses as many people as claimed, and those that get confused might not be well suited to investing their money in cryptocurrencies in the first place and would benefit when they eventually realise their mistake. Blockstream's "Liquid Bitcoin" would be considered fraudulent too, by those same standards.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:46:41
Even if users chose to call BU "Bitcoin", that still doesn't make it Bitcoin. Those users would just be idiots using an alt coin, and the real Bitcoin would carry on. This isn't a democracy, the name "Bitcoin" can't just be adopted by any new random alt coin with the same genesis that manages to trick users with propaganda and lies. Like I have said before, if they use the name "Bitcoin", they will only direct new visitors to sites like bitcoin.org, which will always promote the real Bitcoin, no matter how many people get duped.

It's pretty convincing that Satoshi mined them. Not even relying on blockchain analysis. You can just use common sense. Anyone seriously mining in 2009 with "interesting" hardware would have had to make themselves known to the community back then, they would be active in mailing lists and the old forum. The only reasonable candidates are people that discovered Bitcoin early to mid 2009, that's only like 3-4 people at best; Martti, Nicholas Bohm, Mike Hearn, and Hal.  I'm ignoring the small amount of people who ran Bitcoin a couple times out of curiosity that year and only generated a few blocks. I don't think someone just mined a lot secretly and didn't even get involved in the community, especially since Bitcoin wasn't a guaranteed success so there would be no need for secrecy. Based on people active that year, I'm convinced none of them except Satoshi would still hold on to the unspent coins. I also don't think Satoshi mined out of greed, but out of necessity because there was literally nobody around to do it but him. That gets forgotten sometimes when this issue gets discussed.

A cypherpunk would realize the value of Bitcoin early on and get involved when given the opportunity. He was cited in the whitepaper, but he largely ignored Bitcoin for many years, my extremely old mother had a wallet before this "cypherpunk".
We need to stop worshipping these CEOs, people like Roger Ver and Adam Back are just political operators who don't contribute much to our community but only create division and drive people apart. Companies like Blockstream are potentially extremely dangerous, once you start seeing a company hiring most of the main productive developers of the Bitcoin software, you need to be very suspicious.
This entire post seems like an unnatural attempt at hero worship. Please stop trying to create a cult of personality around people in Bitcoin that happen to agree with your views on the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:53:15


Nobody is selling Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin. No exchange does this. Instead, a few extremists personally believe that Bitcoin Cash deserves the Bitcoin name, according to their readings of the whitepaper and original Bitcoin promotional materials. This might be stupid, but there is no actual huge scam taking place to sell Bitcoin Cash passed off as Bitcoin. There isn't anywhere where users buy "1 Bitcoin" for $7k, and then get sent 1 BCH instead.


They make that argument in a completely different context. If I approached one of these people and asked; "I want to buy one Bitcoin", most wouldn't go and send me some Bitcoin Cash. Their argument is more about their personal view of Bitcoin, which might confuse some, but there really aren't any ways to get scammed into wrongly buying Bitcoin Cash thinking it's Bitcoin, the exchanges clearly differentiate between the two. And it's clear that Bitcoin is obviously different, since you wouldn't need to say "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" if it actually was. The person selling you lead isn't telling you "lead is gold", he doesn't ever mention lead.


I haven't seen "free transactions" marketed anywhere, they usually focus on low fees. Decentralized is not really a binary thing, but I would say that Bitcoin Cash is way more centralized than Bitcoin. Though I don't think you can claim it's not decentralized, it's not like Ripple. And I haven't seen anywhere where it's claimed that Bitcoin Cash has enough capacity for the entire world, at least with current technology. You can't call a cryptocurrency a scam based on incorrect marketing material, [Bitcoin.org]( has "low processing fees" on the homepage, but if fees got really high tomorrow, it wouldn't mean Bitcoin itself was a scam.


The attacks were facilitated by the miners, and I'm one of the few who wants to fire these miners with a PoW change, as punishment for their persistent threat to Bitcoin over the years and to improve decentralization. Mining needs to be decentralized, otherwise there will always be political attacks, and eventually, transaction censorship forced on miners by governments.


So your problem is with a group of people, and not with Bitcoin Cash. You think I'm "multiple people" because you can't wrap your mind around someone being supportive of both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, for different reasons (obviously I am hugely invested more in Bitcoin though). I get told to "pick a side", as if this is sports, but there are no clear defined lines. I will use what works for me. Probably that could be Lightning one day. There's nothing coherent about your hatred for a cryptocurrency that you advocated for for years, by telling big blockers to "fork off", which is what they did. You just *need* to see Bitcoin Cash to be a scam because it justifies your intense hatred, but that only ends up in you making arguments that make no sense.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:36:27


You acknowledge that Bitcoin Cash isn't being sold anywhere as "Bitcoin", but now you say the scam is in the name itself. Bitcoin is built on individual sovereignty, there will always be fringe groups of crazy people that fork off, and believe they are the true Bitcoin. It's their right to believe that, anyone can run their full node with whatever parameters they want. It's insane, but if they believe Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin for them, then it's fine, as long as this fork isn't being sold as Bitcoin on exchanges.


Unfortunately cryptocurrencies are less clearly defined than chemical elements. Really, each person in the system defines Bitcoin for themselves by choosing what full node software to run. Their view is a lot more defensible than you think, and you could easily one day find yourself in a similar situation where you are a minority running what you believe is the true Bitcoin blockchain.


So by your logic, Bitcoin used to be a scam. At what point would it become a scam again, if someone goes and puts "instant transactions" on a popular site, and fools a bunch of people to parrot that, Bitcoin is a scam? It sure sounds like Bitcoin is very easy to damage, if all you have to do to make it a scam is fraudulent marketing. This definition of scam is stupid, Bitcoin is Bitcoin, no matter how certain individuals are promoting it. It can never itself become a scam, it just is technology.


I can't find them, can you show me?


FWIW, I've been against the corporate influence too, you won't find anyone that is as suspicious of corporations in the Bitcoin ecosystem as me. It's concerning the level of influence companies like Coinbase, BITMAIN, BitPay and Blockstream have. They sit in rooms trying to make deals (NYA, Hong Kong Agreement), believing they can decide the fate of the Bitcoin network.


I am tired of people saying I'm compromised, or multiple people. I used to dislike Bitcoin Cash, but I warmed to it gradually and saw it as less of a threat, and appreciated it even more when the fees got high. You may find it inconsistent that I use Bitcoin Cash, even though I dislike BITMAIN, and they control a lot of the hashing power on there and are associated closely with it, but I don't care if Bitcoin Cash is more centralized. Bitcoin needs to be as decentralized as possible, to be a good censorship resistant store of value. But Bitcoin Cash can be more centralized, since it's more focused on payments, so it needs bigger blocks, which encourages centralization anyway. I think of both coins having very different futures and priorities, that is why I will happily use Bitcoin Cash while denouncing miner centralization on Bitcoin, because I view them as having different goals.


Right, you don't hate Bitcoin Cash, you "despise" it. Even though you own some yourself. And it exists because a significant minority believe in a different solution to scaling. I just think saying Bitcoin Cash is a scam, or a fraud, just makes you seem almost as tribalistic and crazy as people repeating the "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" nonsense. Both viewpoints are very extreme.
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:32:02
There’s nothing wrong with supporting Bitcoin Cash and wanting it to succeed, alongside Bitcoin. Both do different things well. There are times when fees on Bitcoin are too high, and paying with Bitcoin Cash makes sense. Alternatively, you probably are better served storing your life savings in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:49:48
Very few people have purchased Bitcoin Cash believing it to be Bitcoin. No exchange actually sells Bitcoin, and then sends you Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash isn’t a scam, there’s no premine, or any intentional weaknesses in the cryptography to steal user funds. In fact, all holders of Bitcoin got free money when Bitcoin Cash forked, which is like the opposite of a scam. I see no logic or evidence behind calling Bitcoin Cash a scam, it’s just something people say out of frustration and anger. Maybe you mean to say some people within the Bitcoin Cash community promote it in dubious ways, but they only harm themselves more than they gain, so I don’t see how that makes Bitcoin Cash, the coin itself, a scam. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:31:14
I really worry about what’ll happen to those 1M+ coins when ECDSA is broken. I think consensus for destruction is likely, but it could also present a way for some influential entity (a group of developers, a big mining company, etc) to accumulate more Bitcoin for themselves by arguing that instead of the coins being destroyed, they should be put into some sort of fund, for the good of Bitcoin development, or that they should be added to the mining block reward some way, to improve mining security. Destroying someone’s wealth is also a pretty scary precedent to have set. Maybe it’s extreme, but I *like* the idea of the coins never being manipulated or destroyed, even if that means they get compromised in some way eventually. It makes the point that whoever controls the private key controls the coins. No matter what, ownership is represented through private key control. Logically, destroying the coins is the best thing to do; but there’s just something that makes me feel uneasy about someone’s money just being completely wiped out in that way.
I also think it’s a worthwhile bounty to encourage development in quantum computing. If the consensus becomes “the coins will never be destroyed”, it’ll mean whoever builds a quantum computer will be rewarded with potentially (assuming Bitcoin gets *huge*) hundreds of billions of dollars. Considering the extremely useful things you can do with quantum computing to advance humanity and science, it might be good to have those coins be something that gets “mined” by entities working on cutting edge quantum computers. At least it gives them a way to recoup some of the insane costs it would take to build a quantum computer. Though then again, it could be that the entity building the quantum computer is *hostile* to Bitcoin.
By the time this stuff is even an issue, it’ll probably be almost impossible to come to a consensus on *any* change in Bitcoin anyway.

So far, the evidence seems to suggest the opposite, BITMAIN gets stronger the closer we get to the maximum possible efficiency. It's irrelevant if you can get cheaper electricity than BITMAIN. They manufacture at the biggest scale, so you will be forced to buy from them (if you want to be competitive), and in doing so, you will already be losing because they're front-running you.

If someone sells you lead, claiming it to be gold, then the scam is in the context of the person misleading you, not the lead itself. It would be absurd to scream “lead is a scam!” in that situation, because you weren’t scammed by an inanimate object. If someone reads “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” on Roger’s site, and *somehow* buys Bitcoin Cash on an exchange believing it to be Bitcoin (I don’t know anywhere Bitcoin Cash is sold as “Bitcoin (BCH)” or something...), then they were mislead and scammed by Roger, not Bitcoin Cash itself. It’s concerning that you’re filled with such hatred and tribalism that you throw all common sense out of the window, because a bunch of idiots brainwashed you to irrationally hate Bitcoin Cash.

I don’t really care about what groups of people fight about over the internet. All that matters to me in a cryptocurrency is utility. Bitcoin Cash gives me a cheaper way to pay for things online (with much bigger adoption than altcoins like Litecoin), irrespective of what a bunch of angry people think. Bitcoin gives me a good way to store value in a censorship resistant way. This isn’t politics, or sports, there’s no need to choose sides. If it turns out that Bitcoin can be destroyed or significantly harmed by some trolls and idiots repeating “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin”, then it was never meant to succeed in the first place.

Mixing off chain and onchain behaviour in this way is a ***total*** usability nightmare. One of the big issues with Lightning is the need to monitor channel state, something which you ideally want to do yourself. With the onchain security model, you can verify everything whenever your node comes back online yourself using the proof of work, and if you aren't around, every Bitcoin full node is verifying the rules to make sure you don't get cheated. With offchain Lightning transactions, you have to trust some watchtower(s) to verify things for you when you aren't there. Having Lightning transactions happening automatically in the background along with your regular Bitcoin transaction is a complete mess; your money is randomly distributed among two networks with *very* different security tradeoffs. Good luck explaining to users that some of the money in their Bitcoin wallet disappeared because someone broadcasted a prior channel state and their watchtower for some reason didn't catch it.


No they definitely won't. That would be a disaster. Lightning wallets are hot wallets and not meant to store the majority of your funds. I suspect most people will only keep &lt;$500 in LN at any one time.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:08:41


The underlying assumption that a Bitcoin transaction happens on the Bitcoin network and has the same security guarantees is broken if some part of every transaction is put into a LN channel discretely. You want users to create channels ***explicitly***, so they can decide who they make the channel with and how much they put in.


Watchtowers verify that somebody doesn't cheat you out of money by broadcasting a prior state. Whatever word you want to use, you're still placing trust in them to check something on your behalf.


Channels being created in the background as you transact normally, without you necessarily understanding what's happening and the security differences between BTC proper and BTC LN.


Good, and your hot wallet shouldn't make up the majority of your funds. For most smart users, and likely for you, their hot wallets will only a very small amount of USD value relative to their total holdings.
Look, the point I'm trying to make, and maybe this isn't coming across clear enough is that we should leave it up to users to make channels and fund them. Not only will that give them a clear mental divide and control about the distribution of their funds, but the channels will be more natural and less centralized around big hubs.

It's not about ethics it's about following along with what everybody else is doing and pandering to the mob. Most of these exchanges list coins that are even bigger scams than BSV. They happily list premined crap or coins with founders' rewards and other abuses built directly into the protocol. BSV isn't presently *that* bad when compared to the degree of central planning and personal greed that fuels some of these altcoins. Though obviously I would never put any money in it.
The issue with BSV is that its community and leaders give absolutely no fucks about marketing or being liked. Other coins are **literal** scams but they hide the nature of the scam behind a friendly well designed site, polite mannered communities, and leaders that actively charm and court exchanges so they can get their coin listed. BSV doesn't do any of that. Their community throws abuse at anyone who is an enemy. They were even daring and taunting exchanges to delist them, and the level of zealotry and extreme behavior amongst them is alarming.
Scamming is well tolerated by all the major exchanges and amongst the crypto media, it's just there's an expectation that you go about it in a more refined and sophisticated way and do the song and dance of courting exchanges, putting out a compelling narrative, explaining away why there's a huge premine before public release, or why 40% of all mining rewards are going to your foundation, or the logic behind supporting your coin with ASICs that only you will have a monopoly on to design, sell and ship to customers. If you go about it the right way, the exchanges and media won't ask any annoying questions, and you'll only get called out by a handful of people, though chances are by the time you're getting attacked by public figures, you've already swindled a couple hundred million dollars out of the ecosystem and you can dump on clueless idiots.
In some strange odd way, I find the BSV people are refreshingly honest. Maybe that sounds weird to say, but I prefer to look at the monster, and avoid it, rather than have it pretend to be an angel, and eventually fuck me in the ass when I realise it was a monster in disguise all along, which is what a lot of crypto projects nowadays are behind a layer of fake niceness and clever deception/marketing.

Overt ASICBOOST is only accessible if you join the Blockchain Defensive Patent Licence group, and you can only do that by opening up your patents portfolio. It goes against everything our community claims to stand for to use legal instruments backed by state force in this way in an attempt to fix the mining centralization issue.
A *better* alternative would be to soft fork in a change to reject blocks mined with patented technologies, and therefore strongly discourage manufacturers from patenting hardware optimizations in future. Patents are terrible for everyone, and even when we try to use them as a force for good, we just empower the state even further. I prefer we just discourage their use, rather than take part.

Bitcoin Cash has its flaws, many of the prominent people in their community are shady and their development process is flawed. But if you ignore all the stupid ways it's marketed, in some ways, it's actually somewhat useful. There was a huge need for *some* type of blockchain with the particular characteristics of BCH; mainly lower fees attained by increased centralization. Litecoin never really took off in a big way for payments, and LN is many years off from being a reliable way to pay (and comes with its own set of issues which make it less suited for certain types of payments).
We can only hope that the toxic people in their community become less relevant over time, and they start to attract decent developers well suited for the tradeoffs they're trying to make with their blockchain. Probably developers who value absolute decentralization will stay away from their project.

The problem is that the centralization exists in the first place, not necessarily whether it's being used to launch attacks yet. Though you could argue that holding hostage segwit for political purposes and giving support to dangerous hard fork attempts are "attacks".
If we had one miner with 100% of the hash rate, would you still support keeping the current PoW? What if it was 95% and 5% split between two miners? At what point do we need to admit to ourselves that PoW is useless and doesn't secure anything if it's too centralized? Our security depends on being able to *react* to miner abuse, but you can't say whether consensus for such a reaction will be possible to build in the future. Such a reaction would also be rushed and not well thought out. Keep in mind that the make up of communities change over time, protocols become entrenched, and LN and layers on top of Bitcoin introduce entirely new ways for hash rate to be abused in subtle ways.
Over time the standard for what many consider an attack will change. Let's say one day there's a hack of Coinbase, and every user of Coinbase loses their money (including some big miners); these miners rush to announce that they'll "recover the funds" through rewriting the chain, perhaps going back ~60 blocks and removing *only* the transactions that steal from Coinbase, and keeping the rest the same. I would consider that an attack on Bitcoin, but there would be a huge mass of people in the community who would disagree because of their own greed. Hashrate won't be abused in black and white ways, it'll be through ways which are somewhere in between, where many won't even consider it an attack because they'll believe it's the morally righteous thing to do, but it'll slowly erode the properties that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place.
Competition so far doesn't look promising. For example, HalongMining, a company with no known address, or any known employees, and so far just a cheap template site and a vague promise to delivery hardware (they haven't yet) is seen by many as the "BITMAIN killer". BITMAIN supposedly made $4 billion dollars in profit, and **THIS** Halong crap will be "competition"? People also say [Samsung is coming to compete]( But Samsung won't be selling hardware, or even using it themselves, they'll just be supplying an "unnamed Chinese mining equipment provider" *with* hardware.... probably BITMAIN.
Rather than wait around for competition that won't come, or believing that we will always have the consensus to respond to an attack, we should be asking ourselves **right now** how we can change and structure the PoW in such a way as to make it very hard for one entity to dominate. The solution won't come from changing the algorithm to another one, but it'll likely be some hybrid combination of multiple algorithms, possibly one that's very easy to make an ASIC for, another that's memory hard, and some level of PoS thrown in as well. As long as the hard fork is done in a clean way, and with consensus (something which will build as mining gets more centralized), the risk of a PoW change hard fork is negligible.

You make a very good point about how the *existence* of powerful attackers that *can* attack the system doesn't necessarily mean the system is centralized. Though I think we should strive to minimize the set of "entities which can execute attacks against the Bitcoin network" as much as possible. If somehow the U.S. government was the only entity on earth that could pull off a 51% attack, Bitcoin would be a lot more secure. Even if the PoW change is a marginal improvement, as long as consensus was built around it, it's a net positive in my view. I think some sort of consensus will build through bringing the issue to light, and as this topic gets more discussed in the open, I'm sure we'll see interesting solutions emerge.
Bitcoin is a secure system right now because, ultimately, there are a set of ethical violations which the wider economy/community will not tolerate under any circumstances. But it's not guaranteed that uniformity of ethics will persist, and I promise you, over time the community will trend more towards types of people who will be OK with things like blacklists, bailouts, and stuff of that sort, as Bitcoin gets adopted by banks and the "mainstream". That's why we need Bitcoin built on the strongest possible technical foundation.


Doing it without consensus-building will cause the split, and by then, there will be so many participants and stakeholders in the community/economy, that you will *have* to build consensus, and it would require years. Not to mention, you may be on a fool's errand trying to build consensus with a community that no longer shares your ethics, or even sees what the miners are doing as a violation. We recently just got done fighting and defeating a segment of our community who engaged in a form of miner worship and blind obedience to hashrate deciding what Bitcoin is.
Your hybrid PoW scheme is a very thoughtful idea. In particular, it's not such a bad thing to have some portion of the hashrate controlled by botnets. The people who run botnets are greedy criminal bastards, which strangely makes them good reliable miners, and their anonymity makes it hard for governments to coerce them. The PoS element adds another layer of security too, and you could possibly add even more PoW algorithms for the portion of hashrate allocated for PoW; something like 1. easy-to-ASIC-for, 2. hard-to-ASIC-for, 3. a backup algo activated under specific conditions. 
We edge closer and closer to a theoretically solid solution emerging the more we bring the mining centralization issue to the forefront by saying we *can* change the PoW, it's not blasphemy. PoW in my mind is not something that should be touched only in the context of an attack, it's just an implementation detail that can be improved at any time, just like how Segwit increased the block size. There was nothing special about the 1MB limit, getting rid of it *did* have consequences, but we had consensus and it was done safely. It's the same for SHA-256.


Very much in agreement here. There shouldn't be any UASF-like movement until we have a solid solution to rally around. We're at a stage, like we were in the scaling debate pre-segwit, where we know there's an issue (in this case mining centralization instead of scalability), and we're just in need of an elegant solution, something which eventually came in the scaling debate with segwit, but not yet in the case of centralized mining. Though at least with the scaling issue, we had tons of active research, but in this case, there seems to be too much fear for *anyone* to look into it.

Stop spreading FUD, and stop repeating Adam Back’s talking points like the puppet that you are. I’m not acting “crazy” or unreliable, and the content on bitcoin.org would be a lot more egregious if I was somehow corrupted as you seem to suggest. Maybe get out of your cult echo chamber and rub a few brain cells together, and you’d see that it’s not so unreasonable to have a positive attitude about Bitcoin Cash.

@_date: 2018-07-18 23:44:37
I'm surprised you aren't advocating for a boycott of [bitcoin.org]( It's some sponsored content pointing users to a pretty good P2P exchange, and the money we'll get from it goes to significantly improve the site and reward contributors. Would you rather [bitcoin.org]( not improve and get better content? Wouldn't that make it easier for Roger's site to perform better in search engines due to the fact they have an entire paid team working against us? I think you should look at the bigger picture a bit here. This wasn't done maliciously, or for greed, this was done to benefit and serve our users.

You don't measure that way, those numbers are meaningless. If you look at comments and engagement, it's pretty easy to see which community is more active across Reddit and other social medias.

Me, whining? I’m not the one spamming “bitcoin.org is being phased out” all across this thread. That’s you.
The site is already excellent and very useful, there’s no need to “still make something nice” of it. Language like that and your repeated claims of the site being “phased out” to new users and hint it could be compromised only convince me that your intent is to slander the site, and not to engage in meaningful discussion.
I’ll repeat it for you, it’s not unreasonable to have a positive attitude on Bitcoin Cash. The fees on Bitcoin can get pretty high, and Bitcoin Cash is an excellent way to transact in situations like that. It functions quite well, and is well adopted by merchants because of companies like BitPay. If you can’t comprehend how that makes sense, then I don’t know what else to say.

I still think it's a scam, but from what you've posted, it's possible that Oleg and Calvin are *not* the same person. The likelihood of Oleg being an employee of Halong is high though, he has been extremely active in their Telegram, always defending Halong, and even putting out what appears to be [strange Russian fake news]( which has been immediately retweeted by Halong.
At first I thought the scam would play out with just not delivering the Bitcoin miners, but clearly *something* is being delivered. Though from reports we're getting from users, [both on Reddit]( and [on the forum]( the efficiency gains are not consistent with what one would expect with use of overt ASICBOOST (casting doubts on whether these chips even have the boost in the silicon). People are already getting suspicious at why this hardware is not meeting the specification.
There are also [strange similarities with Innosilicon]( the PCB is basically an Inno design, a PCB designer [actually confirmed this]( What's really interesting is a user on the forum a few months ago claimed to have flown to Innosilicon offices, and met with them, [where they told him that the product Halong has obtained is actually theirs]( and simply one of their future products. Obviously you can't take the word of random people on the internet on faith, but since there *are* striking similarities both in the PCB, and in the [Web UI]( it's more likely that this is actually an Innosilicon product.
Personally I think they have stolen them somehow, since theft is the most logical conclusion here. If Innosilicon wanted to compete with BITMAIN in secret (which makes *no* sense, since they already compete anyway), they have the expertise available to do a better job covering that up. It's also not unimaginable for Inno to release a BTC miner, since they have miners for LTC &amp; Dash, they could easily have been planning an entry into the BTC mining hardware game this year.
That's what I think has happened with respect to the Dragonmint T1's (the Bitcoin miners), I think they're just stolen, but we'll have to see in the coming weeks how Inno will respond. They could distance themselves from the whole thing to save face, or they could aggressively demand that all customers of Halong return the miners to Inno, along with all earnings. Who knows. Either way, you really don't want to be making money out of what could be stolen goods.
Now with the miners for other algorithms, this is where it gets really evil and horrible. For example with their blake2b miner, [they're claiming efficiency levels of 3.83 TH/s @ 1380W]( while the best BITMAIN hardware for that same algorithm, [the Antminer A3]( is only doing 815 GH/s @ 1275W. Those claims are absurd, and it makes me doubt whether this hardware actually exists. There is absolutely no way an unknown company is able to beat BITMAIN hardware to that extent, considering BITMAIN's massive R&amp;D capability and engineering talent. Conveniently, they haven't shipped out those miners, and there have been consistent delays, with customers still waiting.
Once this all blows over in the next few weeks, I think it's going to be ***the*** biggest scam in Bitcoin. And we should not forget the main people who promoted this nonsense to thousands. The best way to decentralize mining is with a PoW change, not by getting Halonged with some shady hardware and fictitious companies promoted by Adam Back.

No, he's just telling you that the miners \(Jihan Wu\) don't rule Bitcoin. If they did, Bitcoin might as well be called "BITMAIN Coin". Miners have no authority on what is or isn't Bitcoin, that's something that's decided by the users who run full nodes. If 99&amp; of the users supported a HF, it would happen, no matter what the miners thought about it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:44:02
These businesses are insane if they think the community will accept their SegWART that comes with a rushed hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:13:57
It's a shame that small blockers like Roger and Jihan are blocking bigger blocks (segwit) on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:14:37
You should point out that Blockstream employs you for the purpose of communications.  Maybe you aren't the best person to decide what is and isn't "fake news" in this context? You're recommending other people to refer to your post in future, and you're not making it clear that you have a relationship with Blockstream, so that comes across very sneaky.

To be fair, Roger Ver was always very relevant in the community, even before he went completely crazy.

The anonymity space has been shockingly neglected. Probably because very few people actually need strong anonymity, so nobody feels the need to implement better systems than Tor. If the US government wants to find out who you are, it can do so pretty easily, and no technology on the planet is currently able to defend against that.
Even if the technology were perfect, the OPSEC required to run these DNM sites consistently without leaking some personal information as you're handling millions of dollars of wealth and managing a complex business, writing announcements and interacting with users is so difficult that you can't maintain it for any reasonable length of time.
For example, even with Satoshi, it's trivial to assume the country he was living in based solely on the time of his posts and writing style. With enough textual data and source code to search through (something the US government could get), it's not unreasonable to expect that the list of "potential" Satoshi candidates could be narrowed down to &lt;50 people whom can then be monitored and narrowed down even further.
Anonymity technology hasn't kept up to compete against advances in data mining capabilities. For most anonymous individuals, the only thing protecting their identity is being obscure enough to not attract the attention of powerful nation states.

Bitcoin.org is an open source project. Feel free or make a pull request that implements an alert, and it'll be discussed, and possibly merged. I guess there's no harm to have an alert, even if the expected disruption to the network is likely to be minor, it at least will keep people informed and reduces shock if anything crazy happens.

Garbage software. The BU team should just give up. It's embarrassing at this point.

The way facts are presented can be biased or designed to push a particular narrative. I do agree with everything being said, but OP would do good to make it clear that he works for an employer that is involved in the drama (especially because he's their communications guy). It's just basic decency...
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:08:28
Agreed. The whole value proposition of Bitcoin is built on censorship resistance, rolling back transactions is a grievous betrayal of that ethos. As the block reward dwindles it seems inevitable that these types of ideas will get taken a bit more seriously by miners though.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:15:28
The 2x hard fork will never be Bitcoin, no matter how many miners switch over to it when the time comes. I'm sure you, and everyone else associated with Core is well aware that true Bitcoiners won't ever consider that piece of crap to be legitimate. If they do hard fork, I hope Core will immediately change the POW, and we can move on from this mess. We will never let them win.

He didn't disappear right after the CIA visit, he was responding to emails for quite a while after. I think his goal was to bootstrap the project, get contributors, build a team, and then gradually start shifting out of focus once he felt that the project was in good hands. I get the feeling that he wanted to minimise the length of time he maintained the "Satoshi Nakamoto" identity. Keep in mind he never formally left, so he always gave himself the option to return if he felt the project *really* needed him (this would have probably happened if the development stagnated around 2011/2012). There were probably like 3-4 people behind that identity anyway, at some point it becomes stressful keeping a team like that together and having them constantly stay in touch and share knowledge, while also being anonymous and using proxies and Tor everywhere. Best opsec is to keep an identity alive for as short as possible, and once the objective is achieved, to kill it off.

Most of our traffic comes from Google. And in fact, we still get tons of new links daily. Not sure if you’re stupid, but you and your small clique of paid idiots spreading FUD about bitcoin.org and even forking it (btcinformation.org) have almost no effect on us. The site continues to get traffic, regular contributions, translations, and is the place where the overwhelming majority of users download Bitcoin Core.

This is stupid. A full node product that comes with a “pre-synced” blockchain (and encourages this) is useless. The whole point of running a full node is to be able to verify the integrity of the blockchain without having to trust anyone. Encouraging people to pay hundreds of dollars for a raspberry pi with a copy of a “trusted blockchain” is doing the community a huge disservice. People are better off installing Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots on a decent PC instead IMO.

When was I compromised and by whom? Surely if I was compromised by someone hostile to Bitcoin they would force me to abuse my access to [bitcoin.org]( in some way to damage Bitcoin? Do you see any content on the site that harms Bitcoin? All your examples are essentially me saying things you disagree with or random Twitter drama that most casual users don't give a shit about. I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings. 
Truth is I've helped millions of people learn about Bitcoin in a safe and reliable way. Maybe you can contribute to a project too? Seems like you think arguing on the internet and running UASF software that would have split you off from mainstream Bitcoin is helping Bitcoin. You are acting in bad faith and I don't think it's reasonable for me to continue wasting time engaging with vicious trolls like you.

It's a form of censorship by Blockstream Core. They design their software to block nodes that in the future might be incompatible, but they work fine now, so they suppressing free speech of users to signal to peers what consensus rules they will accept.
