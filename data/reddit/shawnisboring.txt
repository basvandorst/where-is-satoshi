But gold and silver almost always increases in value over time and has historically been a safe investment for thousands if years.  
Bitcoin is insanely new, unproven, and the general public will never know how it works or how to use it.
It's a techie enthusiast hobby and proof of concept that everyone is mistaking for the future.  As it stands bitcoin is far too complicated for the average person to understand or use, and far too unproven to trust as a currency.

Have you seen the average person use a computer?  Do you really believe the average person will understand, trust, and use bitcoin rather than money they've been accustomed to their whole lives?
This is as niche as niche can get.

Just build a little fence around it.

Oddly enough, I agree with both of these posts.  
It's a double edged sword really, it's valuable because people inherently want to get rich quick and see "internet money" as an entirely new business they can back from the ground up (imagine being able to back personal computers from the ground up), but I believe it's extremely overvalued (in the truest sense of value) by the relatively small community that backs it and its currently limited applications.
In the end I haven't invested in bitcoin because I err on the side of caution and see it as far too volatile; I can't really put much trust in something that went from $30 to $1000 in the span of a few months.  Granted, I'm purely a novice, but if it can rise that fast, surely it can fall just as quickly.

It's just a peer to peer cloud storage service.  I could see it being used. 
No need to build huge data centers, just farm out the storage and hashing to volunteers and pay them a little.  
I'm a little surprised it hasn't happened already.

If it's that difficult to find a business building upon the utility and application of bitcoin, in a world were every business is trying to beat their competition to the next big trend, then perhaps this is the wrong thing to be throwing money at.
