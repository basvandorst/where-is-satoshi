Seen some guy on buildpcsale once that posted him self buying an SSD for bitcoins and he was pissed off when BTC hit all times high of 2k+, but other people told him if it wasn't for his transaction, maybe we wouldn't be at 2k+.

Proof is stake, as u get% return on the coin u saved in ur wallet! 
Well mining I doubt is gonna be count as gambling as technically you're not actually spending real money(but electricity) to make money and take money from others!!!
However you're putting your machine into work. I think of it like a Taxi driver, it's all about luck right? Be in that spot in the right time to drive someone.(before we had uber and phones)

U managed to send 4K to Middle East? You're brave guy! Last time I sent $1k I was under investigation from the FBI -.-

I see 2 possible thoughts:
-avoiding taxes by lying on how much you made. 
-make extra $ from the ATM transaction fee. If it's your own ATM you can charge $2 or more.

Why even bother going to the bank? When you can wash out all the cash that you "forgot" to mention :) easy job.

Loved in Syria for few years while running away from Iraq. We had black market where you can take in USD and get almost double Syrian lira. Same thing for knock off usd, take in real ones and you can usually double or quadrille it with fake ones. Some higher quality ones usually go for double but u gotta buy a lot!

Didn’t the silkroad guy get his bitcoins seized? They waited for him to type it or something in the library before they ambushed him!

But but but silkroad? Like did people all the sudden forgot about silkroad! 
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:11:15
Ok so let's assume I don't cash out, would they still charge me for that 500$ gain? Or wait until I cash out
One more, how would they know I have bitcoins? I haven't noticed any exchanges send 1088(or whatever the form name for self employed

Those old guys made billions from doing something else. You know sometimes just because someone is a billionaire doesn't mean he knows everything. Heck I bet he doesn't know what's a block chain is. And or he knows what it is and wants people away from it do he could buy in cheap.

Used to check every day a bit over 100 times! Now I check it once a week, and check some news about the coins I'm in to make sure everything is as is.

One question, let's assume I bought 1BTC at 4000$
The price goes up to 4500$ 
I cash out, does the government charge me for the 500$ profit or the whole 4500$? 
On another note let's assume it crashes and I cash out at 3900$ 
Do I pay taxes or what?

We have all the time to know if he's right or wrong in the near future.
If he's wrong that's good. If he's right now that's bad. However if the community believes in crypto I don't think a rich man opinion would matter.

And saved the company over 50% taxes cuts because Canadian taxes ****ass

Yea after I threaten them and they knew they would pay more than 13k as lawyer fees and court as I had the winning side anyway as its their fault for trying to save few $ on cheaper transportation with no insurance.

Sadly that's the worst, I worked with a partner in Canada, whom would write me a Check every month for my 80% share and he takes his 20%(long story to explain why he has to do it). So every month I had to wait a whole month just for my money to get approved and get it deposit into my bank account :/ worst 2 years of my life. And once had a check for $13k get lost in the mail, so I threaten them with a law suit as the Canadian bank refused to cancel the check as it was bank check or whatever the reason (been 4 years) and my bank had to use their insurance. I had to wait a whole year to get my bank insurance to pay.

Oh good to know, I'm not the best when it comes to taxes!!!
