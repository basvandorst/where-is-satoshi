Well, Magicaltux had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret. 'I am not Magicaltux', he said. 'My name is Garry; I inherited the ship from the previous Magicaltux, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Magicaltux either. His name was Mark Karpeles. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia
