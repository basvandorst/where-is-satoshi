Yes you can invest, and looks like you have a lot of help from people here to get started. :)
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:11:45
+1 for you :)

if a group of old ladies can do it, then everyone else can too!

I tried to use it the other day.... I just ended up calling to find the information I needed...  Their website is a mess and can't figure anything out.

This is more of an internet currency.  People are too use to not having things changed.  Eventually they will have to, but until we have better people running things, people will stay clueless about a lot that life has to offer.  
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:14:31
I can't really see why there is so much hate either on either side.  They are both the same type of currency.  Both can easily get you to the moon and Beyond!
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:30:49
ew man, that is horrid. :|
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:24:12
Don't have much, but what I do have I hope keeps going :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:37:12
Thank you lots! :)

Welcome to the club! :D 
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:04:10
that's how it is with most guys.  We want only a couple kids, women are like, "GIVE ME ALL KIDS!" lol
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:56:51
Fullyrite ;)
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:30:19
But how does one keep the change without loosing it?
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:29:04
Thanks a bunch! :)  And that is why I decided to share this news.  Sometimes someone just needs a little good news. I am fully with you on that. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:05:57
In the end, you win some, you lose some.  Lots of people are skeptical about anything and everything dealing with money... for the most part.  But most who talk shit about stuff they don't understand are the ones who really don't want to see change.  BitCoin is a future changer, something the entire world could make into one currency.  But in the end, there are too many out there that don't want or care for change, namely old people and the government.  Because what the government can't control, they don't like/want.
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:48:34
Well, this is not good news... :|
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:23:05
Thank you! :)  Not investing anything more right now. :)  SOoooo much stuff to get.  Everything we had was either destroyed or was just old or ended up on a recall list.  I'm thinking, why do baby items end up on a recall list if they go through so much testing first?  Some of it was fisher price stuff...
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:21:09
You know?  That would be quite awesome!  Imagine the future, "Wow so, you're part of the family that created the new currency?"  Future baby, "why yes, yes I am."  Instant popularity. :D
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:02:40
Thank you for the reference fix.  I couldn't remember what it was. lol  And thank you :)
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:20:33
Why is there a war between Bitcoiners and Dogecoiners?  Very confused about that.  
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:36:24
Heh, I remember my dad trying to talk to me through AOL Messenger many years ago.  I could make a drink, cook some food, take a shower between messages lol  And there would be only a few words every time.  I miss those days :(  Feels coming on strong now :(
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:25:02
Ahhh ok.  That explained a lot.  Thank you for that :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:35:10
If anyone is willing to throw some donations here, could use them! :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:03:51
I see what you did there :) lol  also, just in case    It was a joke for those medicines that claimed they could cure al aka miracle drug, but not from Miracle Max. lt was mostly made with high % of alcohol, molasses, and goop.  Towards the end, she gets so drunk she slurs and can't remember her lines.  One of the funnier episodes that hit on real life at the time too.  
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:37:07
Basically you're right.  People only really believe what they learn from either TV/School/Government.  To them, the internet is for porn/music/videos.  No one wants to progress further... As humans, we seem to have just accepted the state we are in, and have no drive to go further.  I'm not saying all humans, just about 70% of them....  I actually have family members and friends interested in bitcoin and dogecoin while other friends and family cast me off like I'm a vacuum salesman :|  BTW  Do you guys have time for me to tell you the good word on this vacuum with this awesome atom filter?
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:05:11
nah dude.  If I'm wrong, then I am wrong.  I accept my mistakes and fix them instead of constantly looking stupid. lol
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:23:13
Not begging for anything.  Sorry my story is so long as when I start writing, I really can't find an off button.  And I just wanted to spread good news.  You're the only one really aggravated by this post.  Personally, I love stories and backstories.  But in the end, this is why I usually don't say anything at all.

my head, it hurts, need some Acetaminophen

So..... Is there a bigger dooby than a blunt?  I'm not to hip on the mary jane slang.  
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:24:40
I was just trying to keep the joy going :)
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:30:01
LOL I have no idea what I would do if we had twins.  If they were the same sex, my god I'd confuse the two all the time.  I'd have to mark them with a permanent marker lol
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:15:05
Hope you're having yourself a great day!!  And thank you in advance if you get to me! If not, no hard feelings, I see you did a lot today!  :D

After a while of that stuff, anything is tasty. XD
