You are fucking pathetic.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:03:28
Why not?
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:05:58
Ah alright, thought you were one of those idiots who doesn't know you don't have to buy 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:27:49
Everyone has it and their CTO is talking about it like it's nothing. Fucking great.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:35:33
For some reason the news really cares about this one in the Netherlands, no word on Lightning or anything though
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:23:35
well r/bitcoin is different from what it was when i left it months ago, overwhelmingly negative actually.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:30:33
Let us set the fucking speed of the transaction, not everyone needs fucking 1 second transaction. I just want my fucking BTC back but you are absolutely killing me with these fees, i don't care if i have to wait a week. Its to late for me to use it for christmas as i had planned anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:21:46
And this is why we are in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:40:57
I am a business owner, landlord, and a freelance consultant as well.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:05:18
Something about core and unlimited and shills and the people at r/btc are hitler etc.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:10:25
Bitpanda is pretty good, also has low fees.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:11:07
Have you considered BitPanda? Fees are lower i think.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:21:56
That, i agree with.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:50:26
If you are trying to lose weight, i'd recommend and use the app MyFitnessPal to track every single calorie that you eat. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:48:47
So my wallet actually only contains the keys? That makes a lot of sense actually.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:10:44
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:54:04
I learned about Bitcoin when it hit 1000 and immediatly bought after doing research. I feel like such a dumbass right now haha
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:08:40
Highly doubt that, anything to back it up?
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:37:29
I use electrum.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:52:37


@_date: 2017-08-07 13:25:12
!RemindMe 7/31/2018
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:57:54
On what did you base this back then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:35:28
But he won, as has mentioned already.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:04:08
Coming awfully close already
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:26:05
fuck i love this meme
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:33:48
God, you're cringy. Go outside for once.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:26:31
So it will just take a long time now?
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:21:09
Do you mean this?
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:05:35
Yeah, this is hilariously delusional.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:16:16
I paid the highest possible fee via electrum.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:35:37
Wait segwit is bad now?
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:58:44
Wait what's that?
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:26:18
So it will take a real long time now?
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:54:43
I have been out of crypto for a while, can anyone tell me that when I look up my wallet address it doesn't show any bitcoins on balance at all? No matter what explorer I use?
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:13:25
Also just showed up, nevermind.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:56:54
from 9.9k to 8999 is 1% now?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:43:35
It broke through the long term channel support from april 2017.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:57:29
8227 is a new local low, few days ago was 8366. The channel bottom is a rising trendline so it was higher today as it was then.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:12:44
It just arrived in my wallet, so not really.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:18:20
Of what? The transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:12:42
I sold at 4200 a few weeks ago because of financial troubles. Fuck me
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:06:16
Oh the horror.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:28:40
Bottom is not in it seems.
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:30:34
Bitcoin isn't a ponzi, this sub is however.
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:00:09
I thought so lmao
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:30:27
What does this mean for a simple hodler like me who doess't understand shit about all this? And what can i do to help?
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:32:11
Aye aye, captain!
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:57:21
oh ffs learn your fucking memes
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:56:58


But i can't use them either, right?
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:03:22
Euh, what are those?
