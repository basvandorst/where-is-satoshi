Modern cars have electronic steering, brake assist, torque vectoring, and a completely electronic controlled engine. Provided someone can gain remote access they can then induce vehicle behavior with little override from the driver.
I'm pretty sure that some hardware would be required, but then again OEMs are starting to link controls to an uplink for diagnostics.

So it's basically going up. Got it. I agree.

A good bit of celebs pledged to leave the US if Trump won. I haven't heard of any packing their bags.

Sounds like these guys were fooling around with the rifle. Even if open carry is legal you can't sling it around pointing at things in public.

Good point. Same thing happened to locomotives. GE was selling out of simple emissions locomotives because operators were weary of dealing with new emissions tech, mainly after treatment systems that had no benefit to performance.

I don't think so, but you would have to pay tax on the vehicle sale (most likely).

Similar things happen in Europe. We employ people there and the cost per employee is quite high even though their take home pay is about half our cost. Nothing is free. Nationalized Healthcare is just mandatory state run health insurance that is a financial burden to employees and employers.
  
The only question with national healthcare is do we trust government to run it or would we rather have it privately run. As a side note one of our employee benefits is a private Healthcare plan that can be used to skip the lines and see private physicians.
