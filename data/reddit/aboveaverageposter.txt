This is what rbtc shills say.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:03:27
Fuck off troll.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:57:44
No, because they do it on every crash every time without fail.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:06:36
Yeah etf not getting approved lol. Would be shocked. Thank BU and crew for continuing to strangle and attack bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:36:26
Being malicious makes it malicious.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:17:52


Oh god your trolling is making me cringe
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:12:43
Oh wow big surprise you two shills who have everything to gain from bitcoin being in discord support an unnecessary and toxic plan.  
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:51:54
All bitcoin will never be lost since it is infinitely divisible. The network would work just the same and be able to serve just as many if there were only 1 bitcoin total in existence.

Segwit troll.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:43:35


Well you're a Ver sheeple so not surprised.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:25:25
Fucking disgusting. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:50:57
.bit domains? NMC to become relevant finally?
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:46:06
Wrong. Space doesn't exist. The sun and moon are small and close. Earth is a stationary plane. Search Eric Dubay on youtube.
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:56:50
Litecoin action soon.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:50:52
Funny you would show up. I was just thinking how this Bruce guy and you are using the exact same division tactics....calling for an uneeded compromise with toxic players that, in reality, would just further complicate things. Fuck you, your shilling, and your shitcoin business. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:28:06
Because the BU crew doesn't want anything that comes from Core. You are kidding if you think that would even appease them or end the war. They want to fight forever and take complete control of bitcoin. Stop playing dumb!! Why not just support segwit which is a blocksize increase already and gives us what we need to grow. Why compromise with toxic players? And guess what....YOU are one of those toxic trolls so please just stay away and stop the divide and conquer shilling youve been doing.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:34:39
Whats with the Tai Lopez vibe? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:43:25
Um no. Just 1 bitcoin can be divided into 21million*100miilion units or more. So 1 bitcoin can be divided into more total btc units than there are today with 16 million bitcoins. You can run an entire global economy on 1 bitcoin....or even 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:09:59
Here's Satoshi and others talking about the creation of BitDNS (now known as Namecoin) 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:36:30
Just add another decimal point. Would have units smaller than satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:35:32


Sad to see you drinking koolaid.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:59:44
Fuck you "compromise" trolls in here all of the sudden. No one is compromising with you bad actors. Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:47:16
Yes, infinite division. Pretty cool indeed.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:10:52

@_date: 2017-03-04 16:50:26
Lol no
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:01:33
Don't fall for these "compromise" shilling tactics! It's a hot shilling topic and several industry players have come out today to shill. It's an attempt to weaken and blur out the best way forward for bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:09:41
Moderation may have just saved bitcoin. Try to think about the alternatives of allowing attack brigades....this sub is dead by now. Stop giving credibility and support to an obvious coup attempt.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:02:39
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:40:28
No because there's no reason to right now, just added risks. Nice goalpost move. Fuck you chump.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:19:39
Yep. Sounds like he's been paid off. spewing moronic crap all over the place.
