That's me being an asshole? It was a joke. You have some think skin if it that's rude to you.

come on now. Don't act like that

Why would quantum computing run down the price?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:58:19
that would make me feel even worse! Let's hope it drops down to $1 this time next year ^^^^^;)

No reason to act like that. I didn't mean it hasn't always been like that **until now**. I'm saying no, that won't **always** be the case. You have no idea if bitcoin will always go up or not, that's my point.

ahh, good point. I really think you should make a post on this with a little more depth. It would make for grea discussion
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:03:18
Lol, I wish. I'll need to pay for a lot of things shortly and bitcoin won't cut it as of now

No reason to be such an asshole, fuck dude. My bad. Also, it seems the moron would be you if you can't even spot your own car.

I've seen literally zero people panicking on this sub and probably 6 of these kinds of posts.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:51:58
I do! Thanks for the comment

Dude, why are you acting like this? I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying what you said wasn't correct. And I've been on reddit for multiple years. Hope you stop acting like an ass.

I'm guessing it'll drop like another 500 dollars?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:51:14
Because i'm 16 without a bank account or credit card at the moment
