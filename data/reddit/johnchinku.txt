But how the miner know what hash other miners are generating. He has no access, and once he has submitted a hash, if he is not allowed to change, how would a miner with the most powerful machine know whether his hash is the lowest or not.

I am suggesting a system where  the POW generation would not be something where the miners need to achieve a target. Having a faster machine would surely help him generate hashes at a faster rate.

What i get from reading articles and papers of Bitcoin is that the PoW protocol alongside being used to get the miner of the next block, it restricts the rapid generation of Bitcoins in the system. It tries to maintain the uniform generation of new coins in the system by adjusting the difficulty. So designing a system that would be based on luck and also maintain the rate of generation.

I am considering people working in group and doing the mining in the group with combined power from ASIC machines...

I am suggesting  a change in the BTC system, where the generator of new blocks would be decided by the hash they generate not how much closer they generate their hash to the target.

But you have a target to achieve, and you need to manipulate your nonce and generate a hash. But even if there is a luck attached to the generation but still a significant portion would be depending on the power of the machines. ASIC machines are specifically built for the mining purpose. So why not remove the target to be achieved and include in it a way in which the generation of the next block would be purely based on luck.
