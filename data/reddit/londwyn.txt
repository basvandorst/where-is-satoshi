Sure, if they dont get sued out of existence. 
Not only Finex, but each depositor has a reasonable civil case.
Bitfinex allowed their name and brand to be used to undersign the security of the bitfinex exchange. 
I'm fairly certain a class action would have legs.

i think bitgo has primary responsibility in this case. They allowed their brand name to be used as the security specific outsourced and wallet holder. This is their one job and only job. User's 2FA was linked directly to bitgo.

If the bitgo key was used to sign, then bitgo did not enforce any rate limits or checks, and simply signed all requests immediately?

that would not be enough

There are only two possibilities
* Cold wallet key was used with hot key to sweep the entire btc balance of all users
* Bitgo is compromised, having either zero rate limits or else leaking their key
One or the other must be true for a theft of this size. 
should let us know which it was.

Rate limits, sanity checks, heuristics, human approvals, flow controls.
No, its the whole purpose of bitgo to prevent 120K btc from being swept in a heartbeat. This is literally the remit of their entire organization.
The api key is not nearly enough. Bitgo has to make a statement, it appears they must be responsible at least as much as finex.

The whole purpose of bitgo is to handle exactly that situation.

Three of the suitcases are actually full of Daddies' mineral collection, which he does not need to take on the weekend trip.
He packed them because he has had his eye on that new truck for a while

Can we change this to false ?
static const bool DEFAULT_PERMIT_REPLACEMENT = true;
It would be helpful not to have RBF turned on by default, or at least save us the hassle of disabling it.
I love core, iBLTs, segWit, LN, WBs, etc, but RBF is a non-starter for me.
