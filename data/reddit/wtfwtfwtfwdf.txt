The 10 dollar fee was calculated based on what he bought. It might be the coinbase fees and the discrepancy between the dashboard price of coinbase (directly off GDAX) and the buy/sell tab (which calculates the fees 25 to 100 point basis. Thanks to the other redactor pointing it out.

How com it says fee 10 dollars though? Also do you notice how when you click the dashboard and the buy/sell tabs there is about a hundred dollar discrepancy? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:28:26
Thats not the point. The point is they should add a warning that the buy on the coinbase application and website is an OPEN MARKET BUY ORDER..... 250 dollar difference is insane !

There should be a freaking warning that its an open market buy order.... seriously 250 dollars is not cool

No I'm saying that number is meaningless. Have you bought a share of stock before? If you buy open market when lets says apple is trading at 172.34 - the exchange rates will give you the "best price" available or the "fastest" way to get in regardless of price. So if you click buy at 172.34 there is a tiny lag until your oder fills in. This is called an open market buy. Theoretically your oder can get filled at 174 even when the price is 172.34 when you hit buy.  This is what happened to my friend. Except the difference was 250 dollars. So he automatically lost 125 dollars due to the exchanges.

They should put a sticky on this sub reddit warning people to only buy with GDAX limit... God knows how many folks are getting screwed because of this very deceptive way of doing business.. 
Like i said they should put a sign saying its an OPEN MARKET BUY ORDER....
With a fault like this in the system He could have been locked in at an exchange rate of 50,000 theoretically....
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:47
I'm assuming its because it was using a open market buy order. Its just super deceptive not to list that when your buying. I told him about gdax but he's still pissed he got in at 10450
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:19:28
Im not clicking that nice try 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:48
Thanks for your assumption. No it did not. I already mentioned it did not move up that much until about 40 minutes
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:32
250 dollar premium? no way.... the fee was approximately 10 dollars 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:33
Dude i swear you don't understand me. He did. After clicking buy he received an email saying the exchange rate was 10450... the screen before the buy was at 10250... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:07
250 dollar fee? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:45
Thanks for the only decent reply in this reddit post. Yea thats pretty deceptive. Unfortunately GDAX wants a license and also a head shot. I guess its not open market order? Im just trying to figure out how he got screwed, wether it was because the buy button is an open market buy order or he got hit with that fee your talking about that apparently is not even the 10 dollar fee.. 
Thanks for the decent reply once again. Im having doubts about reddit too but people like you keep me coming here.

He used his checking account. Thank you for your assumptions. Are you perhaps a coinbase employee ? Your comment is very passive aggressive my friend. Im not okay with coinbase exchanging USD to BTC by a difference of 250 dollars. Like i said they should put a sign saying its an OPEN MARKET BUY ORDER....

 the fee was 10 dollars  he bought about 5k 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:41:00
Thanks for the recommendations. But honestly don't you think they should tell people its an open market buy order? Basically the price you click buy at is not the actual price your bitcoins get executed at... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:04:10
Thanks for calling me stupid. Do you know that Im a living person behind a computer typing? How old are you ? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:35:16
Thats what he thought as well my friend. Except when he clicked buy the exchange rate he got locked in was 10450. The price was 10250 at the time...... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:08:30
Yup same problem for me ! And for my unfortunate friend it must have changed by 250+ those fees you mentioned etc. thanks for your help buddy... I think my friend and I learned our lesson.
 Use GDAX with limits.....
