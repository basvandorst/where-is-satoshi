Hi this is Angelos from Coinomi Wallet.
We have evolved multifold since this excellent list was posted, and we'd appreciate inclusion and update.

Coinomi is available for Android and iOS platforms, with desktop versions for Windows, Mac and Linux coming soon. Users can exchange all supported assets instantly from within the app via the built-in instant exchanges ShapeShift and Changelly. Founded in 2014 Coinomi is the oldest multi-asset wallet with millions of active users while at the same time no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or otherwise compromised. See more at:

You probably entered your seed in one of the scam BTG sites as suggested above as the address is the same.

each address type has its own path (M/44H for legacy, M/49H for compat and M/84H for native), so no keys are reused

Fees are 100% customisable in Coinomi. We also boast native segwit for 15 coins, not just BTC, all with seamless UX while switching between the three modes (Native, Compatibility, Legacy).

Consider something more serious:  -- Getting requests to more providers to update will be much appreciated, as it's been months. Coinomi updated on day one..

The recovery phrase is the building block of the entire BIP44 technology. Keeping it safe in an offline place away from the device is a must, and not specific to Coinomi - there are many BIP44 providers out there. Issues with a specific release on a specific device might always occur, and we're always here to help if that happens. A lost/stolen/broken phone without a safe backup of the seed has the same effect as you so colorfully described.
