The internet wasn't very useful in the 1980s either. Just like Bitcoin isn't very useful now. It takes a long time to design and implement scalable networking protocols. Bitcoin has been moving extremely fast over the last decade since it's inception, much faster than the internet did. There were 15 years between the first publication regarding TCP and the creation of HTTP (1974-1989), and another two years before the first website went live.
It has been 7 years since the original Bitcoin paper was published. The idea that we could have a working version of an infinitely scalable, instant, free, anonymous protocol in the next layer next year when the lightning protocol comes out is incredibly fast. If that doesn't work out and it takes until 2025 or something it will still be fast.
Of course we all want it to happen as soon as possible and that is why tens of thousands of people in universities from Sydney to Cape Town to Tokyo to San Fransisco are filled with cryptographers and computer scientists working on Bitcoin. As well as why companies are contributing resources to solve these same problems. 
Here are two projects where you can view the regular commits of new work being done on lightning network specifically: 
There are many more at universities and companies across the world. The current system sucks and Bitcoin isn't much better but it has solved all the fundamental problems and all that remains is for the new financial system to be built on top of that. It will take time but if you want to contribute do more research, if not wait, and learn the fact that 10 years is a blink of an eye for the world.

You can buy with credit cards on CEX.io and then transfer the coins to a wallet like BitX/Mycelium/Circle. Then you just scan a QR code of someone that accepts Bitcoin to spend them.
