You are actually correct. For the traditional bitcoin investor/trader this might be an issue. For the fearful masses this might be a solution.

You are right. That still does not mean that this changes the news. Plus500 does similar but they have less than 70k customer base verses 3 million. Do you really think it compares?
I prefer to buy and own without counter-party risk so I hold my bitcoins directly, and most of my stock. However, the market works the opposite in most of the world...everything and everybody has counter-party risk (hedged bets and fiat). As I say below they still have to cover the hedge 4 times per day. This can be massive in either direction when you are covering millions of dollars profit/loss. That still translates to bitcoins bought and sold even if through a third party. Lastly, social trading (autopilot) will put more buyers in the market than Plus500 could ever wish just because the users can "copy" a good traders movements.

Adding 3Million potential buyers and 10Billion under management...social autopilot trading. This may just be the best news of the last 10 months. Only the next few months will tell.

Thank for trolling ;) but I thought it would be better served here. I read through most of your posts and you act like a curating troll attempting to get your post limit up. I found 1 useful comment from you before I tired of reading. I'm glad you know how to use reddit so well, thank you soo much.
1. I put it here because I think it belongs here
2. This site has duplicates and if you need to search then it's not appearing in an adequate thread in my opinion. If this were an issue they would block repeat links like Digg. 
3. This news is current and really on point to Bitcoin subreddit.
Anyway, you seem more than smart enough to comment on what you think this means for the BTC network as opposed to self appointed "wrong forum" snarking.

They still have to hedge that difference if that is the case. What seems to me is the case is that they are executing trades 4 times a day at a specified price. Either way this forces net purchases or sales. Depending on the in house volume this could definitely be big. Both in PR, in follow on from other trading houses, and in increased volume. 
Thanks for the comment!
