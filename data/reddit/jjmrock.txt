My example is when a transfer is made to a wallet that the owner controls. why is it a report sent to the IRS when no sale has taken place?

Don't mean to take up to much of your time, but Coinbase states, 
Transactions sending into or out of your Coinbase wallet are treated as buys or sells at the current market price in this report.
This refers to any transfer, does it not not? Your examples are spot on, another example is  back in the day when one held stock certificates at home or in a safety deposit box.  Why is holding a crypto asset treated as a sale?  Why should a taxpayer have to report the fact that they are holding a crypto asset?  The U.S. tax system is based on an obligation of self-reporting when a capital gain event occurs.

No, you are right.  If you sell it, you have a relatively simple way of (and obligation to) reporting it. My question stems from the fact that this exchange is treated all transfers of as sales from my reading. To me, a wallet is just like storing something in a safety deposit box. Transfers to wallets should not be treated as sales.

The difference may lie in the fact that you are transferring from a regulated exchange which has recently been subpoenaed to provide information on 14k users.  The exchange only sees that the coins have left.  Does this trigger a capital gains event??

You are correct, it's not a taxable event.  So why is it being reported as a sale by Coinbase?

self reporting what?  no sale took place.  seems like a slippery slope to me.

Yes I get that Coinbase doesn't know where the transaction is going.  Just hope that such reports are kept only by the exchange.  Tax authorities don't have a legitimate interest in non-sale transactions on a macro level.

So is it probable that exchanges may be compelled  to report every transfer off the exchange?  Application of the arcane rules you refer to could become very burdensome to the holders.
