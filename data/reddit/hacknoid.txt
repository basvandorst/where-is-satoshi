Disappointed?  Really?  This is an attempt by a branch of government of a first-world country to try to explain digital currencies to the normal layperson.  That's a huge accomplishment and a huge step forward in legitimizing the entire industry!

I will grant you this - as Bitcoin stands TODAY, it will not be able to handle a billion people's transactions.  No surprise there.  However, you seem to think that the network will not change and adapt over time to compensate for growth.  Yes, there are growing pains - and we have already seen some.  Any new technology has this.  Would we have been able to stream 4k video using a T1 backbone like we had 25 years ago?  No... at that time could the internet even support a billion users at the same time doing activities like they do today?
And your argument about the community refusing to allow any changes is an outright falsehood.  Yes, there has been plenty of debate, but consensus seems to be solidifying around a (lower) number, still higher than today.  Things may be a bit rough going, but any system can and will change.  Bitcoin is merely software, and software will be updated.
I find it funny that people predicting the death of Bitcoin due to scaling issues, lack of leadership or whatever essentially sound the same as those predicting the death of the almighty dollar.  Both these systems are (probably) elastic enough to find a way to continue.  There are enough people with enough vested interest to see that they can work out.  
Nothing is a given, and the most likely outcome is that not one single person the world is able to see what either Bitcoin or the current fiat system will be like in a few years.  It's the unexpected that will force change in the world, and living systems like these will learn to adapt.

Not for bitcoin itself, but individual exchanges can get that sort of information.

I've been using them for years, and pulled out remaining funds when they announced closure.  When coinsetter took them over, I started using them again.  No problems - same logins continued to work, and interface seems unchanged.
Haven't had any customer service dealings yet, but so far no problems.  Only complaint is that I can't do an interac money transfer to them, but I understand why not.

@_date: 2015-06-01 12:41:40
This is the sort of event that has brought all the right people together to make real changes happen.  Bitcoin is fantastic, but being so open has also been its downside - we needed some coordinated efforts, especially in the absence of a single leader.  
Those efforts are happening now - slowly - but I think this sort of event may actually bear fruit and really enhance adoption.  Looks like such a positive summit!

Doesn't matter... those in the know realize that Blockchain == Bitcoin, and by the time the rest of the people realize that they have inadvertently accepted Bitcoin then it won't matter because they will already have been converted.

I just used ShapeShift this week for the first time - great experience, smooth and simple.
The main reason I used it without hesitation is that it was simple and didn't require registration, username/password, etc.  My life is busy enough.  I just had some alt coins I wanted to convert to Bitcoin, just once.  I don't want to register with a new exchange, set up an account, remember yet another password, etc. etc. for something that effectively amounts to converting pennies into nickels.
Congrats again to ShapeShift and Erik for keeping it simple.

Yes, that certainly is the definition of a ponzi - it's also exactly why Bitcoin is not.  Payoff and profit come from selling something for more than you paid.  People will pay what they think it's worth.  Most of profits these days are going to the speculators, who buy low and sell high.  That's market investing.
You know, aside from the scams I mentioned in my post, I have not seen people advocating these fabulous profits.  What I HAVE seen is people bragging about money they gave made, and lots of noobies asking when they will be able to retire on their 2 bitcoins.  I have not seen people advocating fabulous profits.  People that do are scammers, and yes there are some.  However, show me someone that truly understood Bitcoin and still thinks its nothing more than a ponzi scheme.

The funniest part are the final comments that there are two issues: 1) that it could be too expensive to implement a global network of nodes, and 2) that it is not known if the blockchain concept work.
The punchline?  Bitcoin is the answer to both problems - it's here already with a massive backbone, doesn't require a big investment to use, and has proven that the concept works.
No matter... the seed has been planted.  Let them come to the conclusion themselves.

They have a number of ways to do deposits (they actually do have interac online, but for some reason it only works for a couple of the major banks).  I usually authorize an ETF debit from a special account I have for them.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:09:25
No, you're right, and that's a good point.  I think the situation you described (which is very real and happens) reinforces the whole concept that "here is something I don't understand, so I don't trust it".  You get people pushing the idea down the throats of others and that makes then recoil even more and trust it less, as you said.
It ties in though, because while there are those who purely want to benefit from the gains, there are many who really understand the benefit and believe what they are saying.  Unfortunately, until someone understands it, that sort of talk will totally cloud the reality.
However, while I do see many people who seem to think that it's purely some sort of get rich quick scheme, there are a huge number of advocates who state over and over that it is NOT about just buying into it for an investment.  
I still hold my view that the stated abilities are incomprehensible to most (I see it over and over people saying that once they took the time to understand it they changed their views and were blown away).  As such, they will latch onto any negativity pointed in its direction (including what you said above) and use it as a means to dismiss it.
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:34:43
Interesting.  I choose to look at the positive that Bitcoin still is.  There is too much focus on the price and not on the value (not the same thing), and that's a shame.  
People run the numbers, and come up with their own results.  I dunno... call that what you will.  There certainly is potential for price to reach very high numbers - the data is out there, draw your own conclusions.  I don't consider that as a ponzi.  (People speculate on the future price of stocks, housing, gold, currencies, you name it.)  It's too bad it's not possible to discuss the future of bitcoin without it degrading into focusing on price and whether that means it is a ponzi.
Just curious though, what you would think if it does reach some astronomical number in the future?  Were these people right all along, or would it then just be the results of the ponzi?  Ultimately in a ponzi the value has to collapse to basically nothing doesn't it?
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:37:28
I think the debate is due to too many people with too many opinions, not realizing the importance of making a decision - any decision. At the end if the day most people, even in the Bitcoin world, will "go with the flow".  It's impossible to know whether a decision will break anything or not, but debating forever won't help (Gavin, I think it was, summed it up with saying "Analysis Paralysis")
At some point, a decision will be made, and my guess is that in the end, most people will just accept it (whatever it is).  Regardless of today's "drama" over block size, it doesn't spell the end of Bitcoin.

I have noticed a marked increase in misinformation and misunderstanding among ordinary people about Bitcoin, especially over the past 6 months or so.  While I think people were starting to get a more positive view of Bitcoin about a year ago, it now seems that the FUD is getting much worse.  All bitcoiners needs to try to do whatever we can to help things.
Now the funny thing is it seems like financial institutions and many businesses are actually much more positive these days, but knowledge among that the average person is lagging behind.  And in order for crypto to succeed, we need more people to at least understand the idea of Bitcoin, and not keep spreading the rumors...

First of all, Mt Gox is not bitcoin. To equate the troubles it has is like saying cellular phones are in trouble because BlackBerry screwed up. That is what everyone in the community needs to do - remind people that this is not bitcoin in trouble, but one privately run exchange. 
As for all the people screwed over by Gox - people have been screaming for months not to trust gox - search the Bitcointalk forum if you don't believe me . The exchange had a long history of troubles and the recent (as in a few months ago) troubles with withdrawals was just the latest until this fiasco. 
I do indeed feel sorry for all those people who lost money on gox. However I feel even worse for everyone else in the community who didn't use gox and still had their coins lose value because of the missteps of one exchange, and really - of one person. 
Even now people are putting money into gox to try to buy cheap coins. I can't understand this, but greed is a strong motivator. However it won't do much good if you can't get money or coins out of there. 
They shouldn't be ignored because there is an important lesson there. However they shouldn't be regarded as being anything more than that (a lesson on what not to do). They have lost all reputation they might have had. Unfortunately they have probably the most recognizable name of anything in bitcoin, and for that we all suffer in the media.

First off, the new system is, as stated in the article, at least 3 years off.  That's an eternity in the tech world.  If it was here today and fully available, it would challenge bitcoin.  But it isn't.
Second, how much are the banks going to charge for this "convenience"?  They are always all about their bottom line.  It won't be cheap.
Don't forget the Canadian government was trying to roll out the MintChip, which was digital cash, which would have had the convenience (supposedly) of bitcoin, but at the cost of trusting a centralized system that could collect even more information on you.  They eventually abandoned the idea, since people didn't want it.  And you know what?  People still wanted bitcoin.
And as someone mentioned below, what about the ~50% of the world that remains unbanked?  They have no existing banking system to "ditch".  So maybe bitcoin gathers traction only with this 3.5 billion people... hardly "killed", is it?

IIRC they are using bitpay, which means they likely receive cash and bitpay looks after the instant conversion from bitcoin. So no dump, as the exchange back to dollars happens near real time. 
The would have the option to keep at least part of the payment as bitcoin, but if they are doing that I doubt they would bother trying to just dump it all at once. Personally I doubt they keep and coins at the end of the day.

Agreed, but at least the VP of global product seems reasonable: "Mr. Gulmann said the company isn’t expecting a groundswell of bitcoin-related business, despite the internal optimism about it. But they do see it as part of their future"

This is where the payment company (bitpay) should be able to help, as it appears they did in this case. I have ordered using the bitpay system before and I do have a  link to the electronic invoice proving payment. 
However, it also winds up being some trust required with the vendor to straighten it out. Sounds like tigerdirect was more of a problem at least at first. 
So basically bitpay replaces the cc company in your example and they should be able to help (and did).

This application demonstrates so much more than just a paywall:
* Demonstrates how fast the Bitcoin payment mechanism is (barely seconds from payment to content delivery)
* Shows how fully autonomous a Bitcoin payment system is (nobody is watching anything, or for that matter running any addition servers for a storefront)
* Illustrates an application put together by one programmer with no third party involved to produce a working payment and delivery system
* Shows a useful practical implementation of the 402 code
* It's a practical application for newbies to see how simple bitcoin payments are (scan and send).  You can spend $0.25 to be convinced how well Bitcoin works!
IMO we should be holding this up as a shining example of just what power the protocol has!

"fake" is a misnomer.  While the transactions may not be used for purchases in the economy or transfers between different wallet owners, they certainly are still real transactions.  
Besides, the actual amount of the so-called "fake" transactions was more like 25% in 2014, and actually has decreased over previous years.  Transactions even excluding that type are still at an all-time high.

Mycelium states "receiving transaction" when it is first detected and the the message goes away after a few confs (6 I presume).  I always liked that, as when I sent coins to that wallet I instantly knew it was received/detected, but was very clear that they were not safe to spend (yet).

So... assuming it was true (not certain of that), wouldn't governments be very happy to have a Bitcoin trail to follow?  We all know how traceable Bitcoin transactions are; if they have isolated a wallet, they should be able to trace a lot of activity from there, and get links to many other players.  Using Bitcoin to "hide" would be the stupidest thing someone could do, but if they did and the wallet address was known, there is tons of information that can be learned starting there.

In order for someone to execute a buy, someone also has to be selling.  So even if money may be waiting to buy, there isn't much in the order book for sellers ATM.  
Also, even if there are "large institutional investors" with money ready to buy, it doesn't mean they want to pay over market price for the coins.  So again, maybe they are waiting for larger amounts listed at reasonable market price.
It's early...let's see how it goes with time.  BTC is still a small market in global terms.

Transaction time =/= confirmation time.  Every time that I have purchased something online it went through almost instantly, as soon as the transaction was broadcast.  While it can't be assumed to be virtually 100% confirmed until at least 6 confirmations, the end user is not usually subject to wait for this period of time, and if they are, they will be expecting to wait (on average) an hour anyway.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:43:39
Basically it's a place where investors can make large trades without swaying the public price; it happens out of the view of the generally-visible trades, and there seems to generally be a minimum amount of BTC required to qualify to be traded.

Not entirely true... it's up to the wallet software as to whether it will block your ability to resend the same coins.  However, there are wallets where you can do it, for example:
Best practice in general is to wait for confirmations of course, so if you start with a zero BTC balance and then want to spend coins that you just got then yes, you probably have to wait for a bit.
Still doesn't change the fact that you know instantly that a transaction took place, even if it was not yet confirmed.  That was my point (and that would be hidden to most users).
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:38:47

Yes, I may have bought the coins back, but there are only so many coins in circulation.  Eventually I will spend all my coins - and then what do I do?  I have to get more.  Why would I wait?  
Sometimes (most times at this point) I could opt to pay with CC or maybe Paypal, but when I buy something with Bitcoin I paid with money I had on hand/in my wallet (not credit).  I didn't have to give my CC number to someone that could steal it (happened to me twice in my life so far).  I  didn't worry about exchange rates for a foreign country, or banking or credit charges.  I didn't have to trust a third party (Paypal has actually locked my account because I used it TOO MUCH; imagine that!).

That's the best summary of events that I have seen in a long time. Thanks for that!

You calculations are off: 315 trillion (3.15e14) divided by 12 million (1.2e7) equals about 26,250,000 (2.625e7).  You are off by a factor of 1000.

What difference does it make if someone rebuys the coins they spent?  I have used it to pay for things that I could not purchase any other way, and decided to rebuy the coins.  How is it different if I spend 2 BTC on something and someone else buys 2 BTC to save?  Total numbers are the same.
I understand where you are going with your point, but I am just saying the argument really doesn't hold water.   If I exchange $500 from CAD to USD for a shopping trip, does this money not count to the US economy if I spend it while in the states?

But if the OP never makes back the BTC he paid in, then it doesn't matter what the value of each BTC is.  He would have been better off holding the original BTC.
Good lesson - I got similarly burned by BFL by preordering last summer.  Fortunately I paid in $$, but had I bought BTC directly with it - well, lesson learned.

If you did buy in back in April, you should also have followed the advice to hold long term.  Possibly soon you'll be back in the black, even if you bought in at the top then.  If you didn't believe long term that bitcoin would gain in value, why would you have invested in the first place?
You only lose money when you sell for lower than you bought.  If you sold at &lt;$100 after buying at $250, perhaps investing is not for you.
Nobody knows where this is going - there are as many people that say it will go to zero as say it will go to the moon.  Don't buy what you can't afford to gamble with; there are no guarantees - except that it is guaranteed to be a bumpy ride!

Remember that if you are sending BTC to a site, YOU ARE SENDING MONEY!  Deal with it the same way you would any site you were considering sending cash to, providing your credit card number, etc. etc.

Well, Bitcoin, while revolutionary, isn't entirely new.  The concept of digital currency has been around since at least 1995 with e-gold (and later Liberty Reserve and others); thus bitcoin IS actually the superior implementation "that overcame the technical and commercial flaws" of its predecessors.

While an entirely BTC-based economy certainly is the end goal, it is not reasonable to expect that at a time while BTC is appreciating so fast in value.  It just doesn't make any sense from any company's point of view.  
Bottom line is bitcoins are becoming more and more valuable, so paying someone a constant amount of bitcoin ATM means that you are paying them more and more all the time. 
This is still a significant development.  First time I am aware of that a government of any sort (municipal in this case) has agreed to pay an employee their take-home pay in bitcoin.

It had value at the time of the trade, and that's all that matters.  The value may fluctuate, but that is exactly the role that companies like Bitpay play.  Exactly zero risk for the seller.   
I suggest you look up what Bitpay actually does.

Litecoin is to Bitcoin as Bing is to Google.  If you're happy with Bitcoin, why use an alt?

So you're talking about double-spending (x10)? Even if you can coax your wallet client to send those coins again, all those transactions are public on the Blockchain. any merchant using decent software should see that and immediately cancel the transaction. Unless you can somehow get your exit within a few seconds of payment. Plus, the liklihood is the first transaction (merchant) will be the one that gets confirmed anyway. What's the point in even trying this? It's stupid...
