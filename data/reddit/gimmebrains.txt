Not sure I'd call a drop of less than 20% a crash.  We MIGHT see a crash, although I doubt it.  This is market fluctuation &amp; reaction to current events.
Time will tell, but I'll continue to hold for now... Once it looks like we've settled on a low, I may pick some more up

I have no doubt it will suddenly swerve at the last moment.

Bitcoin mining will eventually come to an end by design.  This isn't a fiat currency that can be created at will forever, there will eventually be the last Bitcoin ever produced with only a certain number in circulation.  It's effectively a true digital commodity, completely unlike the dollar and pretty much every other modern currency. 
Yes, there is hype and yes, we MAY be in a bubble (with corrections likely coming), but given its built-in finite nature, the long-term trend is UP as demand will readily exceed supply

Just go away.
Well.  I do enjoy seeing him die in films.  I'm torn.

Frog in a pot.  "A lot worse" is coming, depending on how people tolerate this and what traction it gains. 
Civil asset forfeiture is one of the most egregious abuses of authority I've seen in quite some time, and requiring that people declare and document all assets or face it horrifies me since usually those in power want solid awareness of things on the event that they might need to readily locate said things or those who possess them for some reason (anyone remember when public ownership of gold was outlawed, all gold seized by the government and paid out at a pittance, then the gold standard done away with as prices AKA government profit from this abuse skyrocketing in the coming years?). 
Time to reach out to representatives and get them back to, you know, representing their constituents and not their own personal or private-relations interests.
