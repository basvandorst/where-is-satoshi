[Why Crypto Should be Banned](
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:05:19
I actually looked into **taking Cointelegraph to court BUT COULDNT FIND ANY CORPORATE RECORDS**. There is apparently a corporate ID but that's not how CT operates. It is all under the table, it's all cryptocoins. Their basic model is they accept crypto coins, help to pump the price, and then dump the. **Ian DeMartino KNOWINGLY PARTICIPATED IN THIS ACTIVITY.**
AMOF I raised **questions as to the identity of Cointelegraph management to IAN MORE THAN ONE YEAR AGO**. At this point Ian was rolling in money and couldn't care less. Then the money runs out and Ian tries to play this game, it's hilarious.

Ian, once again trying to look like he's some kind of hero.
"Well known troll in Crypto!" "Known Scammer!", etc. 
Just for a quick overview on me, I'm a CS background software developer. I had a brief stint in crypto as I was interested in the field. I unfortunately spent roughly three weeks with NXT as I already mentioned. I'll fill in some details if anyone wants them. I had so many bad experiences running into people like Ian and JL777 I just walked away from the field for good. **Everyone is a crook.**
re. URO, I did attend the conference. I have never promoted this coin nor have I owned this coin. The called me up told me they wanted me to come, sent me a ticket and a hotel room in Hong Kong for a week. After meeting these losers, and dealing with another idiot from Cointelegraph, Diana Ngo, I went cold turkey on crypto and never got involved with another project again.  I never made any money in this field. I thank myself for that decision. I do tweet still about it because I know what's going on inside the field.
**I did suggest reporting URO people to the SEC.**
btw- virtually every one of my claims has turned out true despite virutally non-stop propaganda to the contrary.

**IF ITS PROPERTY ITS TAXABLE.**

btw- **BYTECOIN has no idea who Ian DeMartino even is**.
Ian blames all of Cointelegraph's issues on Bytecoin for some reason.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:52:10
It's not only pervasive, its the underlying thing that constitutes and fuels this entire space. Ian just wants to look like one of the good guys because his crediblity is totally spent, so he starts to lie out the other side of his mouth.
These Cryptocurrency projects are combination of Ponzi Scheme and Social Media Manipulation. Ian himself used to work for a social media magazine before he got into crypto. You'll find that's a very common combination of skills, and having no real credentials or scruples is also common.

hes really frightened and he doesnt know how these laws work.

HERE'S ANOTHER GOOD THREAD
**IAN DOESNT KNOW IF HE WORKS FOR COINTELEGRAPH OR NOT.**
I assume at this point he wasn't sure if he would be appearing in court or not, so claimed he didn't work at Cointelegraph.
This is your 'whistle blower'

"FRICTIONLESS PAYMENTS"?
Butters are so unbelievably annoying.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:46:58
its funny how you reposted this so that **the information I added about Ian Demartino doesn show up**. I'll resummarize.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:57:27
IT WAS NO MYSTERY THAT COINTELEGRAPH WAS CORRUPT AS HELL. We've known for a long time that CT had a crypto-CEO and it's corporate status was unclear.
Ian is now trying to pose as the good guy here? give me a break.
I had this discussion with him on twitter about the ex-writer on CT who was a fugitive child molestor, Ian claims he only knew him from public chat a few private messages(things he cannot wipe from the record)
**When are people going to accept that Crypto is nothing but a tool for criminals?**
How many times have we heard this shit from the same bozos pulling scams and then claiming to 'come clean' and do it again? (Bryce Weiner comes to mind). He wants us to read his new blog now? 
ya, I still have yet to receive any formal accusation. Meanwhile my accusers remain completely anonymous. 'harrassment spree'? sorry but I was the one being targeted- it's only natural to call someone's employer who is posting your families home address to a forum during business hours.
**Ian worked for Cointelegraph for YEARS**. Suddenly he decides he's going to ride in on a white horse and save us from the bad guys?
you people are complete losers. I hope they ban crypto completely.
I have not stolen anything. I have never created an investment product and I have never sold an investment product. I have also never received a single formal accusation. The entire incident amounted to a smear campaign in which Cointelegraph participated in.
Jl777 continues to issue these bogus ponzi schemes though, and I'm the criminal. Gaurantee you he will end up in court in the future.
 can show you many instances where Ian openly allied himself with the NXT community.
this is the "community" aka a bunch of shady anonymous scamsters who Ian worked with for a period, where quite literally close to **1 MILLION DOLLARS US** went missing in 'robbery incidents'. Ian backed up every single one of their bullshit stories including the highly dubious BTER.COM hack.
Ian had nothing to say about all this, or the obvious charlatanism of Jl777- whom Cointelegraph also collaborated with closely(with Ian's help). Nope he just concentrated on Bytecoin- which for whatever reason Ian is enemies with. Did Ian have anything to say about the fugitive CHILD MOLESTOR working for Cointelegraph? no. impartial he is not.
This guy is a loser clown. He wants us to read his new lame Crypto blog? why? there are dozens of other losers writing crap about cryptocurrency.
**GET A REAL JOB.**

**IAN DOESNT KNOW IF HE WORKS FOR COINTELEGRAPH OR NOT.**
I assume at this point he wasn't sure if he would be appearing in court or not, so claimed he didn't work at Cointelegraph.
This is your 'whistle blower'
another fact Ian omitted.
**"CoinTelegraph.com is shutting down, cutting all non-writer salary to zero...."**
so Ian only decided to be a whistle blower, AFTER Cointelegraph started to go under. In other words, he just couldn't make money there any more.
all you have to do is look at the articles Ian wrote for Cointelegraph- then tell me if you think Ian wasn't in on the pump and dumps. What are we saying here, all this immoral stuff was going on while little Ian watched in dismay at the horrible graft and corruption happening before his eyes. And he worked there for years. What a liar.

the fact that Ian doesnt mention NXT, whom he collaborated with on their scam- should speak loud and clear to his impartiality.
He was at Cointelegraph FOR YEARS, and he's innnocent?

This just proves Bitcoin is not a viable techology.
what normal everyday user would tolerate this? Proves there are no normal users.

thanks. Ginger Ale is my fav.
I mostly know about this stuff because I was attacked by these assholes. Ian was involved in an extortion campaign against me that involved death threats to me and my extended family. He is NOT A GOOD GUY. He is a loser. He doesnt strike me as psychopathic as the core NXT people, just a chronic loser who finds opportunity in the wrong places and overlooks the moral implications.
here is Ian's article on the BTER hack: 
in this article he covers for the NXT story, this was some sort of hacking incident(a story NXT used several times to cover up the fact that they were swindling the money- this was at the point in NXT history when it was actually worth something).
His story contradicted other reporting 
He had a solid history of collaborating with NXT. Did Ian even mention this in his poorly written soliloquy? NOPE.

pump and dump maximization!

**highly believable post.**
can the author send me his contact? I'm looking for this sort of content for my new altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:04:03
make sure to read my comments above. 
it's pretty obvious, Ian worked there for years and demostrably participated in the pump and dumps. Now he wants everyone to think he's the good guy.

**They keep the drama levels high so no one ever figures out what is really going on, namely a pump and dump scam.**
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:25:37
right so only criminals and sociopaths would use it, turning into a relatively irrelevant device with a huge stigma. This would reduce the market cap significantly.
