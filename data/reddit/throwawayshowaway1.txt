Oh I do. Believe me.. that's how I **know** that this little fiasco was related to Coinbase. They are the only entity in this entire chain of events that had my home address/information. Lately with these revelations about and his donations.. shit is not surprising at ALL.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:19:24
Right. Agreed. But literally, over an amount under $100?! I mean wtf?

Catch 22. If I give you (or Coinbase) my account details, then that would ultimately be admitting to (My Real Name) having sent bitcoin to a DNM and if that's part of breaking some loony law I'm not aware of (not actually purchasing mind you - but simply sending bitcoin), then I would essentially be incriminating myself.
, you say you take customer privacy seriously. If you believe a customer is engaged in illegal activity, the first thing you would do is close their account. Fair enough again. What's the second thing you would do? Care to share? And more importantly, since your blanket position is that you can not comment on specific cases, can you or any Coinbase representative inform the public on how many subpoenas or how many times Coinbase has cooperated with law enforcement since it's doors opened? Can you give a range? 1-10 instances? 10-50? 50-100? Over 100? Surely you can provide this information?
And I don't doubt you don't know anything about this specific instance, but that is very carefully worded. Perhaps someone else does. I appreciate the carefully crafted response, but I am 99.9% sure this has to do with my Coinbase account. There is simply no other connection.
Please do answer my questions, would be much obliged.

How is it in violation of their rules when no crime was committed? I know - you're insinuating that merely SENDING bitcoin to an address that belongs to a DNM is a crime, but is it? Is it even in violation of their TOS? What if I sent $70 to a DNM controlled address by mistake? What if I sent it there to use as a wallet because I like it's GUI? What if I sent it there with the intention to buy crack, heroin and meth.. but I backed OUT. No crime committed.
And what is this "people like you" bullshit? Come on man, come the fuck on. FWIW, even if I was a "drug buyer", my personal preferences would hypothetically entail only marijuana occasionally (which is now legalized in several jurisdictions anyways). Regardless, you think Coinbase, a company that has been involved in bitcoin since shortly after it's inception, is oblivious to the fact that whether you (or them, or *anyone*) want's to admit it or not, silk road and the other commerce sites were absolutely critical in bootstrapping bitcoin in the early days. Don't be naive. They know very well that probably 80% of their users were most likely doing something that was frowned upon (at least in the beginning). Fuck them.

I would like this information as well. Coinbase has already stated, in response to the recent inquiries regarding that they can't comment on individual cases. 
Coinbase spokesman [spoke on the record] ( that they **do monitor accounts**. Since you can't comment on specifics , and I do not intend to provide my information, can you comment on the process or triggers that fall under your broad and vague definition of "cooperation"? And we are still waiting on the response to how many instances you have actively cooperated with law enforcement. You "take privacy seriously", so surely you could answer this question in a general range, no? Please don't dodge this question.

Thank you. Appreciate the response. Last question: is donating BTC to (a researcher) considered "illegal activity"? Surely you heard of that BS fiasco.
Anyways folks, Coinbase is most universally accepted to be the **least** privacy focused domestic bitcoin exchange. Do not believe these evasive and carefully crafted non-answers.  
Better then them is Circle. If that's not an option, Localbitcoins. And if that's not an option, probably Bitstamp(?). 
I'm sure is just doing his job, and the decision to be the most anti-privacy centric bitcoin exchange in existence is made on an executive level.

That's why I said there is a 99.9% chance it's Coinbase. I will not admit to anything, but I do know that in this scenario.. Coinbase is the only entity that has my address or name. There are details about *me* that I have obscured for my privacy and safety.. but I highly doubt that they have anything to do with this. I am 99.9% certain Coinbase ratted on me, and I hadn't even broken the law yet.

North East USA. County PD. To their credit - nice guys from what my wife described. She said they were polite and one even rolled his eyes a few times as if to say "believe me this is just as lame for us as it is for you". She shouldn't have said anything, and they even advised her she doesn't need to .. but if she felt comfortable then they just wanted to talk to me and/or ask a couple ?s about "something that's probably nothing". I read her the riot act when I got home - never speak to anyone without a lawyer and answer nothing. She answered truthfully, that no, we've never had anything remotely illegal or questionable come to my place of living. 
Whats rather annoying is it seems like they must have timed their little knock&amp;talk, knowing I'd be at work and not home. Why would I be home on a Monday during work hours? Completely annoying.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:48:43
Yeah.. but this is a bit too far IMO. But I guess you're right. They can do what they want. And so can I/we. Which is to cease using them.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:57:18
No idea. More tech savvy minds might know how and why they would do that. Scraping the DNMs? I dont know? I haven't even logged into the account on that site to check what the deposit address was. Maybe they moved it to their hot wallet and that's flagged. Really don't know.

Thanks man. Here we have an all too common situation where an employee of a company is clearly much cooler then his bosses.
We know there's limitations on what you can answer/divulge.
Thanks for addressing this.

Thanks for the spelling correction! And nobody doubts it Brian. Especially with today's latest episode of the *"Coinbase Chronicles"*, we have our [first publicly known prosecution courtesy of Coinbase](
You guys are a bedrock of privacy.

My Coinbase account is fully verified and has all my information. I purchased an amount of bitcoin there and sent it to an address belonging to a DNM. Never ordered from the DNM. That doesn't change the fact Cbase has my info. Got a visit to my place of residence yesterday asking if Ive ever ordered anything illicit to my address. Pretty simple man.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:18:48
Totally agreed, gave her an earful. Regardless, I know nothing will come of it because ironically enough I did nothing wrong. But just the whole 15-20 minute charade was enough to make me disgusted with Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:00:02
No I didn't buy "the dope", moron. I might have had every intention in the PLANET to buy ALL the dope from the DNM in question.. but guess what? I DIDN'T. Hell, I *COULDNT* because the site has become unusable. Regardless, it's none of Coinbase's business what I do with my bitcoin once it leaves their control. None. And honestly.. even if I do want to buy a little pot now and then, is it any different then if I withdraw $50 from my bank's ATM? It's my business what I do with my money, and only mine.

1) VPN &gt; TOR &gt; DNM
2) Nope
