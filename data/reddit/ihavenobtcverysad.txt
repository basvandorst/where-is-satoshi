Wow, it can take "up to 14 days".  And all I needed was some beer money :/
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:31:31
I didn't receive the notice they claim they try to give.
I had no note, no "we need to work on verification first", nothing at all.  Account just frozen and lol-type replies saying we automatically closed this ticket.
There are two points of view here: from me, they control the keys to my Bitcoins and I want them back; it's a heck of an experience to just have an account frozen without any explanation.
And whole time this could have happened was that I was *probably* dodgy, or *could be* scamming others.
So yes, Jesus Christ.

I like the sound of that, but the reality is most people can't get a day in court. It will drain you.  I'm also on the other side of the planet.  Nobody should have to to that though.  Litigation is an option of last resort.  A sensible mediation process would be better.  When the alarm bells are ringing it shouldn't have to be a Google search and contacting support just to find out what the hell happened and why.
I would really like it if they would just give everyone the option to get out on sign up.
They and nobody else either, exchanges and all the rest, should be able to just clamp your funds, but there is a big problem trying to work around this for everyone.

Oh, this is a legitimate thread alright.  I wouldn't dare warn others about what looks like theft of funds to me if I had nothing to go on.
I have also used LBTC for years, on and off, more recently than usual.  Good for you that it works for you.  Glad to hear they haven't frozen your account and just arbitrarily detained your funds, for who knows what reason, like your own good or something.
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:33:27
Resolved. I was trying to get my account's phone number verified after losing access to accounts, not just at LocalBitcoins. I had a ticket for that open when I was unable to verify my number. I told them I am one and the same person at these accounts, and would like to use one of them, but I couldn't verify my number.
So I had two accounts at LocalBitcoins, which is not allowed, and they marked one as my main account now.
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:11:22
They didn't. Here's a quote when I asked for details:
"Your account has been suspended as a precaution.  We will require you to complete some additional ID verification steps."
Still waiting on any real evidence I did something to raise alarm bells.
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:07:26
I was already ID verified.
I should be able to withdraw my own coins and choose to leave LBC and make use of something else.
It is fair they can suspend my trading if they like, I agree.
But keeping my coins?  Seriously, they can just keep them?  Why can't I charge them with theft or fraud?  For all I know they're making up a few specious allegations like I logged in from a different IP address than usual.
I couldn't even protest their freezing of my account by asking them to give me back my Bitcoins, so that I could leave their platform and go somewhere else.  They have taken it upon themselves to just keep my funds, maybe because security says so, because it looks like I am not me?  I still can't believe it.  I want my Bitcoins back.
Then they can bugger off and we can end this dispute on good terms.  They don't have to put up with me making a fuss and likewise, I don't have to put up with their arbitrary freezing of people's money without explanation.
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:27:45
Sue them?  As in all proper with an expensive lawyer in an overseas jurisdiction? Great, access to some justice once again reserved for the privileged few.
I've come here whining because it's a good way to warn others.  Would you whine if a bank just froze your account without an explanation and not a resolution in sight?  What if you needed the money for food and rent?
I love it, *might* have done something wrong. *Probably* done something *dodgy* (a deleted comment).  What was that about might have done something wrong?  Please instruct us.  I'd like to know what I did and why it was wrong.
Bring on the investigations.  Just don't take my fucking money while you take your time to peer through your magnifying glass.

I have had a look at Paxful.  I tried it out and found it to be a good platform.  Thanks for the reminder.  I met up with others I traded with on LocalBitcoins and they're helpful with the new app thing and all that.
I actually found LocalBitcoins to be intuitive enough.  I was never scammed on LBC either.  You have a look at profiles of whoever you want to trade with and whether they are close by or have some number registered in Russia.  Easy enough.  I have a 100% positive and a trust vote, with the only mark against me being "low volume" - true enough.
I actually don't care that much about KYC, I don't mind signing up for it when it seems to be a good platform especially when it's a third party service and no sensitive PII is stored.  I worry a little about privacy whenever I hear of another hack or data dump.  It seems tight enough, security is hard work for the best of them, but being able to go through some other process that works here like Green ID where they can verify without me sending everything to their platform would be nice.
Still don't like the sluggish response when you can't do anything with your account and you have genuine reasons to be concerned about them holding your money, because you're unable to access it.  It's alarming.
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:08:21
Thanks.  It seems to be sorted out now, I can leave and take my Bitcoins.
From my ticket:


   




  




   




I was already trying to resolve my account problems with them for over a month, but okay.  You finally detected what I was trying to tell you for a while.
**But thank you, I actually appreciate a response and some details.**
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:45:07
Could be.  I found Paxful's site better in terms of UI/UX for (for want of a better term) ordinary people.
The only issue I found with Paxful's site was having to install an app on my phone.  The reason I did it was because of a trusted person I have dealt with before.  Maybe not a good reason... 
Nice work getting your friend through there.  I didn't have much success trying to help out my brother-in-law with buying a few.
Paxful was smooth I'll give it that much.  I will have to give out the link to others who want to buy.
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:53:23
Wasn't talking about Paxful.  But yes.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:20:21
How do I know that?
They claim to give notice beforehand, but they didn't give notice. They said nothing.  Account just frozen.
What part about that isn't alarming?
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:59:04
Smear them.  Riiight.  I came here to smear them rather than to warn people about arbitrary seizure of funds and lack of responsiveness.
So again I ask: if the bank you use just closed your account without warning and didn't provide any explanation for it, and you couldn't withdraw or do anything with it, and they decided to just keep the money instead of giving it back so you could go elsewhere, that wouldn't piss you off?
Revenge for a scam being busted.  You can't rule that out.  Well, I can't rule out you're a scared little midget who won't come out and say something is wrong when it is.
Verification, blah blah.  I was already verified.  I accept having to spend five minutes taking pictures and all that and providing my ID again, even though I was already.... verified!  That's fine.  Who ever said I couldn't come to terms with that?  They can halt my trading.  Don't care.
Are you missing the issue that they are just keeping my money until someone (who?!) decides I can have it back, if ever?
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:24:07
What is this guy asking exactly, if anyone knows the jargon?
How can he be sure of a "promise of return"? Unless the enhancement and risk reduction mumbo jumbo adds qualifications to this.
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:40:20
Thank you.  I would like to see the evidence of fraud or violation of TOS.
I don't want my ticket number or much else in Reddit's system, so if I can flick it to an email address that would be nice.
Edit: followed the instructions sent to me as soon as I found it.  Account already verified. Utility bill sent, selfie with ID and username + date, and pic of ID in front of screen with ticket open as instructed.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:37:09
Yes.  Go fuck yourself lol
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:54:56
I found it hilarious at the time, can't you tell?
When LocalBitcoins could have sent you a notice first, but didn't; when they knew it was me the whole time but froze my account anyway. 
This is outstanding and exemplary conduct on the part of LocalBitcoins and I recommend this method to all exchanges and trading platforms to ensure your customers are happy.
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:33:34
I think you're literally begging the question, but it's worth some thought.
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:18:12
I sell now, I used to buy.
There is a simple and unfortunate series of events which might have lead to this, but I still don't have a response on why this would happen.
I wanted to get back into my account and verify my number.  That was the last thing which happened before this.

Big solar facility being set up for that.  Going to be truly awesome.
