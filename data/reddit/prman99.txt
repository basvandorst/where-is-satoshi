At first I thought you told her, "Your yams are scams."
I could just imagine this comeback at Thanksgiving.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:55:14
Because people will buy and sell the real thing in an attempt to control the real market.  
Hopefully there will be more money coming in than anyone can possibly imagine and the price will shoot to the moon.  I mean, I have set sell points, so my coins aren't for sale unless those numbers are reached.  And I buy back if we reach certain plateaus, making me even more money.  I'm in a can't-lose scenario so let them play their little games.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:32:57
Yes.  Lots of people predicted $10,000 by the end of the year in January.
Everyone called them crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:13:40
I think it rises because lots of large investors are planning to do this all at once and they overestimate their ability to buy and sell when they need to.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:19:40
But we can predict the future of bitcoin.  There's a lottery coming up in the next 1-5 years where bitcoin is going to be between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per coin.
The winning numbers are buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:03:42
We can just divide down to 12 decimal places then.

Look at the 2-year graph. That's a technology adoption curve.  That's the reason.  The more people hear about it, the more are adopting.
The more that adopt, the more demand there is for a limited number of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:10
Sure we do.  Because we understand what is happening here.
I bought and held a while ago, because I understand why bitcoin will someday be 6 or 7 figures per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:17




When it's fully adopted.

100% naked shorts are super dangerous, however.  Especially in something as volatile as bitcoin.
Few people are that foolish.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:52:45
Or go bankrupt trying...
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:08:14
This is true.  I had people tell me to invest in Microsoft, Apple, Google, Apple again when Steve Jobs came back and I didn't listen to them.
But bitcoin gave me another opportunity.

This is the best 2-sentence description I have read.

If somebody set a computer trying billions of addresses a second for the rest of their life, their likelihood of hitting an existing address is 1 in 1x10^26 or something.
It's not going to happen.  You have a better chance of hitting the lottery every week for the rest of your life.

My friend has been dealing in rental properties their whole married life.  Tons of work and modest earnings.
They separated for a while so the wife invested in bitcoins.  In 3 years she now has over 10× what he spent his whole life making.

And he probably wonders why he is losing.

I just got some stolen with a sophisticated address swapper that wasn't visible in any way.  So holding them yourself is risky too.

People hedge.  Up to 40% usually.  40% of $16 billion (estimate futures money) is $4 billion fighting over 2 million coins worldwide.
I'm guessing the price goes way up and they all wonder how it happened because they assumed there would be enough supply.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:38:30
Yes.  Trace Mayer laid out a well-researched post giving reasons why he thought bitcoin would be $150,000 by the end of next year.
I believe this to be roughly the case and I certainly think we will see it before the end of 2018 because of incredible demand.
Think about this.  There are now more accounts on Coinbase alone than there are existing saleable bitcoins.  (13.3 million vs. 13 million).  For the first time, there are not enough bitcoins for every Coinbase user to have one.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:53:20
That's because the KKK sued them successfully in the past and they know that Wikileaks cannot.

I'll take bitcoin.  WAY less risky.

Adoption is an S curve.  We are currently in the vertical for it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:00:27
People could get coins but not money out of Mt. Gox.  I told a friend to open a Coinbase account and move everything, but he said, "he trusted Mt. Gox more".
He had invested $7000 back then (around $100 per coin) and it was up to around $70,000 ($1000 per coin).  Lost it all.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:21:37
Somebody posted a link to retrieve them the other day.  I don't remember what it was, though.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:26:37
This was confirmed true at some point in the past for Coinbase.  But at this point they probably do have more transactions than possible bitcoin transactions per day.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:14
It's the opposite, though.  They have far more money to throw around, so there is more money going after a limited supply, meaning the price is going up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:10:58
Yep. It's easy to regret selling in bitcoin. 
I've never regretted HODLing.
That said, I'm taking some profits at regular intervals just to avoid being all in coin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:19:10
Well, I read bitcoin stuff as regularly as I can with a full-time job.
So, what you are saying is that bitcoin is completely unusable by anyone without a PhD in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:30:14
I'm just looking at that weird straight diagonal line going NE on the GDAX chart.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:40:48
Nah.  Take the long-term view and HODL.  Bitcoin will be in 6-figures by the end of next year.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:10:57
There are only about 12.4 million in circulation.  Conservative estimates have 4 million as permanently lost.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:54:11
Well, they do to try and control the price.
Only idiots naked short.  It's as high-risk as it gets.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:50:07
Oh, I know they've been buying.  I just know that they don't understand the fundamentals of crypto and think that it's like everything else.
For one, I think that they think they are the only ones that will be on the market.  They don't realize that there are other companies ready to buy cheap coins.  And there are Japanese and Korean buyers ready to buy cheap coins.  All day and all night, 24/7/365.
The bitcoin price will be much harder to control than people think.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:59
In bitcoin, there is no too late.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:54
Still HODLing and I only regret the coins I sold.
But still, I can't lose now.  So who cares, really?

Reference Bitcoin-QT client version 13.xx (not rebooting that machine anytime soon so I can't tell you exactly).
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:14
Yep and then bitcoin runs away and you are out of it and miss out on the big gains.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:28:02
Coinbase still owes me $6000 and won't respond to my tickets.  This is over 3 months already.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:56:02
But then how would they (attempt to) control the price so easily?  Duh.
But I think all the long-time bitcoin users are going to arbitrage this to death and make a killing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:54:14
It doesn't matter, does  it?  I mean, if you buy things with bitcoin, you still technically owe taxes for cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:34:11
Smart.  He did the research.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:50:29
It's automatic.  You login to GDAX with your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:53
It's tracking very closely so far.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:49:32
That's what they just tried to do.  And the answer was, mostly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:03:14
Is bitcoincharts.com still up to date?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:24:39
But wouldn't this be a good time to sell BCH and buy bitcoin with it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:35:58
Actually, exponential rise is absolutely sustainable and expected in a technology adoption S-curve.  It only ends when almost everyone on earth has bitcoin.
In my opinion, we are already in the vertical, so it really doesn't matter what the bankers do because we are still going to the moon now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:48:41
We're not.  If you don't understand bitcoin fundamentals, maybe you shouldn't invest in it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:44:29
Look at a 2-year graph.  Does that look like a bubble to you?
Or does it look like a technology adoption S-curve?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:16:30
So on 6 and 7, Circuit breakers and hours of service will exist on CME, but not on GDAX or Bitfinex.  That presents problems for investors and pressure to time-limit bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:09:28
Somebody moved it into an address Mark Karpeles previously proved he controlled.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:16:53

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:52:37
Yep.  Mark Karpeles is confirmed to have done it when Mt. Gox closed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:33:40

Coinbase has over 14 million users now.

@_date: 2017-12-04 21:48:56

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:15
Actually, end of 2017. More like 12%.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:34:50
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:20:48
This.  I think all these bankers are used to dealing with fractional reserves and funny money.  They are going to be sorely disappointed when they can't get their hands on the 2 million available bitcoins on the market because everyone else is trying to buy too and none of the HODLers are selling.
"But I thought there were 16 million bitcoins available?!?"
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:58:58
But do you do taxes for people with crypto?
That would help immensely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:20:01
Yeah.  Why would anyone think they could trust the official bitcoin reference client?  
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:32
It's like having stores with photocopies of Reeboks.  Sure, they look like the real thing, but they're not and they are easily increased on paper.

If even he can't use bitcoin, then bitcoin is a failure.
We need to make it safe for the average user, not blame software developers when their coins are stolen by sophisticated hacks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:01:42
Bubbles feel different.  This doesn't feel like a bubble.  It just keeps going up every day.
And that's because we are in the vertical of the adoption S-curve and not in an overpriced bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:41
But people can turn around and try to corner the ACTUAL bitcoin market to control the price.  But that's only if they want it to go way, way, up.  Because supply is short on bitcoin no matter what.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:46:28
And we easily could...
That's the amazing part.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:09:50
Exactly the same for me. I finally just bought bitcoin with the BCH and held it, which is what I probably should have done to begin with anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:21:14
That transaction was a payment from Coinbase on my laptop, which was visible on the screen as being different immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:02:10
If that happens, I'll start programming with the API.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:42:58
I have sold a small amount and recouped my investment.  Now it's all free money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:11:34
But if they need to buy coins to hedge, they are all competing for a small number of coins that is much smaller than any of them are used to in other markets.

I had a SEPA from Kraken cancelled.  It took about a month.  It was just for some bitcoin cash to USD, so it was a pretty small amount.
Fortunately, that's when BCash went up and Bitcoin went down, so I just changed it for bitcoin and downloaded it instead.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:41:57
As a bitcoin HODLer, here's what I hear:
Cheap coins coming up real soon.  Time to rebuy because this idiot has no idea he's buying into a technology adoption and not orange juice futures.

Amen.  This is 100% right.
My wife and I told at least 200 people about bitcoin.  Only 2 bought and they have held most or all until today.
The two that listened to us and thought critically about it are the ones that are being rewarded.

It's bitcoin.  There are no circuit breakers.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:33:44
They lost my wire transfer too.  It took a while, but eventually they took care of it.

Well, if you are a loud-mouthed creationist, it doesn't work out very well for you:
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:31:05
You know, they need some kind of worldwide network where anyone can send money to anyone else instantly.  I wonder how they could do that...
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:36:11
These are existing esCHEATment laws.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:58:40
It's the lack of communication and the obvious deception that make people think they are operating as a very large fractional reserve bank.  And there's a bank run and they can't do anything about it.
Granted, having the US seize over $5 million didn't help.  But they did give them over 6 months to begin complying with FinCen and they didn't even start as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:03:09
Nobody has attempted to spend the "stolen" bitcoins at any known sites yet.  Once they do, it may be possible to trace their identity backward.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:12:22
They're using Coinbase, apparently.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:44:48
Satoshi is buying or selling bitcoins in New York?  Since when?
Nevermind, didn't read the below.
OK, so a person making an altcoin now needs KYC/AML on every user of that ALTCOIN?  Because that's what these laws say.  That's absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:41:44
Coinbase has very low daily limits ($1000, I think) until you perform their (reasonably easy) KYC procedures.  And on Coinbase, you cannot sell more than $1000 per day, so that would put a real wrench into the OP trying to sell nearly 500 coins at a certain price.
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:38:03
I disagree with the Frognosticator.  I think that it brings national attention to brands that are otherwise unknown.  Sure most people in the USA STILL don't know what a Beef O'Brady (the previous sponsor) is.  But that's because they're only in Florida and most of us don't live there.
If done right, companies have grown massively thanks to their bowl sponsorship.  Chik-Fil-A (a chicken sandwich fast food chain in the US) went from only being in the southeast to being a nationwide chain on the strength of their sponsorship of the Peach Bowl, which has gone from a minor bowl game to part of the playoffs this season.
MagicJack also took off after sponsoring the bowl game.  They failed because of atrocious customer service.
This sponsorship sends a message loud and clear: The bitcoin that you thought died with Mt. Gox is alive and thriving!  Since it IS a national brand (international) I predict that it will do very well.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:02:14
There is a very strong suspicion that Mt. Gox has always been on Fractional Reserve.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:42:11
I believe this to be the reason they only ask when you withdraw.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:02:08
Actually, Mark Karpeles was forced to admit he had 200,000 bitcoins because people on the blockchain could see that he had access to them in the past.
All of a sudden, he was able to find them!
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:56:47
Bitstamp did say they forward the bank's requirements, so they vary all over the world.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:38:22
Me too.  But I printed off receipts from my e-mail for all the coins just in case.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:01:48
I hope Satoshi has KYC/AML on everyone and that he registers within the 45 day period.
Actually, it would be hilarious if Satoshi showed up within the 45 days and said that all New Yorkers have to be out of the bitcoin network within 45 days.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:40:09
Almost all businesses put 2 hands way up.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:50:44


I think we have the answer.  Who is OP's bank?
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:50:41
Then just ask and disallow New York residents.  Problem solved.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:44:00
If you have an account on a service like Coinbase and you leave your bitcoins on there, after 5 years of no activity the government of NY now owns your bitcoins.  
This is why you buy or sell them on a service and then put them in your own local wallet where you control the keys and they CAN'T take them from you.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:18:47

@_date: 2019-11-13 22:51:13
In theory, difficulty drops when there is less hashpower mining.  This would say that lots of miners went offline/switched to alt-coins/whatever.
In practice, difficulty is estimated by how long it took someone to guess.  A random short guess (say 2 minutes instead of 10) makes it look like hashpower went way up.  A random long guess (say 18 minutes instead of 10) makes it look like hashpower went way down.
Since everyone is sort of guessing offline, there's really no way to tell which scenario happened for a single drop, only for an extended one (which then increasingly has to be hashpower related the longer it goes).
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:21:11

But their continued ignoring of the needs of the businesses that are investing and growing bitcoin should give you plenty of reason to assume someone else can do a better job.
See, the difference is what do you mean by "better job"?  Better job coding?  Better job meeting your needs?  Better job meeting miners' needs?  Better job meeting exchanges' needs? Better job meeting investors' needs?  Better job meeting everyone's needs?
Those are all different things.  Core seems to be good at doing the first 2.  But 2x is good at doing the rest.
And another hard fork with Core surviving as another Bitcoin Cash (Bitcoin Core?) doesn't meet anyone's needs, IMO.

Yes.  Visa charges merchants 2.5% - 3% per transaction.  Your card company often gives you back 1% - 1.5% in rewards.
The credit card companies lost a case saying that they can't stop merchants from telling the public about this fee.  So now some do, including this DMV.

Forget password for encrypted seed or wallet file
Cash/gold: Forget password of safe.  Now locksmith knows you have a large amount of cash/gold in your safe.  Storage locker gets auctioned off (my wife found a large amount of cash, about $800 in one once).
Forget location of seed on paper, usb with seed. Part of multi sig. Misplaced, thrown by family, help
Forget websites where you have 401(k)s (especially wife about husband's from work).  Forget where you hid your gold/cash.  Gold/cash found and stolen by help.
Seed incorrectly written.
Swiss bank number incorrectly written.
Wrong seed written, when multiple wallets. People have lost BTC this way.
Listing same problem twice.
Only private key written. Not realised it changes after a transaction.
I actually didn't think about this one since I've always used a wallet, but it makes sense.  
Fire, water damage. Same issue with cash.
Since gold has a higher value with certain stamps, the stamps would be ruined in a fire and it would be worth less.  Also, if it melts into your floor/foundation of your house, it could cost more to retrieve than it's worth.
Bad ink fades away.
Many, many people have lost cash/gold when they have died.
You are also forgetting some things that are unique to cash/gold:
Counterfeiting.  I can't get counterfeit bitcoin.  I know it's real, because I can see it on the blockchain.  (OK, maybe Mt.Gox and others have fake bitcoin in their "accounts".)  With gold/cash, you had better be really good at spotting counterfeits, or you may end up with gold-plated tungsten, which is very difficult to spot.

The most important advice.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:25


Because they believe they can "follow the money" and catch the bad guys.
They weren't talking about standard investors (so far).
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:25
Because they bought at $11480 and then sold at $8500.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:47:26

Better to buy all $1800 now.

My primary investments are in BTC.  Don't feel sorry for me.  I'm doing fine.
I understand the risk, but I didn't put enough away earlier in life and I needed to catch up somehow.
If Bitcoin really goes to $150,000 by the end of next year like Trace Mayer is saying, then I could retire way early.

Find a miner that lets you mine lots of different altcoins.

How did you buy bitcoin if you are under 18?

Yep.  Even then, I just bought more cheap coins at $200, $300, $400, $500.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:53:03
This comment needs to be higher.  If you look at it as a 5-year investment, the chances of losing are very small and the chances of getting mega-rich are very large.

The US doesn't NEED to legalize it, because it's already legal (never been illegal) and some people have already been paid this way for quite a while.

Well said.  This is how I have always looked at it.  Over any 2-year period, Bitcoin is a phenomenal investment.  If you need something shorter than 2 years, then maybe it isn't for you.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:15:10
A very reliable predictor thinks it will be $38,000 by the end of February and $150,000 by the end of next year.

A lot of smart people have been predicting it will end up at $100,000-$500,000 by 2020 for quite a while (since 2013).  It's looking like they might be right.

BofA/Merrill Lynch said it would NEVER go above $1200 (it was $1150 at the time and did crash immediately afterward).
Oh well.

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:41:52


Absolutely.  I only put 6% of my check into 401k because that's what my company matches.  I invested all my extra money in bitcoin for years.


Very long term.


I am selling 10% every time it doubles.  And I set up buybacks on GDAX in case it drops.  That way, I can have money now (already made back all my investment and currently paying for my daughter to go to college) and still make money too.  All the way to the top.  And if it drops, I buy back more coins than I had.


Nope.  They never do.  That's why I just get the minimum for company match.  It's OK to diversify some ;).  (14% is nice, BTW, mine is only 11.5% this year.)
What's bad about 401k also is that I can't spend this money and it's limited in what I can invest in.  I can do whatever I want with bitcoin.  It's literally like having a very high yield money-market account.


I'm thinking of retiring about 15 years early...  ;)

I worked with an employee at an Auto Parts store that turned out to be a thief.
Another college guy and I did some detective work and figured out that he was the only one who was on shift prior to the money coming up short (he was fudging his own paperwork so the next shift would find the error).
When I told my boss about it, he made a phone call and told me that the next part is not going to make sense, but he'll tell me later.
They promoted him to Assistant Manager!
I was like, "What now?"
As part of this, he was to be transferred to another store to receive his training.  Turns out the other store has hundreds of hidden cameras everywhere.
They waited until the guy stole more than $5000 total and then put him away for 3 years for Grand Theft.
So yeah, it doesn't work that way.

@_date: 2019-09-16 20:57:54
OK, you know what a hash function is?
You take a computer file and use an encryption algorithm to reduce it down.  PKZip uses CRC32, which gives an 8-digit hash for each file such as 34DF34CC.  It's stored in the .zip file to quickly see if the file needs to be re-compressed or not.
Now, when you create a hash, you have no idea what the outcome is going to be.  If I add a single character to the 34DF34CC file, it's now 012935DE.  There's no simple way that I could predict that until I try.
So Bitcoin uses much longer hashes and everyone is trying to find a hash that starts with a certain number of zeroes.  Such as 000000000000000AD4345323424.  Since there is no way to predict what a hash will be, they just try as many as possible as fast as possible until they find one.  If they find one, they get the 12.5 BTC reward and all the mining fees.  The rest of the network verifies that they "won" and tries to find the next one.  When everyone starts finding them too easily (the Bitcoin algorithm tries to keep the average at 10 minutes), the number of zeroes needed at the beginning goes up.  If nobody is finding one, the number of zeroes goes down to make it easier.
Currently, all the Bitcoin mining computers in the world are trying at a rate of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 times per second.

So, 0.5% of the world is "everyone"?  And the fact that I, myself, could not now get the number of bitcoins that I have because they are too expensive because I bought them when only 0.05% of the world was in?  What does that make me?
Now, when 50% of the world starts getting in at $10,000 then, you're right, it will probably only go to $20,000 or $30,000 and nobody will get ridiculously rich because "everyone" is in then.

He also said about diversification, "Put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket like a hawk."  Diversification is for when you already have millions or billions.

About 3% are confirmed lost and most people believe the real number is 6% to 10%.

Yes.  Dump all your existing BTC on it ASAP.

Bitcoin has gone up 10x every year consistently and if you understood Sigmoid curves as they relate to technology adoption, you would realize that is probably has 2-3 more years to go at that rate before leveling off.
Is the top $10,000?  $50,000?  $100,000?  More?  Hard to say.  But the logarithmic increase isn't the part you should be questioning.

I would think that most people thinking this must have more than 100. That would be $10,000 per bitcoin, which is somewhat reasonable.  If you only have 10 then I just don't really see it.  $100,000 is pretty unlikely in my book, but anything in the range of $30,000 is somewhat possible.

I'm planning my retirement within 24 months (and I'm in my forties).  Does that count?

Actually, 0.5% of the world owns a bitcoin, but your point stands.  Right now, all the financial press is afraid of bitcoin.  They make mocking articles, call bitcoin investors idiots and all manner of abuse.
When they all start telling everyone to buy bitcoins (after it's already too late to make any kind of logarithmic money on it), it will be time to diversify a little.
