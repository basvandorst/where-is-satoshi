I know exactly where my crypto is.

The QR code contained several hundred dollars.

He was given money.

I like samourai wallet. Tons of features and privacy. Copay is also good. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:41:21
This made me legitimately feel good for the first time since yesterday.

Hitchhiking.

I hope one day someone will cast the magic on me humble old self... To see such a thing with me own eyes....
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:16:06
You're so cool. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:47:15
How does changetip work anyway? Does it hold the coins or is it magic or? 
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:00:19
I feel like you're conflating exchanges with digital currencies. You can buy bitcoin without touching an exchange - it's just not as simple.
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:38:23
Have you tried bitcoin ATMs or localbitcoins? Your bank or credit union seems bitcoin-hostile.

I think it's one thing to not trust the dude anymore and another to personally attack him. I personally don't trust him. Seen too much questionable stuff related to him lately. I don't doubt his sincerity to bitcoin but I do not trust his  (and some of those he has associated with) methodology or practices. He should not be attacked. It's up to each of us to trust him or not.

People feel strongly about bitcoin. We fiercely defend what we think is best for it. The intent is there, we just need to all realize that what's truly best for our community is unity, working together.

If they add ledger nano s support, I'll donate. Money is tight right now but that feature would legit make it worth a donation. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:01:45
But you trust paypal? 
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:39:48
We have this. It's called a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:49:29
As a buyer/seller on purse.io, I can say with full bias that I am not sketchy. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:36:02
Fair enough.

Sorry if off topic, but how do I reset the default transaction fees in samourai wallet? Ever since using a custom fee, it's replaced all the preset fees and it'd be nice to have the calculated fees remain optional while also having custom as an option I can switch to and from at will. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:25:29
Well, can't say I'm a fan of this news. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:16:42
[My custom fee has replaced all my other fees.](
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:26:55
Custom fees seems to be. I had to do the recovery thing because of pin issues last week too. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:05:57
Hmmm... What if you made a duplicate of it, renamed the duplicate wallet.dat and tried importing it into the wallet app from above? If that doesn't work, unfortunately I'm not sure what else to do. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:21:40
Source? This is troubling if true. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:55:03
Wallet.dat? It should let you restore it using Bitcoin Wallet [Google Play ](
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:40:39
[My fees are stuck like this. I can't even change them because anything I try to change it to says it's too low.](
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:00:40
What's the file's name? Like is it a .txt or a .dat etc etc

Life always finds a way. In the early 90's, if you wanted to watch Jaws 4: The Revenge, you'd have to pay for it or break into blockbuster and steal it. Nowadays you can still pay for it...or you could torrent it. Life found a way to make watching Jaws 4: The Revenge much simpler. Torrenting most films is illegal but it can't be shut down because it is decentralized, like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:50:55
BitSquare lets you hold your funds locally. I'm sure there are several others. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:52:22
You don't understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:31:00
It isn't. It works. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:58:16
Not the protocol, but the concept. It is designed to be resistant from censorship. Have you read the whitepaper? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:29:26
Someone show this to the guy who was at the top of this sub the other week talking about how his bank &amp; power company in Australia blacklisted him from their services because he traded in bitcoin.

Childish and mean.

Couldn't this argument be made for gold too? Value is subjective. If everyone agrees that bitcoin should be used as money, why not? It has trustless transparent design, which is something even gold lacks. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:53:49
I highly doubt a government would do that, but history has shown that sometimes governments do things like that. So let's say they did do that. There are services that allow you to instantly convert cryptocurrency to fiat and spend it through a debit card. Let's say that gets shut down too, though. Gift cards. Wal-Mart gift cards, BP gas gift cards, etc. There's already a huge market for those with bitcoin, both on a peer to peer sales basis and by established gift card selling sites.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:03:40
Awesome! Congratulations! 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:30:13
I'll try. Pm? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:53:11
We've made it, y'all. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:09:41
Decentralized exchanges exist. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:43:09
The lack of that "support" is bitcoin's strength, not weakness. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:36:47
Definitely. Thanks for the discussion. Have a good night. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:23:44
This used to be the case, perhaps, but in most countries is no longer the case. Paper currencies are often created by private companies in private without input from the public or sometimes even the government. Most people don't know how any of this works and this works to the advantage of these organizations. When you give a government or corporation the onus of backing a currency, bad things happen. Look up Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus, etc
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:49:46
Because prohibition has a long history of working perfectly....
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:20:01
Yes, that's why I said I doubt they would do that, 'that' being a criminalization of stores accepting bitcoin as payment. It doesn't mean they won't do it. I was just expressing my own personal doubt of the lengths my government would go. But let's say they would. There would be a war and it would be full of conflict, propaganda, economic instability, and massive change. Try as they might, bitcoin can not be eradicated. Bitcoin also has no intention of fully replacing all currencies. It is an opt-in currency that can and does coexist with traditional currencies. What they would likely do is make their own world currency and make it seem better than bitcoin. That won't stop bitcoin though

If it is decentralized, who exactly would be making the exit? If nobody holds the funds but the traders themselves, nobody can run away with all the money.
