I honestly can't tell if you're trolling me or actually serious.
First of all, in order to get Ethereum, I'm going to have to send the BTC over, so what exactly do I solve here? Secondly, why the fuck would I risk switching to Ethereum, when no one knows what will be the price of BTC "in a few months?" Who the hell guarantees me I'm going to be able to get the same amount?
I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful but this comment is so ridiculous... You make absolutely no sense, even though I know you're just trying to help (or at least hope so).

How could it be on an exchange if I mentioned specific fees to you guys? Maybe I don't exactly know the options given to customers on exchanges, but I thought that it was clear enough from my post that my BTC is in a wallet (Electrum).
Like I said below, I know what he suggested would make sense if my BTC were on an exchange, but it's clear enough (or at least I thought so) that it wasn't the case.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:13:57
I know what he said is possible if my funds were on an exchange, but I specified fees ("even if I settle for 'just' 150 sat/B"), so obviously it couldn't have been on an exchange, so I was actually giving him the credit of realizing that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:44:37
Okay, so I got it right. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:22:25
No, it's actually not like asking if I should buy BTC now or wait until it drops a little.
The price doesn't have a direct correlation with the price. if 150 sat/B would equal X, which equals $180 now, I wasn't asking if I should wait until 150 sat/B (X amount of BTC) would be worth much less. I was hoping that the mempool would clear, and then I wouldn't have to send 150 sat/B to begin with.

Appreciate it \^_^

Haha TIL, interesting!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:43:19
I already have, and tried a couple more now, just to make sure.
The original cable does work with the ports that the Magnetic one doesn't. I have 4 ports on the front of my case and a few more behind. Tried a total of about 3 or 4 but yeah...
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:34:12
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS DIRECTED BY MARTIN SCORSESE! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:47:53
Thanks! Are you sure your issue is related to mine, though? You didn't elaborate, but I'm not sure.
Either way, I downloaded the tool you linked to, but it's [not responding]( (I downloaded the x64 version).
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:26:38
Damn D:
What about the authenticity? The video I linked to is from 2015. Is it not supposed to show anymore? How otherwise do I verify the authenticity of the device?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:03:24
I also tried the 32 though, and it also isn't responding... :(
Thing is, that it sounds like you were having issues to get any of them to work. Mine does seem to connect fine with the original cable (though again, I don't see the "Verifying" screen thing... but I can connect to a wallet and stuff... not sure what's going on, as I asked), so doesn't it suggest that the magnetic cable is to be blamed?
If you still think it might help get the magnetic cable to work and it's worth a shot... any efficient way to completely unistall all USB drivers?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:10:06
Does it make sense that I can't access my wallet from the Manager and only from the Bitcoin app?
I reset my Ledger (after sending $1 to it, just to make sure everything's fine), and after restoring the wallet I could only see "Settings" on the Ledger screen. I Googled it and [this guy had the exact same issue]( The issue was solved once you let it rest unplugged from a USB for a while. It was in my case, as well. 
I then saw what you told me and when when I plugged it and made sure it works, but I could only load the wallet from the app and not the Ledger Manager. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:44:25
Oops. I accidentally calculated it as 25k per block instead of 2.5k. but I did exactly as you did (added from top to bottom, obviously).
Not surw how reached [that conclusion]( though.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:47:42
How come the minimum to be included int he next block would be 10 sat/B if there were ~28K pending transactions at the time of your post, and 12.xK+ of them were 10 sat/B upwards?
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:25:24
You're saying that it is hindsight because of the fact that I wasn't ready to purchase, meaning that I was hesitant, but as I said – I wasn't. 
I used to have the help of a Singaporean guy (and a couple more Asian guys) who could instantly buy on his local exchange site upon request. He would then send me the money and I would then send him the money through PayPal (I would also cover transaction fees, withdrawal fees &amp; add a tip).
when dealing with PayPal, naturally, I can't really "plan ahead" (like an exchange site deposit), so there's nothing much I can do in advance. 
Yes – if a dip were to happen again, I could find myself in the same boat, but it'd still not be hindsight, because as explained – there's nothing much I can do about it right now, as far as PayPal goes. 
I've spent many days trying to Google for alternative options (PayPal to Perfect Money or anything else), but nothing accepts PayPal. There's this "Virwox" site which is legit, but the fees are absolutely insane. 
In order to go to an exchange site I'd have to withdraw my PayPal money to a bank account, and it's not going to be an option for a while. :(

Hey dude, read the new comments above! The mempool size in MB is much more efficient, accurate and convenient, so I'm just making sure you get notified and read it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:37:25
Thank you and - the mempool size in MB really is better, after all, the fact I'll soon make a transaction with shitload of inputs is one of the reasons I'm looking into this, so obviously 1 transaction doesn't mean much and the bottom graph is much better.
HOWEVER! I'm not sure I understand what's going on. It's been less than 0.9MB for 10+ sat/B transactions for the past few blocks now, and yet I just entered the site you referred to and it still suggests 189 sat/B. What gives? Is it simply not accurate? Because again, according to the graph, any 10 sat/B transaction would make it to their following block...
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:46:32
Thank you!
The latest update (last min) is [this]( so according to the guy from your thread, the lowest fee I could add and know for a fact it'll be added to the next block would be 10 sat/B, since the total is a lil over 28k, and so I can't tell what is the lowest ~3k?
Or did I misunderstand everything completely?
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:56:58
Sorry guys. I wasn't clear enough – I know I don't *have* to buy a whole coin. This isn't my first coin. I simply wanted to get another one, and now it'd cost me more.
Sorry for the confusion, I edited my post.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:39:00
Ummm I'm not really sure how to check and/or what to do about what you're saying, but the whole reason  I loaded my wallet with Electrum is so that when my Ledger arrives and I'll set up a wallet, I'll be able to send my funds with custom fees (and not the outrageous fees Copay would like to charge me, due to the many inputs).
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:13:13
Yes, from the comments here (and my own Google search), I figured out pretty much everything you just said. Question is - am I able to set up custom fees using Copay?!
Thanks for your reply!
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:11:08
How do I set up my own fee? And thanks for the replies, guys!
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:14:22
Yup! I just tried it (chose BIP39), and it worked!
Awesome! 
Now I'll just wait for my hardware wallet and then send it there with custom fees.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:12:33
Thank you!
I actually had mobile on mind while picking my first wallet a little over a year ago, and heard good things about Copay, which is why I went with it (nevermind the fact they suck now), but I don't really use BTC on my wallet. At least not yet.
Do you think it's possible to set up custom fees on iOS? I don't really want to download and set it up for no reason (plus, I'll only do it close to the time I go ahead and set up the hardware wallet, which won't be for another 1.5 weeks or so, so I do need to make sure I have everything covered and ready to go)
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:44:45
First of all thanks for the explanation!
Reading your intro, I was under the impression I'm gonna read something completely different than what I had originally though, but until you last response, I was under the impression that what you just described is what happened (with very very insignificant and minor tweaks, so now I understand it even better) - I realize that one of the output was sent as planned and that the other output is the change, but what I don't understand is if I'm supposed to see a completely new line in Electrum showing the change I've received. 
All I see in Electrum is the minus .00576 (for the GPU, if we stick to your example), but cannot see the remainder. I went to the Addresses tab, went through the addresses one by one, and I cannot find the 1P1d[...] address with the change.
Does it mean that Electrum did not factor it in? Am I supposed to manually do something about it?
Thanks a lot again.
**EDIT:** As you can see, [Electrum doesn't acknowledge the 1P1 address at all]( and as I mentioned in the beginning – it's just one example among many others. 
**EDIT  Yup. A friend just asked me to lend him some BTC. I sent him from Copay, and while everything shows up perfectly fine there – Electrum shows the whole input gone (whereas it wasn't as much – pretty much exactly like the case we've been discussing here).
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to fix this.
**EDIT  FIXED! I had to spam `wallet.create_new_address(True)` in console.
I tried it before my 2nd edit (of this comment), but apparently once wasn't enough, as I had to generate plenty other addresses for the previous change addresses. Electrum now reflects the accurate balance.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:04:44
"Alternate version of Electrum"? Not really sure what you mean by that seeing how I'm not entirely sure how to collect my BCH just yet.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:04:02
It really is a repost. I tried to shorten it because people don't seem to wanna read all of it. 
Thanks for the reply!
Can you please link me to the page of said file and the instructions? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:43:37
true, I forgot about that part
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:18:45
Are you suggesting I do so to figure out where the issue lies, or in order to fix the issue?
Either way, I went to the "Addresses" tab on Electrum but not quite sure how to proceed. D:
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:57:47
I think I didn't explain myself properly (or perhaps I just misunderstood you, but I should have said that it shows as if I paid both outputs and not inputs), but pretty much, let me show you an example.
[this]( is a transaction I made about 22 days ago. [This]( on the other hand, is how it shows up on Electrum.
As you can see [here]( it's as if I paid both outputs (.00564796+.00576=.01140796, the amount Electrum claims I've spent).
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:13:03
0.001368 BTC/kiB for Priority and Normal
0.001237 BTC/kiB for Economy
"/kiB" (that is what's shown) for Super economy
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:13:49
Okay, I'm sure that in a while I'll be reading your comments and it will all make sense, but at the moment I don't know way too much about all of this. While I've been using BTC on and off for about a year, I haven't read all too much about it, until just recently.
From my understanding, you're saying that Electrum is correct because my transaction only shows half of it, because there are 2 inputs. Does that mean that when I sent out this 0.00576, it actually "took" a bigger chunk (of 0.00114) and then yielded back the change(?), and so Electrum didn't account for that for some reason?


If not, this would explain why Electrum does not display the correct balance
I didn't! As I explained, all I did was use my 12-word phrase (that originated from a Copay wallet) when I made this Electrum wallet. I haven't done anything beyond that, and I have no clue how I'm supposed to add addresses manually (again - not sure I understand what you mean).
