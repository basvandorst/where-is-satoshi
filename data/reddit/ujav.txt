Oh, what a shithole country

In a decade from now, just an idea to keep every coffee transaction in the blockchain would seem ridiculous. Honestly, it is already.

Sorry, I was talking mostly to anyone reading this sub. Shill or just uninformed person, that doesn't matter, really. Quality of the posts and discussions is what bothers me the most.
About the usage percentage, it's the least of my concern. Because it's not really "usage", I'd say 99% of any crypto transactions have a speculative reasoning at the moment. Oh, and the kitties of course.
If you are concerning about the price, then you should be thinking about buying/selling ratio first, not about the volume. There are cryptos with a daily volume 150-250% of bcash but with much lesser total market cup.
Aand I'm not a bitcoin guy too, years ago I kept saying that btc is the oldest and the therefore technically the worst crypto. But bcash, in late-2017, just why. Gosh, even Doge is much superior. Maybe btc will be improved much in 2018, I don't know and nobody knows. We are nowhere near crypto mass adoption.

Compression doesn't help much, otherwise it would have already been implemented.
Basically, every transaction has a long unique identifiers with a lot of entropy, they couldn't be compressed noticeably.

Oh, look at another cute bcash sub user who's using "we". 
And no, market cap isn't the same as "percentage of users". 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:12:52
First, there's no direct correlation between amount of users and product quality and/or price, see gold, analog watches or cocaine.
Second, we do not know how many of them "users" anyway, in a market volume affected by whales.
And the last, any percentage here is bshit, 60%, 55%, or 49%, why not 4% or 90%.

Aand sorry for your sarcasm detection ability.
I was born in "your" country btw, and lived there for a significant chunk of life. А Питер где-то как-то решает.

It's not the issue with mine, is this normal? Node is up and running fine for a couple of days, port opened, about 14 incoming connections usually, tested on external sites too. 
But bandwidth usage's very low, about 0.1-0.5% of unlimited 100mbit connection, with a rare peaks to 10-25%

Not much is known yet, he is unhurt, but "under a big stress", so no comments or interviews. Investigation is ongoing, though I really doubt they will get caught.
Honestly, it might look as an inside job, seems like $1mil wasn't only his private money.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:30:56
Aand he's already freed, alive and almost well.

Why download ~100Gigs of data when it's much easier and faster to export keys through dumpwallet?

Here's what you can get in Ukraine for $25k, somewhere not far from large city:
Average yearly net salary for Kyiv is about $5.1k [now]( so yeah, it's still a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:13:00
Well, maybe, but Ukraine still has 3x less murder and rape rate, and [much less violent crimes]( than modern Russia. And less suicides, too.
But financial crimes, yes, it's an issue.

That makes sense, the country is vast and very different, and Kryvyi Rih is basically a post-soviet industrial shithole, like Detroit for example.
Occupied Donetsk or Lugansk was even worse.
Lviv or Kyiv is a whole different story though, you can't just bribe the reformed police in most cases. Some foregneirs tried recently and now they are under trial. So, a lot have changed in the last 3-4 years.

Ok, and he's [free now]( 
I don't get why are you jumping to a conclusions here. He doesn't have an access to exchange funds. 
Also he's a Russian citizen, and there's still an armed conflict with Russia.

Per capita, of course, just click the link.
