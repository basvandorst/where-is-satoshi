you've got to be kidding me... Is this from a 2013 order?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:05:50
no source. good post

and having your btc on your laptop, on a usb stick, or on a shady exchange site out of Slovenia is in no way safer than government backed USD that everyone accepts. if you think btc is safer than usd then you probably aren't very good with money

yadda yadda. everyone gets interested in bitcoin when they learn about the price. its not your own bank. its a volatile commodity with no backing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:26
no it's not
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:50
I knew that was coming. such a basic redditor.  I know exactly the mathematical framework behind the secure hash algorithm and the purpose of the blockchain ledger.Yes, you can save the private keys on a usb - and the entire blockchain if its large enough. maybe you should read up.

didn't mean to. was on the wrong thread. then I said fuck it lol

dude I've been hodling since 2013. but I also sell and buy at opportune times. I'm up a good bit on btc. don't need your help. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:58
nah I'm good
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:16:05
that's a cop-out blanket statement spread here on reddit. it isn't a safe store of wealth. it is volatile. if you has one 3 days ago you had $19,600. today, and exchange may be holding it hostage due to technical difficulties
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:18
yeah you get in that market in the past 12 hours and see how much winning you do
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:02:40
perfect reply. end of discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:18
the legit exchanges haven't gone bankrupt, just the shady ones with minimal verification. and yes, that's what I meant - immediately liquidate to save losses
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:09
not salty at all. I got out early enough before all of this. I did just fine. didn't get caught up in the delusional frenzy, just kept my cool and didn't lose a Satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:40
why the hell would you keep your coins out of an exchange where you could quickly cash out during a flash crash... cold storage actually hurts you in that sense. after nights like this, you'd want to be able to dump them quickly right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:33:21
lol at "unless you are above 30 years old"
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:12:29
you just keep hodling those coins and never ever sell. ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:41
what do you think of its longevity when quantum computing is viable
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:19:15
um, ok. So you're saying they can be stolen... However you store them is up to you, but spreading false info as if they are completely safe and will never be stolen is one the reasons why some people end up misinformed and losing a good chunk of their cash on the hype. btc is fallible. it isnt the perfect end-all solution to our problems like it's touted here on reddit. I'm  here to check that shit

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:22:32
what you mean is the bitcoins can't be duplicated. they can certainly be stolen. many have been stolen from exchanges. have you ever had your US dollars stolen from a bank and never seen again?  exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:32
there's no guarantee of it ever recovering...
