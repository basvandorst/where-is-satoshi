Ignore Dan Kaminsky at your peril. The dude has independently broken DNS (requiring a patch by ~every software vendor in the world) *and* a big chunk of SSL (with Moxie Marlinspike), as well as holding a shard for the root, worldwide DNSSEC key. 
He might still be wrong of course but calling him a clown says much more about you than it does him.

I was referring to buying straight bitcoins not using their trust, as I understand it they're two entirely separate things. Trading somewhere else dark is equivalent to using secondmarket, you find whoever has the fewest fees. Trading slowly on a lit market can work sure but you're taking risks of the price moving and of someone being cleverer than you and front running. Some people do it that way, some aren't (or don't want to become) that sophisticated at microstructure.

Or if the site simply disappears. The counterparty risk here is enormous.

It's more like optional like buying personalized stationery is optional.

If you're moving a large amount of bitcoin in one transaction you'll 'pay' by crossing the spread. If you're selling say 2,500 BTC your average price on bitstamp right now would be 672, from a last of 707. That's almost 5% off of what the 'fair' price is, before any exchange and wire fees. 
If SecondMarket offers to buy your coins for even a small improvement in price (say 685, still well below the last) you're coming out ahead by $32,500 ((685-672)*2500). Their fees can be quite high before that stops being a good deal for you. Not to mention if you're moving a few million dollars you might be quite risk averse and dealing with a regulated, US-domiciled entity might be worth something all by itself. 
And of course if you want to move *25,000 BTC* you have no choice if you want to do it in one transaction.

I am not a financial planner, this is not financial advice, I have no fiduciary duty to you. 
It stands for Individual Retirement Account. Our IRS cares very little for acronym collisions. 
In the US there are three ways people save for retirement: pensions, 401k/403b/etc and IRAs. Pensions are usually defined-benefit, i.e. you pay into it for X years of being employed and you're guaranteed some income from retirement till death. These are basically dead outside governments and Detroit is proving that 'guaranteed' isn't all that guaranteed. 
401k and friends are offered by your employer, they generally invest in some fixed set of 'normal' investments with very little choice for the individual beyond "put 60% into the one stock fund choice and 40% into the one bond fund choice".  These accounts are tax-deferred so you put pre-tax money into them and pay the tax when you withdraw (presumably at a lower rate since you'll be retired). Employers can 'match' up to 6% which is also pre-tax and free money to you. There are often vesting requirements and other silliness as well as maximum contribution amounts. 
IRAs, [there are a few different kinds]( are like the name suggests *individual* retirement accounts. You can just open one on your own regardless of where you work. These can run the gamut from fully managed mutual funds to normal brokerage accounts to [almost anything you can imagine]( including wacky things like real estate if you're brave. The traditional IRA is tax-deferred like the 401k. The Roth IRA is not, you pay with post-tax money and pay no capital gains whatsoever on the gains. There are contribution limits as well as income limits on contributing at all.

Alternatively he's not a big promoter of bitcoin because he sees flaws. Believe what you like but I'd rather hear disagreement than dismissal, especially when you're talking about someone of *significant* stature in the security industry.

It doesn't exclude them from anything. The proposal is to use a zero knowledge proof generated from a passport as an *optional* identifier people running a full bitcoin node could use. 
Nothing in the proposal stops, slows or limits the ability of anyone from running a full node, mining, transferring or spending bitcoins.

So I signed up. After verifying they asked if I was buying or selling which indicates they're at least in principal willing to take either side. 
I haven't done a trade with them but they also haven't asked me to verify as an accredited investor.

Yeah you do need some apex of trust in a hierarchical system like dnssec. There's some [discussion]( on Schneier's website which links to more primary sources.

Bear in mind the NSA has offensive capabilities that are relevant here. A few carefully-placed rootkits could subvert the major mining pools either for control or simply to remove them from the network.

By all means challenge. Challenge claims with facts and arguments instead of bombast and insults.
