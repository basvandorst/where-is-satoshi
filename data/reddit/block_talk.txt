This is also my use case and I wrote it in a way that these transactions are taken into account as long as you keep the csv file updated.  I have transactions from bitfloor, coinbase, bitstamp, online merchants, local sales, etc. The Bitstamp csv format is only treated as an interface to access your information.  You don't even need to have a Bitstamp account to use this program.  I've included use cases in the README.md file to help enter those alternative sources.


My program allows you to maintain ownership of your trading history.  Bitcointaxes.info is certainly a great option for many people, but others may also want to see the source and make modifications to suit their individual needs.

I haven't used it, but I did check out the landing page.  It looks like a great service.  I actually started working on this script back in 2013 but finally finished it up so I could file my taxes.  I'd say my program is better suited for those who want control of their privacy and/or those who like to program and see the source.

As far as I know there is some question as to whether or not Bitcoin themed apps will be allowed in the iOS market.  I will wait and see.  There is still plenty of work to do in the Android version (plus I'd need to learn objective C, lol)
Are you still under development? Why the wait?
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:25:09
There haven't been any audits performed.  The WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission simply allows me to cache jpg and png thumbnails to lower your network usage.  edit: \*It also implicitly grants READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, which I suspect you are concerned about.\*  It should be noted that whether or not that permission is present does not make any difference for some versions of Android.  I also need to declare this permission so that I can read the images the user chooses for upload when creating a reply or new listing.  Unfortunately these features are quite integral to my app and would severely limit functionality if removed.  I understand your concern, and I know this isn't credible coming from a stranger on the internet, but I personally stand behind this product and put my real full name on it, publicly searchable for the world to see and I wouldn't create a product that could be considered malware.


I use the proper API methods, getExternalCacheDir() or getCacheDir() (in cases when no external storage is present) and only write in /sdcard/Android/data/com.garypaduana.bitblock/ to respect organization within your directory structure.
I never use your GPS information for anything other than your own personal experience on your device (only after you choose to turn location finding on in the menu).  I also safeguard any token/password you use by creating a HMAC_SHA256 hash so that not your plaintext password, nor a hash of your password, nor a salted hash of your password ever leaves your device so that other services with the same password would never be at risk.  (PSA: Never use the same password for more than one service, but just in case, Bit Block isn't a weak link)
I understand this is probably more detail than you were asking for and not the answer you were looking for, but I tried to make this app efficient, secure, and completely clear of any mischievous behavior to ensure an enjoyable user experience.  If anyone has additional concerns send me a PM and we can chat on the phone or browse through source code if you like.  The code is not currently open source, but I may move to that in the future.
edit: sorry, I left out a sentence that is needed to tie together the READ and WRITE permissions.  I suspect that you're concerned that I could read your wallet file or do something else malicious along those lines.  As it stands, if you're running Android 4.1 or earlier it appears as though that would already be possible without explicitly declaring the permission in the Android Manifest (used by the installer to clearly define what permissions are needed).
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:31:35
As a professional developer it would take me a great deal of time and effort to begin to *understand* how the code works, let alone check it for maliciousness.  Peer code reviews typically take 5-10 hours for small code bases (&lt; 4000 lines), and that's just checking things for obvious errors and mistakes, it's not following the flow during execution looking for hidden "features".

Cool.  One thing I noticed while using it was that the entire history is maintained in the WebView when switching between exchanges.  This effectively disables the back button as a means to close the app.  Is this intended behavior?  I would prefer no saved history and only rely on exclusive use of the 4 navigation buttons at the bottom.  Otherwise, it's a clean design and executed nicely.  I went through all of the normal quick testing procedures (multiple rotations quickly, heap dump and review in MAT looking for memory leaks, and logcat analysis looking for stray comments or the leaking of unnecessary details.)  Everything seems to be rather stable for a first release. Good work :)

One way to encourage local growth would be to start listing things around the house that you want to sell using OP's example.  "Selling for $100 or $75 equivalent in BTC".  I wrote an app called [Bit Block]( that will very easily allow you to take a picture and attach it to a listing on a map.  There's nothing else like it on Android right now and it's quicker and easier to use than even the craigslist apps in my opinion.
Here's what the main navigation screen looks like: 
To create a new listing, just locate your position on the map, hit the "+" button in the top action bar, fill out a description and and attach a picture (uses imgur as the host), and submit.  You could post 5-10 things in just a few minutes and it will help the btc economy grow :)

Just claim it as a short term capital gain on 2013 taxes and you'll be fine.  If you had it longer than a year then it's a long term capital gain and not taxed as ordinary income but be sure to have proof of purchase date and cost basis.  You won't receive a 1099-B and the value won't be reported to the IRS but you are still required to claim it.  You may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalty at the end of the year.

There is only a ~$1billion market cap right now.  There is something like a quadrillion US dollars in the derivatives market.  That's 1,000,000 times more market cap than bitcoin currently has, yet you still use the USD in very small denominations daily without seeing it from a distorted perspective.  Yes, the price is rising, but there are only ~11 million of them in existence.  There are single family houses that cost $11mil all over the world yet you still hold on to that $20 in your pocket.  Don't worry about the small numbers, they're arbitrary.  Look at the total distribution and relative market caps.

I only bring that up to show relative scale.  USD is extremely valueless per unit considering that the global market deals with them on the order of quadrillions.  Comparatively, BTC has a much higher value per unit since they only exist in the 10s of millions, not thousands of trillions.  My point is that of course the 1.00 of USD and BTC units will look unequal because they do not exist in similar magnitude.

FYI, I've also posted this on [Bit Block for Android]( which is a local Bitcoin resource for buyers, sellers, and merchants.

that's my whole complaint. there is no accountability or legal oversight. good luck convincing America to become anarchist libertarians when we can't even get more than 1% vote for a 3rd party presidential candidate.

I didn't realize they were still in business.  I thought they stopped offering exchange services about a week ago.

If everyone is in the mood for Bitcoin brick and mortar listings, please check out [Bit Block]( on Android.  There are currently well over 100 physical listings around the world and I add new ones as often as I find them.  Feel free to add your own listings if you are selling something locally for bitcoin or would like to exchange local currency.  It's really easy to attach pictures and post comments and replies to existing listings.

There is no easy way in that you cannot just put in a credit card number and have some show up.  The problem is that credit cards transactions can be victim to things like chargebacks, where the vendor does not receive the funds after the customer files a complaint.  Cash transfer is the only way fast way for the exchange to reliably get the money.  If you want to do wire transfers, you'll need to verify ownership of the account and possibly send a scan of your govt ID.

Cool, I hope it all works out well.  Let me know if you ever want to trade ideas or work together since we have common goals in a very new arena.

Was Padmapper also acting as a noncommercial public archive?

I'm American and it's still a pain.  My credit union blows away any bitcoin exchange so far.
Credit Union: Limit order for 100 shares of XOM.  Executed within seconds of hitting the execution price.
Bitcoin Exchange:  Limit order for 100 BTC.  Sorry we don't do limit orders.  Okay, market order for 100 BTC.  Sorry over the limit, try 10.  Sorry don't have any.  We can maybe give you some next week.  &lt;Next week&gt; Okay, got them, executing market order now with 6 minutes of lag since last update.  Don't worry, order went through $7 higher/BTC than when you last saw it.  Oh, and we're going to need your government issued ID but we aren't going to prepare any tax documents for you.
It's good with no centralized authority, but it's horrible with no centralized services.  As soon as a real bank picks this up and starts offering exchange services the utility will skyrocket.  If I'm paying taxes on all the earnings anyway then why am I doing business with a start-up company?  What's the incentive to struggle through their growing pains?

Very cool!  I went ahead and added this to [Bit Block for Android]( so that others can find it in the future.  [This is what the listing looks like]( and [this is how it appears on the map](  
Version 1.1.1 was just released this afternoon (will be live soon on Google Play) with improvements to text overlays on the map and the way spot prices are obtained from MtGox.  If interested, please give it a look and contribute to help attract more users.

Additionally, as an alternative to local bitcoins, my android app, [Bit Block]( helps you find and connect with local buyers, sellers, and traders.  It's a map based interface with the ability to add new postings without registering.  You can even attach images that are hosted on imgur if you have products to sell or a storefront to show.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:43:05
Also, I forgot to include this part:

exercise, healthy diet, time with loved ones, and hobbies

Looks like I'm done with bitcoin for a while.  There's no way I'm going back to Coinbase after using an actual exchange like bitfloor.

tagged as 'hates libertarians', so I imagine there was some troll behavior in the past to warrant that.

I'm self employed and I'm currently working on a Bitcoin related project.  It's nice to have so much motivation to be productive :)

How long is this offer valid?
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:54:16
I'm still waiting on my first transaction to clear (0.15 BTC) just to test the system.  I waited 2 days and did the verify account option with 2 small deposits then placed my first order.  We will see if they fill it at the right price...
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:12:58
Do you or someone you know pay for electricity?  If so, it may be fun, but it will likely not be profitable with an older computer.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:38:29
Honestly, it would take me another few months as I'd need to learn Objective C and the iOS environment.  I'm a long time Java developer so Android was the natural choice when deciding to get into mobile development.  If you or someone you know would like to help I'd be glad to open up the web services API and make it cross platform.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:49:44
Ahh, okay I will fix it.  I copy/pasted from your Google maps profile.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:49:52
No, you specify the cost of the transaction, which helps it get picked up and processed in a timely manner.  0.0005 BTC is usually good if you can wait a few hours.  You could do 0.0 fee but it may take much longer.

Spoiler alert: they all suck in one way or another
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:34:02
In contrast, my app is getting one submission every few days.  I spent months working on this and even recently removed all advertising to make it as enjoyable as possible.  Have an android app, coinmap? Want to buy one? lol
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:32:06
My app, [Bit Block for Android]( helps you find local merchants and individuals that are willing to buy and sell using BTC.  I'm currently working on updates and I post new listings as often as I find them.  Users can also add listings with pictures.
edit: v1.1.0 will be live soon.  It includes MtGox spot price overlay on the map for quick reference.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:38:45
Do you have a local pickup option? I'd love to add you to [Bit Block for Android]( which is a directory of local merchants and individuals buying and selling in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:03:16
I've got 6 listings in NYC on [Bit Block](
