enderminh here, who helps copy-editing the book. Once you make a pull request, and I can reference the data with Zerocoin website, we can pull this in. Thanks for checking.

Fair enough. It's probably best then to just file an issue or propose a concrete pull request, and Andreas will then review manually.

Repeat Wikipedia-editor here. There you go, I created [the Wikipedia stub]( for you. Go ahead and help improve the article. Remember to cite references for every edit, or else it gets removed.

If you go to  you'll see  just linked from the list of files in the root directory (right before chapter 1). Let me know if you have any questions!

Repeat Wikipedia-editor here. I just [created the stub]( with many references, so from my experience it will stick around. Feel free to help edit and improve the article.

Acknowledged. I am afraid the stub has already been created. I'll let it be. It also looks like some other Wikipedia editors already tagged it for notability review anyways, so it might get removed. I'll let them decide.
Your humbleness is great, though personally I think the article is useful to have. It helps others understand this space.

I don't know what Andreas uses, but I just a plain old text editor. The formatting is pretty easy to learn. Also, github automatically formats asciidoc, so that's kinda nice.

It's a Wikipedia article, feel free to edit it as you see fit as long as you can reference it. I only wrote up the stub based on what I found on other articles. I acknowledge your point that the articles I referenced themselves don't have other references. However, I found plenty of other articles he has written in the past (prior his Bitcoin involvement). I can try to add those references later tonight.
Regardless, feel free to change it to "computer security consultant" or so. Wikipedia works great when the article evolves through the participation of many people.
