Sell them, bam, effectively shorted.

If you hodled for long enough that it's an option financially, that's great and I'm happy for you.. but most of us are stuck here.

I completely agree. bitcoin might be useful as a currency when it has more market depth, but for now it's too volatile to be taken seriously as a currency (that was valves reasoning for dropping it, too). Merchants won't adopt it until they know it won't depreciate against the dollar by 1,000,000% overnight

It happens all the time. Stare at GDAX for long enough and you'll see it. People will place HUGE ($20,000,000+) sell orders and the price will immediately collapse, they keep moving it in as all the buy orders get soaked up and then people start panic selling resulting in &gt;$1,000 dip. This has happened twice today already. Once the wall of buys starts forming, they immediately soak up 10-100 bitcoin depending on depth.

You won't be saying that when they advance this from border crossing to ordinary possession. 'Terrorism' and 'children/pedophiles' are always the boogeymen used as stepping stones to tyrannical legislation.

By the way, to bypass the coinbase sell limit, transfer them to gdax (subsidiary of coinbase), sell them on gdax, then withdraw them back to coinbase.
gdax is basically just the platform that people use for day trading bitcoin (and avoiding fees)
And I'd appreciate it if someone could back me up on this so he doesn't get sketched out by it.

They own Steam, the largest (monopoly) PC game distribution platform in the world
edit: to be clear, that's tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin flow cut off.

Lightning network is flawed tbh it's highly centralized and would require the majority of people on the network to have over $30,000 in bitcoin to operate efficiently. Big holders don't help. I would recommend you do your own research and learn about how it works. There are much more promising solutions particularly Plasma.

I know this sub is a circle jerk but jesus christ. This is not a result of mainstream adoption, because there is no mainstream adoption. The only thing that happened today in that realm is Valve **dropping** their support of bitcoin

Like the vast majority of early adopters, I had hundreds of bitcoin when they were pennies, (I even did CPU mining...) but sold at $20. I've bought in and cashed out since then, I'm poor as fuck, live paycheck to paycheck, and have bills to pay.. so no, I don't have 1btc. :( More like .002

There was nothing to back up the speculative bubble, don't worry about it
Bitcoin, ethereum, shit even litecoin all saw over 1,000% growth to their market caps. I know this sub is a circle jerk and some of the people here are retarded, but it's common sense that nothing was driving a 300 **billion** dollar increase in bitcoins market cap over the last 6 weeks, other than pure speculation
