The point is that right now your lack of sources diminishes your credibility, even if later on it happens to prove correct.
Have an intelligent discussion and bring your source, if what you are after is having a real conversation. 
But this comment is just for the public. Including choice intro words such as 
I remember reading that someone said 
Does nothing for anyone.

Although not really a regret...
In 2014 I was walking the halls of the CES show in Vegas and stopped at a Bitcoin area. I didn't even know it was Bitcoin, I just knew they were trying to sell computer mining equipment and trying to explain the whole thing. They were the only booths giving out really trinkets like teddy bears, bottle openers and other stuff I don't remember. I walked away from it without much thoughts about it. Just like another curiosity of the show. 
After I found out about bitcoin for real and realized how close I was to that situation then, I went into my drawer and noticed that the bottle opener has the Bitpay logo on it.
I still have it.

No other crypto currency is worth your time. Bitcoin is head and shoulders above anything else in the space in regards to its origin, liquidity, transparency and quality of developers working on building on top of the base layer. 
To even call it a crypto currency is dangerous because it seems to equate them all. 
Bitcoin is it. Everything else is pretty much riding Bitcoin's coattails.

Most important 3 things about Bitcoin
1. Apolitical/ non sovereign. No one controls Bitcoin. 
2. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin 
3. Permissionless. Wanna send money to family in Venezuela? Or from Russia to the Ukraine, or North Korea on a Sunday at 3AM? Ain't no one stopping you. 
Honorable mentions:
The first digital good with absolute scarcity 
Method of settlement and currency at the same time. It is the dollar and PayPal woven together. 
Feel free to add to this list
