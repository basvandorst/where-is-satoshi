Tough to quote in USD at this point. I have a GTX570 at home, been mining 12-18 hours a day since mid-February. It's netted about 0.5 btc so far. That was worth $20 two weeks ago, and $130 two days ago. I see it as a painless way of turning part of my electric bill into BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:51:45
$71.02.  Thank you, Voice of Reason, for your, ahh, voice of reason. I do find the concept of being a daytrader alluring. At least with my little play money account.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:59:11
Thanks. I'll give it a shot, might as well at least have some sort of plan since I'm daytrading anyway. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:23:07
It's either shaken out already, or it hasn't. Some argue the current 90-100 price is our dead cat bounce and it's headed down still. Some argue that the increased publicity has enough additional people bought in to hold prices here. I'm bullish from this point, but my advice is worth exactly what you paid for it.

Good interview. Reminds me why I like the guy. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:34:55
$5 isn't really a statistically significant price movement at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:07:11
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:00:34
For example...tried to sell two minutes ago at 104. And now it's bombed back to 98, and I'm pretty sure my sell didn't go through. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:58:44
Not sure if that drop was because of a wall, I watched a shitload of 0.01 btc sells placed at 110-113 as the price tanked, and then a buy at 113. Well-played, anonymous bot/speculator.

How exactly is it unethical? 
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:28:33
Hopefully it works out for you. Last couple auctions I saw ended slightly above market price, but not enough to cover ebay's 10% fees and the chances of a buyer scamming me. Tough enough dealing with them when transferring physical goods. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:10:51
I HOLD. (Because the peak was about $0.60 short of my sell order)

Whatever it is, they just shot themselves in the foot, big time. *sigh* I've been trying to avoid Mt Gox, but I need a stable trading platform, and closing bank accounts doesn't really inspire confidence. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:13:16
I suggest you drive to another state and get your documents notarized. 
Alternately, I offer my transfer services at a flat fee of 2%. Transfer BTC to me, I'll convert back to USD, withdraw to my bank account, and wire you the money. This will double your withdrawal rate, at least.

@_date: 2013-04-24 04:21:47
Well, either way, congratulations on your success. My biggest 1st world problem right now is if my ex finds out about my $3,500 401(k) account. :facepalm
I suppose if it's really necessary to access the money right away (assuming everything is completely legal and above board) that taking a small % hit might be necessary. 
And why do you need to remove USD from your account in order to continue trading? Arbitrage over to BTC-E or similar?

Thanks, checking them out. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:59:57
Sounds like their error means that you got to withdraw more than your actual balance. So actually, they GAVE you 2.0765 BTC. Or accidentally lent it to you. And if you'd like to use their service, you'll have to repay it. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:02:20
I don't think 78 is enough to move the price, I just think somebody wanted it pushed down so they could make their buy. Seen the pattern several times now.

Didn't realize we could do it that way. Makes sense though. Not time to worry quite yet, there seems to be some delays in Bitfloor sending out withdrawn funds. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:24:35
Sold about 75% at $86.15, might jump back in if 80-90 seems like the new trading band. Let this be a lesson to me that day traders should not hold overnight positions.

So how do you short it? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:36:26
Bitfloor is under a DDOS attack, according to their Facebook /twitter. I have a couple of limit orders pending as well, or at least I did a few hours ago. Certainly hope they have it fixed by the time Mt Gox reopens and crashes everything another 50%

Moneypak is anonymous for the buyer, right? Basically he gets the BTC with no ID, no verification, no in-person meetup, etc? For some people, that's worth a small premium.

And bitfloor is usually another $3-5 higher than MG. But the current volatility and the costs of moving USD into and out of these accounts is making the risk unattractive to me at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:48:37
Leaving decimal place ambiguous, I started with 3(x), made it up to 4.3, dropped to 3.8, and today has been bad, down to about 3.2 before recovering to 3.8 and having to pull all my funds out of bitfloor.

The trust issue is the potential problem that I see also. I have a 100% seller rating and over ten years of history. I would never actually consider taking advantage of the lack of recourse for the buyer, but it's always something that's going to be in the buyer's mind. Fortunately, ebay doesn't have to like the method of payment, they're going to get their 10% in final value fees either way. This just sidesteps the 2.5% extra they like to skim once the transaction goes through PayPal.

I just gave it a try. The web interface is too slow to make it work, and the price keeps running away from my walls. LOL. And, if your price happens to match the actual market price, you get dinged the 0.4% instead of rebated. Definitely bot territory, not gonna happen via humans. That lesson just cost me two dollars. Hah.

If you bought in at 110.9, then you were anticipating the crossing. Not that you were wrong in this case, but is that your normal method? If it looks like it's going to cross, and the current H4 block is in the same direction, pull the trigger on it?
I'm using mostly H1 right now, and it got me in at $97 on this current bull run. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:30:19
And it's down. DDOS got ahead of them. If it tanks a bit on reopening, I'll buy in some more. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:03:41
Glad I just doubled my position this morning, but at the same time, I'm gonna get really nervous if this keeps up. A second bubble so soon would be...something. Weird? Unprecedented? The greatest bull trap of all time? I dunno. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:46:47
Hmm. Bitcoin is not specifically mentioned, but it isn't one of their "allowed" methods either. I wonder if it could be considered a bank to bank transfer, which would be allowed in several categories.

There's some discussion today of bitfloor closing their USD bank account. Makes me a little nervous, since I do most of my trading there. Might have to pull BTC and shift over to Mt Gox or CampBX until it shakes out.

@_date: 2013-04-25 17:52:26
Selling off 600-700 coins right at $150 USD, pushed the price down significantly. It'll recover, but I'm sitting here wishing I was set up for a buy instead of 100% in BTC in my trading account.

@_date: 2013-04-24 06:33:05
From what I've seen, I suspect they are putting in a flurry of buy and sell orders for small amounts, all below the market price by at least several dollars. Likely actually selling back and forth to each other. As this flurry outnumbers other transactions, it pulls the actual price down for a span of maybe a minute, and during that window a single larger purchase is made. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:52:56

@_date: 2013-04-15 04:29:11
I'll freely admit I've been enjoying the 10-15% daily volatility, and yes it does make for good day trading. Interesting thought, that when (we) get tired of it and cash out that it would drop again by another 60-75% of it's current price. Not infeasible, I suppose. I'm hoping to hold a modest position once the price settles down as a longer-term investment. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:39:20

@_date: 2013-04-17 22:44:38
I suspect they're transferring from their cold wallet to their live wallet as fast as possible to fulfill a tsunami of withdrawal requests. Sounds like a lot of us who pulled out at the 11th hour are still waiting on any information from the blockchain. I would get a screenshot of the bitfloor confirmation on your overview page at least. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:59:20
I would say going all in has been one of my problems, I've been comfortable with my position in BTC, and seen a drop that would make a good buying opportunity (like today) and been unable to capitalize on it. I bought my last batch at 137 a couple days ago, and might sell a few at if it hits 145 to standby for any more variance tonight. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:39:08

I'd love to hear how you included the payment information in the auction. I'm obviously still planning to allow PayPal, just offering BTC as an option. My business volume isn't huge, but it keeps me busy on the weekends. PM a link to one of your listings?

Quick question, when a person makes a deposit through your service, when do you determine the market rate? Is it daily, or when the payment posts to your account, or ??? Thanks.

It causes price instability, and trader uncertainty.

I thought the trade fees started at .6%, and go *down* to .55% as your trade volume increases.

Away from my desk, can't even check.

Excellent post. I am, admittedly, completely new at this and flying by the seat of my pants. Also, I'm not into it for any more money than a working man might drop in a good weekend in Vegas. Not betting my retirement or anything. Any further insight is greatly appreciated.
