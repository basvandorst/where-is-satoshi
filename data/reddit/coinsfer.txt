Do you have any proof of this other than that you just think it is? They've been around since 2010 without issue...

So it says "this service is illegal"? I doubt that. If it's so clear then please copy/paste the portion that "clearly spells out" that it's illegal.

With respect I think you are missing the point of Coinsfer.com service which is to enable Bitcoin payment for services like this which do not do so natively.

Apologies, didn't realize it was considered 'spamming' to repost since I last posted our site here a couple of days ago.

Once we're successful enough maybe we'll expand to the UK! :)

We're new to reddit, only had 2 posts, and (again) didn't realize it was considered 'spamming' to repost days later.

Great question, thanks. There are some key differences between our service and those like snapcard, and we actually see ourselves working mostly in parallel to them rather than in competition...
1. Our service is primarily (though not necessarily exclusively) oriented for international customers buying from U.S. retailers which don't ship international.
2. We support basically all sites where you can buy something online as opposed to primarily just focusing on the "big guys" like Amazon, eBay, Google, Walmart, Target, Newegg, etc.
3. You don't have to create an account with us, prepay, link your Coinbase account, etc. Just submit your email and urls to the items you want to buy to get your order started.

Hi, thanks for your question - great idea! Since governments require us to comply with their demands (or they'll throw us in a cage called "jail"), we must show the USD price. However, if you indicate that you wish to do this with your order, and if your chosen retailer provides a way to add the additional information to the invoice, we would be glad to do so!
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:06:14
Thank you for the feedback, we will take it into consideration :)

We have lists of what is legal to ship overseas and what isn't listed on our site, I'm afraid you're wrong about some of those items listed there.

Our business is shipping U.S. products to you anywhere in the world... NOT web design ;)

Hey thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:48:27
Thanks, we look forward to your business!

Hi, thanks for your question. While the Bitspend incident was highly unfortunate, we would never let something like that happen. Our business is registered in Florida and we have ensured that our bank is OK with our business (although there is some dispute as to whether Bitspend's issue was actually due to their bank, but that's a different story).
Our mission is to leverage the power of Bitcoin to transform international commerce. We're in it for the long haul, so we want to leave our customers happy so you'll come back for more and tell all your friends. If you like, just try a smaller order to start with. You'll see how great our service is!

Hi, thanks for your questions. We answered your first question in another comment, but to recap: 1. Our business is legitimately registered in Florida 2. We have ensured that our bank is OK with our business 3. We're in it for the long haul, so we want to leave our customers happy so you'll come back for more and tell all your friends. More business from you is better for us, so we have every incentive to provide a great service and leave you happy every time. --- To your second question, eBay is actually one of the only sites we currently don't support due to fraud issues with their site (as you mentioned). We hope to find ways to offer eBay support in the future, but in the meantime if you are able to find the same items on Amazon or elsewhere we would love to help!

Hi, thanks for your question. Our shipping courier can vary by country, but we primarily use DHL, FedEx, or UPS. We will let you know who we plan to use (and their cost) when you submit your order. As for our bank, that is information we can't disclose at this time but we can disclose that it is a community bank (not one of the banking giants) and that they are OK with it.

Coinsfer.com service provides the U.S. address AND credit card for you to do so :)

Yes, we can do more complicated orders, although if it is a cheaper order with high complexity our "tip" can increase from the standard 5% up to 10% to cover our time (in the rare case that this happens we will notify you on the invoice before payment). Also, in the case of phones for example, we of course could not pay for the contract so a non-contractual option would have to be used.

Hi, thanks for your question. If the retailer the merchandise is purchased from offers a "gift" option, we will be glad to use this option - simply indicate that you wish to do this with your order. However, for legal reasons, we must use the accurate invoice amount. Frustrating, but we want to be able to continue offering our service, and don't want to go to jail!

Hi, thanks for your question. We are relative newcomers so we don't have lots of references yet, however we have already received a good number of orders, and well over 2.5 BTC (~$1600) in orders already paid and in progress. And we're ready for more! Give it a try with a small amount if you like, then you'll see :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:01:06
Thank you for this feedback, it is helpful and we'll try to make some improvements there!
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:05:41
However, many of them do not ship international and require a U.S. address.
