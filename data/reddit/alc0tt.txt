If my math is correct, it’s approximately 900 BTCs!

I’m scared about 2 other things:
1. How centralized mining is in China
And 
2. Can’t a single country buy up a huge amount of BTC and either get rich from it or deter people from using it completely?

Would you still use it if a foreign country bought up millions of btc?

I think holding bitcoin is beneficial for the ecosystem as well. 
Firstly, the engineers working on bitcoin don’t get paid to do so and therefore only benefit from their hard work from the appreciation in bitcoin. One can say I’m investing in their hard work. 
Secondly, the more capital that enters bitcoin grows the ecosystem and legitimizes it as a global currency. Bitcoin won’t be globally accepted unless it is seen as a legitimate currency that holds value. 
Thirdly, whenever the price goes up due to demand and low supply of sellers more and more people start to get interested in bitcoin and start to learn about cryptocurrencies. I, myself, came for the money, but now I’m totally addicted to learning more about cryptocurrencies because of my finance background. I even have done a few projects about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in my MBA. 
For bitcoin to become a useful currency I do agree that it must be spent, but currently at every single place that I spend money at they do not accept bitcoin (I am very frugal and only buy food and necessities in America). I think bitcoin needs to be seen as valuable before it is widely accepted. We’ve seen that many places started to accept cryptocurrencies when the prices were rising and seen as valuable and from my knowledge the number of places that accept cryptos slowed down since the bear market arose. 
In conclusion, whether you’re HODL-ing or spending, turning fiat to bitcoin will grow the ecosystem and make it more valuable.
