Right, and they couldnt even make up a higher number. They just talk about how dangerous the SilkRoad was without backing it up one bit

Meanwhile they reported "at least six" people died from SilkRoad's operation. SIX PEOPLE IN TWO YEARS versus what, 400,000 every year just in the US?

Let's see, using the data from a Reddit AMA of a guy in a coma for 76 days who got a bill of $1.5 million, we can guess a year in the hospital would cost around $9 million. 9 mil times 8 years equals $72 million dollars. So if memes become the new reality by 2025 (lol) this prophetic image macro tells us that 1 BTC will equal $23,225,806,500,000,000 USD 
.... HODL!!!!!

I timed it by walking from one side of the room to the other. I lost 6.5 seconds both in time to pick up the penny and put it in my back pocket and the momentum I lost in my short travel.
Then it took me 12.5 seconds to put it in my coin jar in my room. (If I didn't have a lid on the jar this drops to 5.5 seconds)
Im too high to do the math on it but I tried and it was like $1.80 an hour idk

All of those issues are ones we'll face whether drugs are legal or not.

Silk Road being seized is clear indication that the war on drugs is not about keeping people safe or reducing crime. Allowing recreational drugs to be sold online would bring all the benefits of drug legalization without having to deal with the "I dont want cocaine being sold in MY neighborhood!!" issue of allowing B&amp;M vendors
