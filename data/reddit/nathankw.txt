Correct me if I am wrong, but the US dollar hasn't had any intrinsic value since we went off the gold standard. Bitcoin may be fueled by potential &amp; pure speculation, but the US dollar is just based on promises &amp; faith in the government that prints the bills. Neither are sure bets in the long run

Agreed. He looked like he was on drugs.

The difference between buying at $550 or $450 will mean little if (when) it goes below $100 again

Maan, it's crazy. I heard all the same stuff during the internet bubble of the late 90s. Tulip mania, whatever. Times and mass hysteria never changes.
I believe in fundamentals (or in speculative btc promises in this case), so for all of you I would place some trust in long term trends. I don't know any exact numbers naturally. Looking at ANY graph right now tho and you'll see that this is ugly. Sure it might change positive, but no 300pt move will happen in a day. Big money like to spread it out a little more. FOLLOW the big money... not the .00025 trades going on now

SELL, SELL, SELL. Recover your profits. Quit catching a falling dagger. Buy back again at $350 minimum. Being a former trader and seeing this thread and then the charts, the only people holding up the value of BTC are people like YOU in this thread. I am rapidly becoming a fan of Bitcoin and it's alts, but I don't buy on hysteria. I unemotionally sell. Do not buy till we see a base (one that's more than 10 minutes or even 36hours long...). We WERE in a tight trading pattern, but based on the short price history that is GAWN.... There may be psychological resistance at 400 (like 500 kinda is playing with), but long term the bottom I would estimate is near 300. Feel free to buy or rebuy in the high 300's and thank me later.  Keep watching the dead cat bounce until then. This mofo won't move drastically higher like all the baseless prophets say until the institutions decide to play. The past 600 points have all been profiteers. I'd guess around the month of May-July to be optimal. Take it or leave it. I signed up to Reddit just to post this.
