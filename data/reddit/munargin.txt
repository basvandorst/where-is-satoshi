Wouldn't the transaction fee give miners an incentive to create fake accounts and take the money, in the same way that charities would have this incentive.

Sure, with bitcoin if you deal with an untrustworthy merchant you can loose the money you send them. However, in mind the risk of credit cards is mostly identity theft, that anyone with your credit/debit card number and some basic info about you can spend your money. With bitcoin that is not generally possible.

A nice little summery of the benefits of a deflationary currency. I would say it doesn't really engage the arguments against a deflationary currency it just dismisses them.

Surprisingly governments can do both good thing and/or bad things. Frankly, this is shocking, and probably requires and intelligent nuanced discussion.

It might also be interesting to include the lag at Mt. Gox as a possible trigger.

It is kind of an interesting idea. However I think it would be un-implementalble. An exchange that was set up with such a policy would likely fail to attract users. They would favor exchanges where they had control. They only solution would be to build a BTC alternative with your idea somehow baked in, but that seems like with would really cripple the currency.

Rotenone has a half life of 6 days in the environment. Unless they sprayed the crop very soon before harvesting it is much much more dangerous to the farmer than to the consumer.

Saying ledger instead of blockchain might get the idea across more simply.
