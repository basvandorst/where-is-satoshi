As i said above i have money in shares atm. I am getting to get these paid out. Then i will have a couple hundred €, thats what am going to go with.
Okay, i am going to create a Coinbase account for myself.
So i got that right, that coinbase isn't an exchange?
Is Coinbase just for buying the BTC?
As soon as i have my BTCs bought on coinbase i have to transfer them to poloneix? Right?
In the detailed i quit guide by somebody on reddit. I read something abotu a reoccuring buy option for btc on coinsbase, i am thinking about doing that. Do i have to transfer them to poloniex on a regular basis?
Thank you so much for your help already. I appreciate it.

There are so many articles or guides i can read. But i don't really now which one to choose. How did you learn? Do you own a wallet or do you have it in an exchange? I am not even sure what those things are but i read them somwhere

it wont be too late, it is still skyrocketing
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:53:52
The thing is, it is pretty simple and Even when btc drops, i have a stop loss that prevents losses, i cant have that when i own the Coin right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:59:34
so i will get more for my money if i sell my shares now and buy bitcoin for that amount?
