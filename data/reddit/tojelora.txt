I wouldn't advise selling. It is dropping a lot right now, yes. But listen to me and hold. Don't try to sell and think you will buy when it gets lower. You won't time it right. You will fuck it up. When you want to rebuy, you will get less coins for your money. Plus as soon as you convert to fiat you have to pay capital gains tax.

Not happening. A lot of people are just scared of futures opening tomorrow. When people start selling, it snowballs. When tomorrow comes and people notice wall street didn't short bitcoin to zero, people will buy back.

You only lose in fiat if you sell. You still hold the exact same amount of bitcoin.

Within 6 months? Sure, it's possible. But it is not starting right now.  Futures won't kill it. This is merely a dip. For the price to get to the 2013 levels something truly catastrophic would have to happen, like Coinbase going down with everyone's coins. Probably even that wouldn't be enough.
While I think you will be proven wrong, you don't really have to eat your dick, enough balls eaten on this sub already.

Are you assuming 8mb is the original plan as BCH with its 8mb blocks calls itself "Satoshi's original vision"? In fact in was Satoshi himself who put the 1mb limit into code.

What do you mean scale segwit first? Why would we need a 100% segwit adoption? It has been a year and we are barely over 30%. Clearly segwit through soft fork has been a failure that the majority of users have ignored.

I would say it makes sense to make sure in advance that the fee catastrophe from Nov/Dec does not happen ever again. Planning ahead is good, no?

It is possible. There is apparently malware that changes the address to the attacker's address. Hope it is not the case though and your coins will eventually be shown in your wallet. Mempool is filling up, I don't know if that could be a reason why it takes a while?
edit. Has the transaction been confirmed on your end?

Congrats on the 250k!
