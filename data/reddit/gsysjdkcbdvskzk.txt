I've been hobby mining for years and finding it all pretty funny.  The price swings like this from time to time.  The recent swing has been the biggest, but in the end, people aren't just investing in Bitcoin, they are divesting in the current Fiat system.  You can't just keep printing unlimited money that is not backed up by something tangible like gold.  Bitcoin differs because there is a set limit of coins that will ever exist.  Meaning a coin will only be worth what the community values it to be.  Similar to the old gold standard.  There was a finite amount of gold in Fort Knox and our currency was tied to it.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere because people understand that buying your own rapidly inflating money from an ATM is wrong.  It's impossible to make any money with a savings account, and you'll likely lose more in fees and inflation then you'll ever make.  You can buy bonds, but they barely outpace inflation.  Unless you have tens or hundreds of thousands to throw around in the stock market, you'll never make money there either.  Five percent growth is nothing for the average person, but equates to a living for a person who has millions to invest.  Bitcoin is meant to buck the whole system by removing centralized banking.  Ie: I agree that fixing your sink is worth X, you pay me X directly, a miner makes a small fee to verify the transaction, and that's it.  Banks and Federal reserve are not involved.  1 to 1 anonymous transaction for a clogged drain, that's it.
