Crack babies are a subculture within a subculture. Your assumption that they're American smacks of lazy stereotyping.

I place a lot of value in a financial company being "full service" and not forcing me to jump around to multiple places.  So until my cypto holdings move from majority Bitcoin to exclusively Bitcoin, Gemini is at a disadvantage.

So you only made nearly 70% gains on your entire life savings over the course of a month?  Get a grip.

Is it only possible on another ledger?  Therefor exposing you to risk of supply?  Or could it be restored in other software / online location?

If we're going to insult...it's obviously your mother must have been on crack when she was pregnant with you.  You think automated bots just decided to jump into Ripple all on their own?  Maybe just MAYBE they were instructed to do so by actual people.  I could give two shits about wealthy, educated or bots but the majority of money coin hopping comes from Asia.  Don't ever go into a career where you have to think for a living.

They absolutely can. Large groups of people agreeing on preferences and behaviors is practically the definition of a 'culture'.

Lots of money running around between Alt coins looking for the next pump and dump opportunity.  Particularly true in Asian markets where they don't seem to care that Ripple is just about the opposite of a cryptocurrency.

Would be very interested in switching over to Gemini as well, but it will never be a top choice for me until it adds support for litecoin.

A KIA? If this forum has taught me anything, it's that the real Satoshi drives a Lamborghini.

I have noticed the exact same thing.  To me it looks like someone is dumping coins scheduled at noon, spread out over several days.
