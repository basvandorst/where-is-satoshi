Wasn't really an answer, but will give you that. As far as an actual goes, religion is largely based in myths etc, the truthfulness varies depending on who you ask, but there is little to no concrete evidence to support it outside the myths. Not entirely sure what you're asking, so I'm going to assume you mean cryptocurrency in general and not just bitcoin. Where religion is based in myth, crypto tends to be based on technology and the blockchain. (Admittedly I'm not the best at explaining this part so I will leave that to someone more suited).  There are some coins that aren't based on tech and I suppose you could compare those to religion, dogecoin being one that comes to mind. Probably doesn't answer what you are asking, but eh it's better than the last one lol.

Has anyone actually seen a miner in person yet or still just the one they show to test?

Shop around, decent foreign guys can make you lose at least 350%. Maybe find a Nigerian Prince like those emails.
