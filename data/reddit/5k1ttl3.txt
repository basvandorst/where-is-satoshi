Take a gander at the mempool over the last week and tell me what YOU think it costs to get a transaction confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:40:38
From what I've heard - and research this yourself because I've only started to look into it, but it seems that low fee transactions will eventually fall out of the mempool. At that point, you can transmit a conflicting transaction - ie - send those coins somewhere else, with a higher fee. And if the fee is high enough, and if the other transaction has fallen out of the mempool of enough miners, the new TX should get mined into a block. Keep in mind that you need to make your core client 'forget' about the original transaction AND keep in mind that the core client will try to retransmit the unconfirmed transaction whenever it is launched.
Fun stuff.

I bought into this too, then I watched a few of his videos on YT. The only person I like MORE is Andreas. And Andreas is honestly the only reason I'm still with Core
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:40:00
There are many mempool visualizers out there, this is my favorite: 
Surely you aren't suggesting that 24 or 48 hour confirm times are "okay'? For a coin that just a couple of years ago was touted as being instant? (Zero conf was safe for small transactions, now it doesn't make sense to make a TX under maybe $1000 or so, as every single other method on the panet for moving money is less expensive)
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:38:32
Yep. Nothing to do with the current fees or current dev team and their vision for untested, controlled second layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:18:18
yeah you're semi-fucked.
my TX at over 56 sat/byte is 15 days old. Its not likely to confirm anytime soon.
I'm lucky in that I can PROBABLY broadcast a conflicting transaction sometime in the next couple weeks and claw it back.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:10:08
Nah, I'm good dog.
Not that big of a deal. For real. I'm ~75% divested from BTC.
Its just not usable. 2000 transactions every 10 minutes is pretty bad. The "blockchain spam" line is getting old. The "segwit IS a blocksize increase" line is getting old. People need to step back and realize that, even though you occupied one side of the scaling debate (I occupied that side as well), there's still, objectively, a problem, and it's getting worse by the day.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:53:21
Dog, I'm approaching 20 days. It really depends on how big of a fee they included with the transaction. Get the TX ID and we can find out the likelihood of it confirming / when.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:00:18
I held mine after the fork and still hold mine because the risk that BCH becomes the "real" bitcoin is SUPER small - but if it DOES become the "real" bitcoin, then I don't want to have locked myself out. Like the people who sold at $300
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:09:53
Or, in all likelihood, he's dead.
Another thing to consider:
IF those coins were to move, a LOT of people would be alerted nearly instantly. It would probably cause a bit of a panic.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:53:38
Am I reading this right? You paid a fee of 2.6 satoshi / Byte?
Thats a sixteen cent fee. When people are having trouble getting transactions with $20 in fees confirmed.
I have a 15 day old transaction with a fee ten times higher, and I dont expect my transaction to EVER confirm.
That fee is so astronomically low that, even if the mempool weren't SUPER backlogged, it probably wouldn't confirm. You made a mistake.
I dont know how breadwallet works, but if this transaction was flagged as RBF (replace by fee), you should be able to resubmit it with a higher fee. If not, you're probably stuck for awhile. Try to get help from someone who knows breadwallet better. I know with the core client I should be able to resubmit mine in a couple weeks.
Also looks like you can pay a transaction accelerator service to try to get it in a block for you, but you're llooking at over $100 for the privelege
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:32:25
You shouldn't have.
the ONLY time I see where we dipped into that range was sometime yesterday
Congrats to you though, if you got a very unlikely TX to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:25:24
I guess I don't understand.

@_date: 2017-12-14 22:35:59
Maybe you sent it a few months ago, but my last 3 transactions were $17 apiece for a fast confirm (That was recommended fee per several fee estimators). I sent another TX with a fee of around$1.5 over a week ago. If usage keeps up, that TX will never confirm. 
*edit* and looking at the mempool right now: Any transaction below 300sat/byte WILL NOT confirm in the next 4 blocks. If usage keeps up, they too may never confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:39:15
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:28:38
I did the same thing. It was a mistake on my part, I let core wallet pick a fee and it picked wrong. Should have double checked. Now all my TXs I double check AND flag as RBF. We'll get our transactions confirmed eventually. Or they'll fall out of the mempool in a few weeks and we can rebroadcast with a higher fee
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:00:45
That's a bit high right now but not shockingly. Examples: my last 3 average sized transactions cost me around $17 apiece. I also accidentally sent one with a fee as "low" as $1.50. that one will likely never confirm. $40 is super high, but $10ish is normal right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:15:15
Popularity was never the problem. Of COURSE its popular. Look at the price. Popularity is through the roof.
And this is a good thing.
I'm saying that you can't confirm a transaction for what any reasonable person would call a "very low fee"
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:28:23


I mostly don't disagree except: It doesn't matter. If every single person publishing a transaction instead chose a significantly lower fee, you'd still have the same underlying problem - more demand than capacity. Even if everyone went segwit. By a LARGE margin.
The best you could expect is that everyone's transaction got confirmed in a mostly canonical fashion.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:08:32
If and when Bitcoin has 'world currency' status, or even simply much more widespread use, products will be priced in Bitcoin. This will probably start with less tangible items, like information services, but eventually products will be priced directly in bitcoin. This will anchor the price, to an extent. Example:
The motorcycle I want to purchase has an MSRP of 0.5 BTC. Oh shit, Bitcoin has dropped 10%? Great. I'll purchase 0.5 BTC and buy the motorcycle. I've gotten a 10% discount on the purchase I wanted to make, and my buying pressure has in turn pushed the market price of BTC upwards.
This will happen much quicker, and with much smaller drops than in this exaggerated example. This is just another form of arbitrage.
We're seeing wild swings right now because BTC is nothing more than a speculative asset. You CANNOT use it as a currency currently. It seems to me that BTC has LESS utility right now than it has ever had in the past.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:25:37
A 50 sat/byte TX isn't going to confirm for a very long time. I'm going on a week waiting for mine. We can handle 2000tx / 10 minute and the mempool is sitting around 120,000 last I checked. And it's going -up-. Nobody is getting a 50 sat/byte TX confirmed. My last 3 tx's cost me around $17 apiece. Admittedly that was near the peak the other night 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:39:22
Looks like they are. Kinda cool
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:44:56
Alright so I expect that you're asking:
What happens as block reward approaches 0?
Short answer: Nobody knows. Thats what, 140 years in the future?
The *idea* is that mining is supported entirely through transaction fees. Which makes sense, and actually as been seen in practice lately: a recent block actually had more BTC in fees than in block reward. This isn't really a good thing right now, but whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:44
Not right now you can't. Not with a mempool full with 130,000 unconfirmed transactions. I sent a ~$1.50 fee tx over a week ago and it hasn't confirmed. The mempool is literally at all time high. Don't tell people a low fee tx will confirm in a day. Fact of the matter is, my 50sat/byte TX (that would have been considered HIGH just a year ago), might never confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:09
Hey! Huge supporter here as well!
I sold off most of my position in BTC recently, and got to experience the $17 transactions first hand.
Not a big deal, I've divested, my coins eventually made it to the exchange.
I won't be selling my BCH. And that's because I want something to play with that gives me the feeling that BTC used to give me: Easy, friction-free transactions for little or no cost. I don't think BCH is going to "win" or anything like that, but it's a lot more FUN. So for hobbyist / experimental sake, that's what I'll keep around in my "play" wallet.

I couldn't begin to speculate. Google it - "stuck transaction electrum"
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:20:48


...This has nothing to do with miners. They don't set fees. While miners meddling in certain ways, like injecting bogus transactions to inflate the mempool is in theory possible, and in theory potentially profitable - as far as I know we have no proof of this. The high fees we're seeing are 100% the result of a 1MB block size and MUCH more demand than that can handle in a fee market
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:24:46
When we're limited to around 2000txs every ten minutes, and we have a 100,000tx backlog and new transactions coming in as fast as they are clearing, the fee market kicks in and you need to pay a higher fee if you want to move your coin around. Nobody WANTS to pay $20 a transaction. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:59:02
I never said entrapped. The bar for entrapment is so astronomically high that nobody is really ever entrapped anymore. Let me ask you this though. You do custom work, and someone comes to you and asks you to do $20,000 in custom work for them. Then after you've done the work, after your materials are consumed, after your workers have been paid - after you're waiting for that check to come in, the group that placed the order says they'll only pay you if you ship to *THIS* state. And if you don't deliver the goods then they wont pay.
I think the rule for entrapment is - would any average person be compelled to do the same in the same situation - and I would definitely argue yes.

You're right. But if you have an infinite funding pool then you're better off not playing, if only because there's no reason. Furthermore, assuming the game pay slightly less than 100% at 50-50 odds (as all games must), youre always more likely to lose everything before successfully doubling your initial bankroll. Martingale isn't a guaranteed win - its a guaranteed loss that just takes far longer.

Martingale is always ultimately a losing strategy (duh). Increasing the max bet or decreasing the initial bet (so that you get more doubles before bankruptcy) does nothing to decrease your chances of bankruptcy overall.
I wrote a bot a few years ago to martingale roulette for me. And of course, as expected and mathematically dictated, it would always eventually bankrupt itself. Regardless of starting bet.
Good luck though.

The feds called and attempted to order glass pieces (bongs) and have them shipped across state lines. Tommy Chong's shop said no. feds came in person and ordered thousands of dollars of custom pieces. The work was done, pieces were ready to be given to the buyer (the feds), and the feds refused to pay unless the shop shipped them (conveniently to a state where this could be prosecuted). After much badgering, the shop agreed and they were charged. They charged Tommy's son and his wife. He ended up taking a plea to keep them out of prison.
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:10:43
I wasnt saying "glass pieces" as a way of skirting that he was making bongs - "glass pieces" is just what the stuff is called around here - bongs, pipes, etc.
So lets say they didnt ship. Now they're out $20,000 (or whatever it was). Thats a lot of money that they'll NEVER get back. So what do they do? Close their doors? Lay off their workers? Take out loans and be more careful to avoid a trap next time?
And you also need to realize that this was a targeted hit job from the beginning. It wasn't "oh the feds busted a head shop in bumfuck nowhere and tommy chong happened to be working there harharhar" 
it was "the feds set up a situation where one of the two most subversive men of their era pay for their irreverence either by bleeding money and closing up shop, or going to prison"

This is a nice meme, but the BTC LOW on fork day (August 1st. 2017) was around $2600.

And yeah, to back up what others said: MTGox was insolvent at the end. There were no withdrawals into USD. If you couldn't withdraw into USD, your next best option was to (try to) move BTC out of gox, into another exchange. This made goxBTC much more valuable...."valuable"...heh

Depends on a thousand things that we don't know.
Here's what I see: Both parties have agreed to save money for a down payment of a house, and I imagine that she's keeping up her end of the bargain, and then you 'invest' yours in magical internet tokens.
That's not taking things seriously, that's taking severe financial risks with money that you'll need in the short term. I'd be pissed off too. You've both chosen to save money for a specific purpose and instead you're gambling.
Your call on what to do next, ultimatums are stupid. But yknow what else is stupid? Taking money that you'll need in the next ~6 months and putting it anywhere high risk. Bitcoin is super high risk. That's part of why we like it.

This is your source of value. this is why I haven't sold my BCH. Because BCH is hanging out at around 10% BTC's price, and I feel like it has roughly 10% chance of becoming the majority chain. The market price seems about right. So I'll hodl both.

I'm in favor of UASF, but the SECOND the chain splits, each coin will be valued less than BTC's former USD price * the market's expected outcome of the chain split. You won't be selling your BTC at 1:1. You'll probably initially see something like $700/coin on each chain, and as the days and weeks go on, the prices will stabilize with one chain's value approaching pre-split value, and the other approaching zero.

Nobody "owns" the algorithm - and it cannot be changed on the fly. I believe changes are possible, but need to be "adopted" by a majority of nodes on the network or they wont be accepted. What this effectively means is that if someone were to introduce a new client using new rules, and people didnt use it, then you'd have 'splintered' the network, with a small handful of people with this new, changed client unable to talk to the majority. Which is how it should be.
Bitcoin is fluctuating as people move in to invest in it due to volatility and recent news coverage. Bitcoin has an inherent value - nearly instant, nearly free, border-agnostic, pseudoanonymous transfers of funds. Nothing else can touch it. The market is just trying to work out a 'value' to place on it right now. This shall pass. But if you dont have a need for it that surpasses the current volatility, nobody would ever suggest you adopt it yet.
The recent price swings have shown that nobody is really hoarding. Profit is a huge motivator. Someone hoarding all BTC might be able to drive price up, but then getting out of that position becomes difficult without destabilizing the market. I Just cant see it - its not really economically viable and would take a MASSIVE amount of money. The market cap is something like $1 Billion, and as one started scooping up bitcoins that price is going to skyrocket.  so tldr - Some absurdly rich person could probably do this, but its an exercise in losing money so why bother?
Bitcoin is backed by one's faith in it and the ability to trade between BTC and other currencies relatively easily. But thats not why people use it. People use it for the reasons I outlined in question 2. That, and speculation recently.
The goal of bitcoin is to be exactly what it is - the digital equivalent of cash. Peer to peer, as transparent as you want it to be, nearly instant and (almost) no fees. I dont imagine it'll become a world currency. No time soon anyway. But it doesnt have to. It already has a niche, and that niche is growing.
It is difficult to get BTC right now. This will change in time. This is like saying, in 1991, "this internet thing is diffucult how could it ever take off when its so difficult to use" - the people who know what they're doing are doing fine with it. In time it'll become easier to use and trickle down to the point where the 'average joe' can get his feet wet without any research or time investment. In the mean time, hold tight. BTC is expanding at an AWESOME pace. Just because the nightly news has picked up on it doesn't mean its ready for or targeted at everybody yet.

Thats all fine and dandy,
and we can berate OP about shitty financial decisions after coinbase unfucks him out of $2K+

you can already buy mbtc.
I did months ago. Several thousand in fact.
I'll sell you some mbtc right now (with a small markup for the conversion, of course) ;)

Do you have a link to a description of your issue?
If nothing else, this makes me strongly consider reducing my exposure to them as a company. Thanks for the insight

probably because he'll never break even.
Even if the devices were paid for, and even if you could have them TODAY you'd only be able to run them partway into July 14 before you lost more in electricity than you gained in BTC.
My guess is that he was able to get a refund from them or refused them pending a lawsuit.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:40:04
OP has put nearly $40,000 up to defend his claim of security.
In my mind at least, he's proven himself pretty well.
Also, what the fuck other things do you have to do that are more important than getting a $40,000 reward by easily cracking this guys system?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:26:45
Right. If a user profile is unencrypted, then yes - you can inject a different hash to "Reset" the password to a pre-computed value, or to nothing. (In fact you can probably do this either way, but if you do it to an encrypted profile then you've lost all access to what lives inside it).
I'm also aware that you can snag the password hashes and either bruteforce them or use a lookup table to decode them, but at a certain level of password complexity either method is no longer effective.
Sounds like we're talking about the same method of entry. The good news is, if you encrypt your profile and use a reasonably complex password, you eliminate these attack vectors.
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:20:57
His point is no less correct just because it falls outside of your moral preferences.
I'm not sure anyone disagrees with you in spirit - Tax reform needs a good lookin' at. But bitcoin isn't the vehicle to do it - not yet. Do we REALLY want to be conflating this new entry into the untested realm of 'crypto currency' with money laundering and tax evasion? SERIOUSLY? Bitcoin can be a tool for positive social change - but its not ready yet.
Furthermore, his advice is spot on. if I had a ton of BTC I'd absolutely hire an accountant as well. Do you know why? Because I'd one day like to convert it back into USD. Your bank accounts aren't iron clad, your spending habits are nearly transparent, and its VERY hard to spend any reasonable amount of money without raising eyebrows - Getting an accountant, paying taxes, and cleaning that money is a necessity.
Yeah, damn the man and all that, but don't downvote Dageek simply because you've (probably erroneously) decided that he disagrees with your social stance.

Preventing their transfer isn't a requirement to destroy bitcoin - The minute they break out the "funds terrorism and drugs and you-know-what else" talk, and pass a bill, no sane American would openly trade them or admit to holding them. With that kind of a drop in interest, prices are going to fall through the floor.
They don't even have to make use or purchase of bitcoins a crime - The IRS just needs to pick one moderately sized individual and nail them to the wall with audits and money laundering nonsense. Even if this person can afford proper legal counsel and is able to scrape by without prison time or bankruptcy, the currency is going to have a pretty massive black eye for years to come.
Current prices are absolutely based around the hope that one day normal people use and trust the currency. Break that hope and the value disappears (except for those of us that absolutely NEED an anonymous currency - and I'd wager that's very few of us)

buyer receives paper wallet, buyer sweeps coins, buyer reports item as counterfeit or faulty, but he will gladly send it back to you for a replacement or refund.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:44:51
Perhaps you're right.
For some reason it just really, really gets under my skin when someone breaks even mining by relying on price increases - That's just faulty logic.
And I think something about calling it "making a living" really turns my stomach too. Wood working is 'making a living'. Construction is 'making a living'. Innovating is "making a living". Buying a pre-made piece of hardware and clicking "go" is not making a living.
I think i just need a cigarette.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:19:48
You're missing something critical here I think - 
At almost no point has mining been profitable. And what I mean by that is that sure, you could mine 50+ coins a month on a high end gaming rig a few years back, but those 50 coins were only slightly more valuable than the electricity required to mine them. Often times they were worth LESS.
It shouldn't matter if he purchased them (effectively) from the electric company, or if he purchased them from the exchanges. He put money into a long term, incredibly high risk investment with equally high upside. He happened to win.
Nothing stopped you from mining, and even less would have stopped you from spending $100 on a whole shit ton of coins. I'm sure he'd have sold them to you at a decent price.
You have no reason to resent your friend's success. Do you think he'd begrudge you if you'd have done it first?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:43:10
I would say absolutely.
Because regardless of what bitcoin rises (or falls) to, it would be substantially more profitable to buy bitcoin and hold them than it would be to attempt to mine them.
Especially if you're going ASIC - at least with GPU mining you could somewhat justify it by gaming with the hardware later.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:27:25
...no it isn't.
Its their business to store money and allow one to retrieve it later.
What the actual fuck?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:35:00
so much this. If I get a chance, I'm going to calculate his expected losses with each of those.
I hate to be this way, but this question is asked too much, the consensus is clear. If these people think they can hop in and make a return mining, well, maybe we should just let them.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:15:39


I'm glad you're of that opinion.
Shame those with the guns and cages aren't.
I cant speak for voluntarism as I'm not necessarily in that camp. My beliefs mostly align with your final paragraph. but we're so far removed from anything that remotely resembles that situation that I'll push for no government as hard as I can until we approach some semblance of small government.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:29:28
I'm sorry for your trouble, BUT:
For every 1 person who fights through the existing bank infrastructure or uses localbitcoins or get them some other way, there are 10 who say its 'too hard'
and to an extent this is pretty awesome. It means that if you've got the determination to make it happen now, you're going to be in a much better position when the barriers to entry drop and everyone else who didn't have the patience makes the switch.
keep at it. there are like 30 different, valid methods of acquiring BTC. and one of the easiest is just providing goods or services for it:
Check out the bitmarket subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:20:47
I see what you're getting at.
Thing is, if you avoid (at great expense and effort) all of the "benefits" of government, they'll still **shoot.you.in.the.fucking.head.** if you don't pay them.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:00:36
Its probably effectively about the same. Assuming there are no fees, no way for the bank to say "nah", no delays, and both parties aren't required to have an account at Chase.
And honestly that may be the case - And even if only SOME of those IFs are true, it'll be a pretty cool addition to the banking infrastructure.
The cool thing about bitcoin is the lack of a centralized middle-man. It truly is the electronic equivalent of him teleporting here and handing me a ten and a five.

Oh well. This is a gamble and I still fully believe that if government doesn't stop cryptocurrency, then BTCs will be worth a LOT of money. Which is why mine are going into cold storage.

the good news is, if you kept good records and did everything by the books and followed trading laws and day trading restrictions, then you will be paying lower income taxes for a very very long time. Although realistically you likely fucked that part of it up as well.
EDIT - actually you've lost enough that you will NEVER in your lifetime be able to write off those losses (capped at $3k annually IIRC)

That was a fantastic reply, fully understandable and I had no indication you weren't a native English speaker until the last sentence (hence the America-centric response above) - 
And I fully agree. Transfer can never be even remotely stopped. But that doesn't matter. because the 'good people' who attempt to follow the law (and there are a lot of them) will never get on board if bitcoin becomes illegal. - 
Lets say that I have a gift card to give you. It used to be worth $100 and you could spend it on anything in the world. But now you can only spend it on a few very particular things. Oh, and its highly illegal to possess it. Oh, and there are no legitimate ways to exchange it for cash. Oh, and government is looking VERY carefully into those using these gift cards. What would this card be worth to you? Keeping in mind that there are many people who have tens of thousands of these gift cards and are now trying to unload them on the market to save what precious little bit of their worth they can. What would you pay for one?
If you bought in at any price above maybe $1, you're going to lose a LOT of money.
I'm crossing my fingers, and I'm actually pretty hopeful about the future of bitcoin. but lets not discount the very real possibility that Government intervention breaks it.
Also, I agree- America is not the only state. But its a pretty big one, whose policies tend to influence other states. And losing the economic activity from their citizens would be a pretty nasty hit to other states' Bitcoin economies.

Ive never had the slightest problem with coinbase, but my last purchase was 6 months ago. My last sale was 2 weeks ago. both went smoothly.
Slow bank transfers don't count as a problem in my book - that's the banking industry for you. Buying bitcoin at market price some time in the future is a risky move, and if you got burned by it, then start asking yourself who was to blame.
They seem reliable and solid. I like them.
