Thanks for the replies and I was afraid that this was going to be the correct answer. 
However, we do want this to be updated by many people at once and it is common for hundreds or even thousand of agents to be working on thousands of customer issues. Shared write is a big deal. It is possible that there could be a dozen agents involved on one individual customer issue which is where the problems start.
When customers make multiple inquiries or requests speaking with multiple service agents, this is what does harm to the regular database costing money, lost time and frustrating customers.
I was thinking with the way the mempool works sorting 'double spends' would resolve those issues where one customer has multiple service agents working the customer's problem breaking processes in their zeal to resolve issues.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:35:00
The main goal of this is to introduce the blockchain to the organization I work for and it is true, we could probably just get a SHA256 hash of the existing database and then post proof of existance and call it good but having it on a blockchain/s would allow for further experiments.
Edit: The immediate goal may not be to replace existing database's but to compliment them with blockchain tech.

We want a blockchain for internal use only and we don't want any risk of leaking proprietary methods or customer information. Customers will have read only access to the private blockchain.
I'm basically proposing to keep our transactions in house and anchor to the public blockchain with Proof of Existence.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:49:18
Yes and no. Customer could make calls or write requests but they would be processedd by company agents and only a multisignature request could perform a write. That is, the customer can't write alone and an agent can't write without a customer's approval (unless they've elected agent as proxy).
But now we are talking about contracts and we don't want those exposed on the public blockchains at this time, maybe later.

Insert mixing wallets at every node. The mixers would exist as DAOs controlled by the users of the joint wallet.
On the network, nodes can be as small as any odd number. A node with a single user would not be able to mix or obfuscate their transactions however, when connecting to multiple nodes above they begin to gain privacy benefits and economic opportunities (tilepay.org).
The result being a lawful request for the identity owning data might work like this: a federal request would require the signature of the state, the county, the city, the town and the neighborhood. A privileged lawful request might not have to explain why or exactly who they are surveilling, as mixers could obfuscate their requests as well - but in the end, an evidence trail requiring multi-signatures from the bottom up could be unravelled through voting. 
This pushes lawful power down the the community level and supports lawful society from the bottom up and over time, transaction contracts would optimize and adapt to regional beliefs and law.
So in my opinion, perfect your AML. Carve a lawful path directly to the core of the blockchain - but keep it fair and equitable to the users or they'll simply abandon your contract.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:11:22
Could this be used as a front door for lawful surveillance?
Each (lawful) mixing service using something like coinjoin, mixing node upon mixing node - drilling down to the lowest mixing node requires signatures from each node penetrated by surveillance.
What good is lawful surveillance if a suspect knows they are being watched?
The lawful entities are a signature on each mixer - BUT - those signatures/agents are mostly dummies with no tracking abilities (empty payload - respecting privacy) - however, every once in a while those embedded lawful signatures are in fact spying - BUT - at some point, with a time chain their surveillance activities must be revealed because of the timechain contract.
Lawful entities may not like this as ALL of their blockchain surveillance would eventually be exposed, however, they could not track transactions effectively without it.
Users would gain privacy, knowing it is possible they could be surveilled, but at some point in the future, all surveillance would be exposed adding accountability.

Whose patent is this?
Edit: search was my friend: 
So one patent is from 1997 - 
The method includes two basic steps: exchanging a first set of communications between the first and second parties without participation of the trusted party to attempt completion of the transaction, and if the transaction is not completed using the first set of communications between the first and second parties, having the trusted party take action to complete the transaction.
From the pdf:
To keep CV unambiguously accountable for this
type of cheating, we propose to utilize the technology of US Patent 5,666,420, Simultaneous
Electronic Transactions, and foreign equivalents. In essence, this technology guarantees the
exchange a message for a receipt so that (a) the recipient of the message learns the message
simultaneously with (b) the sender getting a corresponding, very detailed, and digitally signed

One of the features would be that narrow groups would combine into ever larger groups, each with layers of accountability. I envision a network where pinpointing the originator of an individual transaction through lawful subpoena might require federal, state, county, city, and even neighborhood signatures, with each cosignature stamped onto a blockchain.

Multi-signature transactions, using the 'naming' features in bitcoin protocol might allow for added layers of consumer protections. Make us a government sponsored whitelist mixer for legal hidden transfers of large funds for example, earning trust with society.
If a company is required to know their customer, it does not mean that company should sell and share their customers data without cost. The blockchain protocol can be utilized through multi-signature to advise a customer of each and every share request.  Legal entities, accessing through subpoena are documented, time stamped and etched in tamperproof logs requiring multi-signatures for release and audit. (3 of 5, 5 of 9, etc.)
Bitcoin may allow consumers to own or track individual personal data. This is a powerful right and should be granted internationally starting 1 state at a time.
In my opinion, if I allow a someone to plant a tracking cookie on my computer I should be able to track who is then using this cookie through the blockchain, earning royalties even.
For the anti-regulation crowd, i would say accept that there will be bitcoin regulations and that from today forward we may all use one of the hidden coins, buyer beware. For me, government regulation just means that the blackmarket coins must survive and that good governments job would be to provide better services with bitcoin than 'underground coins' would supply - leading to better government.

Here's my point, I (taxman) come to you and tell you each and every day where you were by tracking your phone. I have your picture stopped at the red light. I have you filling up at the gas station. I have you driving through the bank. And that's just on the way to work.

I am impressed. Your objective is one I fully endorse. Your charts and analyses are excellent. Very well done. I congratulate you and applaud your continuing effort." In December 2000, Michael Hodges received a surprise package from Dr. Friedman, which included a copy of Dr. Friedman's recent book of memoirs, 'Two Lucky People,' where Dr. Friedman and his wife Rose made this endorsement: "For Michael Hodges, whose Grandfather Report is spreading the good word. With respect and admiration." Signed - Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman. (see 'A Tribute to Dr. Milton Friedman')

Sounds like there should be a customized wallet specifically for each tax zone. We don't get dollar for dollar on charity do we? It would be nice if the wallet locates every deduction on dollar per dollar basis and encourages you to spend in that direction. If bitcoin proves to be the most efficient means of collecting taxes ever, there should be many benefits to efficiency never before realized. Eliminating the fraud, maybe all of a sudden it makes sense to not collect tax on food, fuel and charity for example. Once bitcoin becomes the most reliable reporter of income, IRS suddenly dumps big business and wall street accounting for the new sweetheart, bitcoin.
Then it's bitcoin that calls the shots. That's world changing.

I want to use bitcoin protocol to enforce consumer protection and rights. If we are to be tracked, we should be tracked in a public block chain using the semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin to grant privacy.
Any 'pulls' of transaction identity should be accomplished through the blockchain and leave a trail - watching the watchers.
If a company places a tracking cookie on my computer I expect a satoshi, i should be able to track that cookie through another blockchain and witness it expire.
If my picture is stored in a red light cam database and my vehicle has been identified on some on-board tracking system, I want to know if that picture is accessed for reasons other than a traffic infraction.
Law and bitcoin is going to present some amazing considerations going forward. Those are just a few hairbrained arguments I've dreamed up but I think the main thing is to find out where consumer rights can be protected.
Jason Kolb's blog post was not a major headline but it did come out in the past three weeks and contains some of the best arguments for protecting bitcoin consumer rights:

I think borders will play a huge roll.
Basically, think of every bitcoin node - every exit or entrance as a point of knowing the customer because once someone is on the network, the trail can easily vanish. It's the entrance and exits. It's the community that hosts the server that provides an IP address.
In my house, I am the internet provider. If an entity comes to my front door asking information on a certain transaction I can choose to protect the privacy of my tenants, acting proxy but also accepting responsibility.
If I am in a town where my actions are deemed rights, the entity seeking my information never makes it to my front door. This is how bitcoin/governance will build communities, from the individual on up.
A community, in order to survive (access to the blockchain) will have to acquiesce to certain demands of the greater mob and I expect few communities will opt to protect despicable actions over access to the world.
Politics and bureaucracy is an inefficient middle man to building a stable society.

I believe the success of the internet of things and the blockchain go hand in hand. For me, I won't trust the internet of things unless each and every machine to machine interaction is tracked on a decentralized ledger. Feel so strongly about this I'll want to unplug from everything that is not documented on the block chain. If my car is talking to the highway I want to have access to that conversation. At every avenue where blockchain technology is attacked by entrenched business practice, the reply should be that of consumer rights - that is, consumers can track who is tracking them as a basic right.
There will need to be mixing services to protect private travel and this is where local government (acting as true civil servant) should strive to host nodes and act as mixing services with the vision that their responsibility is to protect and serve and stand proxy for all citizens within its lawful boundaries. Community building around the blockchain is the benefit that simply can't be valued in dollars.
Carving out roles and behaviors for blockchain servants, both government and private interests will provide a clear path to building the best network in my opinion.

Yes, THAT's an issue ;-&gt;
So, there will certainly need to be more than one blockchain. I don't expect their iOT devices to utilize the bitcoin blockchain and I expect they will set up their own blockchains that may work on proof of stake in my opinion.
With side-chains, perhaps I spin up my own personal chain for my residence, where all my outgoing iOT transactions exist and those who interact with me are on another larger chain, but are able to interact with my personal chain with my co-signature, etc. with perhaps a merchant or other entity as a trusted semi-decentralized server.
I tested AIcoin who are using distributed  proof of stake and their  transactions were faster than a credit card as an example of a solution.
Bottom line,  not just one blockchain but perhaps millions or billions of them.

I believe you will do well - regulatory guidance issued by NY will open the floodgates as public companies working with iOT and Big Data will be able to do more than just talk about blockchain technology. Bitcoin is basically 'all talk' right now, just a little 'action'.

Governments all over the world force themselves out of business all the time. All that has to happen is for bitcoin to pick up the pieces when new government forms. 
Departments are retired, merged, de-funded. Officials are elected and later removed from office. Blockchains may give governments competitive economic advantages over rivals and that's enough to bootstrap everything. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:34:08
My approach is more fatalistic than idealistic. I accept how things are, not that I approve and try to reason how blockchain might make them better.
Encryption is still viewed as a weapon by many governments and this type of compromise (consensus) may give technology limiting countries reasons to grant more freedom to their citizens while still having some controls in place.
Regardless, I believe that the release of lightning networks or rootstock or some other 'trusted node' solution pegged to the blockchain will answer much of my speculation.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:13:13
It's actually a prediction. Maybe someday it won't be thought of as surveillance but witnessing.
Certainly the world appears willing to protect something like a water supply from polluters. Plenty of upside to protecting critical shared resources and if blockchains make this process more efficient, governments will use it.
Blockchain can be used to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons:

I have spent some but I've also bought some back. Every one I spent was over 1 year old though, so that helps taxes. One thing for sure, when you buy something with bitcoin you tend to remember it as you compare the worth of what you bought with the price of bitcoin today. Perplexing!
@_date: 2017-01-15 16:52:02
It seems to me that the goal should be to make surveillance accountable.
This can be done with multisignature schemes and what I would call 'automated Freedom of Information Requests'.
This would involve actually working with governments in partnerships, where each and every time private data is revealed to regulators, the blockchain documents a chain of custody and eventually the person whose data has been 'sniffed' is advised of who looked at the data through automated contracts. Judicial signatures could have overrides to bridge the human / machine logic gaps.
Ultimately you can't stop surveillance but you can keep it accountable. Damages done to reputations by surveillance can be resolved through an insurance contract layer.
Ethics or dignity panels would have their own signatures and be part of transaction mixers as well. These panels would act much like Grand Juries and work to prevent surveillance abuses.
I'd like to think that the blockchain won't be a 'take-over' of government tasks, but rather a 'take-under' where the blockchain proves more accountable and ethical and a less costly method of regulation and law abiding behaviors.

Thank you. Most times when I post this idea it gets downvoted because everyone has to give something up.
With lightning networks, as I understand it, trusted nodes will exist with node owner reputations and pegged bitcoins at stake. 
It seems to me that the lightning network node that wins the most users will be the one that brings consensus to the most opponents.

Let's say the SEC wants to investigate insider trading. Proof of Existence is published stating that an official document containing subpoenas and wiretapping orders exists and that the document will be submitted for peer review and oversight in 90 days.
If upon review the committee of signatures agrees to allow the investigation and keeps the document sealed until some future date.
If there are no charges brought against the person investigated, then it is in the best interest of committees to respect rights and privacy of the investigated. People build reputations keeping secrets all the time.


This has nothing to do with what a person wants to do with their own data and property and everything to do with respecting personal data 'in the wild'.


It's not easy trying to personify computer code ;-&gt;

The other side of that is when an elected official leaves office, if accomplishments are recorded on the blockchain then history can't be tampered with. Perhaps this would motivate a different type of person to campaign to become a 'public servant'?
@_date: 2017-01-15 19:16:55
It's not so much a plan as a prediction about the final results when you bring opposing parties to the blockchain.
In a true compromise, all parties feel as if they have given something up. The trick will be retaining freedom while doing so.

It seems to me that all of my transfers out from Coinbase i considered taxable events. I sold one asset and often bought another.
All my trades have been after one year hold period. Some very small transactions as gifts or charity.
Do deposits of cryptocurrency have any consequences? Guessing no but that they will be reported by the exchange where I transferred out from.
I would like for the ability to have a separate accounting for daily purchases so that I could buy and sell bitcoins so quick there's no gain or loss - with the IRS understanding the transaction.
Ultimately, in my world robots are our future taxpayers and we need to make sure tax collectors get with the program asap.
The IRS looks favorably upon big business because it's an easy taxbase to collect from. All the work is done and risks are taken out for free by the markets.
Bitcoin must learn to have a fair deal with .gov.  Respect must be mutual, with 3rd party oversight by blockchain stakeholders watching the watchers. If a .gov action harms someone through surveillance, insurance built into contracts resolves claims programmatically. The more taxes bitcoin pays the more influence over government is granted to blockchain consensus mechanisms.
Time to pay the taxman ladies and gentleman! Let's show them what they should be made of.

Great video: Blockchains will ensure that government derives its power from the people. My view is that government is nothing more than a series of contracts with the people however those contracts are often corrupted, neglected or unenforced. They often outlive their use and add to wasteful layers of bureaucracy. My dream is that someday we won't be able to tell the difference between government and the blockchain.
I believe the blockchain can reinforce the delegation of democracy through election of representative officials as laid out by our nation's founders. Because the blockchain functions in real-time, the moment a representative begins to waiver from representing those who elected them, almost instantaneous blockchain voting would steer them back to representing their constituents or send them packing.
Moved my post under this one but I don't consider government contracted via the blockchain to be anarchy. In my opinion, taxation will become seemingly voluntary as citizens chose the blockchain that represents their communities interests. Household blockchains, homeowners association blockchains, community blockchains, county, state, federal and international.
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:58:02
Probably an exaggeration and maybe some fear on my part, but any established organization, such as Citibank who has developed internally 3 of their own blockchains all benefit from the trailblazing. I have no complaints about the politics of Patrick Byrne and Overstock but his equity trading platform with instant trade settlement might never have been created without the successes of the network - some of it driven by illegal activities.

It seems to me that if these devices act as nodes, perhaps they'll hold the stack (of microtransactions) so as not to flood all network nodes with those incomplete transactions until the wallet user has a need to cash in the wallet contents. At that time, one transaction is broadcast to the network and all the doublespends held on the stack of microtransactions never hit the network.
Seems like this can reduce spam?

Right, going back to the first post in this thread.

“No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the same controls. It’s not going to happen.” - Dimon
I think instead bitcoin will be used to define borders as community standards, regulations and ethics are pushed to the local network. For example - a self driving automobile knows that once it crosses over the state line it can now turn right on red after stop. As these little blockchain contracts (between governance and consumers) add up, there will be a point where we can hardly tell the difference between government and the blockchain.

Estimates of the underground economy in the Unites States have grown from five-hundred-billion dollars in 2008 to two-trillion dollars in 2013. Could blockchains bring this economy back 'into the fold'?
 est 500 Billion 'tax gap' 2008﻿  est. 2 Trillion 2013 
Could portions of government be automated and funded as side chains and thus might society benefit from governance as contracts with firm goals and life cycles?
Will taxation ultimately become voluntary through choice of blockchain enforced perhaps by community commerce regulation? Specific blockchain acceptance would strengthen local governance while federal blockchains would have to continuously bid for acceptance - in other words a shift of power from federal to local levels.

Thanks for the [s] warning! [/s] Edit. Posts are now standing, let's find out what it takes to win him over to bitcoin.
Here's what I posted:
You raise great points that apply to any currency except with bitcoin you can prove you are virtuous. The value of the 'underground economy' has been estimated between 500 Billion dollars in 2008 to 2 Trillion dollars in 2013 according to the most recent articles popping up on google search from my desktop. 
Why did the 'underground economy' bloom from 500 Billion dollars in 2008 to 2 Trillion dollars in 2013? What happened to cause the herd to flee risking severe penalty if caught fleeing? I would suggest that when those who were assumed to be virtuous were suddenly unmasked, money saw the risk of being jailed for tax evasion as lower than the risk of keeping money 'in the system'.
I would propose that a virtuous blockchain that reduces fraud allows people to lead more virtuous lives. I won't argue that bitcoin can be used for illicit transactions, so can a coin, so can a dollar bill - only one of those commerce vehicles is traceable on a time stamped tamper proof ledger.
So my prediction is that as bitcoin removes fraud from 'the system' the system will bring in those who've gone underground and that they would be happy to participate in a more virtuous tax collection system and more virtuous governance.
The benefits outweigh the risks.
I believe that blockchains will introduce true wealth to the world initially through eliminating fraud and waste to such an extent that it will literally Change the World. I'd further predict that an end result is the perception of tax collection becoming voluntary - as anyone not wanting to pay taxes can simply 'unplug' from the system - with a content and wealthy and charitable world happy to care for those who would unplug.  If robots and blockchains are to take over programmable tasks, we might find that simply caring for each other and celebrating life are new careers.
I am not against anything the author of this video says because it is exactly how I felt when I first learned of bitcoin being used as a currency and it took me till late 2012 to see it as something much more than just an underground currency so I give this video an upvote because I've been there.
