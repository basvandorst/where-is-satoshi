add to that the increase of the finance sector's share of the GDP in recent decades. 
And yet the rate of the "unbanked" is not improving proportionately. Shouldnt this be one of the top priorities of the finance sector?

says who? In the US for example, the federal reserve "prints money" by *buying* gov securities from "Primary Dealers" (most of the big name banks you could think of).
Since there are no public audits we as citizens (and even congress or any other oversight for that matter) cannot see these purchases- how much are they, what are the rates?
This creates so much fuckery because the federal reserve could theoretically *buy* a gov security for 99 quadrillion-trillion dollars. Yes, theoretically they will sell that gov security back to the primary dealer but for how much? This is an unacceptable imbalance to our currency.

or just be born to the correct family and inherent riches. No value-providing necessary! 
What about the people that the economy runs on? The ones working daily and spending the majority of their earnings?
What value do high-frequency trading firms provide to society? *Liquidity, thats it*?
