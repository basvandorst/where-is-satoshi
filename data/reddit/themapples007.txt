Man, I'm just not sure why people put so much trust in these types of services. And if you're going to use them, at least only put a small portion into them.

The fact that their political process worked well enough to jail the bankers and then compensate the Icelanders from the bank sale is pretty damn impressive within itself.
A lot more than we can say for the United States. Banks got bailed out. Main street did not. Banks paid back their debt. Main street lost their homes. Now banks in the US are already positioning themselves for the *next* bailout. Yet, you're implying that they should jail their politicians when their political system actually worked. 
Bravo Iceland!

If governments start holding BTC, the price will have a lot more zero's behind it. However, I'm not anticipating that happening anytime soon. You hear about Gold in the news pretty rarely, but Central banks are still more comfortable holding gold reserves than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:09:03
It's funny how this stuff works. My strategy now is buy and hold forever...as if it's a throw-away savings account...because if the price tanks to $0.02 for some reason then I just lost everything. However, I honestly think it'll go to $10K+ someday...as more people around the world realize it's potential. And the supply is so limited. But who knows?
Either way, I'm along for the ride and it's an awesome thing to be part of.

Ok, I'm not going to lie - I was bored by your conversation until I saw your references and "connecting the dots with bitcoin". I'm going to look into it if the readings are not to painful. Granted I studied Econ in college, but stuff that's too heavy or too abstract just loses me now. Cheers.

Everything in both points is related which leads to my overall point...everything has a cost, and the benefit must exceed the cost to justify the price one is willing to pay. Bitcoin is cheap (even at $700) because it's not very useful. It's not even necessary because most people can and do live without it. I get that it has uses, but those are rare cases - literally one in a million. Now, make it useful and necessary for an average person, and I bet bitcoin's value will skyrocket, which means it's price will rise and people will be willing to pay the higher cost.


I'm not sure what you mean by this, although I'd like to know.
Anyway, you will not buy a candybar for $100 just because "the unit of currency is irrelevant". Sure it's relevant because it's been made to be relevant by people/society/trust. Bitcoin is not relevant yet because it has low adoption. Saying "unit of currency doesn't matter" is like saying that "who you trust" doesn't matter. Everything matters...if it can be trusted, how many are in circulation, people perception, who has clout in the community, how usable it is, how accessible it is, etc. 
Once I start seeing real adoption - people demanding getting paid in Bitcoin, landlords demanding rent in Bitcoin, grocery stores demanding Bitcoin, etc - then I'll believe that the "benefit" is higher than the "cost" and the price will really start taking off. Until then, we're all just a bunch of nerds scratching eachothers backs hoping to see the price chart edge upward.
Let me know if I'm missing something :)
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:45:14
I have 1 bitcoin for sale for $100,000 for you. Is that a good price or is that too expensive?
In fairness, I know what you are saying and I appreciate your thought on the matter. My whole point is that while it's great to think theoretically, there are real limits. People cannot afford a $100,000 bitcoin just as much as they can't afford a $0.10 Satoshi right now - the economic benefit of such exchange does not exceed the value of the transaction...and nowhere near it. So when I hear people say "this could go to $100,000!" I think "not anytime soon" because Bitcoin doesn't have the infrastructure yet to justify it.
For example...an average mom in an average town can't get some Satoshi's from the Satoshi ATM within a few minutes, go buy groceries, take the kids out for ice cream, and buy gas (all with Satoshi's) and then work to earn Satoshi's and pay rent with Satoshi's.
Now, if we as humans could get to that point, then I'll back the idea of $100,000/Bitcoin anyday. But it's pretty undeserved right now. Bitcoing is hard to get, it's hard to know the price of things with it, it's hard to spend locally, it's hard to trust people when you pay with it, it's just hard all around to deal with. This all needs to be easy for people to adopt it and find it usable.
Right now a lot of it is based on speculation. If it went to $10,000, all these jackasses would sell...because they're not concerned with bitcoin or how usable it is, they're concerned with making money off of it. That is the exact reason why I still don't fully trust Bitcoin...I see little value being added to the real world.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:48:05
It's possible. I would be cool if my boss would pay 10% of my salary in BitCoin...slow steady side saving plan. Imagine if thousands of people did this, that would be a decent driver in BTC adopt-ability.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:49:11
I'm all about the fun ride, but let's not kid ourselves that someone would actually want to pay $100K for a Bitcoin anytime soon. A lot of infrastructure work needs to be done for that to happen. $10k - much more likely in the near future.
Edit: Thanks for the correction on missing the "anytime soon"...big difference!
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:42:52
Baby lions!
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:55:32
Sure, it's possible. But there's a couple issues with what you're saying. 
1. If the dollar collapses then a shitstorm of events will happen that will lead everyone to being more concerned about food, guns and gas vs Bitcoin. 


2. The fact is - nobody knows what is *more* or *less* likely to be valued if the economic collapse happens. We are in uncharted territory in history. Crypto currency has been around for what...15 years? Gold has been around for...oh right thousands. You think most wealthy people will hoard little computer chips that require electricity/networks over stacks of gold coins? Who knows. I'm just saying that your over-confidence is flattering but not realistic.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:02:57
I'm aware of that. The point still stands. Would someone pay $5,000 for a half of a bitcoin or $1000 for 1/10'th of a bitcoin? This is what we call fungibility and divisibility.
It's disappointing people are downvoting my comment - I get that we all want bitcoin's price to rise, but is everyone so blind that they're forgetting the reality that people actually need to pay a price for that *thing* to hold it's value? I'm not saying people wouldn't pay, I just can't see people dropping $100K for a bitcoin and the market stabilizing in that area. It's especially dangerous/speculative when Bitcoin isn't functional/accessible/adopted widely. It means people are gambling instead of getting economic value out of it.

@_date: 2016-06-13 00:41:51
I agree with this. Imagine people buying groceries with Satoshi's or entire skyscrapers being financed with a bunch of whole bitcoins. I can see that in the future. 
I can even see $10,000 per coin in the near future. But $100,000/bitcoin isn't happening anytime within our lifetime more than likely. People aren't going to throw down a house to buy a bitcoin. By the time they would throw down $100K (in maybe 100 years), inflation would have skyrocketed anyway and a true house would then be worth $10million. $100K would be pocket change by then.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:47:18
Big difference between $100 and $100k. Trust me, I'd love to see it go that high, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. Let's all just cool our jets. $10k is much more achievable, but the perception around Bitcoin will have to change quite a bit.
The cold hard fact is that someone needs to be willing and able to pay $10,000 for a Bitcoin for the price to be worth that much. I don't see anyone around willing to pay $1k yet, do you?
We're getting there but perceptions/economics needs to change quite a bit.
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:58:50
That and because if Bitcoin reaches $100,000/coin then other currencies will be so unstable that you wouldn't want them anyway. This is the same reason that "Commodity Money" exists - because people don't trust their government's currencies.

It's reverse engineering of data. I've seen the same concept used with businesses trying to figure out their competitions numbers.
You can learn a lot about a tech company just by learning which developers work there, which job postings the have online, how many users they claim to have, SERP ranking, inbound links, pricing, corporate formation, etc. Then compare those numbers to industry standards and other metrics and you get an idea. Certainly not exact, but broad numbers can be telling.
If 11Gb is the average, than I'd imagine the average US citizen would take up less than 1-2 GB of data and rest would be info on corporations, bank transactions, high profile people, security data, etc.

Less competition. Like some other forms of regulation, it raises the barriers to entry and forces economic costs onto New Yorkers that want to use Bitcoin. 
Although Bitcoin and fiat work differently, bitcoin is superior in some ways. It gives people an alternative method to transact business. For every dollar people save using Bitcoin, banks are losing that dollar from being left out of the deal. Now multiply that over $7Trillion dollars worth of transactions per year. 
If Bitcoin does well, they have A LOT to lose. People in power don't like things that undermine their financial position, which is what keeps them in power.

Any help here? This is how I'm viewing this:


Say I have 100 BTC in my users wallets. And say 1 BTC and its equal to the value of 1 Treasury Bond, or $1,000. 100 x $1000 = $100,000. Does this mean that if a Wallet Service holds $100,000 in Bitcoins for users, they would need to hold an equal $100,000 in Treasury bonds? Is that like having an extra $100,000 laying around in a bank account? Where do they expect that money come from? Or, does it mean that the Wallet Service provider would need to be 'bonded' and insured against loss?
Another question:
If treasury bonds (used as the backing in our example) drop 50% in value, does that mean this business will need to now purchase more bonds to ensure they have adequate coverage? Isn't this a huge counter-party risk to any licensed Wallet service?
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:16:07
Probably 0. How many cases of securities fraud (misappropriation/embezzlement) happen per year? The numbers are staggering. MtGox shut down and cost users approximately $450 Million. While painful, that's a drop in the bucket. People trusted one exchange too much (which really only strengthens my case). Securities fraud cases happen all year/every year and it's common for them to run &gt; $1Billion.
Counterparty risk is huge. All it takes is one bad policy, crooked employee, corrupt CFO or banker for your money to disappear. Too many people in the mix means more risk.
Here's some info I found:

Bitcoin is a solution, but not the only solution. Don't trust someone? Use cash. Trust someone and want to support the BTC movement? Use Bitcoin.
If you use cash, don't complain when a bank/paypal withholds your funds or interfering with your business somehow. If you use bitcoin don't complain that someone did an unfair deal with you...you should have protected yourself in the first place.
People get burned in both scenarios. It sucks but we learn and move on.
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:12:22
I think people are downvoting you because they don't see the inherent "protections" that law requires when using fiat. All it takes is a small number of PayPal (or any bank for that matter) users to file complains and then regulations get put into place. I think this is where Bitcoin shines. However, I think if Bitcoin goes truly mainstream more escrow-like services will need to be involved - this will essentially act as a bank, protecting both mainly buyers.

I think the smart people will, but probably 95% of the population won't even think about it after they get some fiat in their hands. I doubt it'll affect BTC much. This is one of the most frustrating parts of our financial system...people aren't interested in asking questions and seeking change, they just go through life without changing their behaviors.
The people like us who practice critical thinking and search for new solutions will be safeguarded against atrocities like this happening to us. The remaining 95% of sheople...well, they'll learn the much harder way, maybe from a frozen bank account, cut govt services, reduced pension payouts, etc. And even then, they may not learn. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:22:56
I agree. Some people think it's not fair. But a better way to look at it is this:
Do you prefer having your savings inflated/debased away for the rest of your life so you can never have anything of value, or would you rather have it happen once (the moment you get into bitcoin) where the market rate absorbs some of your savings?
I just got into bitcoin. Feels good. Quite frankly, I would have paid more to get into bitcoin, because the lifelong benefits are much more than fiat could ever offer...even WITH trust (which there is no trust in fiat). Even if Bitcoin loses 50% of it's value, I can rest assured knowing that my stake is my claim and nobody can inflate/debase that to nothingness.

I don't think it'll be a massive exodus. I think many people will realize that after saving fiat for 10 years they have essentially nothing to show for it. That's what happened to me...after going into debt and savings some money, 10 years later I my savings was essentially cancelled out. I had nothing to show for my hard work. Even from working two jobs, no children and no major financial responsibilities I ultimately had nothing to show for it.
Now I'm diversifying between tangibles, crypto and a minor amount of cash. Nobody can touch my "stored value". The banks can go fark themselves.

That's a cool observation, but you can understand why it looks like that. Assets gain/lose value in tandem with all currencies. BTC is one half of the ratio in your example, for all currencies. Generally it takes a long time for currencies to "disconnect" because currencies generally don't gain/lose value rapidly. This is because of arbitrage trading and central bank policy, which is sometimes why currency traders make bank. 
You can use this stuff to make money. Think about it. When the lines diverge rapidly, that is when a currency is gaining or losing value. That is an opportunity for making money.
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:42:23

100% agree. It's a matter of preparing and looking ahead. People that were smart were the early adopters. They get to benefit from making money on Bitcoin, but suffered high volatility. The rest who follow will benefit from having less volatility, but won't make the much money from it. 
This is the true story of any currency. The thing that makes it really interesting is that there is potential for infinite cryptos. This is good for the crypto environment because people will essentially flow to the ones with the best qualities.

The internet was already widely adopted by 1999. My family, and many others had computers around 1994/1995. Gaming consoles, like original Nintendo were already well past their prime.

Is this implying that they will make money by contributing to to bitcoin development? Or is it sarcastic because their contribution will secretly have the intention of damaging BTC?
Call me crazy, but Wall Street getting involved in BTC is a grave error. Sure, they can start their own cryptos, but nothing is better than the BTC gold standard. I'd love for them to prove me wrong.

I'm curious of this as well. I believe they're not truly trying to solve problems. If anything, they're trying to muddle the space, create diversion and possibly infiltrate bitcoin altogether. Sure maybe they're not doing this *yet*, but they know it would be foolish of them to make a direct attack...much better to ease their way in.
If they had their way, everyone would just forget about crypto and keep using the paper they control. They've had it good for soooo long, they probably can't accept things being any other way. With BTC, they can't use guns and force to take it down like they do in destabilizing the middle east for oil and shutting down alternatives like the Liberty Reserve. When the "little people" start getting ahead they pull a tantrum and the 2008 financial crisis happens. Not possible with Bitcoin.

Why can't we have both again? Money was never originally meant to be used as a tracking mechanism. Sure, it's always granted governments power, but it was primarily meant to control exchange, credit and inflation, it's only over the past 3-4 decades has it really become a powerful tracking/control mechanism.

Who are these thousands and thousands of middlemen you speak of? And how is it more expensive (and to whom)?

Would what do?
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:25:29
True, but then again...what's the difference between a forgetter that buys 25 bitcoins and never sells vs an investor that buys 25 bitcoins. All else held equal nothing.

lol, I'm not familiar with them nor do I want to be.

Wow, nice work. Your employer pays in BitCoins? That's an awesome story.
I agree, miner should be a class of it's own.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:02:58
Haha, interesting. I guess it depends on how you earned it. Like if you earn it by trading labor then you would be categorized as being "The User", but if you bought/sold your way up to the top then you would be "The Trader".
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:44:42
I wish I was more of a User. When I buy something, I never seem to remember that I have Bitcoin to actually buy something with. So I end up holding on to it. I don't Bitcoin good.

That's really cool. Do you find it a challenge to buy groceries and pay rent? The world would be a better place if we all followed your example.

TIL people still fax. He shoulda gone with 'kodak film' or 'typewriter' as his example.

I'm hoping. My only concern with this "big hedge fund" logic is that for them to get behind it means they have to accept that the dollar is not the best place to be. And yes, while it's not the place to be for us lower level peoples, the dollar system is exactly what makes these high financiers rich. They can never lose because they can print more $$$.
So expecting all the big players to get behind Bitcoin is like asking them to kill their golden goose because a more honest system is available. Trust me, if they wanted a more honest system it would already exist. What they really want is more money and power and the current system is working quite well for them in that regard. (It's days are surely numbered now though).
What we really need is for the working people (value creators) to buy bitcoins and dump dollars therefore eliminating the *middleman*. Then when they print more money nobody will give a shit because people will want Bitcoin, not their corrosive paper with funny ink markings on it.

Or put it up your butt. That's a lot to put up your butt though. Would need to ask a friend for a hand.

Me too man, I'll die before I sell my BTC. However, I might buy more to play with as it matures and is easier to use.

Everyone wants to *already* be in it after it receives a significant spike. Nobody wants to touch it when the price is low. Lol
Smart people quietly buy when the price is low, then forget about it until the headlines are blowing up again.

So if they don't think the dollar is the place to be, why aren't they conducting their transactions in Bitcoins instead of dollars? I'm not talking about the assets they're purchasing, I'm talking about the transaction vehicle. You think Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) would have been "bailed out" if they conducted business in Bitcoin? Not a chance.
LTCM is a great example too. Hedge Fund invested, got stuck, assets tanked in value, millionaires lost a ton of money, government bailed them out, taxpayers were pissed. With a Bitcoin financial system, this would have been impossible to happen. This is exactly why OTHER hedge funds would not be likely to get involved in Bitcoin...no bailouts are possible. It drastically increases their risk.
I'm hopeful too they'll jump into Bitcoin, but it just doesn't make sense at this point (except for possible experimentation purposes).
