This is why the miners would never fork without being certain that node operators would validate their blocks. With the current ideological split between node operators, that ain't gonna happen. It's a nice check and balance actually.

It's tough to decentralize the fiat-transmission part though. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:52:01
It's more accurate to say that the Core developers want to increase network capacity in a way that doesn't threaten decentralization. Increasing max_block_size without other considerations is a blunt change that invites DOS attacks and doesn't solve serious issues like transaction malleability.
 The Core developers have a solution for those problems that's ready right now (SegWit), PLUS it's a capacity increase that will allow for real block sizes of about 2MB.
So to say this:


Is misleading.
@_date: 2017-02-04 07:20:25
The interesting thing is that CoreFork would actually be considered Real Bitcoin by most exchanges and businesses. So the BU fork would be the altcoin, finding that nobody wants to buy their coins. I would imagine the miners would quickly return to CoreFork with their tails between their legs.

Imagine if some media companies wanted to somehow hop on the BitTorrent hype train back in the early 2000s. They call BitTorrent an interesting but ultimately silly and failed experiment, and that the *real* innovation is "file hashing technology". 
They then put a heavily promoted consortium together to build their own system based on File Hashing Technology without a clear goal or understanding of what made BitTorrent successful in the first place, diverting attention and capital away from further development of the actual innovation, BitTorrent.

I agree. Theymos has been consistent. His view makes a lot of sense given his ideals. He wants to keep Bitcoin free from populist attacks. And oh boy, have the attacks been coming. 
If the code project can be handed to a bunch of cowboys away from the core team - who happen to be disciplined, talented, intelligent, and committed to decentralization - then it is inevitable that Bitcoin's 21 million btc cap will eventually be raised. Theymos doesn't want that to happen, which is why he's being so draconian. Unfortunately, I think he hasn't taken into account the delicate politics of the situation, and so he's doing more damage than good.

I, for one, defer to people who know more than I do about deeply technical things. The "experts", if you will.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:00:01
Do you mean signalling? 25% is still a far cry from the (stupidly low) 75% threshold that BU requires. And it would be idiotic for miners to create large blocks, even if BU has 75% hashrate support, because the rest of the ecosystem runs Core!
 I believe that miners prefer to have their blocks accepted by the economic majority rather than tossed in the trash.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:32:29
BU isn't looking for consensus among users, just 60% of mining hashpower. It's the most hostile way possible to fork the network.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:48:53
Not a chance.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:34:33
Lightning works better with SegWit, but it could be done without it. What will the miners do then?

@_date: 2017-03-17 20:00:31
The exchanges were all given assurances by the Ethereum Foundation that the original chain wouldn't survive. The exchanges took their word for it
After the fork, the minority chain still survived because of significant remaining community support. Poloniex responded to that and listed it as ETC.
The reason the exchanges are taking this stance today is because of that experience. They know that the minority chain will survive, and they don't want to take the chance that the minority chain becomes the majority chain because of significant community support, which the Bitcoin original chain will surely have.

Agreed, the blocksize could be raised to 2MB. That's what Bitcoin Classic proposed,  and that's what SegWit does --- but with a safe soft fork instead of a hard fork.

@_date: 2017-03-21 20:51:20
The compromise was SegWit, which conceded a blocksize increase to 2MB but done as a safe hard fork.
 But then the big blockers shifted the goalposts to requiring a change of the consensus mechanism that puts the miners in charge of the block size. 
So compromise time is over. BU is withering, all we have to do is nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:48:23

The exchanges say that they will list an Unlimited fork (they will call it BTU) but it has to include replay protection. BU said they won't include relay protection, so if they don't get listed, blame the BU team.

@_date: 2017-03-15 03:09:15
We would be much more sympathetic to BU if it was consensus compatible with Core.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:11:32
SegWit is a capacity increase that is ready to go right now, but the China-BU faction refuses to signal for it. So clearly their motives have nothing to do with wanting Bitcoin to scale.

But BTU isn't BTC. So it's an altcoin. I think the chances of the exchanges handing the BTC ticker back to the BU team are near zero, so why discuss it?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:24:18
 &gt; the blocksize variable is still unchanged. 
But the block can still exceed 1MB, so it's an *actual* blocksize increase that just doesn't involve MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.

A subset of long-time Bitcoin Core developers decided to form a company so that they could get paid while focusing 100% of their time on development of the software. The company they created is called Blockstream.
Some paranoid conspiracy-minded types believe that Blockstream is actually driving Bitcoin development according to its self interest. These people ignore the fact that only one Blockstream developer has commit access to the Core Github project, and that they make up a small percentage of the 100+ Core developers who contribute to the open-source project.

Before you make a statement like this, you should explain for the group your understanding of the technical tradeoffs and risks that occur when raising the blocksize. And I don't mean with regards to just nodes.
Because when you write "even a run-of-the-mill desktop computer can handle way more than the 1mb current block size limit", a claim parroted and debated for years, it sure does sound like you have an extremely cursory understanding of the situation.
