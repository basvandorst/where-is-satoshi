Panic selling was a lesson I learn for myself. Not all lessons in life are free.

F Casa. Here is a plug and play node. Simple, right? Wrong! We are going to make it super complicated with our subscriptions. No one wants more yearly subscriptions!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your not late. In the grand scheme of things you very early.

Haha. Just remember it's a long term investment not a get rich scheme. Price today doesn't matter price in 10 years matters.

Don't these come with a yearly subscription of $300 a year or you don't get software updates? I was going to buy the 1st one but after I saw that I thought it was a ripoff.

Same in the US.

Really? I have found him to make a ton of great points and really good education information. Can you point me to what you are referring to.

It was good until the commercial popped up in the middle. Not sure if that's you or YouTube buts it's a no for me.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:42:17
I liked it until the ad. It's one thing to have one at the beginning but in the middle F that. Like I said idk if that was YouTubes choice or yours but I won't watch it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:36:33
Finishing it.

I did not really understand what a seed is. Found some stuff on it and it's starting to make sense! Thanks.

Isn't the easy answer seeds with basic instructions in a safety deposit box? Once you die the bank will find your heirs.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:18:15
Isn't the risk just as high with physical storage? It's pretty easy to lose it, have the data corrupted, and or destroyed in a house fire or something.......

Any good articles about doing this you could point me too? Wouldn't this mean every time I move my crypto from coin base I would need to create two new copies and then put them at those separate places? Don't you think the more times you access these trusted and separate places they themselves become more vulnerable?
Do a lot of people use safety deposit box to store these? I would imagine they have the same type of issues you seen in an Exchange.
