AH THATS THE ONLY THING THAT SCARES ME , but I heard if you take the file and move it on to a new computer that’s not on the internet and virus free,  then encrypt it. You should be safe ,   I just wanna buy a fair amount and hodl I’m 16 with lots of money and I don’t need to spend it, figured a paper is my safest / cheapest option

They would need to have wallets and you would buy it send send it to their wallet, 
You can buy the total amount you would like to give to your family members right now. And for Xmas( or whatever,  sooner the better)open a wallet with them each and send your coins to them. 
They would definitely want to read about how everything works too and make sure they don’t lose their coins.    Could be very easy for them to mess up.

Best off reporting the 80k losing 25 % and buying on an exchange just sounds like less of a hassle.

The way it’s been growing and adopting I don’t see a crash , just dips of a few thousand here and there but always going back up, people believe in the system and that’s key. At this rate I don’t see anyone’s belief disappearing. If anything the belief is growing. And so will the value.
