It is semantics, it is the same as saying "a bank robbery" did they really walk away with a bank under their arm?
And it is a 'bitcoin robbery' or 'hack', a hack is a hack it does not matter if it was a protocol hack, or a btc protocol hack, or a social engineered hack, a weakness in the 'bitcoin system' was compromised and bitcoin were stolen. 
It is a bitcoin hack unless you are willing to narrow your definition so far as it is meaningless to use that term at all.

You guys who are affected by this issue need to inform whatever law enforcement agencies you think are responsible for your and Bitfinex's operations.
It is not up to Binfinex to pick who or who not to get involved, particularly considering they could very well be the people who are investigated, the police are the first people you always contact, and the police are the ones who will get other agencies involved as required.
Don't just think 'some other guy will do it', you have to do it yourself, the longer you delay the worse it will get. 
Don't ask for answers, ask questions.
It is your money stolen, you have a right to know what is being done to address that theft and by who.

An analyst from some finance department worked it all out and presented it to the people who could do something about it, but they ignored it. 
You should watch the congress hearing (or whatever it was) where they were saying that this guy, "gave them a flashlight and led them to this steaming pile of dog shit, and they still could not work it out".
But all Ponzi schemes fail because they 'run out of money' that is the whole point of the Ponzi, you fake trades and hope not too many people want to cash out, and that something bad does not spark a withdrawal craze, which is exactly what happened to Madoff.
The person who found out about it before did so by looking at the returns and operations, and working out it was simply impossible..

There is simply no cost/benefit gains to be had by having computer processing power in space, solar panels are not 'super efficient' in space, so you don't get that much more power than one on earth, so for a lot of power consumption you still need a large array.
Cooling is a huge problem, space is NOT 'very cold' space is nothing to have a temperature, but if something generates heat (such as a computer) it is very difficult to remove that heat, you have to rely on thermal radiation to remove heat, as opposed to conduction and convection in an atmosphere.
Communication: The radio spectrum is limited (for communications to space), and busy, it requires more energy to communicate information via radio than it does via optical fibre or wire, it also generates more heat (the above problem). 
So your right, there is no real advantage of it but many disadvantages.

It is the perception that matter, not reality. Also one persons evil is another persons hero, just look at the Ross thing.

"trustless' is just far too expensive, and it simply adds far too much overheads, the real world works because a basic level of trust, not everyone is worthy of that trust, but that does not mean you should assume **no one** is worthy of it, you just deal with the outliers as they occur.
Trustless is the assumption of guild until proven innocent, that is a very expensive overhead to take on.
Systems don't need to be trustless, and bitcoin is not really trustless anyway, it is just you have to go to great lengths to establish trust for each and every transaction. 
It is a deeply inefficient system, and no matter what you do (except trust like LN's) wont fix it.

It is about Moore's law and [Dennard scaling](
Which basically states, that the lower limit in size has been reached, and any smaller does not improve performance or speed, but in fact creates more problems and in efficiencies. 
So you are actually beyond the efficient physical limitation of IC substrate dimensions.


So you get smaller, you energy cost start to go up, and heat and efficiency.

You actually have it the wrong way around, when lots of people are interested in a company, its price soars. It is the interest that drives the price, not the price driving the interest.

The point he is making is that Bitcoin does not use encryption as such, it just uses cryptography, and they are not the same thing. 
Encryption uses cryptography, but that does not mean that everything that uses cryptography is therefore encryption.
Bitcoin uses cryptography to sign keys and in solving hashing problems for PoW mining, but it does not use cryptography to encrypt things. You could not really repurpose what bitcoin does with cryptography as a method of encryption.

It could easily be much more subtle than that, I could even be that the price stays at one value, but if no one buys and no one sells it is effectively dead.
Also the 'network' could simply fail, someone could force a change a folk, or just break the system (considering recent arguments that is a very real possibility).
So they could have a price, but have no value, or you could just log on one day and there could be no bitcoin network anymore.
It is a highly fragile system, that is only just working now, it has been proven it is super easy to 'break'.

they can't compete because of the difference in technology, same with bitcoin, I cannot compete because it cannot compete, not because someone says they cannot compete. (see the difference).
So even with no (zero) regulation Bitcoin cant compete, and Erik is not protesting, he is going running away to somewhere else.
Hardly what I would call a protest, and hardly an action that is going to bother the regulators even a tiny bit.

you might really, really want it to grow, but saying "it must" is not really true, it is very possible that it will not. 
Bitcoin is now trying to compete with itself, its real problem is it able to compete with fiat?
It is not about a competition between LN's and bitcoin, or bitcoin developers, its about its overall and long term viability.

what bitcoin does not have that all fiats do have is an economy, neither fiat or bitcoins can be considered a value without the function of an economy.
It's the US economy, that gives the USD it's agreed value.
All currency is, is a common agreement of value, bitcoins don't have that agreement, that is why bitcoins are valued in fiat.
Bitcoins cannot function without an economy, it therefore tacks onto other economies, and as a result it has to function and comply with that economy.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:42:27
I think economics can be modelled as electrical circuits, and cash flow (which is really economics).
you could for example certainly equate value to voltage, and velocity/volume to current, the therefore power to actually overall quantities. such as 1000 trades (amps) of 1000 (Volts) BTC and 1 hour would be high power (1000x1000).
A capacitor stores charge or passes voltage as a function of the 'rate of change' of voltage, capacitors don't pass DC.

there is a big difference between 'understanding' and 'knowledge of' or a 'working understanding/knowledge'.
Science does not yet understand gravity, although they know it's effects and can do incredible science and engineering with the force of Gravity, they don't understand it, they don't know where it comes from, or where it goes, what it is, or why it is so very weak compared to the other fundamental forces (EM, Strong/weak nuclear).
It's easy to say "people need to understand money" they do, they have a working understanding of it, everyone does. 
You know what money can and does do, you have that level of understanding, a working knowledge, you know you can provide a services and ask for money for that service (a business), or you can pay for a service (or product), you know the value of your money, even if that is in terms of how many hours you need to work to earn it. (or how much product you need to sell), you know you suppliers require it, and if you are a supplier you know you require it too.
That is a working understanding of basic economics and 'money'.
You don't have to hypnotise about money, "it is what it does", and we all know what it does.
Bitcoins are the same, 'it is what it does", it's just what it does is not so clear.

There is not an organised or concentrated effort to attack all things bitcoin, there IS however a large number of people who are clearly turned off Bitcoin by the hype, conduct and politics and libbo's that pollute bitcoin for their own ends.
I am 'mainstream' and was interested in bitcoin, but when someone looks at it, it's just a 'bad scene'. 
Nothing in it installs confidence or trust.
The result of that is it puts people off, when I see a bitcoin logo I have a reaction, (not a good reaction either).
This is THE reason why people are turning off bitcoin, because bitcoiners are putting people off.
Nothing you can do about it, and if you comment that it has happened to you, (like this OP), they are themselves attacked and vilified (as I will be too for posting this).

Except of course for the people who understand what bitcoin is, they somehow get an insight as to what money is.
EVERYONE (even bitcoiners) understands money, they might not know everything about it, but they know what it does and what it is good for.
Money, what it is, is what it does.
After all money (fiat), is simply an accepted agreement of value or worth. 
All that is necessary is to understand that, and you understand the utility of fiat, it's uses and its benefits and it flaws.
Economic understanding is what it important, money is nothing without an economy. And if you don't understand that fact, that's a problem.
Another problem is bitcoins don't have an 'economy', it has to 'tack onto' other economies to function.
But to say people don't understand money, is a bit crazy IMHO.
Maybe you just don't understand people ?
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:15:01
but there is no bitcoin economy, a currency is not an economy, slithering argument or not, it's reality.

And with great company too, 'a gum wrapper' and 'a spy camera'

@_date: 2014-12-09 12:23:09
That is one of the major flaws with bitcoins, it's supporters don't seem to understand the simplest concepts, fiat does not lose is value exponentially, fiat's 'value' is surprisingly consistent, if anything it has gained value it real terms. 
This "fiat has lost 90% of it's value" is also not correct, that is from what the USD was detached from gold, and at the time (1971) gold was worth $35 per ounce, now gold is worth $1000+ an ounce, so IF the USD was still tied to gold (IT IS NOT) then in terms of it's purchasing power for an ounce of gold is has decreased.
But in terms of buying a computer, car, house, farm or food, as a ration of time spent working for purchasing price, fiat has increased in value.
Inflation is a good thing, it means there is more money, and if you have a loan you pay less in real terms over the duration of the loan (assuming fixed interest rates).
Bitcoin is highly inflationary at present, there are more and more of them, and their purchasing power is decreasing (you need more of them to buy things). 
In economic terms if bitcoins were an economy it is in a deep recession or depression. 
Two quarters of negative growth is the set point for a depression. 
This is a very interesting time, exactly 1 year ago, you BTC was 'worth' $1000, (on the 10th of Dec) on the 18th Dec it was worth just over $500 dollars, in 8 days it halved in price.
That is severe inflation, (if it was an economy).

Assuming they do not decide that he will spend so long in prison it is not worth it.

The article reads just as you would expect it would, as a lawyers take on subject well outside her skill set, who would have ever expected a lawyer to tell you 'more talk' is what is needed, it's too simplistic to state 'Regulators ask the 'how?'" question. and Law enforcement ask "who" and "what".
It's not really how it work.
Regulators regulate based on the laws as set out by the Government, and use law enforcement if necessary.
The other classic misconception is that evolution has a direction, and is a continuous advancement.
Evolution has no direction, evolution does not mean "always better than before", humans have evolved large brains, but they are slow, not strong, don't see or smell well, and have lost a lot of abilities.
Evolution is a trade off, it's not really survival of the fittest, it is survival of the most fit.
Is it 'decentralized' or "Ad Hoc" ?
It seems Bitcoins have to comply and 'best fit' into each and every market and economy, this I think negates the decentralized argument somewhat.
Everywhere that bitcoin "is" is an Ad Hoc arrangement with your country, it's law/rules and regulations.
So it is decentralized or Ad Hoc ? At least I agree with the claim it is not a revolution.
She also talks about the GFC, and it's causes, the 'regulations' that drove the GFC was the lowering of US interest rates, this led to excessive 'bad' loans that fell apart when US housing prices fell. (houses NEVER lose value).
That was because the US president wanted re-election and lowers rates (against advice from top economists).
Not the banks for the regulators, but the politicians (US pollies, Bush).
With evolution to survive as the 'most fit' you have to be the 'most fit' for the purpose, for your niche. Is Bitcoins the 'most fit' for the currency of an economy?

it is not unproven it is information that was provided to the court as part of the information (that the court found to be true) that he was DPR, the evidence submitted (including the murder for hire) was accepted and was enough to make a conviction that he was DPR.
The charge was that he was DPR, the court on that evidence agreed and found him to be DPR. 
If the charge was for the Murders, that same evidence is sufficient to convict him for murder.
The evidence that he hired murder, does not prove he ran SR, but it might well prove he hired murderers.

No it is not the evidence, it is the conviction that needs a standard of proof.
And in sentencing, it is an even lower standard of proof, that it is only something to 'take into consideration', he is not being charged for the murders here, so there is no onus of proof, but that information as submitted as evidence, will be 'considers' as factors for sentencing.
Just the same as was he willing to help authorities and assist, did he plead guilty, does he show remorse? all these things will be factored in.
Everything he will be sentenced on has already been proven to the satisfaction of the court, not what is he like, and what are the chances he is sorry, and will not do it again if he could.
They will consider those things, and he will spend the rest of his life in prison.

I don't think you have to 'understand' most things to use those things effectively, you don't have to understand Global economics to use fiat, or money.
Things are "what they do". Fait (money) explains itself all the time, people understand what fait is, you don't have to know everything possible.
It's a common argument with bitcoiners that 'people don't understand the tech" or "don't understand bitcoins".
You should not need to, and if they do, who's fault is that?
Entrepreneurs do not really need to be highly skilled and educated economists, you don't need a degree in economics to run a coffee shop. 
You don't need that level of understanding, you just need to follow the rules, but a deep economics knowledge is not going to make your coffee shop sell more coffee's.

If you can buy off one exchange a BTC and sell it on another for $300 more, you create $300 out of thin air. This is what was happening with Gox and the other exchanges at the time.
You cannot really make USD's out of thin air, so it is impossible to sustain this split.

In the bitcoin world if you have/own the private key, you have/own the money in the wallet that the key unlocks.
That is the beauty (if you want to call it that) of bitcoin, if two people have/own that key they both own it.
It is not theft if you own the key, particularly if you believe in the "ruled by math' concept, by that rule if you own the priv key you own the stash that key associates too.
And if you derive the key, (no matter how, even making it  up yourself) that is not theft of anything. Having a key to a door does not make you guilty of opening the door and taking the contents, and it does not make it a crime to open that door and take the contents.
Having the key in Bitcoin's world means you have full legal access to what that key protects.
If you want to be ruled by math, you need to obey those rules.

You want to tell your friend a secret, (that you don't want anyone else to know), so your friend sends you a lockable box (that is unlocked), he sends the box but not the key to the box.
You put your secret in that box and lock it, you then send that now locked box back to your friend. He has the key to that box so he can open it and read your secret. The design of the lockable box is such that even if it is sent to you unlocked you cannot work out what the key is to unlock it. All you can do is lock it (after you put your message in it). 
That is public key cryptography.

you are right, he did not use "just a" but in the title he refers to him as a 'controversial speaker'.
And the comment statement was:




So why would that do more harm than good? and harm and good for whom?
Sure it might do more harm than good for Garza, letting him speak will do more harm than good to the community. 
It might also do more harm that good to his wallet.
But you can read it however you wish, I am just an impartial observer, I don't profit or gain in any way if he talks or not.

I'm sorry but I just can't leave that alone. Here are some of your quotes:
"But like any auto-immune reaction, however, it can get out of control. Even if Garza is actually a witch, let's not allow ourselves to engage in witch hunts. Let's not act like an angry mob."
So the people who have made this fact know, and posted all the details, screen shots, and honest research are just 'an angry mob'.
Tell us, what should they have done ? Nothing ?
1) they are 'an angry mob'.
"Are we so gullible that we're worried his silky words will convince us all to dump our BTC for sparkling Paycoins? "
You mean "we YOU so gullible", so now add
2) Gullible angry mob


**"But whatever damage he does to the people who follow him without rational scepticism, let's not make that damage worse by destroying an important industry event."**
So if Garza is not allowed to talk it will **destroy** an industry event!!!
And you don't care that people have been damaged, just you don't want damage to your 'important event' !!


3) Gullible angry mob of adolescent witch-hunters
No wonder people reading your post ask themselves who's side are you on.
It appears, your for 'industry conference' at all costs.
What will damage the bitcoin industry is if people see things like this, and talk about it, and they are called a **Gullible angry mob of adolescent witch-hunters**. And the "names" are the people doing the name calling, it kind of makes you wonder.


Looks to me you are standing up for him, 'one crappy speaker' will 'destroy' an industry conference.
That must be a good enough reason to let him talk, and forget the mass of evidence that he is a CON ARTIST.
and why are you even here ?, Cat got Garza's tongue?
Bitcoin can go two ways here, it can show it's maturity and willingness to self regulate, or it can bow to the "Names" and the "central authority".

YES, of course they will, that's why he's doing it, now we have to ask why are you supporting him?
If you think no one will listen to him and invest, why do you want to allow him to talk?
If he is a sociopath (and it appears that he clearly is), he will be able to ignore the questions and provide answers that promote his con.
Have you honestly never seen a politician interviewed ?
They have a message they have worked out before hand, and they deliver that message regardless of the questions asked.
Why does this con man need sock puppets like you and evoores to cover his ass? 
Where is he ?
I have to applaud all the bitcoins who have done their homework and exposed this so well and clearly, from an outsiders perspective that is very heartening.
Not so much the "names" of the bitcoin community that are coming out of the wood work (like grubs) to offer 'support' for him.
From the outside, and I have looked at the web pages, and the youtube comments, and the page hacks, and the history.
I had some hope that Bitcoin had grown up and was able to self regulate, but the likes of you just instantly turn me off again.

wow, almost word for word of lots of stories that came out of the Madoff Ponzi, investors were making money and high profits, they were not really sure why (some magic black box), but because they were told they were making profits they did not bother to ask too many questions.
They did not worry that their returns were printed on 20+ year old dot matrix printers, or that they could not get 'live updates', "but that was the way Burnie wanted it".
Of course you will turn a profit if you get out of a Ponzi before it blows up, but your payout is at the cost of other investors.
If too many people pull out, the Ponzi is exposed.
There is an excellent documentary that analyses the Ponzi that was Madoff, and how he conducted the 'long con'.. 
Sadly, these schemes work on two principles.
1) (some, enough) people are stupid.
2) (some, enough) people are greedy.

I have never met an engineer that was infallible or never made a wrong assumption or was simply wrong about something. 
Assuming Satoshi is some inerrant deity is a mistake I think, the fact is bitcoin can go no where near the capacity of the real players in the field, and looking at the huge problems with agreement for modifications in the space, it may never achieve that goal.
As for not comparing it with VISA, why stop now?? People here have always compared it to VISA and the banks, you set the goal posts (the standards), VISA, or WU or whatever if you want to take them over you at least needs to be able to technically compete with them.

All for one purpose, for I guess his own personal gain.
But it did have the bonus effect of drawing attention to Evoorhees and his activities as well.
For me that does make things much more clearer.

A 'Killer App' is a


the spreadsheet was a killer app (live VisiCalc), as is the word processor, also email clients like Outlook and 'the browser' are all 'killer apps'.
Generally they are things that make things useful for the average person.
Generally it is something that separates the complex technology from utility. That is it makes complex things simple and easy and effective to use.
The technology that is behind bitcoin is difficult for the average person to understand, or even want to understand, just as the technology behind email or the internet is too complex and difficult for the average person to understand or even care about.
That is why there are killer apps that separate that complexity, and convert that into something the average person can use and gain value from. 
bitcoin needs to invent the 'Outlook' email client or web browser equivalent for bitcoin that makes it usable and accessible for 'normal' (non-white paper readers).
OpenBazaar does not qualify, nor does a new wallet qualify. 
Outlook is a killer app, email is not. Browsers are killer apps, HTTP is not. The GPS receiver is a killer app, GPS satellites are not. 
So if you consider bitcoin to be up there with TCP/IP, or the email protocols, or the GPS system. Then the killer app is something that takes that technology and makes it easily and reliability useful for the average person, to the point where they will use it in preference to something else.
Even fait has its own forms of killer apps things that are **'virtually indispensable or much superior** to rival products with credit, debit, and cards and banks.

for one, it was not 'very large sum of money' and for like forever, **everyone** knows that you can have your account credited before the cheque is cleared, and they equally know that it is not available to you until it is cleared. 
Most people who deal with that kind of thing understand this, and they wait until the check is cleared if you do not trust the person sending you money.
It has always been your responsibility to know and understand this, it is a basic principle of business. 
It also goes to know your customer, did Alex do his due diligence? and if not why did he send off his coins?
But it is not the banks job to question every transaction you make, and getting deposits is not considered 'atypical' transactions. 
Unusual withdrawals are, but not deposits, very few frauds are started by a deposit.
Alex was conned, and not by any bank, he was sloppy with his business practices, so its his fault.
But he is very within his right to take TD to court, but the court will not want to deal with it, they might even ask why he is not going after "Richard", and why he does not have Richards details?
He could be in more trouble if it is found he is a money vendor and did not apply KYC !!!! (He should take that into consideration before bringing in the law).

You know what you are saying (and correctly) is that there is now at least two central authorities and there is now a democratic decision to be made as to which party should be elected and which should not.
Is this what was intended for bitcoin when it was conceived? I was under the impression that decentralization was the primary goal, not being attached to any one authority or other, but rather a meritocracy. 
One of the primary selling points of bitcoin was that the users of it were the ones who decided what was the longest chain and how the system operates. 
From an outsiders view all this is exactly like any other political shit fight, with the same old tactics.
If this system cannot cope with a small change, how is it going to handle a real problem?

Difficulty and responsibility are not the same things, responsibility does not make something any more or less 'harder'.
It would be like saying driving is too hard for people because to be able to drive a car you need to understand exactly how the internal combustion engine works. Where in reality all you need to know if you press that lever you go faster, and if you press that other lever you go slower, or stop. 
The majority of people do not care about the technicalities behind bitcoin, and they never will. But that should not stop the majority of people being willing to use it. 
The majority of people don't care about how email works, they just want to be able to use it, not understand it.
Same for GPS, same for your toaster. Most people don't care about toasters, but that does not mean they don't like toast!
I don't care how the CPU in my computer works, I just accept that it does work and it is easy to use.
Most successful technologies are hard to understand but easy to use, people don't care if they don't need to care, I don't care about banks, or visa or WU or bitcoin, but I do care about using those things if I need to. 
That is the mistake you are making, you think you have to educate and convert hearts and minds, you don't. You just have to make something that is useful and easy/fast/secure/effective.
If you can do that you can become huge with no one 'caring' about it at all. 
That is the big problems with the state of bitcoin, the community thinks that the technology should seduce the people, but people don't care about technology they care about utility.
email or the internet is great technology but it is not huge because it is a great technology, it is huge because it has great utility. People love to utilise it but they hate to have to understand it.
But time waits for no one, and time is marching on in the bitcoin world, 7 years is a long time, plenty-o-time to refine the technology and to design utility into the system. 
Seems everyone is looking for the 'bitcoin killer app' and it is staring you in the face.
The **bitcoin killer app** is the 'Outlook' for email, or the browser for the internet, or the interface for the GPS. 
It is a technology that removes the technicalities without removing the utility. Come up with the 'Outlook' for bitcoin and you would be surprised with the positive response. 
This would be far more effective than trying to educate the entire planet in computer science and macroeconomics. 
You must go to them, on there terms and not expect them to come to you, on your terms.

The OP here does not seem to understand the A Blockchain is.
If as you say "It is just like another server" for a start servers are quite useful, and popular. There is nothing in this world that says a blockchain has to be tied to a bitcoin. 
What you are still thinking is Mike has a plan (for bitcoin), he left that world (and the toxicity it has) and got another job.
I think it is a mistake to believe a data structure (blockchain) has to be tied to the data (bitcoin).

I don't understand that reasoning!, so if someone steals gold it makes gold more desirable? 
We know gold is desirable, as is money and we know people want to steal it, but that does not mean if someone steal money it makes money better. The same applies to Bitcoin, it just means the people using it have not taken the appropriate measures to eliminate that harm.

A 'hack' is a hack, regardless of the actual mechanism, be it social engineering, inside job or by technical means. They are all hacks. (a hack is a manipulation of a system different to what that system was intended to do). 
So fitting a turbo on a car (non-standard) is a 'hack', tricking someone to get access is a hack. 
If an inside job or security flaw is allowed, it means the system (protocol) is flawed to allow that to happen. 
That type of 'inside job' would not be possible for example in a bank that has systems to ensure no one person has that kind of access, so an inside job is just as much of a security breach and hack as someone finding an open port and breaking into your computer.

This is easy, **write and design the bitcoin killer application**. 
WEB sites were nothing without a good browser, email is nothing without a good email client. 
But with these killer apps they became huge, bitcoin needs the same thing.
Something that makes using bitcoin as easy as sending mail, or browsing a web page.
A developer should be able to isolate the technicalities from the human, because if the average human is required to know those technicalities in order to use it, he/she simply will not use it. 
That is the state that bitcoin is in now, and until that is resolved it will remain in that state. 
You need something simple, intuitive, familiar, logical and sensible. 
Email is a complex protocol, but if you make it as simple as addressing a letter and posting it, it will appear to the average person very familiar and sensible. It all makes sense.
Same with the GPS system, very complex, but with 'killer apps' the average person can easily use it, (and never have to read scientific papers to 'understand' it).

"Is a double spend fraud", I would say that as it is allowed by the 'protocol' and it is a 'service' offered by coinbase, and that is (was) supposed to be something bitcoin solved (although it also created) the double spend. It could be argued that it is a 'feature'.
I don't think you would get a fraud case off the ground, how can it be fraudulent if it is 'allowed'?

Most people don't need to be told what is true or not, usually they can make up their own mind based on observation of the facts.

There have been wallet hacks, so the bitcoin protocol has been hacked, Sure there has been no 'blockchain' hacks (actually there has been that also), but the blockchain is only a transaction record, and the wallets are equivalent to a bank account. 
There has been many 'account' hacks, including Gox, Cryptsy and private users, from social engineering and technically (weak keys and so on)
Anything that is stolen is 'worth something' to the person who made the effort to steal it, but it does not 'valadite' that thing as a valuable (although sometimes it does, such as gold and cash).
Bitcoin is 'valuable' because you can (sometimes) convert it into cash, and bitcoin is 'valued' in fiat, and fiat is valuable. But I do agree with you, people do consider it valuable, but I do not agree that the 'bitcoin protocol itself' is immune from hacking and deception and theft. (as there are just too many examples of it happening). 
For the blockchain to be hacked, would be equivalent to robbing a bank and stealing bank account transaction records. 
(but thinking about it, a double spend is also a protocol level hack), so bitcoin is no more immune to technical or social attacks as anything else. More so than gold because you need to have it physically, it is not so readily available over the internet.
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:58:40


"Very few cases" !! No, lets put it this way, without gold we would not have modern, complex electronics at all. There is no way you can use other elements apart from gold because of its particular properties. At best the reliability of electrical connections would be measured in weeks as opposed to years, or hundreds of years. 
Gold cannot be replaced by anything else in these applications, just like it cannot be replaced by any other metal for other industrial processes, (even jewellery). Because its properties are unique.
The properties of bitcoin, or blockchain are not unique and commerce can be done without them. 
Gold also cannot easily be destroyed, you cant have a keyboard error and lose you physical gold, bitcoin's are destroyed all the time. 
The entire bitcoin system can shut down and no longer exist, but the gold you keep in your safe will be there for as long as you are there, you are never going to open it up and find it as been deleted. 
Currencies as backed by their economies and the societies that use those currencies. So you can say the USD is backed by America, its economy and its population.
It seems most people value (back) their BTC by valuing it in a common currency such as USD.

and in 2016 the internet is much more complex and still beyond the grasp of the average person, yet it is used by everyone routinely.  You don't have to make people smarter or more educated, you just have to make your thing easy and sensible to use. As yet bitcoin has failed to achieve that. 
Next time your in a taxi ask the driver to explain how his GPS works! He wont be able to tell you, but ask him how to work it and he will be able to explain it in seconds.
You cannot expect people to bend to your requirements, if you want people onboard you must bend to theirs. That means making bitcoin as easy to use as a phone or a GPS, or the internet or email. 
The bitcoin 'killer app' is an interface that isolates the use from the technology, like the interface of a GPS or an 'Outlook' application. Simple and effective, and reliable and safe.

I would love to see you make a case for fraud in a real court, because you would get no where. If it was fraud then it should have been reported to the law. (of course it has not been). 
And if is found that coinbase is not taking "all reasonable measures" to secure again fraud then that is what is called 'mitigation'. 
Plus in the modern world you are innocent until proven guilty, and as yet this is not happening, this is just 'mob rule', which you really don't want to promote in bitcoin.
If someone shows you how you massively fucked up, they should not be punished.
It appears bitcoin is self destructing, and very quickly.

It is not fraud because it has not been determined by any court that it is, at best it is 'alleged' fraud, but it is not even that as no claim of that sort has been made. (to our knowledge).
Because it is only $10 as you say, it wont go to court therefore it is not fraud, and never will be.


No it does not, but it is then your duty of care to ensure that your house is secure, and if someone else breaks in and you knew your house was insecure you will have a harder time making a claim on insurance, plus the police will be 'less' interested in helping you. Legal or not that is just how it is. 
Some insurance companies will not cover the theft of your car if it turns out you left the keys in the ignition, sure the guy who took it is still stealing, but you are also responsible for 'reasonable care'.
If coinbase if found to have not taken 'reasonable care' in light of a potential issue that is mitigation against theft (not to the thief but to the company). 
**The thief is still a thief, but it is the responsibility of the company to take reasonable care** if it is shown that reasonable care is not taken they too are liable.
If the farmer leaves the gate open, and his cows get out and someone takes the cows it is also the farmers fault for leaving the gate open, this is a mitigation for the person who took the cows and is a failure of duty of care from the farmer. 
Yes, the thief is in the wrong, but it is also the responsibility of everyone to provide a reasonable duty of care, if you don't you can be just as liable as the thief. (and for corporations much more so).
There is also a thing called **Corporate social responsibility**


Also **Duty of care**


So coinbase could well take this case to court (on principle) but they would also leave themselves open to tort law and their legal obligations of duty of care. Leaving them also subject to liability. If they took me to court for this that is what I would be doing.. 


Not just bitcoin-core, everyone, even this sub (especially this sub) there is more than enough blame to spread around. (except entities external to bitcoin). 
Bitcoin was supposed to 'stop wars' and so on, it appears making your own money and economy is not for the weak or faint hearted. It is a cut throat and ruthless world, and bitcoin is not immune. (even though that was in intension).

you might think so, but it is not, saying deposited does not mean you money is cleared, it means, money (or a cheque) has been deposited, it does not mean it is cleared. And it has always been that way. 
Its might seem like a trap for noobies, but its being a noobie that is the trap.. 
So either I can tell him that, or the court can tell him that, bottom line is he has no case, and leave himself open to changes against himself. 
The judge will ask him "do you honestly believe a cheque deposit is instantly cleared?", This is a big thing in the bitcoin world, you should all know by now that cheques take days to clear, but he fell for it anyway. 
He was suckered because of greed, he lost his coin and his money, he needs to move on. 
And lastly, why are the cheques 'stacked'?? someone is going to be asking questions about that!

He's right too, the thing is 'Contract law', and the social interactions which are in fact contracts as well is a huge body of law and differs considerably in different regions and jurisdictions. 
Normally contracts are only looked at in law when there is a breach of the contract or a disagreement, a smart contract has to therefore be such that there can be no disagreement or 'breach of contract', otherwise it just because a part of 'everyday' contract law (or 'Tort law'), where it has to be confirmed that the contract is 'legal' or if it is who has been in breach of the contract. 
Smart contracts might be able to determine if a breach of the contract has happened, but it cannot determine if the contract itself is 'legal' and therefore enforceable. 
Watch a few episodes of "Judge Judy" most of what she does is contract law, "did he lend you that money or was it a gift?" type of thing, often those cases have no written contract, so it has to be determined if it is in fact a contract or not. Often even if there is no written or even verbal contract there is an 'implied' contract that is still enforceable. 
So 'smart contracts' is a catchy phrase, but in reality it is not something that can really have much meaning as an 'addon' for bitcoin or a currency. 
At the end of the day it is not going to matter how you write or make your contract, it is about what that contract is and what was (or not) done in the name of that contract.
TL'DR contracts are about people, not so much about some computer algorithm.. And computer or not they will all be dealt with the same was.. (in court).
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:28:31

A good technology should not require an in depth knowledge of its functions in order to use it. Look at for example the GPS system it is very complex and not very many people understand how it works. But ask any taxi driver how to work it and it is trivial. 
How many people know how the cellular phone system works? Not many, but the 'average individual' has no problems with using it.
How many people know (in depth) how the internet works? But using it is trivial, easy. Any average individual can use it. 
Being complex or hard to understand should never limit its usage, and if it does that is a problem with the technology not the individual. 
This is most important when it involves peoples money and personal finances, I don't know exactly how VISA does it transactions, nor do I care, nor should it be necessary to know.
After seven years or working on the back end (and not doing that great either) how about some of the big brains of bitcoin get to work on a simple, fail safe and intelligently designed interface system that can function as the front end. 
I am sure the GPS system would not be popular at all if you had to calculate the kaps for each bird and do the triangulation calculations yourself.
From what I see so far, there has been very little progress in this area! So perhaps all the above average bitcoiners can develop some decent front end functions that takes that high level of technical knowledge out of the equation.
Look at some other systems apart from bitcoin, and ask yourself how complex those systems are and why despite that complexity they are popular.  You will find it is not the fault of the average person, it is your problem and it needs to be addressed. (as opposed to being elitist and assuming your are just better than the average.)

This type of thing always appears to happen whenever the BTC price spikes, and almost never when it is low. 
The reason is simple (and obvious), if they are cashing out the BTC they receive, then they have to purchase those BTC to return them to clients. Its a fractional reserve (of BTC) problem.
If they can delay for long enough that the price might drop back down they profit from that (your) loss. Or they can give it to you now and suffer their own loss.

The past and the future are not the same things. (did they not teach you that in school?)
No economic conditions will ever be that same as they were in the past, it is not predictable or cyclic.
The future is not simply past events done over and over again.
You simply cannot predict the future based on past events, it is naïve to think that is the case.
It would be such a boring work, if it works like a clock work world, but it is not, it is always changing and dynamic, there is not accurate picture of the past that predicts future events, or even the conditions of future events happening.
Pattern recognition, observation and deduction are no more than 'educated guesses'.

If you drive on a road, (paid for by taxes), are you stealing off the Government ?
I see you clearly want to only look at one side of the equation, your side (of course). If you actually thought about it for a second, you would realise that if you did not pay a little extra for your coffee, there would be no coffee shop to get your coffee at any price.
If you did not pay taxes, you would not have roads, let alone cars, and not only roads **all the things that make up a civilisation**.

1) you cant transact **without limitations** locally or globally.
(there are many limitation, including limitation imposed by bitcoin itself, you are free to transact globally (if you pay for it, or mining) but not **without limitations**.
2) Censorship resistant.                                      
It's not really, all your transactions are on public display if total exposure is your idea of 'censorship resistance', then fine
But using Bitcoin does not remove censorship.                              
3) the 'central institution' and "middle men" is bitcoin and the block chain itself. 
IF bitcoin is broken (as it has been in the past) you cannot make transactions at all.

If you are able to continue to add energy it is by definition not isolated! (also if you 'see' what happens it is by definition not isolated).
and back to growth, and 'by definition is unsustainable', what about the growth of decay? What about the growth of the universe, or the growth of knowledge? How are they not sustainable?


Just like if you look at the steady state of the worlds climate you can accurately model all future weather! (oh wait!!).
So you can model economics accurately even if you cannot tell what is going to happen tomorrow that might create a step function that destroys your model!
It is obvious to most people that you cannot accurately predict unknown events and most events effect economics. 
If it could be accurately models, then you tell me what will the price of bitcoin be next week?

the entire economy would collapse.
Why not?, and why would it lead to a collapse?
If dropping the interest rates to zero stimulates the economy and promotes growth, once that growth is established raising the rates again is the appropriate action, it does not mean an economic collapse.
It is an economic stimulus technique, and a tool for economists to regulate economic growth. There is no magic rule that says once it has hit zero then it cannot ever be increased lest you have economic collapse.
What is his justification for making that statement?

You do not seem to have any problem using and taking advantages of the facilities of the society you live in, that are provided to you 'voluntarily'. You are free to not be part of that society, and not take the advantages that society provides you.
But you don't, you voluntarily take advantage of all the things Governments and those taxes provide, and you can choose not to pay them, as long as you also do not take advantage of them.
You have a job, and get paid because of the societal system that you are a part of that, if that did not exist you would not have a job and you would not be paid.
The price you pay for living the life you live in the society and civilisation that you enjoy is to contribute back to that system.
Just like the price you pay (extra) on your cup of coffee is the price you pay for that coffee shop to even exist in the first place.

Without  Govt **everything is taken by force**, you don't have any 'rights' to anything.
In your world, if you own land (for example) you have that land because you are bigger and stronger than everyone else who also wants that land. You have no right to that land. If someone bigger than you sees you on 'your' land, and decides they want it, they will fight you for it, if you lose they get the land and you get nothing.
What the Government is, is "the strongest group around", you (by paying taxes to them) form an agreement and contract that if you pay taxes and support that Government (financially, not politically), they will "allow" you to have a 'right' to be on that land.
They will stop (by laws) other just taking your land by virtue of them being stronger than you are.
The price you pay for that "protection" is your contribution to that society by taxes and abiding by the set laws.
Think about a pride of lions, there is one lion that is the biggest and best fighter, he 'owns' all the females in the pride, but that is not permanent, ANY other male lion can challenge the lead male and fight them for that ownership. If the challenger wins, he is not the owner, and the previous owner goes to the end of the line.
Societies voluntarily pay Governments to provide a stable social structure where you do not, **not** own anything and it is not **rule of the strongest**, by the Government becoming the strongest and forming an agreement with you, that if you pay them to be the strongest they will do their best to uphold your rights.
And yes, Governments at times exercise that right (by might), they can take your house and land if it is deemed for the greater social good. (the good of the many outweighs the good of the few).
It is not done by force, it is done by agreement, a social agreement, you want to be part of that society you make a contract with that society including its governance. If you for fill that contract and if you are part of the 'greater good' for the society, they for fill their contract with you and provide you with 'right' and protections required by that society.
I am 100% sure you are far better off as you are now than you would be if you were fighting for your rights against every possible challenger who thought they could beat you. (by force).

Read up on any talk of bitcoin, from anyone 'in the community' the first thing is says is it is P2P. Even the side bar on this site states as much, or the wiki, look anywhere.


P2P means (if you did not already know) "Person to Person", that is like me giving YOU $20 directly from me, person to person.
Bitcoin simply does not work that way, you have a central authority, it is called "The blockchain". If I want to give you $20 I do not give it to you directly, I give it do you via the central blockchain what after appropriate approvals give that money to you.
So it is not point to point or person to person, it is person to blockchain, blockchain to person.
I was also referring to the statement:


So apart from having to deal with a centralized blockchain for every transaction, the process itself has yet another layer of centralization that is the **central exchanges** (banks). 
So the typical transaction is Person to coinbase, coinbase to blockchain, blockchain to person, and if you want to transfer that money to a second party, it is back to the blockchain for 'approval' and processing of that transaction.
That is simply NOT P2P by any stretch of the imagination.

we can all grasp the principles, as you say it is not that hard. What is more difficult is determining what will happen in the future.
You have no idea (nor do I) what the economy might do, but I know (as you do) that interest rates is not the only tool in the tool box for economic regulation. Economies are not delivered with just 'one big knob' that adjusts interest rates. Many things can stimulate or regulate economic growth. Interest rates are just one of them.
Central banks may have zero interest but do commercial banks? What about other methods of economic stimulus? Capital works, some big projects, goosing employment, adjusting taxation, quantities easing? 
Many, many knobs to twiddle apart from just interest rates (of central not commercial banks). That's (as you say) just basic economics.

You would never apply to regulations that you fail at. It's not about privacy, you know that, so do I.  
I have read the license as well, it is not that bad, but obviously bad enough for them to not even bother trying. You talk about privacy and everything you do is right there on a freaking public ledger! Some will get the license and they will get the profit and the work, others will not.

By saying "the interest rates are now x% Value", just like they did when it was reduced (by central, not commercial banks) to zero.
If zero interest rates are not achieving the desired economic growth, then other methods of goosing the economy can be applied (there are many of those). Then once the economy is sufficiently recovered to moderate the growth you can raise interest levels again.
Lowing of interest rates is a method to promote spending which drives the economy, but it is not the only method to promote spending and investment. You can vary other things (knobs) and do other things to stimulate the economy. But there is no magic switch that once it hits zero you cannot ever change it, there is also no evidence that once it is at zero if it is increase it will result in economic collapse. That is a assumption based on no evidence that simply cannot be made.

It is a bad thing, if you have a fixed block processing time, it means that you can only process the maximum amount of transactions that you can fix in each block. This is a **hard limit** on system capacity. 
The negative implication of this is that you can only process one block at a time, and a block can hold a small and limited number of transactions.
It also means you have regressed 30 years of computer science, you cannot scale because the protocol (and math) does not allow it.
For the past 30 years CS has developed methods of running programs and distributing computing workloads across multiple CPU's.
This is important, because no matter how many CPU cycles you throw at Bitcoin, the max limit of transactions is **ONE AT A TIME**, the winner of the block gets to be the **central banker** for his 10 minutes. 
It is a centralized system also, sure you get to take turns and you get to be the central bank if you win that block, then someone else gets a change at playing central bank.
This is not how a distributed (or decentralized) system works, It is a bottle neck that Bitcoin cannot overcome.
The implications of these basic facts are dire, and in my opinion reflects poor design and engineering in the development of bitcoin, I know I will be hung out to dry for dissing the great Sotachi, but facts are facts.
Bitcoin will never change the world with a system that basically can only do one transaction at a time.
VISA can do 47,000 Txn's a second, and if they need to double that, they could easily do it by doubling the number of computers and network capacity, it can scale and operate concurrently.
Bitcoin is limited to sequential processing, not parallel processing.
ALL bitcoin could do is change the size of the blocks, or the time period of block processing (10 minutes). But that is ALL it can do. (and it appears that these kinds of changes are next to impossible to gain consensus).
It is actually not that hard to design a decentralized and distributed processing database, (look for example at Blizzards WoW), but if you start with a bad design, with severe limitations, it is next to impossible.
I am impartial, and I am simply looking at bitcoin from an engineering perspective, and from that view it is flawed.
So I am not only implying it is a bad thing, I KNOW it is a bad thing, assuming you want it to do the amazing things that this sub (and other places) seem to expect. 
This is the conclusion of not only myself, but even your 'core dev's" have identified this problem.
You can tune a chain saw engine all you like, but it will never be able to power a truck.

That is bigger than most realize.
The problem is that statement is actually wrong, there are any number of larger and more cryptographically secure ledgers in existence. You really should of included "That I know of" in there.


What do you mean by this? License fees ?
Do you think a large bank that maintains and develops its own cryptographically secured ledger pays license fees for that system?


Just because no one or group has done something, does not mean it cannot be done, if there is a will to do it.
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
And the prospect of a 51% attack means that it is possible, by anyone, and even by the NSA if they had to desire and will to do so.
Transactions can most certainly be erased, if Bitcoin fails as well, it is conceivable that ALL of them will be erased. It is conceivable that not only can transactions be erased, but ALL of Bitcoin could cease to exist. If no one mines and no one runs nodes then where are all your transactions ?


Incredible, and clearly unsustainable (as the community is slowly working out).


The problem with that theory is, that it is an arms race with yourselves, the more you work to secure the system the harder it is to do it.
This "brute force" security is an ineffective model, and it means that there are groups that have huge processing power, so it is actually quite easy to achieve a very high percentage of the total hash power "on tap" if other big players have a problem.
Having security by having a huge arsenal of weapons is a dangerous.
So you've got to hire technical wizards to secure this thing, but the problem is, the best people in the world are already working on bitcoin, and they aren't going to come work for you.
That is an unsupported assumption, I would say the number of computer, crypto and IT experts working just for the NSA would outnumber the number of experts in Bitcoin by probably 1000 to 1 or more. The 'big brains' of computer science are not working on Bitcoin.
You then talk about developing a competing 'blockchain' but Bitcoin does not have to compete with other coins, it has to compete with money and economies, that is what it has to achieve, that is your battle.


Which is exactly what everyone does, most people do not need or want to have their transactions and ledger public, they just don't see the point of doing it.
I just don't care what you spend your money on, or how much you spent, and I don't care for you to know what I do. It certainly is (to me) not a compelling argument for adoption.
Bitcoin is on its way to becoming as embedded in our world and life as TCP/IP / HTTP is today, and for similar reasons. 
Except TCP/IP and HTTP are not embedded in peoples lives, virtually no one ever thinks in terms of TCP/IP and HTTP, it is there, and some people know about what they are, but the vast majority will never directly use it or even consider it. (even if they use the internet all the time).

I am not owned by banks either, I have never been owned by banks, those points have clearly been refuted, so their implications are mute.
In the big (real) outside world, most people do not consider themselves owned by banks, and most don't see a relationship with banks of great social or political importance.
You might have some ideologies, or beliefs that make you think it is important. But most (the vast majority) do not see it as an important issue.
Banks provide a service that most people use and value, they are (to most people) not huge evil entities printing money in some dim back room. They have services and functions that you can use, or choose not to use.
And I don't see becoming your own bank as a way to get 'back at' other (evil) banks.
I just don't see it!, sure there are a lot of people on this sub that will agree with your stance, but that what this sub is for.
And I have been an observer (and as an electronics engineer) an informed observer of Bitcoin, and I know as well as you that you have a great deal of trouble functioning at all without the banks and support of established and working economies.
I know that Bitcoin cannot function at all without the 'backing and support' that viable economies provide you (and your community), so you can preach the party line all you like.
But to anyone who has watched Bitcoin, and who does understand the technology, who is impartial (and without a political agenda) I just don't buy into the pseudo political AnCap mind set.
But you really should not be making claims that are not supported by fact and reality. I know those 3 points are not correct, and I am sure if you gave it some thought you would work it out as well. (if not I did explain it to you).
If you are going to make claims at least make them believable, and believable by normal people. If not, don't expect to be taken seriously by the wider community (ie, the rest of the world).
Also consider that having a vested interest in Bitcoin may lead to bias. These kinds of statements go down great in sub's like this one. Because you all seem to want to believe the same thing, and you all have a vested interest.
Also, what implications? just saying there are some does not really work as an argument. But if you are going to say Bitcoin is going to destroy Governments, banks and the FED reserve, and render Gold worthless. Good luck trying to sell that argument, because if it has not happened already, its just not going to happen at all.
If you want to try to save the world from itself, I (IMHO) think you need to do better, and have much better tools. (and a really strong argument).
But good luck anyway, you might prove me wrong, but I'm not holding my breath for it to happen.

Clearly bitcoin is backed by the economies that it operates in, mostly the US (and China), if it is prices and valued in USD it must be backed by USD, and USD in turn is backed by the US economy.
USD is used to participate in the US economy, you can redeem and exchange USD for a part of that economy.
SO you could easily say Bitcoin is backed by the US dollar and the US economy.
You don't value USD's in USD, they stand on their own, until bitcoin is the same, then it is not backed by anything.
But right now, it is backed by the economies of the world, but not its own economy. (as it does not have one yet).

I'm not trying to be a smart ass, but does it really matter?
Regardless of the block size, you are still limited to one block at a time, that puts a hard limit on the number of transactions you can do, because you have to do those transactions in the block time, one at a time.
You are all talking about something that is bad, and making it not quite as bad.
So you increase the number of Txn's in the block and you make the block 10 times bigger, you will only get 27 txn's a second.
All those tranactions (in that block) have be processed sequentially, that is one at a time.
That simply cannot scale, unless you can actually make it distributed, and parallel (like the internet) and be able to run processes in parallel.
That is the only way it will even scale to something useful, and capable of mainstream.
Fix the cause not the effect.

I think you sort of missed the point that OP is trying to make, just because something is 'math' does not bestow any properties or qualities to that 'thing'.
He is trying to say "backed by math" has no real meaning, it says nothing, everything is backed by math, so what?
Everything can be represented and defined by math, everything. 
But that is not a 'quality' or feature, and it does not mean it is good or bad.
He I think is trying to say, you need more than that to make it in the real world, Morse Code is backed by math too, so are steam engines, does that make it better?
Think about qualities not so much quantities, what are it's qualities, what can it do?
If you want broader acceptance of Bitcoin then you need to define those qualities, and promote them, just telling people "backed by math" will not gain you acceptance.

no, not 'on reserve' there is no reserve to speak of, money is a property of an economy, without one the other is not much use.
"Backed by" really also meant nothing, and it is silly principle, that is why it was stopped 40 plus years ago.
Backed by the economy means there is a viable economic structure of labour, vendors, manufactures, importers, exporters and all the other things that make having money actually useful.
Money is only an abstract of value, it has no value itself, its value lies in it ability to be used within an economy. The things within the economy are the things of value.
Money is just a token representation of that value within the economy.
Bitcoin might have some properties of a money, but without an economy it needs to rely on other economies to exist.
For example, a lot of people use the value token of the US economy to purchase Bitcoins. That person has backed those bitcoins with USD, which is in turn backed by an economy.
There is no BCT economy to speak of, and therefore items, goods and services are not priced in BTC. They are always priced in the money of that economy.

It does not matter at all why they are stronger, just that they are, and they are.
They might even be stronger because the price of gold has gone down, but again, So what?
The simple (and I think for you inconvenient) is that the worlds economies (even Greece's) are highly resilient. They can withstands all sort of trauma and still keep on going. 
That resilience is as good as 'money in the bank', most people understand this, they believe (based on past performance) in 'the system'. 
The system does not care what you believe, it is just going to keep on going no matter what you think.
Economies do not care when you think (or what I think either), nor do they care why they are doing well or poorly.
They are what they are, and if it's not broke, don't fix it.

The high number of false positives are substantive.
The common method for finding the same author of text is the do a word count and create a histogram of the words, and if you like phrases. 
You will find that the same authors will tend to have the same histogram each time, and the more test you analyse the more accurate your results.

The problem with bitcoin is that it does not matter how much processing power you throw at it, it does not speed the system up any more. It just makes solving a problem harder to do, there is a specific time to process each block of transactions, that is set, and adjusted to keep that time at about 10 minutes.
So you add more computing power, it just makes the problem you need to solve harder so that it takes you 10 minutes to solve it.
Don't ask me why it is designed this way, but it (to me) is a massive flaw in the systems design.

CC transactions are 'essentially instant', in that you do not have to get on a queue and wait your turn, but really this discussion is about the trade off between **speed, price and security**, a couple seconds is essentially instant.
The actual process of making a CC transaction takes a finite time, but a very short time.
It is to me equivalent to going into a shot and having a queue for the checkout or not having a queue. without a queue, you are served instantly (even though the transaction takes some time), maybe 'immediate' would be a better term for CC's.
And if you are willing to accept trust (and only accept one confirmation) your 'cost' is a lower security.
So Bitcoin has a problem of balance, that balance is between **cost, speed and security** to get any of those things, you have to trade off other parts of those things. 
It certainly cannot be all of those things, and this is a design 'feature' of how Bitcoin works.

True, but that is the nature of patents, not a flaw, it has to be broad enough to encompass what they are proposing to do, but not broad enough to give it no meaning. And not narrow enough that it cannot be practically applied.
And reading the OP, this patent is quite specific, it is also not how bitcoin achieves the same goals (p2p transactions), so the goals might be the same, but as long as the method is different, (and specific enough) its 'not harm, no foul'.
I have applied for and received patents, and the easiest way to have a patent application rejected is for being too broad and lacking specificity.

I don't think you really understand what was said, and you are just trying to make it so simplistic as to sound stupid.
Bitcoin confirms the transaction over an insecure channel, Chase confirms the transaction over a secure channel. 
You start with an insecure channel and your protocol does a process to confirm that transaction, by cryptographic and historic methods.
Chase, establish a secure channel, and confirm all transactions on that, knowing they have the security of both ends and can just confirm each transaction as required.
Slightly different methods, I think one is better then the other and more efficient, but that is my opinion.
Bitcoin does not do anything amazing, just slightly differently.

I have some reasonable questions, (though I am sure I will not get anything like real answers).
**1. Budget**
- What is your budget
- Where is your budget
- Justify your budget
The foundation is a business, and it relies on donations, this money is not yours, therefore you need to justify and account for every penny.
**2. What is your mission statement?**
Please make it more that just "Take donations, splash it about"
The Foundation should be goals and performance orientated.
So what are it's goals and how do you propose to achieve those goals.
**3. Executive Director** 
Do you expect to have full board voting rights as if you were an elected board member?
Or should voting rights be reserved for those actually elected to have voting rights.
It is not appropriate that you should assume equal rights as an elected member, particularly if you ran for the board on a platform and was not elected.
The Foundation members rejected your platform when you lost the election, if you don't accept that, do you feel you have the right to hijack a board vote?
**4. Proactive or reactive?**
Are you going to spend all you time, (and members money) putting out spot fires and reacting to problems.
Or are you going to be proactive, set goals, set performance and seek to meet those criteria ?
It is really easy to meet goals and performance if you have not set out any objectives in the first place, but if you did that it would be a huge disservice to members.

the bank was trying to determine if they were willing to enter into a contract with the person. You can make all the arguments you like, but they have every right to clarify concerns in regard to KYC.
Everyone knows there are KYC laws, and if the bank chooses not to deal with this person, they wont. This guy can jump up and down all he likes, it is NOT going to help him. The bank will just reject his loan, make a report so every other bank also rejects him, and he will have ZERO recourse to the law.
It's his choice, it is not one I would have made, clearly he is very inexperienced with finance and negotiation.  He may even be right, but being right is not going to help him. He can be right all day, still does not mean he will get his loan..

That is an assumption you are making, but in reality being able to 'link' and embed information (such as HTML) was immediately obvious and apparent as to its utility and power.
Yes all that information existed in books before the WWW but the power and ability to access that information was not available, the is the power of the WWW.
Book and libraries and mail is not the same thing as HTML and online information, linked information, in comparison to bitcoin and currencies. You will also notice that the Web did not displace or replace books, libraries, mail, news papers and magazines, the Web complemented these technologies.
So why would bitcoin displace currencies?
The internet does not change information, it just makes information more accessible. 
Ok, there might be a comparison between Bitcoin and the WWW or bitcoin and currencies but it is a weak one, and it has not been detailed here.

@_date: 2015-09-29 01:17:52
you are entering into a contract with the bank, what they are asking your for is to meet their side of the terms of the contract, it has little to do with the law. (from their perspective or yours).
For them to feel comfortable in entering into a contract with you, a part of the terms is that you provide them with information.
You might not like their requirements, but they are not legally obliged to give you a loan, they are however legally obliged to ensure as much as possible in good faith that you are not a risk in some way. 
You opposition to this requirement, would indicate to them that you are not 'in good faith' seeking to meet the terms of the contract. 
I would be surprised if you get the loan from this bank, and I would not be surprised that from this point on you will have difficulty getting a loan from any bank. 
And, they were playing really nice with you, telling you what  you need to do, and you get your back up and start making demands and wanting to review the laws!

No, your not missing a thing, that is exactly right, but I also think you mean 'tangible' value, not intrinsic value.
The only 'value' of fiat is that it is a representation of value, it has no 'intrinsic/tangible' value in itself. (it does not do anything).
But it represents a common agreement of value, bitcoin on the other hand is a token that is a representation of the 'value' of fiat, with is a token for a representation of real (agreed value).

EBCDIC is not a base number counting system, Dec, Hex, Octal, Binary are 'base' counting system. 
BCD (Binary coded decimal) is not a base counting system, the base of BCD is DECIMAL (the D in BCD), the "B" stands for "Binary" and that is a base 2 counting system.
SO BCD is decimal counting (like 1,2,3,4.... 9,0) but each number in the decimal system is coded in binary.
So the decimal number 123 would be coded as 01 10 11
01 01 11 is BCD for 123
EBCDIC is just an extended version of that.

People should not need to understand it, or its benefit to society.
They just need to know its benefit to them (should there actually be any).
Most people I know do not understand the internet, or TCP/IP or DNS at all. They don't know and don't care but they use them every day and find benefit in them.
I think the arguments of "if only they understood it, they would love it" does not work. It does not work with most things. 
bitcoin needs something far more than to get people to understand, it needs to meet a need, most people needs have already been filled by fiat and by the economy they live in.

computers use the Base 2 numbering system, humans can use whatever numbering system they prefer, by far the most common today is base 10, but it the past it was common to use base 60 (hours per day, and so on).
Binary is most suited by computers because 1 and 0 can be represented by a switch being either on or off.
Base 8 and base 16 are handy because that is a common "bus" size or 'word' size in computers.
Programming computers that operate as ON-OFF switches virtually REQUIRES them to be programming in binary.

Then before we do, how about you provide your CS reasoning to support your claims? All you are saying is "I have a CS degree therefore I am right". We'll that might be so, but you should at least detail your reasoning behind that.
We are dying to hear your reasoning too. 
All the things the poster you responded to was not true when BTC was worth 0.01$, and 6 years later there is a clear trend for sure. But it is a trend detailed by the first poster. 


People detract on the notion and on the basis of the concepts of the notion, not because of its popularity or lack thereof.


There were no detractors when it all started?


You've had 7 years, I honestly do not worry about it succeeding. (or not succeeding for that matter). People have the capability of being neutral and even impartial, that same cannot be said from within your own 'community'. That seems to be rife with decent.

so your argument that a society can fall but all the infrastructure (such as roads) will just continue on regardless? You don't see any glaring flaws in that reasoning?
Such as what if you don't want to pay for that pot hole, and who is going to fix it? (someone else?) How is the road going to be able to be closed for repair, who is going to regulate and control the repair? Who is going to make sure the repair does not cost 10 times what it should?
These are the things societies provide, that are not provided if a society does not exist, if the society collapses so does the infrastructure that surrounds it. I don't think the idea that a state can collapse but the structure of that state can continue 'leaderless and stateless'. 
Even if it could exist do you honestly believe it would be the utopia you would like, or would it actually be far worse that what you have now?
Sure people don't like living by rules (from the state) but I bet they would not like living by no rules even more.

Tourism is promoted by the relative values of currencies.
Australia is a popular tourist location, it gets more tourists for example when the USD is stronger compared to the AUD, it's **cheaper** to travel to places.
If it's cheaper to do, more people will do it and take advantage of the saving in exchange rates.
Taking away that advantage will not increase tourism, it will decrease it.

Bitcoin does not have perfect competition, especially in "labour markets" even with mining, there is no perfect competition as the cost of mining varies dependent on your electricity costs.
It is also not a homogeneous product, with a small number of people owning a large amount of bitcoin, giving them significant market power. 
It is certainly NOT a Pareto efficient allocation of economic resources.
