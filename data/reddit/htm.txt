Still BS if I cant send a satoshi without paying thousands times one to send it.

TBH even in online transactions, PayPal makes it frictionless to purchase with credit cards, more so than bitcoin in my opinion. Most companies accepting bitcoin as payment (tigerdirect, cheapair, overstock), are having it converted to fiat instantly anyways so what's the point?
Some may say bla bla fees etc. Well I'm paying the same price if I were to go through bitpay compared to PayPal so that point is moot.

STFU, Credit card I just swipe/chip and I'm done.
If I want to buy something with bitcoin in the real world? Transfer to exchange, wait 20m-6h for confirmation, meet some sketchy dude on localbitcoins/exchange out, recieve cash/wait 3 days for $ to transfer into bank, go and buy product.
Bitcoin to an outsider looks confusing as hell and if we keep it this way, especially with the long confirmation times and outrageous fees, it will not become mainstream.

I'm using a Bitcoin ATM in Calgary, trying to sell. It requires 1 confirmation to give me the cash and its been 8 hrs.. so frustrating. Blockchain says 0 confirmations, but blockr.io says 60.
