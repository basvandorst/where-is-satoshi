I initially had 10 BTC at 2013. Lost in gambling.
Between years 2014-2016 I lost even more over 100BTC again on gambling (around 40k USD, bought at 200-400). 
Total loss is all BTC investment plus yearly income.
I stopped gambling. I have kids, wife and good job. Still strugging with depression and regret. It's just .. money/btc.
Years ahead!

Educated guess.

Totally agree. Waiting for comments that this is totally fine and expected. Goverment will make laws on this.

Let's say that you are in your twenties or thirtees. Everyone here is talking about revolution. I think most of the early investor are waiting for the exit strategy. No one is talking about it, but you are prime example of doom of bitcoin by greed.

It's a trap.

I don't like the looks, I don't like the ux. Too fancy, too social media copycat.
I like the idea though.

How much you lost?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:43:36
We will see 10k. This is normal. Newbies aware.

You think this was over? Look at the graph.

Trend is still down. Anything could happen. I don't believe currently any support level. Bitcoin reputation is hurt. Wait until march. We need steady growth.

There will be some news from China later today (in 5-6 hours). When announcements arrive you can guess the price direction at least. Wait for day or two. Crypto is here for forever.

I was almost early investor (under $100 anyway), but since price went down I gambled it all during early 2015.
In this pricejump I had again 40BTC and lost all gambling with dice few moments before price went up.  Actually pricejump was just 3 hours away. 
I still have money to buy maybe back 10 BTC, but is it worth it? Honestly. I am gone gambling, but buying now 10BTC would be risky again? I mean I believe in bitcoin in general. Any tips what should I do?
Lady luck hurted me.

When you are ready. Wait for a day or week. I mean do not buy at all time high day. Moment is gone. I will certainly come down. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:29:55
I would not buy at this moment. Wait for it now.
