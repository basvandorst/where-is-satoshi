"its not cost effective without specalized hardware"
Also false.  I'm paying for electrical heating.  How cost effective is something for nothing?

You simply arent trying to understand those that heat their home with electricity.  100% of your computers energy usage goes to heat.  It is the same as an electric heater.
Therefore, people that heat with electricity can do computer math in the winter essentially for free.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:35:07
You need to do some electrical research.  99.9% of your PC power consumption goes straight to heat.  There is no higher efficiency of 1 to 1.

... you mean.... *gasp*... its not the future?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:53:53
That is what I'm trying to tell you.  There is no distributed mining right now.  It all has been specialized perverted and hidden - otherwise the entire eastern seaboard should be doing it in the winter.
You can't find an open source bitcoin miner anymore.  Why is that?

Most of Quebec is under electrical heating and it's -40 outside.  Know your subject.

"its not cost effective" - Bitcoin installer that no longer lets you mine bitcoins - all mining software is mysteriously offline.  All conversations for video card mining clients on youtube point to spyware.  Sourceforge projects are shut down.
"It is a gold rush, boys." 49ers (early adapters)
"I formatted my hard drive and lost two bitcoins ages ago.  F that noise, I'm done." -Me
Also I live in Quebec.  It is more than the power is cheap.  In the winter you can run -40c through your datacenter at the price of a fan duct outside.

I'm doing my own part to make the world better, not rubberstamping stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:46:54
Space heaters have no fans.  My pc has a fan and zero investment.  You're still bad with math.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:33:33
Then why did the software disappear?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:09:29
Have you looked at these personally?  I've never seen a more spyware infected plague since I tried to pirate windows xp.  (bit of a joke there... I've never done this)
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:02:39
It was not a secret it was on sourceforge!
Everyone claims its an open project then you guys pull crap like this and call it a power dominance tool to generate wealth.
It's a fucking shell game for people to steal money from the ignorant.  Not what it was designed to be - not what people hope it will be.
End of rant.  Please drive through.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:44:45
I don't trust it.  The miners used to be open source - now I have to believe that someone does not have a back door into my device taking a few coins here and there.  Specialization is not distributed mining is it?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:02:22
You don't get the point of open source software.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:24:08
I'd love to.  Know where I can find the software anymore?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:34:04
Now you're getting it but why can't we do it?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:11:57
God it really is rookie hour.
Meltdown spectre ring a bell?
They were open source....  they're gone.  Why?
Why would someone close their sourceforge repositry for a video card miner ?
Is it an open project or is it exploitative?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:24:42
Power is free if you figure you're just offsetting electrical heating with your PC on a 1 to 1 basis.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:27:34
OK so I'll blow $1200 worth of power at .08 canadian cents per KWH of power loss through my apartment in the form of a electrical heater instead of off setting 5 - 10 % through mining PCs because you're bad with math.
That is per month btw.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:46:59
If your computer puts out more heat than the power it consumes, you're rich.
Electrical heating puts out exactly the power it consumes.
Know your subject.  The fans put out exactly the amount of heat that they consume.  (otherwise they would always be spinning faster)
Electrical heating is the most cost effective heating in Quebec because power prices are so low.  (unlike most places in the US were natural GAS heating is actually cheaper)
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:55:31
but its nothing it claims to be anymore.  It is not distributed if you don't have visibility into the miner.
It is not decentralized if you have to deal with a 3rd party.
Emperor's new clothes my friend.  Have fun with it.

Also keep in mind there is no way to know the timing.
It is exactly the same as saying if you went back last week with the winning lotto numbers.
Bitcoin and other lottery schemes (to me it was real-estate) make it sound like anyone can win if they are smart.  No you win big if you are lucky.
The *fortunate* thing is every day life is good without large amounts of money, and we can remember that with things like friends family, spirituality/meditation and a bit of introspection.
But sure spend a bit of time trying to be rich. . . just see it like fishing in a mostly empty lake.
