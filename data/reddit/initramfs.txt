I only watched half of it, because I had to go to sleep. Copied the mp4 to my phone, so I'll watch it in train next hour ;-)

Yes, I mean loses control instead of loses.

If you want to use encryption, please use "Off the record" (OTR), with XMPP. 
With PGP they are able to decrypt all your messages send in the past if you lose your key. With OTR that's not possible, because of "[Forward Secrecy]( 
The most userfriendly app I currently know is 'Conversations', it is available in the [Play Store]( for 1,99 EUR. 
Is you don't want to pay, download it from the [F-Droid]( app store. Enable unknown sources in the Android settings.
To register an account, you can fill in a username you like, and add a XMPP server after it. (yax.im for example, so if you want cap2002 fill in cap2002
I made a test account for this, so if you would like to test encrypted communication, I'm reddittestaccount :-)
My OTR fingerprint is 150E2A88 A72151E0 D309AC5 90F96D31 185CBB19
Happy encrypted chatting, and ask your friends to do also this! :-)

Telegram is not true end-to-end. And their cryptography is questionable. At 31C3, Jacob Appelbaum showed some NSA documents that OTR couldn't be broken by the NSA (I was at 31C3, btw)
PGP also couldn't be broken, but you have to be really sure that you protect you private key because it don't have PFS.
And you can be 100% sure that they save every PGP and OTR encrypted message. 
If you expose both your OTR and PGP keys to the NSA, your OTR messages are still safe, until they have quantum computers ;)

I know, but I never got it working on my OnePlus One with CyanogenMod. Probably because of Whisperpush, that's the same protocol. Whisperpush don't work either on my phone.

Well, they claim that, indeed. And it's probably safe. 
However, as I said, their crypto is questionable. OTR is more audited and more proven secure.
And there is the fact that Telegram is a company, OTR is a protocol. You're not depending on any server, if you don't trust your server anymore, move away.

'Moving money for better' vs 'Moving money far better'. I like it.
