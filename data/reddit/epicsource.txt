This doesn't really seem to make sense to me. If they were trying to clog the memepool they would have used LOW fees.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:17:09
That's exactly why the majority of people are buying Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:21:25
Would be a good one except I don't have any hair to lighten.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:16:43
Lightening is not close to being ready

Depends when said mortgage occured, if they mortgaged the house when BTC was at $1500 they are looking like fucking geniuses right about now. If they did so at $20K BTC not so much

Did you have any luck with this? I'm in Van and looking to grab a laptop as well lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:18:15
Yeah but there is an exemption under 1031 exchanges of like kind transactions
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:11:19
This is not a Coinbase problem. This is just normal human behaviour, people putting their own self interests ahead of others.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:05:45
As far as Im aware the IRS is yet to weigh in on the event of  crypto to crypto transactions
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:34:33
Yet he was pretty much the face of the main Bitcoin chain for years hmm.... 
Now that you don't agree with his viewpoint he is all of a sudden the devil incarnate
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:28:11
I don't understand your logic here. Premined? Anyone that wanted to had a fair chance to begin mining it. By your logic Bitcoin was also premined because not everyone wanted to mine it ot even knew about it in 2009
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:43:58
No volatility here fine Sir, 50% gain in one week? That's not volatility
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:11:49
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:46:46
Why are you assuming his trades weren't life changing sums of money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:16
"It's now up ONLY 1200% year to date, so I'm sure anyone that went long on it, obviously within the LAST 3 days. They are now underwater" 
This guy is hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:19:31
Except he has been telling everyone that Bitcoin Cash is going to blow up for months, everyone has had their fair chance to buy in
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:17:26
If the mining is so centralized, why did the miners switch back to Bitcoin chain? They could still all be mining the BCH chain causing widespread fear and panic causing BTC value to plummet.

I have a feeling 20-50 years down the road or so after his passing some relatives will be opening up a safety deposit box and find those ohh so valuable private keys
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:27:32
Somebodies a little testy, did you have a bad weekend?
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:28:50
There should not be ANY transactions costing that much at any point of time to date.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:52:17
The neighbor poisened 10 of  his dogs shortly before he got murdered... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:43:18
Wait how did you screenshot coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:57:32
Umm pretty she we already have them. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:50
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:22:07
It is saying it will decrease only  1% on fork.lol at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:33:40
"Bitcoin decentralized so that it can remain as a public, permissionless, highly censor-resistant network THAT ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN USE"
With the current fees that prices out over 80% of the world's population that is living on less than $10 a day. Lightning Network? Centralized hubs
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:13:41
The irony in your statement
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:28:52
This is misinformation. Crypto to Crypto is not taxed. Unrealized gains are not texed
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:14:58
 
This dude lost 8999 BTC and it's sitting in a wallet with a current valuation of $65mill+ so don't feel to bad.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:25:14
To get banned on this subreddit is pretty much as easy as that though
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:15:40
Yes but there is something called like-kind transactions in which case the tax is deferred.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:20:50
Dude that shit is old. I have seen that reply a million times on here. "Is that you Roger?" If someone is talking nonsense I will have no issue with calling them out on it. Try using some critical thinking skills and save the lame replies
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:44:33
Yeah, as if you are worth 1/1000 of what he is. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:33:14
Yes she is not long for this world
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:14:43
He can criticize him all he wants but his argument is flawed. Calling him a worldwide beggar? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:31:59


It's legal? It's a psy-op
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:03:02
Yes I would really like to see proof of these time traveling capabilities ��
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:55:08
46. In March of 2008 Craig wrote Dave an email stating "I need your help editing a paper Im going to release later this year. I've been working on a new form of electronic money...."   
Huh?!? I would like to see the proof of this interaction. Did this really happen?
