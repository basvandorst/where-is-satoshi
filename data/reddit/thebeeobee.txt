If anyone sells a few hundred coins the price goes down. There isn't enough volume to withstand that. Just a fact. Accept it or trade somewhere else.

Everything changes when we start crossing into the millions of transactions a day. 
If you think we hover around 100k transactions forever, then you may be right. 
However, if usage grows exponentially, it's impossible to predict what the future will hold.

Eh, i believe you. Was just checking to see if this was an ad or something. I was thinking about testing them out this week and just wanted to see if your testimonial was really real. 
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:03:31
Yeah, it's just reality of the markets. No idea why they'd downvote instead of using their information to their advantage.
75 coins sold can push the price up or down $2-$5 right now pretty easily. That's all it takes.
If someone dumps a few thousand coins we're going back down below $180 fast.

The Play Store itself is a security joke. Super easy to publish anything - including shady apps. 
Also, a lot of users leave themselves vulnerable by unlocking bootloaders and rooting and not really knowing what they are doing.
The permissions available to apps are pretty invasive. For example, Twitter can now scan your apps to see what's installed on your phone and gets access to that data. Imagine if someone with bad intentions had that information.
With that said, just be smart and don't expose yourself to anything. Use a vpn when logging into public wifi. Don't download apps by unknown publishers and make sure you aren't downloading spoof apps that look like they are something else.
Last, there have been times that manufacturers have rolled out forced upgrades to their OS on Android that has been insecure or buggy and then stopped the rollout to fix the problem, but leaving those that already received it hanging with no idea what to do. Can't downgrade or patch it and just waiting for an answer.
My daily driver is an android. You'll probably be fine but these are just things to keep in mind. I might get an iphone for my wallet, actually, as the permissions I'm giving apps makes me a bit nervous.

You mean 4 for $900?
If someone bought at your price they already lost $92!
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:36:35
$50,000 / $400 = 125 coins?
I came up with the $400 from the average price you paid ($600) minus today's rough price ($200). 
If you're interested in technology, you could've built a Bitcoin app with that money, brought the prototype to some conferences, and then got a few million in seed funding. 
You seem to be interested in gambling.

It's a venture backed startup, which in general implies lack of a business model and concentration on growth. Once they reach scale they will figure out a model.

I think most people do NOT optimize for privacy, as evidenced by the 1+ billion users of Facebook and 1+ billion users of Android phones. 
Coinbase, due to being a silicon valley backed startup, will have everything at their disposal (mainly $$$$$, press) to grow as fast as they need to and get customers.
So yes, I think many people will actually use Coinbase's exchange knowing that stuff.

I don't know about $100 (or any number), but every time someone sells even a couple of hundred coins right now there is a big drop.

Yeah, the three I listed are ventured backed startups, staffed in some cases by financial industry veterans, and I believe them to be as safe as any other online transaction.
And the time varies depending on the payment method. You'll have to check the sites for more info. I think coinbase, which I like, takes about a week if you're doing a bank transfer.

Of course it is. I don't know why anyone on this forum that owns less than 1000 coins is all "to the moon!" 
The longer it stays low the more they can buy up if they really think it will be worth a lot someday. It's way too early for another bubble. Have patience and wait for this ecosystem to mature.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:26:28
Watching the charts for the past few days, anytime someone sells 200 coins, the price goes down $5. and then as people buy them back 1 by 1 it inches back up.
So if someone dumped a few thousands coins, the price would drop very rapidly. 
Any volume at all causes a big wave.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:05:18

The US Marshals are still going to sell off tens of thousands of coins, thousands of stolen coins will probably find themselves on the market, miners are liquidating to pay bills, and still a lot of noob panic sellers. 
So I don't think we're at the bottom based on those things.

In the bitcoin space - look at Coinbase.
I think the music production software  has a really beautiful site.
If you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation (which I prefer) you'll get something that looks great on all devices.

Good! Keep going.

@_date: 2015-01-17 20:16:04
If you want to do it online, go to coinbase or xapo or circle and enter you bank account info, get approved and purchase.
If you want to do it in person try a service like 
I think these are the easiest solutions for a noob.

In your scenario, the people who care about those sorts of things could just move over to an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:06:56
Why is everyone so obsessed with that 2007 looking forum?
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:17:27
Keep thinking. Compare to other open source projects. You'll figure it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:27:17
I think you're getting way ahead of yourself. This is nascent tech and no it's way too early to draw any conclusions.
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:40:31
I just watched Blackfish. Too soon. :(
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:11:15
Are you using an automated service for these purchases? Where? Has the experience been smooth?
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:04:12
Why are you cursing me out?
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:29:13
They don't need profits right now. They have venture funding!

On the other hand, I feel much more comfortable keeping a wallet app on my iphone than my android as every week my android apps are asking for more invasive permissions.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:30:47
white male neckbeards, i'm guessing.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:54:54
I hope you get an answer because this is really interesting and I would love to know what causes this and how it can be solved in the current climate.
Unfortunately, most of the posts on here are about price and storage and getting rich/poor. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:34:07
I think the bubble was temporary.

I only look at the "new" tab.

Why are you answering my question with a question?
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:56:48
I don't really know how reddit works but I think he posted this to and then later here somehow?
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:59:34
Agree. That is the most solid use case that has developed so far.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:44:53
Thank you! Next step for me is to figure out the best way to collect Bitcoin for my web consulting services.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:07:21
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:18:46
They have a great viral growth engine and look to be the future of tipping transactions on the web. It's way too early to assess their financials.
I would love if they did something like humble bundle that allowed me to attach a few bits for them with every transaction as well as a few for charity. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:03:04
looks legit.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:36:34
You're aware bitcoins are divisible, right? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:08:28
TIL: Bitcoin is a lottery ticket. smfh.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:01:26
I know what crowdfunding is.
I don't get why your question is "why can't you?" There is nothing stopping you.
I have no idea what your post has to do with bitcoin. 
If you want this thing to exist go build it man.

Oh duh...look at "Merchants" prominently featured on the menu. That's where the money is.
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:11:57
This has more to do with UI/UX design, A/B testing, and general website customer conversion funnels than anything OP is dreaming of.
Bitcoin's price is a huge story. People are checking the price constantly. Coinbase sees via analytics that a lot of their traffic is looking at the price (i'm constantly refreshing). Their UI guy makes some changes. Conversions go up. 
Pretty basic e-commerce stuff.

This is the best post I've seen in this sub all week.

It's 200.37 now. It happens every January 17th at 1:36am eastern.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:18:36
Cool. I see it under Tools. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:09:55
Yes, it is my fault that the rent is going up in brooklyn and los angeles. Has nothing to do with the fact that some landlords are not longer renting out their units and up to 30% of available units are only being used for illegal short term hotels.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:38:40
The love for the 1% in this thread is CRAZY. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 08:20:56
The first one is pretty good, but doesn't that saying carry a pretty negative connotation now thanks to that HBO doc?
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:09:32
I didn't say I can't afford it.
I'm kind of shocked by these responses. Shilling for a company that doesn't give a fuck about the neighborhoods they exploit. 
I guess I'll assume you own some apartments somewhere and are now earning triple. Congrats.
@_date: 2015-03-08 08:16:56
Checking out that tee.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:04:53
I should move so rich people can stay in an illegally rented apartment rather than a hotel. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:40:12
So what makes a temporary rise magnificent for you? I'm lost.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:49:51
I just gave my first youtube tip last night! And i agree with other sin this thread that you have to be careful about using the right names. Someone else even has an account called ChangeTip (but you can clearly tell by the icon which it is supposed to be).

A lot of good vibes in this thread.

Dude, FUCK AIRBNB. They are the reason that all of my friends' rents go up so much every year.

It was 300 for like less than a minute. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:18:54
Wow, how much money have you pocketed from those 20% jumps?
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:13:11
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:52:09
I didn't say you did. I asked how you use it without.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:33:41
You are the man! Thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:45:23
Oh. Have you rethunk your strategy at all?
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:30:50
True, i get your point. It's way too early for anyone to rely on the value of bitcoin. Still, i'm working on an ecommerce site that will accept bitcoin and keep the $ in bitcoin.

Ayooo! I'm trying to spread some on youtube this week so this would help!
