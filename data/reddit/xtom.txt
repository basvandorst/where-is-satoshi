It's not the 5%, it's how many people are going to try to pull out once Mt.Gox is fixed. It will affect the numbers, cause a crash, then others will bail because they're afraid of the crash.

This idea has come up in a thousand conversations amongst thousands of nerds over the past few months.

A Senator just announced there's a place you can buy drugs online, and that there is a way to launder money in an untraceable way. They just gave this *incredible* publicity. If they can't shut it down, it will be a slap in the face every single day.
I just moved $750 more to my account. Can't wait to switch it into BitCoins Monday. When the takedown fails, this shit is going to explode.

Most of our money laundering/taxation laws work on the idea of paper trails and the ability to subpoena. Ways to transfer large amounts of money are always tied to an identity because that's the audit trail investigators need if something goes awry. 
BitCoin not being tied directly to an identifiable person is a big, big deal.
Another interesting tidbit: Up until this point the largest obstacle to obscuring financial trails has been the fact that anything of any significant scale would either be too slow or too expensive because of the fees associated with everything from bank wires to ATM machines. With BitCoin transaction fees are only used to increase speed, and transactions are fast enough that money can bounce through a huge number of accounts to obscure the trail.
...And that's not even getting into the more central ideas about not having a country backing the currency and not having a central bank, both of which would also have tremendous impacts.

It doesn't sound like they're against the idea. They just want to have their legal ducks in order. No responsible business, charity or group is going to go into a situation without knowing what their risks are.

To be as comprehensive as the tax data they can get from banks it would require Facebook to start taking in Social Security numbers. Which I highly doubt they will do.

My friend had an interesting idea: 
BitCoin is backed by the collective value the global economy puts on (semi) anonymous transactions. The value of transferring money via an unfreezable, unmonitorable means.
The more our overall money supply is manipulated, monitored and controlled, the more value BitCoin will have. It is the "equal but opposite reaction" to our current financial policy.

As always, I will be buying.
With BitCoin it's good to remember these traders are amateur for the most part. They change their position with the wind, panicked by the slightest breeze.
Mt. Gox is not bitcoin. It's a utility, and one that will be replaced eventually if it keeps failing. It's impact on the market will likely be immediately, not ever-lasting.
@_date: 2011-07-07 17:50:58
As bitcoin grows there's more and more targets and it will become harder and harder to make a substantial DDOS. More mining pools, more exchanges, etc. 
For now there is a risk. DDOS can affect supply and demand. Take out a few exchanges and price can rise at the others based on the increased demand.
We're in the wild west right now gentlemen. Put on your big boy pants or GTFO.
Edit: It's worth noting there will always be a risk at the top.

Because it's pretty basic reasoning skills. I'm not sure where the disconnect is, so I'm going to walk through all of it.
 People have little incentive to get a currency businesses don't accept, but supply-end Businesses have *even less incentive* to adopt a currency people don't have. It's a bit of a catch-22 by default.
You have to overcome one of those hurdles if you want to convince the second group to implement. This means there has to be an advantage or incentive to someone so you can push one side into adopting without the other.
There's a few ways to jumpstart one side without the other, but speculation and trading like we're seeing with BitCoin(speculation and rapid trading) is one of the ways  to do it
Once the new currency is in the hands of consumers, it represents a *large potential for profit* to businesses. There's a lot of people with a lot of money and nowhere to spend it. That is obviously a good situation for a business to be in.
So a few businesses see this potential market, expand into  it and making a killing(Llama socks!). Other businesses see this and want a piece of the pie. So they join in. And just like magic, you have adoption.

They will probably shut this down and it will have nothing to do with "Monopoly" status.
It's about taxes. It's *always* about taxes.

The blackmarket will keep it alive for now while mainstream adoption picks up. Just wait for the "UltraCart" plugins and whatnot to start coming in. It will get adoption when it just requires clicking a checkbox.
You need users before you get businesses. Normally that's a problem, but in this case the users are showing up. The businesses will follow.
...I'm already looking into how to accept bitcoin for the [legal] product I sell.
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:03:41


I suspect that a lot of what they're looking into is Tax related, which wouldn't really be a specialty there.
BitCoin isn't "currency" as it's commonly defined. That would create a huge number of problems when trying to calculate income, assets, etc. Additionally, you're supposed to keep receipts for the IRS for many years. What are bitcoins "receipts"? Screenshots? Vague records?
If you're going to make your primary job suing the government and large corporations, these types of things are important. The government isn't going to pull any punches if EFF pisses them off.

Too many big shakeups past this one could cause a bit of stigma in bitcoin and a big drop in confidence. I hope it settles for a bit after this, but I'm surely going to take advantage of this one.

MtGox went down temporarily. Caused a surge of customers to go elsewhere, which caused the price spike.
@_date: 2011-06-30 17:51:00
And the consumer adoption that comes with that speculation brings in businesses.
You need a base that has the currency to get websites to accept it. Speculation created that base.
