Email isn’t technically “teleporting letters”, but if I wanted to describe the implications of email to someone 30 years ago, that’s how I would describe it. I guess we’ll know who’s right in 10-20 years. Good luck. :)

You’re not thinking about it abstract enough. A “cryptographically secure linked list resistant to mutability” is the “how,” not the “what.” The blockchain made the “what” possible (bitcoin). What bitcoin IS is weightless gold that can teleport. The “how” is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, how much do you believe weightless gold that can teleport is worth?

It’s invisible gold that can teleport

I try not to assume anything, and there will always be the possibility that someone still has the keys to them. But from a statistics standpoint, the longer they go without moving, the less likely it is that anyone still controls them, and it’s been nearly 10 years now. But that possibility will always be there.

The kind that leaves everyone screaming and shitting their pants.

Bitcoin is gold that can teleport and the human species is trying to figure out how much that’s worth.

Doesn’t matter. It’ll all work itself out in time. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show.

That doesn't even make sense.
