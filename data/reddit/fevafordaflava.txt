I don't know how to correctly write how that one guy who you can barely understand says it.

I work at a bank. The people who get charged are the ones who do it over and over again. If you overdraft once or even twice a year you can get the fee reversed as a courtesy. However, if you keep over drawing your damn account you are going to get charged. It is not that hard to keep a positive balance.

What, responsible with my money? If you are having trouble budgeting, check out mint or other apps that can help you not overspend.

Anyone else seeing MTGOX creating a bitcoin crash as large as the 1929 stock exchange crash?

This is terrible advice. Never cash out and sell everything when the markets are low, you lose out on your investments. The only time you should cash out is if you are retired and need that money to survive.
For everyone else, ride it out. The markets will eventually go back up and for the time being you only lost money "on paper" and not in reality.  
If the markets actually do crash l everything is going to be worthless anyways and every country is going to be fucked, which we know will not happen.

I've never had a customer ask that before. I would presume we would either say no or take down your information and not do anything with it. Like I stated earlier, we were pretty lazy as tellers. We only did the bare minimum work that was required because we were paid shit.

I work at a bank. A CTR is only mandatory for cash transactions above $10k. However, banks do have the option to file a CTR for anything between $3k-$10k. When I used to be a teller, we only did it if we felt the transaction was sketchy. No one ever wanted to do extra work.

As in, the customer telling the teller "please file a CTR for my transaction?"
