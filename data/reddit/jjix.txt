If this guy really is Satoshi -- and yes, I know his damn name is 'Satoshi' but I mean THE Satoshi -- then in all likeliness he knew this day was going to come. 
Satoshi understood Bitcoin profoundly, and he foresaw the different stages of its evolution and social acceptance. Early he encouraged people not to be too zealous in its promotion to give it a calm environment to grow in. He predicted later that one day it would become, essentially, the world reserve currency. He also probably knew that the day would come when it would be catapulted into the popular consciousness, and that at that point the hunt for Satoshi would become very strong. And, indeed, that is precisely what happened. 
If he had really been intent on hiding, he would have taken much more extreme measures than using his real name, which would inevitably lead to someone discovering him. Therefore, knowing that he would have anticipated a lot of effort would eventually be spent into looking for him AND the fact that he hid in the open like a man who has nothing to hide leads me to no other conclusion than he knew this day would come.
But if he knew this day would come, it is unlikely that he wasn't prepared for it, and therefore unlikely that it will "destroy his life". This is a man who thought through every possibility when designing bitcoin, if this guy really is Satoshi then he has already thought through his preparations for this day.

I think you may be confused. Mycelium and Blockchain may be online, but as long as your private keys were generated offline and never touch the internet that is all that matters. 
You generate the keys offline with a computer, ideally with hard drive detached, using an Ubunutu CD (and a USB stick holding your key generating software). Blockchain.info is then used for monitoring the balance in these addresses. My private keys never touch the internet, I simply use blockchain.info as a convenient way of tracking these addresses by scanning the public addresses into the wallet. That is the purpose of "watch only" addresses.
Mycelium is for the "checking account" solution, as opposed to the "savings account" described above. With Mycelium, you can reuse paper wallets, which makes them far less secure than pure cold storage, but it is still a kind of cold storage in that your keys are not being held anywhere online, except temporarily when you go to spend, which is more secure than keeping your money in a hot wallet. Hope this clarifies!

The problem is that it is illegal to create a privatized currency. This is why e-gold and many of the other bitcoin predecessors were shut down. Shutting them down is easy to do when they are issued by a private company. Bitcoin works because it is decentralized and no single entity owns or controls it. 
Within their own ecosystem, however, these companies are free to create a kind of "currency", where you buys credits and then can use those credits within their system to buy stuff, ideally providing a more frictionless system. That kind of thing wouldn't really be a much of an innovation nor a threat to bitcoin, however, anymore than a casino chip is a threat to the dollar. 
The real question is whether a huge company like Google could create a new crypto-currency, not actually owned by them but yet heavily pre-mined by them, and then promote the usage of that coin using the great power and influence they wield. That is to say, if crypto goes mainstream, will we then see a mainstream rush which essentially recreates the current phenomena of creating alt coins, only on a much more massive scale with mainstream companies promoting different coins the way a developer promotes his pump-and-dump craptocurrency? I don't know . . .

Using the blockchain.info android app, it is as simple as selecting "scan private key", scanning the private key QR code, select "sweep" and that's it, your wallet will receive the funds. 
BTW, Blockchain also has a very convenient feature that lets you keep the addresses of your paper wallets in your Blockchain wallet so that you can see the balance while keeping your private keys paper only. Simply select "scan watch only address" and then scan the QR code of the public address(es) in your paper wallet. Now you can keep a complete balance of your funds, while having them stored safely offline immune from hackers. 
Finally, the android app Mycelium is super convenient and easy to use with paper wallets. It lets you reuse paper addresses by erasing the private key from memory when used and sending the change automatically back to the same address. While you don't want to reuse paper address for long term storage, for money you intend to spend, but don't feel like keeping in a vulnerable wallet, this is a perfect solution. 
I keep the majority of my money in encrypted paper wallets, money that I intend to spend in reusable non-encrypted paper wallets, and pocket change/cash in my Mycelium wallet.

I remember reading an article somewhere in which the author pointed out the "stages" of fraud as well as what we should expect from MtGox (if this is indeed a case of fraud). One of the keys stages, he argued, was that the fraudster eventually offers back a portion of the customers "lost" funds, usually explained through some sort of fortunate happenstance. The customers are so grateful just to get something back that a great deal of pressure is taken off the back of the fraudster. This technique, he argued, is used time and time again in such cases. I remember reading that and have been waiting to see if that partial return would occur.

I would be completely behind this. While I do understand the process of using different denominations, I am concerned by the subtle, yet very real power Doge coin has as a medium for tipping over bitcoin because of the large number of coins. Multiple denominations is only confusing, especially while people are still struggling to grasp the whole idea of crypto-coins. 
I also find it fascinating this idea that the currency could actually inflate collectively all at once, rather than as a means for redirecting wealth out of the pockets of the many and returning it to the pockets of the few, as is the case with fiat money.

And that is precisely how it is supposed to work. We value bitcoin, therefore we invest in it, our investment helps to make it thrive. If it does thrive, those who valued it early will be most rewarded because they are responsible for its success. 
That is true of any type of investment, yet for some reason bitcoin skeptics are convinced that it is Tulip Mania 2.0 because bitcoin has no intrinsic value. 
That just shows how much of a different reality they are living in from me. To me, Bitcoin not only has intrinsic value, it is arguable the single most valuable thing I have ever invested in. The reason I believe this is going to be a revolution that utterly changes the world is because I see the tremendous value in bitcoin. If I thought for a second that it was just a bubble being held up by a lot of promise and hype I would get out immediately. 
Some people say it is the underlying technology that is valuable, not the currency. This would be a way of recognizing that the tech is innovative and has value, while still maintaining the idea that the currency is still a bubble. I don't agree. Block chain technology depends on there being a currency (in order to incentivize mining) -- it is the lifeblood of this technology -- which in turn depends on people placing faith in it in order to derive its value (faith is essentially the root of all value). This technology depends on the concept of value. Without value, it will not work, and we humans are the ones that inject the system with value. It is that basic concept that many skeptics can't get their mind wrapped around, despite the fact that all currency basically works this way.

"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model . . .
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party." 
                   -- Satoshi Nakamoto
The Bitcoin system will not and cannot work relying on trusted 3rd parties. Period. Why does no one get that?

Precisely. Innovation is happening through and on top of BTC. Nxtcoin and Ethereum may become serious competitors, but by the time some "powerful" entity comes around with the intent to create their own crypto, it will be too late. Very few people will even understand the industry with the sophistication of the actual developers of that industry. 
Furthermore, the design of crypto is the use of the block chain which has the sole purpose of creating a ledger that works without centralized control. Once you have central control you no longer need a block chain, once you don't have a block chain you no longer have a crypto-currency. This, again, makes me think the prevailing crypto-currencies of the future are likely the ones in existence today. Bitcoin's greatest vulnerability is simultaneously its greatest strength: being the first. Being the first means it is the most likely to succeed, but being the first also means it will take the brunt of attack from those who feel threatened by crypto, which could end up destroying it and allowing another crypto to rise to the top. 
Finally, Bitcoin being spent vs hoarded isn't a concern in my opinion. Hoarding causes the price to rise, once it reaches a certain point people spend it, when it lowers in price too much people hoard it. The overall trajectory of higher prices is essential to its adoption as it increases media coverage and merchant interest in accepting it. As more merchants accept it more people spend it. It is a self-sustaining cycle that will eventually result in a stable currency as we are used to thinking of them. But no crypto-currency can magically just start out as a stable currency, they must go through this growth process. We have never seen this natural process before, which causes people to be skeptical as they have nothing to compare it to.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:04:27
Exactly. To the layperson the concern isn't that the developers are debating over the code, that is healthy. The concern is that the developers may not share the vision of the future of Bitcoin that many of us have come to believe, and that parties like Counterparty and Mastercoin have inspired us to believe. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:34:42
Is it a "free ride" if it is increasing the value of bitcoin? The point is, if another alt coin provides this "service" and bitcoin does not, and the value of that alt coin skyrockets while bitcoins stagnates and falls, by the time anyone realizes why it will be too late. Bitcoin's advantage is not just in being first, it is in remaining first.

Is the whole point of this discussion that Eric Schmidt is secretly promoting litecoin? Or was it the idea that somehow the technologies associated with bitcoin could be used for other, "less disruptive" things? 
It seems like in the end you need a currency. That currency could be Bitcoin, that currency could be Ether, but avoiding the dramatic impact that crypto currency is going to have on the financial world seems unlikely. You can't have block chain technology without value underlying it, and that value is a currency. Yeah, maybe Bitcoin won't always be the top crypto, but that is rather irrelevant. When people criticize Bitcoin "fanatics" they are not saying "geeze, what a bunch of morons, they should be investing in Dogecoin!!!" They are criticizing our "belief" in cryptocurrency in general. For them, all crypto is basically "Bitcoin". So when people point out that the currency is actually foundational to the "value web", that you simply cannot have a value web without currency being "the first app", that is actually quite a profound insight into the very integral nature value has to this technology and all technologies that will be derived from it.

Your concerns are valid and justified. People like myself who are extremely excited about bitcoin are excited about its potential, which is enormous. It is a bit like people who were excited about the internet back in 1992. But like the internet of 1992, bitcoin isn't ready for prime time, it isn't ready for mainstream adoption. That is why people who start using bitcoin now are called "early adopters". 
Sticking with the internet analogy, when bitcoin adopters insist there isn't anything wrong with bitcoin per se, that the problems are with the surrounding ecosystem, it is like how the pre-web internet was excessively difficult for ordinary people to use. The problem wasn't with the internet per se, there was nothing wrong with the internet. The problem was that no one had yet developed the tools to make the internet fully accessible to the mainstream. It is like this with bitcoin. A great deal of innovation has to happen before bitcoin is ready for someone like you. Fortunately, that innovation is taking place as we speak. And like the internet of '92, where getting a connection was difficult and few people were using it, the bitcoin economy is still small with relatively few merchants accepting or using it. 
Price stability also will not exist in bitcoin for awhile. As BigChubbyCat wrote in Bitcoin Magazine:
"The role Bitcoin plays is a virtual currency. Unless the price of Bitcoin highly exceeds its intrinsic value of real purchasing power, the price will keep increasing. Suppose that the total amount of oil on the earth is 21 million tons. If Bitcoin can be considered money, the price of oil is 1 ton per Bitcoin. If someone gives a quote of 36 tons per Bitcoin, the purchasing power of Bitcoin is then overestimated and the price of oil is underestimated. The market can self-adjust via price discovery. The so-called liquidity shortage won’t actually happen, as the market price is wrong, rather than a currency shortage. So there is no need for a central bank or a flexible currency. Before supply and demand can reach an equilibrium, Bitcoin can be unstable, and thus any soaring or plummet of price is possible.
In other words, if the demand of Bitcoin quickly decreases or even disappears, the price would plummet just like that of the tulip. This is when Bitcoin cannot meet the four attributes mentioned above. Bitcoin is waiting for the test and approval of the market. If the market accepts it eventually, the theoretical unit price of Bitcoin would be equal to 1/21,000,000 of the total value of Bitcoin-denominated commodities. And if the price of Bitcoin is higher than that price, it is a purchasing power bubble, which could be adjusted by the market itself."

Miners make money in two ways: 1) they mine new coins into existence and 2) they receive the money from the transaction fees everyone is paying. 
The idea is that as the network grows, even if the transaction fees remain tiny, the number of transactions will explode thus providing a huge source of income that will largely negate the value of mining new coins into existence. Over time, the incentive to mine will be to tap into those transaction fees, mining new coins will just be an added bonus. By the time all coins have been mined, miners will have long forgotten about mining new coins anyway, they will be in it for the transaction fees.

As far as I am aware, no bitcoin wallet allows you to make in-app purchases using bitcoins. All they do is allow you to send and receive bitcoins. You implied there was more to the story by saying, "you can make a Bitcoin wallet app that doesn't support Bitcoin in-app purchases." I assumed, then, what you meant was that if a a third-party app allowed one to make in-app purchases by sending money to a given bitcoin address, you could design a bitcoin wallet that could somehow censor that process, block sending money to particularly companies, and I don't see how that could be done. 
As far as what you call the "iPay" rumor, what other explanation can there be? I find the "legal" explanations silly quite honestly. And even if that were the case, and Apple secretly favored bitcoin, why not issue a press release stating so, that they will willingly open their arms to bitcoin apps as soon as they gain some legal clarity? At the very least that would ease some of the Apple hate being generated around this issue. No. The reason they don't make a press release concerning their motives is because doing so wouldn't benefit them.

It is interesting, but in the end democracy and socialism essentially have the same goal. Assuming bitcoin proves itself to work as a currency, then there is really nothing standing in the way of creating an electronic voting system which would have far reaching implications for democracy. If, eventually, we had a system in which people voted directly on the issues, rather than elected politicians, we would have moved substantially in the direction of pure democracy of which you speak, which really is in principle a system in which the government IS the people.

Owning a bitcoin will be a very big deal, but not just because it indicates that you are rich.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency represent a dividing line between the new and old worlds. Right now people whose allegiance is basically with the old world are laughing at bitcoin. But soon enough as they realize bitcoin is here to stay that laughter will turn to anger, and eventually it will become outright hostility. This won't be simple smooth sailing to jupiter, there will be massive asteroid fields between here and there.There will be real tension in society and many people will seek to destroy bitcoin. It is the tension between the future and the past. Owning or not owning a bitcoin will indicate which side you are on.

They suspended withdrawals around the 10th of February, I believe. At the time they blamed TM for why they were suspending withdrawals and implored the bitcoin developers to fix the issue. I don't recall them indicating how long they believed this issue had been affecting them. 
Of course, halting withdrawals means that all of the money they lost due to TM would have had to have been lost prior to Feb 10. The research in this article shows that prior to that date, a total of around 386 -- that is not a typo, no zeros -- bitcoins were stolen using TM. Since no bitcoins could have been stolen from MtGox using TM after they halted withdrawals, we know TM can't explain the missing bitcoins. Assuming the research is accurate.

My guess is that this attack was from the same people who stole money from MtGox. They were basically done making money and wanted the Bitcoin community to wake the fvck up to the fact that there was a serious vulnerability in Bitcoin -- NOT MTGOX -- that everyone was just dismissing as nothing serious. 
This attack achieves nothing other than to whip the devs into fixing things. That is why I believe the attackers intention was -- at least with this attack -- beneficent. The real attack was using the same vulnerability to fool MtGox into sending the attackers tons of money.

I find it hard to believe that the "thieves" were anyone other than Mark Kerpeles himself. He has already demonstrated his character, his lies and manipulation, why should we think he isn't capable of it?
Seriously, how is it possible to just lose half a billion dollars from a small company like Gox? It just isn't possible. He must have stolen them. Right? It is the only logical explanation. "Incompetence" simply cannot explain half a billion dollars. That isn't to say other people weren't also stealing coins from Gox, but the bulk was likely Kerpeles himself. I suspect he chose to keep the transaction malleability vulnerability in place for a reason, additional hackers just gave him cover.

In exactly the same way that Silk Road made Bitcoin flourish in its earliest days, the exchanges have been important part of Bitcoin's growth. But in the same way Silk Road was ultimately a liability, the centralized exchanges are beginning to show that they are holding Bitcoin back more than they are helping. 
The problem is that the centralized exchanges are modeled after the hierarchical structures of the old world. They aren't part of the revolution. They require trust, which is precisely what Satoshi Nakamoto stated he was trying to avoid in the creation of Bitcoin. As long as they exist Bitcoin has several weak links in the chain. Not merely because they require trust which makes the entire Bitcoin ecosystem no stronger than the fiat ecosystem, but because the only way to make them work is to increase government regulations and oversight, which is just fundamentally contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin. These exchanges are essentially just banks, but banks without anything legal to keep them in check. As long as they exist Bitcoin will never explode into something much larger than anyone currently expects. 
Fortunately, decentralized replacements for these exchanges are already in the works based on Bitcoin 2.0 technologies (e.g., Mastercoin). The fact that these technologies are coming is only more reason to expect the collapse of these exchanges as they realize their time is limited, it could be very ugly. 
Decentralized exchanges will extend the power of Bitcoin. Instead of being weak links in the chain, they will be just the opposite, expand her power and security dramatically. A decentralized exchange essentially works in the same manner as Bitcoin itself, they will be the first example of how the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is a model for power structures of the future, not merely an interesting characteristic of the currency app. 
So this is all a way of saying that all of this needs to happen. We need the exchanges to collapse and perhaps it is best that they do so sooner than later as that will promote the urgency to change to another model. The greater danger would be to fall into a lazy degree of comfort with these exchanges making the transition to decentralized structures more difficult and allowing government regulation to encroach and threaten Bitcoin. 
I expect, in the end, the end of the centralized exchanges will be a bit like the end of Silk Road . . . an initial shock, followed by an explosion in the value of Bitcoin.

It doesn't make them "hitler", but saying that Apple is actively working to destroy bitcoin out of greed paints a very different picture than saying that they secretly love bitcoin, but are just afraid of legal liabilities.

@_date: 2014-02-07 03:55:00
The issue isn't whether I, as a consumer, have the choice to use another product. The issue is that app developers are now no longer FREE to compete within a huge portion of the market. They have been effectively banned. This kind of situation was rare prior to the internet, where one company had the power to completely block another company from competing within a huge portion of the market just by declaration. That used to be the power and domain of governments. But now that corporations like Apple have the power of governments to censor and regulate, how are they any different than governments?
People here keep defending Apple because of the "free market" and yet THAT is precisely what Apple is destroying, the free market. The free market means all app developers compete with one another and consumers choose which apps they want to use and which they don't. It is competition and the best product wins. Preventing products from even competing is censorship, plane and simple. And while censorship used to be purely in the domain of governments, the fact that this power now resides within private corporations who have no legal obligation to desist just shows how far our system of society has fallen into the realm in which the distinction between public and private have become increasingly meaningless. The only meaningful distinction now is between nodes of concentrated power and everyone else. 
Saying people have the right to switch from Apple to android just ignores the fact that such a change is a hugely inconvenient and frustrating process for most users, requiring a tremendous amount of energy. Most users haven't even heard of bitcoin, never mind are they prepared to make the leap into a foreign operating system just because a few apps aren't provided. 
If bitcoin is victorious eventually the free market may force Apple to change its policy. But the chances of bitcoin becoming victorious just declined greatly because of this censorship on Apple's part. Now all that need happen is for android and Windows to follow suit and bitcoin is more or less destroyed. This shouldn't even be theoretically possible, for censorship -- whether from governments or private corporations -- to effectively block innovation. Yet it is. I really fail to see the difference between what Apple is doing and what government regulators may attempt to do in the future, except to the extent that I view Apple as a far greater threat than government to Bitcoin's future because as far as the digital world is concerned, Apple is one of the major world governments.

I think you are right about 'wallet' being like a real world wallet, but I think addresses are better thought dollar bills (i.e., paper currency notes) than credit cards. The only caveat is that with Bitcoin you can make custom paper notes of any amount, as opposed to the fixed amounts of $1, $5, $20, $50, etc. That is to say, addresses ARE bitcoins, from a purely conventional point of view.
I think this is important because people often ask the question, "well, what ARE bitcoins? Can I hold a bitcoin in my hands?" And the answer actually is "yes", that is, to the same degree you can hold a dollar in your hands. If you print out an public/private key pair assigned 1 bitcoin it is essentially a physical representation of a bitcoin, just exactly as a dollar bill is a physical representation of a dollar.
The reason it is confusing is because no one ever had a reason to make the distinction between a dollar and its physical representation (i.e., a dollar bill). It is natural to thus think that somehow if you are holding the bill you are holding a dollar, when in fact no one has ever "held" a a "true" dollar anymore than anyone has ever held an actual bitcoin.
This is important for understanding why physical bitcoins are possible. They need three things: an embedded hidden address/private key, a tamper proof mechanism, and a way of blocking further bitcoin input into that address. Once you have those things there is really no reason physical bitcoins couldn't become used just like fiat paper.

Also, do we even know that bitcoin is nothing but a "currency". Perhaps cryptocurrency is simply something new.

Bitcoin isn't difficult to use, it is difficult to use safely. If security wasn't a concern bitcoin would be spreading like wildfire, it is so simple. But because security is on your shoulders it goes from being simple and elegant to a technical nightmare (for ordinary users). That is to say, it is simple to use, but very difficult to use safely. 
Of course, if the security of fiat money was entirely on our shoulders it wouldn't be easy to use either. Imagine if it were legal to steal people's money, the way it is with bitcoin. Suddenly, just the act of standing in line to pay for something would become a security hazard as the guy behind you could legally grab your wallet. Buying an expensive item would be particularly nerve-wracking, as you worried about whether the merchant would actually give you the said item or just take your money and run, legally. 
Of course, laws are not likely to save bitcoin. Indeed, the promise of bitcoin is that it can achieve the kind of stability and security that the fiat world enjoys WITHOUT laws -- i.e., without a trust based system -- by instead relying on software. But if it is not possible to design software that largely eliminates the security issues, then either bitcoin will die, or international laws will be applied.
I think people just assumed the security issues would work themselves out, but actually security IS the issue that will define the future of bitcoin. That future will either be stronger government regulations than the world has ever seen (i.e., international laws), or a software based system that proves it possible to achieve law and order without government. Time will tell.

If you have a physical bitcoin you can, same way you can flip a penny. Remember, physical coins are merely representations of currency. A penny is a note that says "this is worth .01 dollars". But in itself it is just a piece of metal. No one has actually ever flipped an actual .01 dollar. A penny is connected to .01 actual dollars through the law and social agreement.
Bitcoins are exactly like fiat currency in this regard. Physical bitcoins are connected to actual bitcoins through a hidden/tamper-proof keypair. If you have one, you can flip it and eat your pizza.

I think we make a mistake when we pose this issue in all or nothing terms, i.e., it is either ready for mass adoption or its not. I think it is more like a gradual progression, moving from the extreme tech savvy people who initially adopted it, and over years moving into a less tech savvy audience. Today, bitcoin users are all still very tech savvy compared to ordinary people, but they are much less so than they used to be. The tools to use bitcoin today are much more user friendly than they used to be, but they are still a far cry from mainstream ready. With each passing interval of time, bitcoin becomes a little more mainstream, a little easier to use, a little safer to use, and the appropriate audience comes in.
There is really no need to slow things down, natural barriers are erected that keep out people who are not ready, including disasters like MtGox. People who jump the bitcoin bandwagon today are for the most part still very unique people, people who are not mainstream. These are very early days. So when people in the reddit forums sound idealistic and "crazy", there really isn't a problem because the types of people who are joining bitcoin today are the types of people that need to hear that kind of idealism. If you don't have a bit of idealism, you will just become disappointed at how unready bitcoin is. If you don't have a bit of idealism, you probably aren't yourself ready. So the idealism is actually one of the many natural "gate keepers" that prevents too many people from getting on board before "their time". These people see the idealism and are turned off . . . but that is actually good news. ;-)
Eventually bitcoin will be so mainstream that we will lament the loss of these days of idealism.

Just because the coin has no cap doesn't mean it will always inflate. For money to inflate, its value must decrease. Cryptocurrency, being infinitely, or near infinitely, divisible means there will always be plenty money, yet if the value of the currency increases it is still deflationary, regardless of whether more coins are mined or a decimal is moved in one direction.

+1 for that. The problem is not simply that people trusted their money with the wrong people, the problem is trust itself, that is, trust as the basis for the crypto system. If bitcoin is going to succeed, 2.0 technologies that remove trust from the system are going to have to take off. Exchanges that allow trading peer-2-peer without a middle man holding your money and contractual agreements that are embedded in the code rather than a legal framework. Trust needs to be removed and replaced by math and code.

I think the big names all have plans to implement their own currencies that work within their own ecosystems. Sort of like Steam Wallet funds. Basically these internal currencies will serve to make micro-transactions much cheaper. Paying $1 for a MP3 download or a rental video just isn't lucrative while they have to process credit card fees. They want a solution to the friction caused by credit cards as much as everyone else does, but a currency that is internal to their ecosystems would be far more lucrative than one like bitcoin. Bitcoin opens things up, a single currency controlled by a powerful company eliminates competition. 
You have to remember, these entities are super giants. Amazon has a virtual monopoly over retail. If they can come up with a "Amazon Wallet" or "Amazon Credits" these credits will effectively become as powerful as dollars, and Amazon will have the ability to act like a bank in addition to what they already do. Such a currency would be entirely controlled by Amazon and would strongly discourage customers from ever shopping with their competitors again. The idea is that the customer buys a certain number of credits, and then from there on uses those credits to shop -- with all sorts of advantages and perks -- instead of a credit card. It would effectively lock customers into the Amazon ecosystem, and make shopping elsewhere even more cumbersome by comparison than it already is.
In comes bitcoin swooping down to save the day, just before the evil villain is about to unleash his ultimate plan at world domination. Bitcoin is a universal currency, not one controlled by a company. It allows all companies to compete with one another, not one company to become the one company that rules them all. It offers all the advantages that Apple and Amazon hope to make possible with their private currencies, but it can also be used anywhere, not just within a certain company's ecosystem. Especially once bitcoin 2.0 technologies allow for the inclusion of shipping addresses in the bitcoin transaction, suddenly shopping at tiger direct becomes as easy as Amazon. One click shopping, literally, everywhere. It could literally save the little guy over night. One of Amazon's greatest advantages over everyone else was the fact that once you had shopped there once, the friction was vastly less than anywhere else. 
Bitcoin promises to allow secondary players, like overstock.com, who were on the verge of annihilation, to compete. If bitcoin becomes widespread, the entire bitcoin ecosystem may find itself in direct competition with the global internet giants who were hoping to rule the world by forcing all economic activity to go through their internal systems. Just look at how Apple intends to literally control the marketplace of competition between app developers. Governments don't even have that kind of power. But bitcoin will offer us a choice. You will either choose to shop exclusively with Amazon or Apple . . . or you will shop with everyone else. It is the war between centralized control and decentralization. 
People keep saying the game changer will be when one of the internet giants accept bitcoin. In my opinion, the giants will be the last ones coming to the party.

"At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug. As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared. We believe that there is a high probability that these bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures. On the same day (24th), we found out large discrepancies between the amount of cash held in financial institutions and the amount deposited from our users. The amounts are still under investigation and may vary but they approximate JPY 2.8 billion. We are investigating the causes of these problems. Since there are probably a variety of causes including hacking by third parties, we need to investigate a huge amount of transaction reports in order to establish the truth. As of this date, we cannot confirm the exact amount of missing deposit funds and the total amount of bitcoins which disappeared. "

Took a break for about a year and came back . . . most of my money had evaporated due to inflation. Luckily I had invested in some items before I left, however, which kept up with inflation, so this kept me still in the running.

I have not read anything that indicates MtGox suffered from greater issues with malleability than the reference client, perhaps you are right, I don't know. 
The point is that greater or less issues with malleability isn't the issue, what makes the attack successful is simply the ability to fool the exchange into thinking they failed to send a customer their money so they end up sending it twice, or something similar to this. It may be that Gox's internal software made it easier to fool them, I don't know. 
What I do know is that it is very easy to fool someone if no one is aware of or expecting such a trick. The reason the other exchanges weren't affected is because they were aware of and expecting the trick. 
What disturbs me is the way these exchanges, and the rest of the community, tried to essentially pretend that they had always been aware of the threat and had taken every precaution against it all along. "It was all MtGox's incompetence." Because, that was a bunch of baloney, as the very next day proved hilariously. 
I don't know if these exchanges didn't want to cause panic, and no doubt ordinary bitcoiners didn't want to see a massive price drop, so it was natural to be angry at Gox for making public the details of the attack. 
But to me, that is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the essence of open source, it is the idea that making things public, transparent, and available for all to see -- to tell the truth -- keeps us all far safer than secrecy and lies and deception (the status quo of the old world). Yesterday proved that. And, from my perspective as a bitcoiner, I believe MtGox should be rewarded for having turned from the darkside of secrecy and finally just spoke the truth. That is why I have been defending them here. But perhaps a centralized exchange is inherently incapable of transparency, I don't know.

Fair enough, up voted for an intelligent post. But I personally think currency is more essential to the technology than implied. Indeed, any block chain technology requires a currency at its base which means one cannot simply talk about the currency in purely economic terms since it is simultaneously the key component of this new technology. All protocols built on top of Bitcoin, for example, will fundamentally depend on the security of the network which in turn depends on the currency 'bitcoin' which in turn must have value in order for the network to survive. So as more and more technology is built on top of Bitcoin, using protocols like Mastercoin and Counterparty, the value of bitcoins themselves will become essential. 
In some ways, the "intrinsic value" everyone looks for in bitcoins is tricky because we are used to intrinsic value lying in something in the past -- something that has an older historical value that is pointed to by the money, so to speak, like gold -- whereas with bitcoin it lies in the future, in the future development and expansion of the network and its dependent technologies. 
But the critical thing is, that value, that future value, cannot be separated from the technology. Right now it is understandable that we are under the illusion that it can be precisely because that technology has only scratched the surface in terms of development. But in the future, when the Bitcoin network is vast, and a thousand 2.0 currencies are built on top of it, derivative markets, distributed exchanges, stocks, DAOs, and on and on . . . it will be clear that the currency could never be separated from the technology.

You make good points, but I don't think you -- and many others of course -- fully grasp the potential of cryptocurrency. Right now it is like the internet before the web. But once the equivalent of the "web" is created for bitcoin, it will be possible to make a transaction between two people with minimal to zero trust involved using software.
Think of it this way. Have you ever played an online video game? In many online games, trade between parties is possible. I give you a certain amount of gold, you in turn give me a shiny new virtual sword, or whatnot. None of this involves trust. I don't have to trust that the person I just handed my money to will honor their side and hand over the sword, because the software guarantees the trade does not go through until both parties have checked the agree box. And, what is more important, anytime one of the two parties updates the items being offered, the checked box automatically unchecks, making it practically impossible for one person just to "keep the money and run". Something like this is perfectly possible with bitcoin, as it is a programmable currency, and is already in the works. Technologies like this would make bitcoin far more popular than it is today.
You can imagine such technologies being used in an online exchange, where software handles the transactions without any third parties being involved or necessary.
Of course, this won't work when trading fiat to bitcoin, a task that would require further innovation to ever become possible, but it certainly would be a very big step in the direction I am speaking of. 
Look, I know many libertarians love bitcoin, but I am not myself a libertarian, nor have I ever been. This basic premise of creating an economy that minimizes trust has far reaching implications that go way beyond avoiding the "messy passions of society." Small businesses will be able to compete with the mega-giants (whose success has been largely dependent on the fact that consumers trust them) and economic possibilities for individuals will emerge that were previously reserved only for large institutions. Smart contracts will allow contracts to be binding in the code, rather than relying on laws and regulations to make them so. An excellent article on the subject can be found here:

The truth is, if they were actually interested in making money this way, they probably would have a much easier time and greater reward by simply investing in bitcoin and then pumping it. The moment google promoted bitcoin the price would sore.
You see, there is a real problem here. These big companies have the ability to greatly influence the price of bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, and yet there is nothing preventing them from investing like mad in them either, a kind of ultimate insider trading. I don't know if there are laws against this sort of thing, but it is an example of how capitalism starts to break down as certain players become too powerful. 
Once these big players get involved, I worry the "free market" will get so twisted and perverted we won't even recognize what comes out the other end.

If the banks are too big to fail, then of course they need to be bailed out, that is the definition of "too big to fail", it means we can't let them fail. The problem is not that we didn't let them fail, the problem is that they are too big to fail.
This is precisely why centralized exchanges will not and cannot be the future of bitcoin. Centralized exchanges become too big to fail, and then the entire bitcoin ecosystem is vulnerable to attack simply by attacking that centralized institution or institutions. Furthermore, our individual wealth is vulnerable from the said institutions themselves. These institutions will have the power to manipulate the currency and the entire system will become dependent on trust, which was the opposite of Satoshi's vision. Government regulation will not solve this because, among many reasons, government regulations are impotent against "too-big-to-fail" institutions. Only decentralized solutions can provide security, reliability, and stability to the system.

What will arise from the ashes of Bitcoin will be . . . Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin needs secure and sophisticated backups of the blockchain that will allow her to be rebooted with everyone's money intact if anything serious should happen. She also needs a more fluid ability to be updated and evolve, a bitcoin beta version that coincides with the live version where updates can be tested and eventually ported over. Financial incentives can encourage people to become beta testers. 
With these bitcoin will be unstoppable, and from the ashes of bitcoin 1.0 will just arise 2.0, and then 3.0, and then 4.0. Bitcoin is just in her infancy, the amount of evolution promised ahead is epic.

Imagine a situation where there is a huge natural disaster, like a Tsunami, that has caused complete chaos in your city. No law and order, no one is going to rescue you, it is every man for himself. Then, in the midst of this chaos, imagine that you notice the vault to the local bank had been smashed and money is pouring out into the streets. No one will arrest you if you take some, no one will see you, no one will know as long as you only take a small enough amount to hide it.
That is, in a nutshell, what it must be like working for these exchanges (MtGox, BTC-e, Bitstamp, etc). There is no law and order, no one is going to arrest you if you steal some money. At worst, you will get fired. There is nothing standing between you and the money, it is mostly stored in paper wallets. All that is required is a sufficient amount of chaos to cause the stolen transactions to get lost in the mix. And, besides, if you don't do it, you already know that half your fellow employees are doing it.
There can never be centralized exchanges without laws. Laws are what keeps fiat money afloat, software is what keeps crypto afloat. That is why decentralized exchanges are inevitable.

Well, that is what I am saying, MtGox processed the transactions unknowingly, and everyone else shut things down before they did. I doubt that this was because everyone else was tracking their transactions in a more rigorous manner than Gox. If exchanges like Bitstamp had such rigorous tracking of transactions, why did they shut down withdrawals? 
What transaction malleability does is it allows you to fake zero confirm transactions. It allows you to pretend a payment occurred when it didn't, or didn't occur when it did. The possibilities for fooling people with this power are endless. Now, of course, if you wait long enough -- like, days -- eventually it all gets sorted out. I know my Enjoy Sochis are finally disappearing one by one. But within that time frame so much mischief can occur. 
For example. I could walk into a coffee shop that accepts bitcoin, pay for a coffee, mutate the transaction, and then buy three more coffees and a cake with the change from that previous transaction. Since the initial transaction was mutated, the 2nd payment is invalid, yet by the time the owners of the coffee shop realize that I am long gone. That is, unless coffee shops are going to demand a single confirmation -- i.e., 10 minutes -- before they will give you your drinks. 
This problem is huge and cannot simply be patched up by forcing the standard wallets to only make payments from confirmed sources, because nothing is stopping the malicious individual from writing his or her own wallet software. 
The problem is with bitcoin itself, and it needs to be fixed. And not only because it needs to be fixed, but because bitcoin needs to prove that it is capable of evolving. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:06:56
The answer is obvious, you guys are proof that hiding the coins in plain sight is simply smarter than trying to move them. You completely believe in the incompetence argument as a result, which would be precisely the intention. What is the difference between a lost key and a stolen one? The only difference is whether you believe the person who claims to have "lost" it or not. If you believe them, they are innocent and "incompetent", if you don't they are a thief. I don't believe anything from Karpeles. Technically, there is no difference between lost or stolen. 
A "lost" private key is the perfect hiding spot really. Then the question becomes, do you believe them or not. You guys trust Mark, I don't. I did! I believed him all along, while everyone else was with pitchforks I believed him when he said he was going to restart bitcoin withdrawals. But he didn't, he lied. Now you guys are putting down the pitchforks precisely at the time when those pitchforks are most needed. 
And the fact that he has so consistently deceived and lied, suggests to me that believing that he simply "lost" the keys is far from the "simplest explanation". The simplest explanation is the explanation that is consistent with everything we have seen . . . deception. 
Furthermore, it stretches all credulity the idea that someone can simply lose that kind of money due to incompetence. Sure, it is very convenient to believe that, we want to believe that. We want to believe that kind of evil can't happen in bitcoin land. But it is utterly unbelievable. It doesn't make logical sense that someone could lose that kind of money by accident. Ooops, I lost the keys to half a billion dollars? No, not possible. 
Finally, the incompetence argument shines an extremely negative light on bitcoin, the idea that you can erase hundreds of millions of dollars with the wrong keystroke is precisely what most people fear, and this incompetence argument just strokes that fear and takes advantage of it. The reason this heist will work is because people don't understand bitcoin. They think a bug in the code can cause a "whoops, I just erased a billion dollars honey!" Who will touch bitcoin with that kind of image?

What was the advantage of paper money over precious metal coins? The obvious answer may have been "it is lighter", but the real implications of it extended far beyond "it is lighter". It gave rise to modern banking and indeed modern civilization.  
Likewise, the obvious advantage of bitcoin is that it is "lighter" than "conventional currencies" but the real advantages are simply not known yet. That is to say, it is clear that it lays a foundation for tremendous innovation, but what that innovation will look like we still don't know. One thing is for sure, though . . . bitcoin won't simply settle for being a internet substitute for traditional currency anymore than the web settled for being a substitute for magazines. 
The main thing people don't realize is that bitcoin is programmable money, which means all sorts of financial digital innovations will be built on top of cryptocurrency. Ownership of physical objects, like a vehicle, will be integrated into the blockchain, so that I will be able to rent a car for a day and have the keys to the ignition all in one simple immediate transaction, as a simple example off the top of my head. I will be able to borrow money from a network of individuals who choose to invest in my future and the network itself will take care of guaranteeing that they get returns on the investment should I succeed without any need to reference legal entities. I will be able to purchase items from any online store and have them immediately sent to my address with a single scan, never entering any information, even if I have never used that store before nor entered any personal information. I will be able to invest in startup companies from the ground floor as an ordinary individual as simply as I can currently buy stock in Google. I will be able to give complete strangers money through the internet for whatever reason without having to provide my credit card information or personal information. Companies can be formed without centralized points of control that work through blockchain democratic consensus. Small retail stores will be able to compete with the mega giants because the ease of shopping with them will be equal. The fluidity of starting businesses and participating in business as investors will be terrifically improved. And I will be able to buy a coke from a vending machine for someone across the globe with the push of a button. :-) Really, I am probably talking about some pretty superficial stuff compared to what will be possible. 
Of course, bitcoin is nowhere near these innovations, but it has laid the foundation in the same way the internet of 1990 laid the foundation form the web in 1994. You really can't understand the advantages of bitcoin without projecting into the future somewhat, just as you wouldn't have been able to appreciate the advantages of the internet by simply looking at its current state in 1990. 
The essential advantages of bitcoin are technological, that is why everyone always points to them. But the technology doesn't impress many people because they fail to see that the technology is a foundation for things much larger, it isn't an end in itself. That is one reason I am not comfortable even calling Bitcoin a currency. That is like calling the internet a fax machine.

In China censorship is done by the government. Here (the US), it is largely done by private corporations like Apple. The end result eventually becomes more or less the same. The problem is hierarchical concentrations of power, whether that be government, banks, or corporations. Eventually they all merge into one super-structure, in which distinctions between a private corporation and the government becomes meaningless. When the government passes regulations to prevent competition in a sector controlled by some powerful company that essentially uses their power to buy politicians, where is the distinction?  How is that any different than a country like China where the government owns most corporations? Bickering over whether government or corporations are to blame for society's woes is like two dogs fighting over scraps. The problem is the entire system of top-down, hierarchical power structures in which a tiny few controls virtually everything and then leave the rest of us to fight over the leftovers. Just as the feudal system eventually failed to offer enough freedom, modern systems are resulting in such a massive concentration of power in the hands of a tiny few that this trajectory just isn't sustainable short of a 1984-like scenario. 
The reason I find the cryptocurrency movement so exciting is precisely because for the first time I can actually envision an alternative to the top-down model we have grown up with. A model of society that promises distributed power structures, not hierarchical ones, whether that be in the areas of finance, government, or private companies. 
But this future will never be possible as long as people are convinced that all we need is the complete victory of private companies over government or vice versa. Because whether a government owns everything, or a corporation (or two) owns everything, it is essentially the same thing.

No need to be sorry. If you don't see it, you don't see it. Either way we will likely know in a few years. 
BTW: It isn't the fact that bitcoin is "data" that makes bitcoin unique. It is the fact that that data is both not controlled by any central authority and is singular in existence (i.e., copies are not possible), making it objective, as opposed to something that someone is just making up. So, for example, let us compare a chair in the real world to a chair that appears in a video game, like World of Warcraft. Both chairs are made up, both represent data, but the physical chair cannot simply be "unmade" at a whim the way the WoW chair can because the physical chair exists in objective space, it is not controlled by a central authority that can dictate whether it exists or not. 
Bitcoin is the first unit of data on the internet that no longer works like a chair in a video game, but instead works like a chair in real life. You may not see the practical advantages of that now, but eventually it will become self-evident.

That is because Gox actually had money stolen from them, so they may have bigger issues. The reason they had money stolen was because the attack wasn't recognized until the attackers had already fooled Gox into sending payments multiple times to the attackers. Had Gox not informed the Bitcoin community of this danger, likely the other exchanges would have suffered the same fate. But because the other exchanges knew what to expect before they became the target of these attacks, they weren't fooled. The attacks themselves did little more than cause congestion, their real power was eliminated once MtGox informed the community of the danger.

Fractional reserve banking, or the process of lending more money than you actually own, simply wasn't possible prior to paper money. If you have 50,000 gold coins, you simply cannot lend out more than those 50,000 gold coins UNLESS instead of lending the coins themselves, you lend IOUs -- that is, paper money -- which anyone can use at a later date to redeem their gold coins. Since you don't anticipate everyone trying to redeem their coins at the same time, you can lend out more IOUs than you actually own gold, thereby creating fractional reserve banking. Once paper money was invented, fractional reserve banking was inevitable. Prior to paper money, it was impossible.

Exactly. The purpose of the attack was to fool the exchanges. Fortunately, only MtGox was actually impacted by this financially, and they were even spirited enough to inform/warn the rest of the community so that no one else was fooled. 
What people need to remember is that when this attack was applied to Gox, they probably didn't even detect it for quite some time which is why they were fooled into sending the wrong amounts of money to people. The attackers deliberately kept the attack low key so it wouldn't be noticed. It is because MtGox warned the rest of the community that everyone knew what to expect and thus weren't fooled. More importantly, it is important to realize that the fault wasn't with Gox's software, as this attack could just as easily been applied to most of the other exchanges, including those using bitcoind. It was just fortunate that the attackers focused exclusively on MtGox.
When MtGox reported the problem the attackers basically knew their game was over and just flooded the rest of the network to make sure the community would fix the vulnerability. They are probably very rich by now and have no interest in seeing it exploited anymore. The attack today was an obvious wake up call to everyone who wanted to blame the situation on Gox alone.

The mainstream media doesn't really care about whether the problem was with Gox or bitcoin itself. All they know is that Bitcoin is software and that MtGox collapsed because of software. To them, it's all software!!! That is what scares the mainstream world about bitcoin the most, it is completely virtual and people don't trust that. MtGox will only reinforce their fears and the media loves stories that increase fear. 
The bottom line, however, is that Bitcoin simply isn't ready for any more mainstream adoption than it already has and it is precisely growing through disasters like Gox that will mature her overtime until she is ready. By the time BTC goes mainstream, she will be extremely resilient.

That article essentially stated that the problem was isolated with Gox and due to Gox's bad programming. Countless other articles claimed the same thing. Then, the very next day, almost for the sole purpose of making fun of people like the author of that article, hackers applied the attack to the entire network and guess what . . . it worked. It worked because the problem was never isolated to just MtGox's software, it affected 'bitcoind' itself.
The only reason the damage wasn't extensive was because no one was fooled the way MtGox had been precisely because everyone knew what to expect since MtGox had warned us just the day before.

Satoshi created Bitcoin as a "system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust." At the very core of bitcoin is a vision of an economy that does not rely on trust. 
Yet these exchanges, like MtGox, almost entirely rely on trust, even more so than fiat institutions. With no laws or regulations, trust is the only thing there is, and when one of the big exchanges violates that trust, it erodes the entire system. That is, the system based on trust. But trust was precisely the system Satoshi was trying to get us away from.
The death of MtGox, therefore, while painful is a necessary evil . . . because ultimately the system must move to a trust-free model, and that simply wasn't possible while the community felt comfortable relying on trust.

So you are saying that if I took my desktop wallet, sent backups of it to my email address, uploaded backups to my dropbox account, and advertised to the world that that is where those backups were in case anyone wanted to try to steal them . . . that would basically be blockchain in a nutshell?
On top of that, you are saying that the site is extremely dangerous to less tech savvy users who assume it works like a pure web wallet (e.g., coinbase) and therefore think nothing of logging in on a public computer, assuming 2FA will protect them, when in reality they have just downloaded their encrypted wallet to that computer for anyone to take and brute force at their leisure. And more, that the whole 2FA thing is a complete joke because it gives the user a false sense of security when in reality it can be easily and entirely bypassed simply by focusing ones effort on decrypting wallet backups?!!!
And the icing on the cake is that if you use a crappy password, you pretty much are forever insecure short of starting a new account? Am I getting this right?

Well, a sophisticated wallet could easily handle automatic payments for you. There really is no need for a bank for that.
But I do think there will be bitcoin "banks", but they won't be centralized institutions like MtGox, they will be decentralized "pools", if you will, where people will collectively protect each others' money, as well as use their collective money for investments using democratic consensus. Each person will exchange bitcoins for bankcoins, or whatnot, which will give them partial ownership of the bank, and all revenue will be distributed to all holders of bankcoins proportionally.
Or . . . something like this.
Centralized institutions won't be able to compete with decentralized ones because the customers will be making so much more money when they become partial owners of decentralized companies.

The issue really isn't having sympathy or not having sympathy for those who were Goxed. The issue isn't whether the death of Gox will be devastating to Bitcoin. The issue is, how to we absolutely guarantee that Gox never happens again? 
There is only one way: decentralize. 
Of course everyone wants Bitcoin to be ready for the mainstream now. Of course everyone wants the price to go up. Of course everyone wants the advantages of bitcoin over fiat to be obvious. But the the problem is, that isn't going to happen until Bitcoin is ready. Just wishing it were ready won't make it so. And MtGox proves Bitcoin isn't ready. Even if MtGox hadn't happen, the point is that it COULD have happen. Bitcoin was vulnerable to being Goxed, and that in and of itself proves that Bitcoin was not, is not, ready. 
Bitcoin is no more ready for widespread adoption than the internet was in 1992. Bitcoin needs the equivalent of what the Web was for the internet, and that will only come from DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Corporations). Until DACs are in place and STRONG Bitcoin will not be ready to take over the world. Period. And the first DAC that needs to happen, sooner than later, is a decentralized autonomous exchange that is capable of replacing the centralized exchanges like MtGox. 
Only DACs can secure bitcoin, only DACs can avoid government regulations strangulating bitcoin, only DACs can make apparent the clear advantages of bitcoin, only DACs can avoid Goxing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:49:55
Yet the whole problem here was with a CENTRALIZED entity, namely MtGox, not decentralization. It became insolvent because of incompetence, criminality, whatever . . . flaws in a centralized organization that held people's money for them in a central location. If the exchange had instead been decentralized in the way bitcoin itself is -- assuming that is theoretically possible -- none of this would have occurred. Transaction malleability would never have been an issue, and even if it had the problem would have been rapidly reported and detected, rather than going unnoticed under the shadow of incompetence, insider trading, and god knows what went on inside Gox. Just direct peer-2-peer trading using open-source software without any third party holding your money and handing out poker chips.  
In short, what we need is more decentralization, not less, for this entire problem was due to centralization. Whether this can be accomplished, I do not know.

Great interview. 
What I found particularly interesting was the whole idea that you could essentially make a video game as a DAO (distributed autonomous organization) allowing player made content to play a more robust role in the development and expansion of the game. With crypto, paying players who add content becomes effortless. 
In general, a theme seems to be emerging around this idea that crypto and DAOs will make it possible for people to make a living and, effectively, be "employed" without actually literally being employed -- i.e., without being under any contractual obligation -- giving them complete freedom over their time and the amount of energy they are willing to expend on any given project, as well as the complete freedom to choose which projects to work on. Much of what was talked about in this interview directly pointed to that theme as it pertains to video games. Very exciting stuff!
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:08:16
All of this has shown that this issue of transaction malleability needs to be fixed in Bitcoin itself. Patching up the client software will certainly help, but there are so many holes that can still be exploited. Whether Gox was more incompetent or just the victim of a more focused attack . . . who knows. It is really beside the point. The real problem is that as long as this issue exists, there will be more attacks, using unanticipated techniques.

I use blockchain.info instead of electrum for my cold storage. Blockchain lets you set up watch-only addresses, same as Electrum, but with the added bonus of also having a smartphone app that makes scanning these addresses into your wallet super easy. Just go to "scan watch only" and scan the public key qr code of your paper wallet and that's it. Also, I never really felt entirely secure until I encrypted my paper wallets using BIP038. Now I don't have to worry even if someone gets a hold of them.
Most of my spending bitcoin -- i.e, my "checking account" bitcoin -- I also store in cold storage and use the Mycelium app for that. Mycelium allows you to scan private keys temporarily, spend money from the address, and then returns the change to that same address and erases the private keys from memory. (Note that mycelium also accepts BIP038 encrypted private keys, it simply asks for your password and it is as simple as that, though for convenience you probably don't want to encrypt your "checking account" addresses.) This is much more secure than just keeping your spending money in a hot wallet. Of course, I also keep pocket change in a hot wallet for tipping and what not, but never more than I would mind losing.

Yes, the exploit used transaction malleability and took advantage of certain features in bitcoind to cause bitcoind to become confused into thinking double spends had occurred. Many exchanges use bitcoind which is why they were vulnerable and why many ordinary users were also affected.
The only reason MtGox was more devastated was because no one had yet discovered the problem, so the attackers were able to fool MtGox into thinking that the problem was at their end so that they would inadvertently pay the attackers twice. MtGox eventually figured out what the hell was going on and then explained it to the rest of the community, so that when the larger attack occurred the other exchanges were able to quickly respond without being fooled.
The community interpreted MtGox as being a bad actor . . . really they are the victims and heroes in all this (assuming they are able to return everyone's money).

Whether someone needs to be sitting next to the ATM for legal or security reasons is not relevant to whether the machine is automated. 
By 'automated' we do not mean the machine can work without someone standing next to it. By that definition there would be no such thing as an ATM since all ATMs require at least one person to be standing next to them when they are used . . . namely, the user.

Well, Bitcoin, among other things, essentially opened the floodgates to transforming the internet from a realm of mind only into one that shares the same kind of objective status as the real world. 
You see, the internet up until now has essentially only existed in a mental space, where ideas were readily transmitted and shared, but objects with unique identity were prohibited. One of the primary characteristics of an idea is that it has no singular existence. It can be shared infinitely and can exist in many minds at the same time. It is not like your lawnmower which only exists in your garage and nowhere else simultaneously. Sure, other people may own the same make and model lawnmower, but theirs is a different physical thing, carrying different amounts of gas and possessing a unique set of scratches. Physical objects have a unique identity.
It was because of this separation between the real world and the virtual world that digital cash was never possible before. For, what defines cash is not merely the fact that it is money, but that it is money connected to a physical object, a piece of paper. The internet could always do the "money" part, it just couldn't do the physical piece of paper part. 
With Bitcoin, now it can. That is a radical breakthrough and the first step toward transforming the virtual space into an quasi-objective one. We may very well be witnessing the birth of a new type of internet, one that possesses the characteristics of the physical world, yet the advantages of the virtual one.

All of the advantages inherent in bitcoin are incompatible with regulation. As you said, with regulation bitcoin "starts to look a lot like fiat currencies." Indeed, I would go so far as to say that a cryptocurrency whose stability is dependent on government regulations really is just a fiat currency. 
Yet on the other hand, the Mt Gox collapse shows definitively that the current situation is untenable. 
But the essential problem is not with Bitcoin itself, per se. The problem is that centralized exchanges, like MtGox, essentially work like fiat institutions. That is to say, the only way a centralized exchange like Gox could function reliably is with government regulations.
You could say that this is proof that we need government regulations. I say this is proof that we need decentralized autonomous corporations, DACs, starting with a decentralized autonomous exchange. 
Indeed, DACs are the inevitable evolutionary future of bitcoin and crypto, as the Web was the inevitable future of the internet. The Blockchain implies such innovation, and the Ethereum project, Master Coin, Colored Coins, Invictus, Open Transactions, Nxt Coin, and others are all hard at work innovating that future. 
These technologies will essentially make a MtGox impossible, and it will be impossible without the need for government regulations. Law won't keep things in line, software will. THAT is the promise of bitcoin. 
The promise of Bitcoin is not what we have today, it is not the hope that governments will leave Bitcoin alone and that somehow She will survive despite the mad, chaotic, wild-west environment. The promise of bitcoin, the promise of the bitcoin revolution, is in the complete and radical decentralization of financial and institutional structures. This is an inevitability of the technology. 
People who want to regulate bitcoin don't really understand bitcoin. Relatively short term investors looking to profit off the latest technology naturally want to see Bitcoin embraced by society, beginning with regulations. They see this technology as a small advancement with the promise of big financial returns, which are pretty much guaranteed should it become accepted. They don't understand that we are at the beginning of something much much larger, and whether governments regulates or not, it really won't ultimately make a difference.

OK, here is my layperson translation of what is happening to the best of my ability: The issue pointed too yesterday by MtGox -- transaction malleability -- is being exploited to cause the 'bitcoind' software used by many exchanges and wallets to become confused into thinking double spends are occurring. No actual double spends are occurring, but the software thinks they are. This effects everyone, not just the exchanges. The propagation of this attack is happening through the 'enjoy sochi' bot. I hope I got that about right.

If bitcoin is dependent on these banks, and the banks are dependent on bitcoin, then the two really can't be separated. 
The implosion of MtGox has had a negative effect on the entire bitcoin ecosystem. If the chain breaks because of a weak link, it really becomes irrelevant that the rest of the chain was strong.
The reason Gox was a "weak link" was not because they lacked regulation, the reason they were a weak link was because they are a centralized exchange that requires trust. The entire system of bitcoin is about creating a system that does not require trust, so adding exchanges/banks that are so critical to the overall success of the network that do require trust is like connecting two steel chains with a plastic link.

The way I see it, the "intrinsic value" of Bitcoin is forward looking (as opposed to the "backward looking" nature of, say, precious metals) in that if, and when, the Bitcoin network becomes the basis for all types of financial tools and organizations, the existence of all of that will depend on Bitcoin thereby giving bitcoins an actual form of intrinsic value. The value of bitcoins depends on the network becoming much more robust than just being used as a currency, because as a currency alone bitcoin is vulnerable to both marginal benefits over traditional banking and being easily replaced by another currency. It is true that all currency ultimately relies on faith, but faith is going to go toward the currency that works as a building block for all types of software financial innovation, not one that is stagnant. 
If I thought there was no future in bitcoin beyond just use as a currency, I would immediately pull out.

The Mycelium wallet has an amazing feature that allows you to use your paper wallets in just the way you described by sending change back to the paper wallet address after its been used and erasing the paper wallet private key from memory.

It is both. A weakness in bitcoin allows transaction malleability which was then used to confuse the bitcoind software.

Close your eyes (well, figuratively speaking) and imagine the following scenario in the future:
A company makes a kind of snack cake like Twinkies -- let's call it a Twinkle -- is created in a purely decentralized manner. The company itself is owned by no one, there is a Twinkle foundation similar to the Bitcoin foundation, but everything is open source. The company issues Twinkcoins, and all revenue is distributed to all Twinkcoin owners based on how many Twinkcoins you own. Each Twinkcoin = one Twinkle, and each purchase of a Twinkle automatically gives you one Twinkcoin. Wait . . . what?
Imagine it . . . a world where the consumer simultaneously becomes a partial owner in the decentralized company.

Bitcoin is not currently deflationary, it is actually much more inflationary at the moment than fiat. Over time it will eventually become deflationary.
By the time that happens it is my opinion that people will not be spending bitcoin very much. The Bitcoin network -- and perhaps a few of her competitors -- will instead become the backbone of the entire world value economy which will be built on top of Bitcoin. Currencies built out of, and on top of, Bitcoin will be used for exchange. Bitcoin will be a bit more like gold back in the days when fiat was backed by it. 
Due to being deeply divisible, bitcoin will find a natural balance of value that will constantly adjust from market forces alone, serving as a kind of central bank for the world economy run by no one.

If the collapse of one leads to the collapse of the other, they are inseparable. 
Fact is, the centralized exchanges represent weak links in the chain, and while the core of bitcoin is decentralized and immune to things like "insider trading" and manipulation, the centralized exchanges aren't, and their influence colors the entire ecosystem. Regulating those bodies essentially regulates the network, just as cutting through the weakest link in a chain breaks the entire chain. 
No, the answer is in decentralized solutions, Bitcoin 2.0 protocols like Mastercoin and ColoredCoins. Decentralized exchanges. We may need jump points like Coinbase for quite some time to provide fiat-to-crypto liquidity, but the rest can all take place within the cryptospace without anyone needing to give their coins to a "trusted" third-party. Eventually fiat-to-crypto exchanges will be able to be decentralized also.

All that needs to happen for bitcoin to hold advantage is mass adoption (and services and software that improve usability and security). Once people are no longer in a rush to exchange their bitcoin into fiat, once they instead choose to hold their bitcoin because they know it can be spent as easily as fiat, the advantages will become obvious. 
Really, the analogy is paper money. Until bank notes were adopted in mass the disadvantage of having to exchange the money back into gold or silver probably outweighed the advantage of lighter cash. But once everyone got in the habit of holding and spending their banknotes, instead of constantly exchanging them, the advantages over gold became obvious. 
Fortunately, the initial mass adoption of bitcoin doesn't depend on there being immediate advantages to using it for merchants or Joe Fiats. The adoption will occur because speculation is driving up the value of bitcoin and thus providing merchants with a lot of incentive to accept it. (All eyes are on the government now . . .) The speculation, of course, is in large part due to people realizing the inherent advantages in bitcoin. But those advantages are IN THE FUTURE . . . that is why it is called 'speculation'.

What they currently have is the central bank and RTGS systems like FedWire. They all have accounts with the central bank and they can move money between themselves simply by instructing the central bank to debit one account and credit the other. It is a kind of centralized database.
If the banking system's intention is to move toward a centralized block chain, i.e., one controlled entirely by the banking system . . . the question remains, how would that be superior than just having a single centralized database at the central bank?

Precisely, it isn't the same as using a bank where you have an account and therefore need identification to prove you are the account owner. 
With bitcoin, you have an address and a private key, no accounts. You can hide that private key under your mattress for all you care, it isn't associated with any account. Therefore, there should be absolutely no reason (except legal ones) why you should need to prove your identity. If I send you bitcoins right now, I don't need to prove my identity, it should be no different with an ATM in principle. In terms of technology and security there is absolutely zero reasons you should need to prove your identity. 
The only reasons you need to show your identity is because the government says you must.

This is, of course, quite natural. Adoption happens as a result of speculation, and speculation happens as a result of adoption. Sometimes it sounds like people think the two are mutually opposed, or that one leads to the other but not the other way around; but the truth is that with cryptocurrency they form a self-sustaining whole, and with a higher price the pressure increases upon merchants and businesses to adopt it, and as more merchants adopt it speculative excitement drives up the price . . . the more speculation drives up the price, the more merchants want in on the action, etc. This self-sustaining cycle will continue to grow as long as there is room for increased adoption. When adoption becomes widespread and the room for growth becomes more limited, the price will become drastically more stable.

People are already breaking the "rules" left and right (gold farming isn't such a vibrant industry for no reason.) This will just open the flood gates. It is one thing to log into some shady looking website and give your credit card info, it is another to just toss a couple of anonymous mbits. A lot of players who otherwise wouldn't have thought to buy gold now will. It is one of those areas, like purchasing pornography, where crypto's advantages become immediately obvious. 
New games are going to have no choice but to change the rules and find some way to adapt. It will just be too hard and painful to the health of the game to try to aggressively enforce the rules. 
This means that games that rely a lot on economies and loot will essentially suffer from a real pay2win crisis. Games will either decide to embrace this, or steer clear by emphasizing rewards that simply cannot be purchased economically. One of my favorite games of all time, City of Heroes, didn't really involve a meaningful economy in its early years, and thus would have been immune from this problem.

The bottom line is Gox was fooled because few people in the bitcoin community had really thought through the possible ways transaction malleability could be used to perform an attack. Everyone else was just lucky that Gox was the initial target and thus took all the damage and all the blame, because everyone else were also using software that was just as vulnerable as Gox's.

It isn't just the code that separates one coin from another, it is the community and the philosophy -- for lack of a better way of putting it -- that surrounds each coin. The lighthearted spirit that surrounds Doge coin used to be characteristic of bitcoin. When bitcoin lost this quality due to its success and being propelled it into the world of "serious" -- as you put it -- Doge coin essentially picked up that torch. Not everyone wants to approach Crypto with the heavy handed philosophy of saving the world or the egotistical drive of a speculator. Some people want to approach crypto with a lighter touch. This is why Doge coin, despite being relatively generic in terms of the code, has become known as the  tipping currency and why its community excels in demonstrating a spirit of generosity. It isn't that bitcoin lacks these qualities, it is simply that at times they get drowned out due to all of the seriousness.

Inflation does not = an increase in the money supply. An increase in the money supply often causes inflation, however, thus the confusion. Inflation is when the value of a currency decreases, when I can buy less stuff with my money than I used to. If the value of the money increases, on the other hand, that is deflation. 
So, no, the inflation is not set in stone. The whole justification for Central Banks is that by consciously manipulating the money supply, one can efficiently guarantee that money is being used to better society. So, for example, inflation causes your money to disappear as long as you keep it under the mattress, thus essentially forcing people to put their money back in a bank.
But there is the rub, if the money you put back in a bank was loaned to you (or previous owner(s) of that money), then the moment you put that money back into the banking system you have just returned the loan the bank initially gave out, yet the bank is still owed that money from the initial borrower. Thus money is created out of nothing. The banking system can now loan the money  out again it had initially loaned, even though the initial loan hasn't yet been repayed.
So it is essential to the banking system that money always decrease in value, because otherwise people have no incentive to use banks, who in turn don't have enough to issue more loans.
That is my layperson's understanding of this. I wouldn't call this system "evil", anymore than feudalism was "evil", it is just that we can do better. The problem with this system is that average people have to work their asses off just to keep their heads above water, while the rich essentially rake in the majority of the wealth that comes from this increased labor. To me, it is a far cry from slavery, but it still has the same taste. It wasn't until Bitcoin, and more importantly things I've heard from the metacoin community, that I began to imagine it was even possible to create an alternative to this system.

I think it is clear we are still in the early days. Ordinarily only the very rich are allowed to invest in projects during this phase. Because ordinary people aren't used to being able to get in on the ground floor many people accuse bitcoin of being a "scam" or a "ponzi scheme" when really all they mean is that it is a high risk investment, just like investing in any startup company. In a very hostile sentiment they accuse investors of wanting to get rich quick, when the reality is that that is the hope of all early investors.

It is programmable, the USD isn't.
When paper money was first introduced, its advantages were not immediately obvious either. I'm sure people considered that it was lighter and easier to carry and would have resulted in smaller transaction fees (e.g., don't need to hire a mule to carry your coins), but in the end the true advantage was that it made it possible for banks to lend money they didn't actually have. That is, for every gold or silver coin they had, they could lend out multiple banknotes. This basic practice gave rise to modern banking which is the foundation for modern economies. 
In the same way, the true advantage of Bitcoin is not in the fact that if you were to post an address I could send money to you instantly without knowing anything about you. It is clearly more frictionless than fiat, just as banknotes were more frictionless than precious metal coins. But the real advantage is that it is programmable.
You can't build applications out of the US dollar, you can't build smart properties, software contracts, DAOs. The possibilities to financial innovation are staggering when you consider the idea that money becomes software. In time this will become obvious and people will wonder why anyone actually considered it possible that Bitcoin didn't have any advantages over fiat. The internet may have seemed like a glorified fax machine when first introduced, but its true advantages were in all of its programmable possibilities, a fax machine would never be anything more than a fax machine.
Paper money had a very good run, and lead to all of modern finance. But it is clearly on its way out. That vast majority of dollars in supply today are already purely digital, yet digital fiat money is just a virtual representation of paper money, it works fundamentally the same way as paper money. It may be digital, but it does not carry the properties of a programmable currency. More importantly, fiat currencies cannot become programmable without ceasing to have the characteristics of paper money (i.e., the characteristic of being promises for future payment, aka credit), just as paper money didn't have the characteristics of gold coins. 
The demise of fiat currency is inevitable. How quickly it will happen and for how long it will compete with crypto is a matter of debate, and whether Bitcoin itself will survive or will be replaced by some other programmable currency is also debatable. But the idea that Bitcoin offers no advantages over using a bank is profoundly naive.

Right now we are at a stage with bitcoin that might be analogous to when paper money was new. I imagine people were trying to buy stuff with bank notes, yet most of the merchants likely didn't accept them. There would have been an increased need to travel back and forth from the bank in order to withdrawal gold -- both for the merchants who were nervous about holding onto bank notes, and consumers who often needed to get their gold in order to pay the more conservative merchants. All of this traveling back and forth from the bank would probably have seemed a source of more friction than any alleviated by the advantage of carrying lighter money. 
Many of the concerns about bitcoin expressed by the OP are right on the mark. However, they all basically boil down to the bottleneck caused by the exchange between fiat and bitcoin. Like the advantages of carrying paper money around rather than large amounts of metal, there are inherent advantages to digital cash over fiat currency. But also like the bank note, those advantages cannot be fully realized without mass adoption. As long as people are in a hurry to exchange bitcoin back into fiat all advantages are lost in the bottleneck. That is precisely why the massive appreciation of value in the bitcoin due to speculation is so vital to the whole system, because mass adoption is simply not possible without proper incentive for all of the reasons the OP laid out. Currently there is a lot of valuable bitcoin locked in the bottleneck, eager to be spent. This amount of money ready to be used puts increased pressure on merchants anxious to take advantage of the situation. Merchants who accept bitcoin suddenly find a powerful force of money flooding in, middleman fees be damned! The success of these merchants, in turn, inspires more to jump the bandwagon. The speculators are causing the adoption of bitcoin. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy, for once the adoption becomes widespread, the increased value of bitcoin becomes inevitable. People who are rejecting bitcoin as a ponzi scheme are like people who reject a $100 bill because it is paper. 
Also, I can't help but feel that it is precisely because the difficulty aspect of bitcoin remains -- along with the fact that bitcoin appears to be in a bubble driven by hype, and the fact that bitcoin is a new technology so its inherent unknowns remain, well, unknown -- that most people are too afraid to get on the train. They either think the train will be headed off a cliff, or the tech prerequisites intimidate them. Yet it is exactly while they are hesitant that opportunity continues to persist for those willing to take the big risk. As soon as bitcoin becomes everything it promises to become the window of opportunity for an early investor will have been lost. But as long as the entry difficulty into bitcoin remains high, it also suggests that IF bitcoin succeeds, then getting in now means you are getting in more or less at the beginning.

I used to think the same thing, then I thought more about how the crypto revolution will not just be one coin that rules them all, but rather a completely diverse ecosystem of literally thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of coins, all interconnected in an overall web of value. These coins will all serve different functions. They will have different political foundations, different mining techniques, different banking structures, different transfer and storage paradigms, some will be used by college kids, some will be used by investment firms, some will be used to play video games, some will be used to pay taxes. The value web is going to be one huge overwhelming digital super highway with possibilities far far beyond what we have today. 
Dogecoin in no way threatens bitcoin, it is merely doing for crypto what Bitcoin no longer can because Bitcoin has gotten too big and serious.

Thanks for clearing all of this up. I was under the impression that MtGox was the victim of a targeted attack which, in principle, could have worked against any exchange. I guess I was wrong about that. It doesn't really matter, does it.
It doesn't really matter because the real issue is the problem of having centralized points of failure. If MtGox is insolvent, who will bail them out to save the bitcoin ecosystem? Having these centralized exchanges is no better than having banks, and they leave the bitcoin economy in a constant state of vulnerability. Bitcoin itself may be distributed, and resilient as a result, but it doesn't matter if you have these massive privatized black boxes serving as weak links in the chain.
If Bitcoin is going to survive, if she is going to prevail, everything about bitcoin, EVERYTHING, must be decentralized. It will clearly be possible to create decentralized crypto exchanges once 'crypto-currency 2.0' technologies get rolling, and now people are even suggesting ways to decentralize fiat-to-crypto exchanges. This all needs to happen, and Mt Gox completely reminded us of this. 
Of course, the alternative is just to let massive government regulations and law enforcement work to prevent these kinds of disasters . . . but we all know that will only do more harm than good.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will make exchanging virtual currencies (i.e., mmorpg gold) for real money extremely easy. Up until now the problem has been focused around Chinese sweatshop gold farmers who accept paypal payments in exchange for in-game gold. But with cryptocurrency, selling in-game items for real life money becomes simple for the ordinary gamer, whereas before it was prohibitive. If cryptocurrency becomes widespread, this could really become a "problem", and gamers who actually have too much time on their hands could discover they are able to actually make some decent money just doing what they love. 
At that point, where there is a dramatic increase in liquidity of virtual gold into real money, and vice versa, will virtual gold become taxable in a more aggressive manner? Will governments place pressure on the gaming companies to get rid of in-game economies entirely? It really poses some interesting questions. This is a worthwhile thread.

Exactly. 'Cryptocurrencies 2.0' will likely reveal all kinds of things we can't even imagine at this point. Not to mention the possibility of the alt coin universe exploding in directions not anticipated. (The alt currencies, of course, bring a further dimension to the matter of the limited supply of bitcoin.) I'm guessing the whole ecosystem of 'cryptocurrency' is going to result in something much more massive than just "digital cash". 
Right now Bitcoin is inflationary, extremely so. By the time she eventually becomes deflationary -- years from now -- I wonder if the landscape and our understanding will be so completely altered that we will even find this issue of concern.

I wouldn't be so sure if they are all so young actually. MMORPG gamers have a wide range when it comes to age. Most of the arguments against bitcoin come from a conservative mindset ("money just doesn't work that way dammit!!!"), young people tend not to have that and instead tend to have more of a "I'll check this out for myself" attitude.

You are completely right, but the reality is that despite the fact that it is legal to steal bitcoin, and that it is incredibly easy to launder bitcoin, actually stealing the bitcoins from someone who knows how to secure them is next to impossible. You essentially would need to force Satoshi at gunpoint to give them to you, but at that point there really is no difference in difficulty between stealing bitcoin or just stealing fiat from a rich person.

@_date: 2014-02-01 09:07:30
Basically, blockchain sucks when it comes to security. It is very convenient, but you should never store more bitcoin in blockchain than you would carry cash in your wallet. 
Here's the problem. Blockchain is very misleading. It appears to be a web wallet, but really it just is more or less a desktop wallet that is stored online and then downloaded every time you use it. This causes a false sense of security, such as thinking two-factory authentication will save you.  
Hacking your blockchain wallet is pretty simple. The two-factory authentication and second password are mostly just for show. All one needs to do is get a copy of the wallet file and that is pretty easy to do given that blockchain is constantly spamming it everywhere (dropbox, sent email backups, etc). What is worse, a copy is downloaded to your computer every time you log in, so if you are on a public computer basically you are screwed. This is an example of how the illusion that blockchain is a pure web wallet can actually result in user behavior that is very dangerous. You would never copy your desktop wallet to a public computer, but that is exactly what you end up unknowingly doing using blockchain.
Once a hacker gets a copy of your wallet backup, all they need to do is leisurely brute force it and unless you have a super long password, you are fvcked. Once they get your password, there is nothing standing between them and your money . . . two factor authentication, meaningless, 2nd password, pft. So, yeah, blockchain is bad news right now as far as security goes.

Bitcoin is just about a modern religion, and being a part of the community at this point must feel very similar to what early adopters of world religions must have felt. We know we are dealing with something that is going to utterly transform the world, and because of bitcoin we believe that the future is utopia. We believe in technology, we believe in freedom. We are overwhelmed with the thrill that is Bitcoin. So you will just have to excuse some of the more "cultish" moments.

Bingo! Centralized exchanges are theft waiting to happen. Centralized exchanges with no regulations and no laws is theft guaranteed to happen. We need decentralized exchanges for crypto-crypto trading, and regulations of those exchanges that handle fiat-crypto trading.

Was thinking more about this issue of infinite -- or semi-infinite -- divisibility and how it plays a role in the matter of deflation. Came across this very interesting article:
In it he argues, in effect, that the deep divisibility of bitcoin means that the currency -- through market forces alone -- will find a stable equilibrium and will constantly keep itself precisely where it needs to be without requiring a central bank. Interesting read. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:52:29
You are right. But once it does become possible to get almost everything you need/want through bitcoin alone, then decentralized exchanges, decentralized companies, decentralized solutions and decentralized innovations will become characteristic of the crypto economy and will be, largely, what separates it from the fiat economy. 
Of course, there will always be that need for fiat-to-crypto exchanges as long as fiat money exists. But I see that largely being taken over by more trusted institutions in the future and coming under strong government regulations.

I don't think so. In essence, the network is dependent on the currency in order to survive, which means that the larger the network becomes, and the more financial technologies are built upon the network and depend upon it (derivatives, stocks, DAOs, things that would come out of bitcoin 2.0 protocols like Counterparty and Mastercoin), the more essential it becomes that bitcoins have value. 
In short, the larger the network becomes, the more "intrinsic value" bitcoins begins to enjoy. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:25:56
It has been said that the problem with Colored coins is that they lack a business model. Mastercoin is often presented in contrast. 
But the thing I don't understand is that even though Mastercoin claims to have a business model, as far as I can tell that revolves around the value of a mastercoin. The theory is that as/if the protocol succeeds, the value of mastercoins themselves will appreciate. But what gives a mastercoin any value? What actually connects it to the protocol itself other than the name? I just can't get my head wrapped around this.

There is a big divide between between being a millionaire and being one of the richest people on the planet. Now, obviously, if the price of bitcoin remains what it is then the incentive to commit this kind of crime doesn't seem that great. But MK, like many of us, is expecting the price to be much greater in the future. 500 million might not seem worth going through all of this, but 5 billion? 500 billion? And to get that kind of power all he needs to go through is a brief period of pain, a slap on the hand, maybe a couple years prison max. Seems like one hell of a good tradeoff to me.

You mean they cut your hand off if you use too much bitcoin?!!!
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:28:50
The point is, without paper money (i.e., banknotes) it isn't possible to actually use the created money. If you simply had gold coins, the number of gold coins in existence remains fixed, fractional reserve banking can't touch that. Only with paper money do you have a way of representing these coins so that the created money can be spent.
Bitcoin is like gold. In order to expand the money supply artificially, new coins meant to represent bitcoins will need to be issued and traded. Gox coins were an example of this. The tokens used in exchanges are examples of this, you place your money in an exchange and in return you are issued tokens which you then use to trade within their system. When you cash out, those tokens are then used to redeem actual bitcoins. But using a bitcoin 2.0 tech it is conceivable that one day there may be a universal banknote meant to represent a bitcoin that will make lending possible in a way it currently isn't, and that in turn will allow for a more dramatic expansion of the money supply. Who knows.

I'm not really interested in participating in all this hate between the two communities. What I can say is that Crypto is going to have a huge impact on MMORPGs.
Really, MMO games have had a long history with virtual currency. In effect, virtual currencies in online games were among the first non-fiat currencies that were neither regulated nor made illegal by governments. Yet, despite just being "play money", a whole industry developed -- particularly in China -- around exchanging MMORPG currency for fiat. "Gold farmers," as they came to be known, became a huge "problem" for online games. 
Eventually, as mmorpgs moved away from subscription models of payment to "free-2-play" models, the line between fiat and virtual gold became even thinner. Now, in addition to Chinese gold farmers exchanging virtual money for fiat money, these companies themselves were offering "cash shops" -- their new way of making money. These cash shops essentially allow players to buy stuff for their characters in-game using fiat money. Many players, then, turn around and sell those bought items to other players for in-game gold, effectively making the gaming company a kind of money exchange (though only 1-directional).
The dam separating virtual gold from real money has had many holes in it from the beginning. But with cryptocurrencies, that dam could come crashing down entirely. That, my friends, is why the MMO gaming community fears Bitcoin. But fear could very quickly turn to love.  
Crypto could, in principle, make exchanging virtual gold for real money as simple as a couple clicks. The wall that kept these virtual economies insulated from the real-life economy just evaporates. Imagine it, virtual online economies will be directly plugged into the overall world economy. Welcome to the age of cryptocurrency, welcome to the 21st century, where the lines between virtual and "real" slowly become blurred, and eventually disappear entirely.

We need to separate those things that are "bringing down" Bitcoin due to it being a cryptocurrency, and those things that are due to something unique in Bitcoin that separates it from other cryptocurrencies.
In my mind, the main things bringing down Bitcoin right now are government hostility (in the form of the ban in China and the IRS ruling in the US), the collapse of MtGox, and the negative press surrounding Bitcoin. Arguably, none of those things are specific to Bitcoin, they are based on issues that apply to cryptocurrencies universally. 
What I don't consider particularly relevant to the drop in price are things like Bitcoin being too associated with libertarianism. (The dogecoin community, which has recently become hostile to bitcoin, a bit like beating someone while he is down, would have us believe the whole trouble with bitcoin is an image problem. I don't buy it, and further the problem is the dogecoin community is killing their own image by ceasing to remain neutral and taking on this self-righteous crusade against self-righteousness.) I also don't consider the recent hostility shown by the bitcoin developers toward Counterparty a dramatic concern, just yet (thought it could prove to be if bitcoin essentially makes pro-bitcoin metacoins impossible, thus leaving a void for other metacoins that have their own blockchains to ultimately replace bitcoin). I don't see this as driving the price because this is something most people aren't even considering yet. 
So right now, it seems to me if shit hits the fan for bitcoin, it is really hitting the fan for everyone (though, again, the dogecoin community does seem to perceive this period as an opportunity to get the upper hand over bitcoin, which I find completely contrary to the "spirit" of dogecoin). 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:57:20
Seriously though, I don't think the value is ultimately in any qualities that make a particular cryptocoin unique, the value comes from faith. Faith is ultimately what gives bitcoins value, faith is what gives all currency value, including gold. 
This is why it is a bit hypocritical, imho, for people who are pro-bitcoin to be hostile toward the alt currencies.

Think of it this way: let's say a someone sends out a phoney email to a targeted individual claiming that they need to log into such and such account over some security issue. They make this email entirely convincing and manage to steal the individual's credentials and money. Then the criminals think to themselves, "gee, that really worked, lets send out a thousand of the same emails to other people!" But just as they are hitting the send button the previously robbed individual sends out an email to everyone warning them of the threat. Consequently, no one else is fooled because they all know what to expect. That is essentially what happened here. Everyone received the same email and everyone was just as subject to receiving it as everyone else, but only the first guy was actually fooled by it. 
Everyone more or less was affected by the transaction malleability attack, but only the first guys were actually fooled by it. Those first guys were MtGox, and they ended up giving the attackers a lot of money apparently. But as far as I can tell it wasn't because of anything unique about their software, it was just that they were the first victims and so the only ones to whom the con actually worked against.
As far as individual users not losing any money, how would they?

Exactly. Centralized exchanges are weak links in the chain. Just hoping that nothing goes wrong is not secure, and even more transparency on their part, or more trusted vendors, or even government regulations won't protect against the kinds of things you are talking about. We need a decentralized exchange that is as immune to government and fraud as bitcoin itself is. 
That is why I am very excited about this:

Awesome post, wish I had caught it earlier. Lots of insight there. I wish I had more time to think through it and make a more thoughtful reply. 
But I just want to focus on one thing: the idea that bitcoin is deflationary. You often hear the fact that ~21 million bitcoins will ever be made points to the currency being deflationary. But what people don't mention is the deep divisibility of bitcoin -- a characteristic traditional currencies do not have -- which essentially makes bitcoin simultaneously inflationary, i.e., capable of always increasing its supply. If the decimal point was moved over a space the entire currency would increase 10x, proportionally distributed. So I would suggest bitcoin is BOTH deflationary and inflationary simultaneously, and that while the supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, because of the "infinite" divisibility of the currency the supply effectively is capable of always expanding. This is just one of the many ways in which cryptocurrency defies being categorized according to old models, and why those models probably aren't very good at predicting its future. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:11:46
And the critical thing is that bitcoin makes it possible to transmit value over the internet as easily as text, that was never possible before. So you can literally send $500 to a complete stranger because VALUE is now encoded in the digital space.
