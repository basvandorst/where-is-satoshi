Not necessarily. It's likely that technology is already here. Google "laser uranium enrichment." The largest problems are not about building the bomb, but rather enriching the uranium or enriching the uranium, irradiating it to create plutonium and then enriching the plutonium.

Yea, but most (all?) of the time mercenaries who are killing large numbers of people are hired by governments.

I can't imagine where the profit potential would come from to make that kind of thing profitable. It's a pure expense for them in the short run.
Also, remember that they have to pay people true market value to fight. It's not one of those situations where people are volunteering out of patriotism and because they think they're defending freedom and their country. Dangerous conditions make hiring people quite expensive.
If it's over a resource that's so valuable as to justify the cost, the problem becomes that defending it gets to be very expensive and thus makes the resource much less valuable.

That's why I added the qualification "large" to all of my comments.
There are no profits in genocide or war without a state.

Most importantly, what is the greatest number of people a private company has ever intentionally killed in history? When have they committed or even attempted genocide? Private sector killings are always targeted to a few particular individuals. How many mafia movies are there that involve plot lines that stem from the problems caused by killing the wrong person or accidentally killing someone they didn't intend to?
Any large scale incident where a private company killed, injured or in any way damaged large numbers of people has always been by accident or intentional neglect where it was incidental to other their other goals. It is only government that has ever engaged in willful and intentional harm to people on a large scale.
