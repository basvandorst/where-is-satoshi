I can't wait until we don't talk about Bitcoin in terms of USD value.  We all "know" what $100,000 usd is "worth" currently and what it buys.  I cant wait until 1 bitcoin or whatever is what people dream of owning so they dont ever have to worry about having a normal job again.

The ICO calendar will be fully updated this week.  We also will have original content this week including interviews with some of the best up and coming cyrpto projects.

Ha so funny. Trump recently spoke in my town and I wrote Buy Bitcoin on both sides of my car and drove up and down the street for an hour.  People were going wild.  Someone yelled that "the owner of bitcoin is here"

We're losing all of the things that made crypto worthwhile in the first place.

Its because this is the same thing as the main stream media. Its not just what you see on this sub that matters, its also what you DON'T see. If people in this sub were able to get all the info and not just part of it, it would help a lot.  These centralized forums are whats causing a lot of the disruption between the communities. And I don't think its an accident.

Don't forget our point here. This is a peer to peer system.  Find someone in your area on local bitcoins or via meets ups!
We are starting to rely far to much on centralized institutions and banks.
