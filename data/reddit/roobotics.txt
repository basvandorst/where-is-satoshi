Wow, that didn't explain jack about why he tweeted that. 
So apparently someone explained to him that they(BTC-E/bitpay) use cold storage(like they have been since inception because it's the *safest* way.) and he pulls that Tweet response out?


Sorry, not buying it. I'm glad bitpay has called him out on this personally.

A good compromise to the things others are saying here is cash out half of it and see if your folks can help you invest it. Lock the rest away in a well-protected paper wallet.
BTC could crash out, or it could become huge. You can still win both ways.

Oh I wasn't aware there were limits on the bot requests, that would explain a lot then. I wonder what the actual rules regarding multi-bots is. There might be a nice way to get around those, like people purposely pick one under the least load. Automatic load sharing would still be ideal of course though.
And I do happen to have a Doge wallet setup, so feel free.

Regardless this post is soley about an inquiry and they are straight up saying they don't really have stock of these "In-stock, shipping now!" sales they have been advertising.
If anything I'd consider OP's opinion regarding this matter more reputable since he *has* done business with them in the past.
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:30:11
I liked where your analogy was going but then you veered off to modem speeds rather than the time it took you to setup your connection.
It's not the speed of bitcoin itself that's the problem, it's convincing someone to start fiddling with it in the first place. It can be tedious, time consuming, and frustrating for new users, just as the internet used to be.
Today a broadband internet connection is as easy as clicking a broadcasted wifi SSID and you're done. If BTC can become more stream-lined then adoption will be easier as well.

@_date: 2014-01-14 08:12:42
I agree with this method, tell them these paper wallets are temporary as you have a copy of the private key. You can also use this as an example to help inform them what they need to never share with others and why they should protect their private keys.
You could even take it 1 step further and make an empty wallet for them without copying the private key, so they can load it onto that one and still have a nice paper wallet backup.
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:25:01
If there is that much excess maybe put a note in that we're pretty well standing and don't really 'need' donations ATM. Sort of put them on pause.
Also you could always consider sponsoring another event or two and try to put that excess to work, only my 0.02 because I play it, but League of Legends is a very high exposure teamwork/tournament game that would be well suited to something like this. Just look at  see what's at the top?

Yes but not directly. They are a result of mining BTC blocks and were specifically designed towards formining a private DNS thought NMC domain ownership.

Very much this . BFL has nothing to do whatso-ever with bitcoin payments processing and you should not be associating with them as a first step into bitcoin. 
Unless you are working out a deal or something to sell their items (and if you do they need to be actually in-stock items for the love of god) there is no valid reason you should want to give them publicity on your page. They have gained a very bad reputation in the Bitcoin community for their practices, primarily delayed shipping.
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:31:10
Agree! This is just a rehash of an already figured out idea. Please incorporate NMC as it is a byproduct of BTC merged mining.
I highly suspect this uses BTC because they see more face value, missing the point of how this is supposed to work.

@_date: 2014-01-06 08:20:32
Could you please elaborate on that? I've searched in the past and nothing suggests you can mine NMC alone instead of BTC with merged-mining support.
**Edit**: no, really guys. Don't downvote stuff unless you prove otherwise first. There are no pool setups for NMC, nothing on  I've only heard of nmc being a result of finding btc blocks, so I don't understand how it could be mined seperately.

When I was in the middle of trying to reconstruct a QR code that took significant water damage I found [this page was an amazing resource]( 
There are a few bits that are present in all QR-codes aside from the main squares, and quite a few other pieces that have visible duplicates that don't require demasking and decoding.
If you [want to see what I was working on](
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:40:22
Going to agree. Actual implementation is far more measurable than "we might implement this.." speculation.
[Newegg]( mentioned "It's a possibility" but that was back in mid-november. Not a peep since.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:03:38
If only they could make their back-end as functional as their front-page is pretty. Draw you right in then "Ooops, looks like our entire withdraw system is no longer functional, sorry!"
They better be using this time to implement a proper testing environment! Else we're going to be hearing "Due to a bug in how our hot-wallets function and a recent attack.." you get the idea.

He didn't place an order though. Read the bottom of the email. It's simply an inquiry. You don't have to order to ask them a question.
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:36:08
As interesting as this is.. this is exactly the reason NMC coins come from mining BTC blocks. Why are you trying to reinvent the wheel?
NMC was thought of well in advance. All I see here is a likely grab at greed since BTC has such a higher value than NMC.
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:04:18
There is a fairly substantial difference in accepting Bitcoin as payment and allowing donations.
Cool that they accept it none-the-less but that doesn't mean if they had a pay-for-product they would necessarily accept it.

Thanks, I'll have to try this out. Do you happen to know if NMC and BTC share the same diff level? I'm asking because I assume this is basically solo mining through the command-line NMC client. Which if so would be the same as solo btc mining (Hence wanting to find an NMC pool earlier. Since many of us no longer have the resources to solo.)

Aside from circular logos, all I can think of is open-sourced knowledge meets open-sourced money.

He didn't buy, it was just an inquiry. Read the last line they're responding to.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:52:27
Actually it kinda proves opposite. Because if they compromise the network their own earnings become useless and the purpose of their servers goes away. So they charge users more for their service until it reaches an equilibrium again. In the process netting them more.
But really things like this can be rationalized multiple ways. Just glad they reacted at all regardless of the reasons.
Not calling you wrong, just that it doesn't mean it was done soley on good intentions.

All valid points but at the same time it's about getting BTC out there and for everyday uses. If everyone stops spending it altogether and hoarded theirs it will go stale and just die off. Not going to happen atm but still.

I've heard mixed things through the grapevine. Mostly that he is a bit out there, but his judgements are fairly sound. 
That's why I'd like more information since it paints a pretty contrasting picture.
Also I think it's kinda hilarious he started putting bible verses into the blockchain, because I didn't even know there were "unused bits" that the block finder was allowed to fill in. 
Someone mind sticking that magic blueray encryption code in there please? ;D
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:21:26

@_date: 2013-12-28 23:53:23
Thanks for the informative reply. Finally given the name of the coin it was much easier to find the thread regarding what went down.
I don't know if I'd outright call it a scam-coin, it looks like they were trying to innovate and possibly bring some escrow type features into the main Bitcoin scene if it panned out. Making your own coin is a good way to make a proof of concept, because there is no way it would get implemented until proven stable.
So not only did he drive up the diff of the alt he purposely configured the miners to fail external transactions on purpose.  I'd feel terrible if I did that to somebody, wreck their entire idea.
I'm sorry, but he couldn't have just created his own temporary clone-coin just for a proof of concept? "See here is what can happen, etc, etc.."


That part wasn't finished yet (and never will be now likely) but it sounds brilliant and something BTC actually needs when we encounter trust issues.. Just my 2cents.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:13:35


Yes you can, don't be part of a corrupted pool. That's why I'm asking and trying to get more information on this incident. I want to know if it was malicious or just a test.

In my install the blockchain was placed inside the %appdata% folder and in there is a bitcoin folder. Please be aware this is the default location for your wallet.dat file and I think a folder related to it. Don't delete those if they have any BTC in them and aren't backed up!

This thread is so full of negativity towards OP though, I guess this is what happens when one titles a submission with a negative inflection, it draws in negative users..

A better question is why would anyone hold more than 0.1BTC at a time in a random bot somebody made?
Not that I don't like the idea and spirit of it of course, just saying, be safe where you store large sums of coin.
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:59:52
I'm already aware any BTC hardware can mine SHA256*2 coins.
I'm more asking this from a responsibility standpoint. Was the pool operator asked to do this? He very well completely destroyed the value of that alt-coin because it's difficulty is so many times more that what it was even starting to be worth.
Imagine how many people would still mine BTC if it was worth 50 cents per btc and the difficulty as it is now. The idea of mining would be tanked because how much you'd have to pay in electricity cost. Granted it would level back out after a diff adjustment, but still.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:40:20

Oh, and now deleted of course.

I was tempted to make a post along these lines. This currency is going/has gone 'toxic' in a sense that the majority of those supporting it are hoping to turn a quick buck. Sure we all have hopes that it'll blossom into more, but there is a difference from that, and selling at the most inflated price you can image, only to walk away onto the next 'upcoming thing'
I feel this downward spiral we're experiencing is necessary to remove those with jaded ambitions. Hopefully more coin will fall upon those who will continue to distribute it so acceptance continues to grow as well. 
We've already made it this far and many businesses are touting they accept our magical internet money, let's be sure and support their investment in us. It's mutually beneficial, so lets not screw it up over BTC receding back towards it's original price point.
I have a little over a single coin to my name, so it's been interesting to watch it rise up to 1k then drop down below 450. Somehow I think having a single coin made the experience all the more real since the market value reflects directly to what I could have cashed out at everytime I look at a price-ticker, So I could just cash it in at that price and call it quits. But instead I'll be buying drinks from a local vendor at each of the local BTC meetups I attend.
TLDR; What's the point of magical internet money if you don't spend a little?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:39:18
Well wait, yes, that is a possibility as well. But that's not a picture you'd want to just go passing around everywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:24:16
Businesses can interface with APIs that directly convert bitcoins into dollars/fiat currency. 
There is no risk once it's converted and the seller does't need to worry about bitcoins any further than that. 
A ponzi would be more like they must accept and hold the bitcoins at whatever value they fluctuate to. And some actually decide to do this as an investment, but it's at their own discretion.
**Edit**: If you're going to downvote an explanation, at least say why? To the best of my knowledge this is all accurate.

They likely believe if they allow the progression of sending BTC developers will undercut their 30% margin by allowing users to download a 'free/partial' game then purchase an unlock code for BTC.
I honestly think it's as simple as that. They're trying to look out for their own ecosystem because they can't cover/refund/investigate anything of this nature.

I bought my friend a drink at a bar with BTC 3 days ago. It's catching on more than all the close-minded people would like to think. Subway has hesitated but made an unorganized attempt that they weren't ready to enforce, newegg has mentioned it's a distinct possibility. A web vender I've bought things from prior (adafruit) allows you to pay this way already.

So.. you have an app installed that Apple pulled for whatever reasons, and the attacker was physically holding onto your phone. Yep sounds like a recipe for disaster.
Shouldn't the 2FA stopped them from even being able to send coins or were they able to just change the preferences and bypass it because you didn't lock the preferences page with 2FA also? (not 100% this is how coinbase works but BTC-E does, and warns you about this distinct possibility.)

It's just supply and demand, the more popular it becomes then yes the face value goes up as well because there is a set supply. It's still zero risk for merchants that implement it as I explained above.

I completely agree with your ideas here. I'm quite tech savy so for my first btc wallet I chose armory... 
Oh okay it requires QT..no big deal.. 
Oh it needs to sync first? Alright I'll let it do that..


Oh FFS how big is this file.. 11GB?! (Running a 128GB SSD, so kind of a big deal)
These sites need to have a warning that states if you use _______ wallet program the entire blockchain will be downloaded, and tell you roughly how much space that is. This will keep newbies from needlessly draining the bandwidth of peers for something they're possibly not going to use.
*Then* there needs to be an explanation why you would want to download the QT version, how you're helping the network thrive by leaving it on, etc.
Without making these distinctions to end users you are indirectly slowing the ease of adoption for BTC and clogging up the network.
Also please add a link to the official "bootstrap.dat" torrent and explain where to place it to significantly increase the syncronization speed(and that you can delete/move it once QT renames it to a *.old file)
