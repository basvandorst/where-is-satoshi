Big bankers get their bonuses mid to late Jan.  So there might be a pump here?

HODL.  Don't panic sell.  It's a bumpy ride for all.

Leave us your email and I'll inform you when available

As long as you've submitted your email we won't forget about you.  It's going to be near impossible to ship before 2019 given courier services are closed down and 2019 is only 5 days away.

Here's some more green to cheer you guys up

Try now, it's now behind Cloudflare :)
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:28:14
Careful.  Marking bank notes might be considered vandalism?

Cool short video of the lights in action 
Or a small gif 
This only shows very few modes they can operate in.

Hard to give an ETA at this stage.  These things are a massive effort to make.  Stay tuned.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:53:29
lol !  It's just a tag
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:17:24
I hear you.  It's just a simple landing page for now.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:55:54
It does for early adopters.  Banks are the on-ramp to acquiring Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:45:56
Not exactly a happy ending.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:37:44
Please try again now and let us know?  There was some brief DNS issues.

Remember not all exchanges support airdrops or forks.

Slick UI.

Drop your details here 
I've read over reddit self-promotion rules and msg'd the mods here to clarify.
It's not immediately clear.  I think they just discourage spamming.  Since you guys are genuinely interested i don't see this being a problem posting the link above?

Put it in your man cave.  Let her decorate her own tree :)

2000 what? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:39:28
Happy to help but I'm not sure what the rules are on self-promotion for this sub??  
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:24:06
For the guys that wanted to see red 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:09:54
Sure.  But what if your most hated coin is included, would you still want one?
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:37:42
Could also force them to limit / delay withdrawals.

Soon we can all earn crypto playing games.
