People are willing to buy it at market price

Yeah sorry but the average person doesn't give a shit about buying coffee with Bitcoin, they just want to make money

Do you actually think most people buying bitcoin are buying it because they read up on it and believe in the technology behind it? No, they want to make money. What Bitcoin's qualitative value is does not matter to the vast majority of people.

Basically yeah, if BTC reaches its full potential it means being *the* global reserve currency IMO. Until something like that happens you'll still be seeing price appreciation of some sort

No it isn't, it's called normal people getting involved with crypto. They see $$$ and they want in. Do you think the average person knows what "fiat" means, or what fractional reserve banking is? No. They don't give a shit. They go to the store, they take out their credit card, they swipe, and viola - they bought something. Since you can't really do that (considering the extra hassle, nor would most people *want* to), the only reason the average person is going to buy cryptocurrency is because of price appreciation. 
Bitcoin was here first: it has the brand power, it has the awareness, and it has the price appreciation. I can tell you first hand that nobody really gives a shit about any other crypto. They don't care what they do, they don't care what capabilities they add, they *don't care*. That's why Bcash users are sitting around with their thumbs up their asses all day while Bitcoin leaves them in the dust. Once lightning transactions are a thing ([within one or two years]( there won't be a fee or mempool problem anyway. Normal people can barely figure out what Bitcoin is, much less what IOTA or Tether is. You can be idealistic all you want, but if you want widespread crypto adoption, this is what it looks like - and (barring some catastrophe) it's going to be Bitcoin.
