There's no proof anything is going to go up either...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:06:07


So do they add a percentage fee for using a credit card? None the less, the places I shop at don't have such fees.
Maybe BTC will be a huge thing in the future, maybe it won't. In any case I treat it as a risky currency. You do you.

Vanguard has said that there is 70% chance of stock market crash within the next year. And I've heard it in many sources that things are starting to look worrying. Hitting an all time high today doesn't mean that the next year is going to be great...
I can't remember where I read about Netflix, but there was something troubling about it, and I remember thinking that it would be a terrible investment. Then again searching around I can only find positive news. But again, the fact that it has performed well in the past definitely does not mean it will continue to do so in the long term future.

Except by saying "miss the old days of Bitcoin on here" he is obviously referring to Reddit, and specifically this subreddit.
More than likely they had more than one account. Doubt anyone would say they miss their time on a subreddit if they never participated.

Legally you would need to pay taxes. Chances are that banks were involved at some stage, so you can't really hide it even if you didn't use an exchange.
Shouldn't try to hide anyway. Pay your taxes!

Or just wait for it to reach 500k, so you still get the house.

They might, its true that there is Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, etc. So it could be that you can select between for example Bitcoin, Etherium, and Litecoin. But to me it seems a bit complicated to have multiple different digital currencies. Why would people want that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:03:12
It hasn't dipped enough to buy yet. It could start going up again, but I think it'll go down for some time. Possibly weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:44:08
You know your country doesn't have capital gains taxes, but don't know which country that is?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:12
But doesn't that mean that you pay heaps in transaction fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:07:17
Then again, if its true that Wall St. is pushing up the price in order to get heaps of money on futures, then it might never recover to these levels after the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:51
Are futures already available?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:20
BTC was around $1000 at the start of the year, and real use cases haven't gotten much better since then. I'm sure we'll go below $10,000 before the end of next year, but you might be right that we won't see a $2000 coin again. Or we might end up going below $100, perhaps slowly, as people realize BTC isn't a viable option, and some new cryptocurrency takes over. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:23:32
Grumpy? lol
All I said was that BTC is not what you would call a safe investment.
Bitcoin futures hitting NASDAQ doesn't suddenly make BTC a safe investment. 
By all means go and buy BTC, but beware of the risks involved.
And when I say BTC could crash, I don't mean temporarily, I mean in a way it doesn't recover (back to the levels we see prior to the crash).
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:58
Why not just use a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:36:30
Wouldn't it be much easier for Wall St to go short, and then cause a market crash, which will spiral out of control by itself, rather than attempt to go long and somehow keep BTC going up for an extended period of time?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:39:09
I didn't realize they were out of context.
First point I honestly thought you were saying that I shouldn't call it an investment because its a currency, and has the potential to be huge in the future.
And the second point I thought you meant that it couldn't be a bubble because of how high its gone, or that if it is a bubble, its the biggest one you've seen. Either way, that's a big point. This could be a big thing when it pops.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:34:02
The fees involved are still much higher than using cash. Depending on the service if I went and bought 10€ of BTC, sent that to someone, and they sold it immediately (with the same exchange rate), they would be left with about 3€. IMO that's just ridiculous. If I just transferred the money it wouldn't cost anything, and they would be left with the full 10€.
And the large fluctuations really aren't a good thing if you want to use it as currency, are they?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:01
KGB already knows your home address.
Why would you be so worried about anyone knowing the COUNTRY you are from anyway?
Besides, I don't care where you are from, I just want to know one country where there are no capital tax. Cause I don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:52:37
Nobody said that the futures were being settled in BTC. And that doesn't have any impact on what futures were created for...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:38:33
Would depend on the reasons though.
Also, isn't it likely that one cryptocurrency is going to become mainstream, and the rest fade away? So if you have 10% each in 10 different altcoins, wouldn't you lose 90%?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:46
I'm not from America. Didn't know there were countries where there are no taxes. Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:42:45
Those card fees though, wow, those are really expensive. Where did you find one where they don't have high fees?
And I bet those car dealerships are in the US or something. Never heard of car dealership taking bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:36
Those are different services that provide a different experience. They aren't currencies. Currently we do have USD, Euro, etc. but the thing is, those are based on the country you live in. So if you live in europe, you use euro (and convert to what ever currency you need if you buy overseas). If you have a digital currency, why would you need/want different options?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:58:03
If you actually read the thread you would know the discussion was about the current state of bitcoin. And future development and the lightning network had already been mentioned.
Currently if I went to buy a 2€ ceffee using bitcoin I would have to pay almost 10€ in transaction fees. That sure is retarded, isn't it? And it adds up, if you used bitcoin exclusively, during a year you would be spending thousands just on transaction fees. Whereas using cash, credit, or debit card there are no fees. In fact, if you use a credit or debit card you usually get some percentage bonus.
The lightning network will take a long time to adapt. And once it is adapted, there is still going to be a fee, even if its only a couple of cents. But at that point it could be somewhat more usable. Especially if the price of bitcoin has stabilised to be actually useful as a currency. Because as it stands, especially on this subreddit, people tend to treat it as an investment (when really its speculation), and the price fluctuates wildly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:01:01
Its true that the person who accepts credit cards has to pay a fee, but that fee is incorporated into the price of the product. So you pay that same fee whether you pay by credit card, debit card, cash, or bitcoin.
Cash is subject to inflation, but btc is subject to deflation, which has its own problems.
Currently btc is not a safe store of value. Its a speculation. Its very risky. I personally think its a worthwhile thing to store some money, but you need to understand that the value of btc is unknown. It could be 1000, or it could be 100,000.

Assuming they bought low and sold high then they didn't lose anything. Potential profits are not a real loss. And they'll be able to buy again soon, since its bound to correct at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:52:32
You said that LTC would be above 100 in one years time. If the current price is about 92-93... Well, you do the math.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:16
It doesn't have to be passed, since the stock market does follow an upwards trend over time, so it should be expected that its not a ceiling. But the stock market follows a cycle, and we are due for a fall. It won't keep going up forever. Just nobody knows when it'll happen, or what causes it. Could be NK starts a war, Trump does something crazy, a disaster, pandemic, or anything really.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:55:37


Your the one who called it an investment. I just followed suit, with an analogy of "investing" by buying lottery tickets. Its not really investing, but people are treating it as such. And really, what can I buy with bitcoin?
And the fees involved with purchasing/selling bitcoin are actually higher than buying stocks. And of course there are no fees involved with just using normal currency.


Well yeah, that's just it. People are going to lose a lot of money. Then again some will make a lot of money. Just don't treat it as a safe investment and put all your money into it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:01:35
Honestly though, I'd assume an inheritance from an oil tycoon to be way more than what you got from bitcoin. Doesn't make any sense anyway. If you are going to lie you may as well take the credit, say that you worked three jobs for 40 years with no holidays doing hard labor, and now its time to rest and spend the money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:46:06
I thought Netflix was doing quite poorly. The stock market itself is likely to crash within the year, so that's not necessarily the safest option anyway. Though it'll obviously recover, so in the long term its a good investment.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:02:51
What do you mean?
If you originally invested 4500 USD buying 1 BTC, and now sell 0.5 BTC, you'll cash out 4828 USD. You'll end up with 328 USD more than you started with, plus 0.5 BTC.
So if the price drops below 5000, and you decide to sell the your 0.5 BTC at say 4000, then you'll get a further 2000 USD. So you'll have made 2328 USD profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:57:41
A crash. BTC could be worth 100 tomorrow. Or it might be 50000. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:42:54
I know its a bubble, I know I can't predict it, and I know I'm not lucky. Still considering buying some (actually just did, but such a negligible amount it won't make any difference whether it quadruples or goes to 0).
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:00
I think how much you have in bitcoin is more like asking how much did you win in a lottery. More to do with how lucky did you get, than how rich you are. Its also something that you might assume someone is very happy about, and might actually want to talk/boast about.
Also, in my experience people tend to ask about wages and rent. I don't ask people, but I assume that if someone asks then they are comfortable sharing as well. Might be a small cultural difference though, since I'm not in the US.
Though personally if I won the lottery I wouldn't tell anyone, unless/until I did something that required an explanation. Which I might not do anyway.
But the thing is I wouldn't even say I won the lottery. If someone comes up to me and says they won the lottery, of course I'll ask how much. Same with bitcoin. If you say you bought some, I'd ask how much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:25:12


Only if they SELL now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:14:23
Conserving means protecting. Investing in bitcoin is taking a big risk. As always, big risk means potentially very big profits. For example, you put 100 dollars into buying lottery tickets and win a million. That doesn't mean that it was a conservative move to buy the tickets, you just took a huge risk, and got huge profits.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:05:11
Well that's been the case for a long time now. It could go at any moment. I agree that it feels like its going to crash hard, IMO feels like within the month, but it could well continue climbing until some time next year. 
Really though, if you think it'll recover, then its an ok time to invest.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:20:06
So once they start selling the price is suddenly going to drop
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:21:50
Thats assuming that the price stabilizes after the crash, and people don't decide to abandon bitcoin. In which case although you'd own a large portion of coins it wouldn't actually be worth anything.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:38:42
14% increase in a year? I mean that's great, but not really that amazing compared to the stock market. And compared to possible BTC gains... Especially considering LTE seems more risky than BTC.
Is there any reason for something like LTC becoming mainstream? If Amazon decided to add BTC as a payment option, would they also add LTC? Just seems unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:18:15
Have you written things worth 0,01 in your will?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:24:30
If I were you I'd sell 50% now and not make a loss.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:03
But when. That's the question.
