On a theoretical level you can randomly generate a used address. There's nothing that directly prevents that. However due to the sheer number of possible addresses, the chances of someone ever generating the same address as someone else is infinitesimally small. All the worlds' computers working together for the lifespan of the universe small.

I don't have an opinion on what amount of identification is needed. I'm just saying what they will say to you when they charge you for money laundering.
Let's say you have a business converting USD to CAD or something. You maintain that you do not require any sort of identification whatsoever and the exchange is entirely anonymous. When someone does launder money through you, you will be considered to have assisted the money laundering since you structured your business to be attractive for it. A warrant does nothing because you couldn't track a transaction down even if you wanted to.

As opposed to paper money, which is even more impossible to know. 
Stealth addresses don't provide true anonymity since it's still just as traceable for the person sending the payment.
Coinjoin involves some measure of centralization. Not enough for fraud to occur, but enough that a service can be shut down.
Both give a user casual privacy, but that's it.
Zerocoin works better, but has issues scaling up. Moreso than the current issues the Bitcoin protocol already has.
You don't have to tell me about the benefits of Bitcoin. I'm a big supporter. But I could care less about taking down the government. History shows that ideas like governments don't disappear overnight. They integrate, adapt, or show up in some other form. The government may lose responsibilities. They may gain new responsibilities. They may lose some power, or not. I'm all for improving efficiency, I just don't see governments as inherently evil and I don't see Bitcoin and blockchain technology as immune from future problems.

No, we're not talking about that, but it seemed to me that you were claiming that there was no way whatsoever to hurt someone using money.
This is also why the notion of intention is supposed to be very important. You can save a doctor that hurts someone, but you aren't considered to be at fault if you didn't know that the doctor intended to hurt someone. You could help fund something that hurts someone, but if you didn't know that then you aren't considered at fault. But if you did know that, you could be considered at fault.
So if someone knowingly funds drug deals then whether you consider that person to have done something wrong depends on whether you consider drug deals to be something wrong. 
I don't think that a person who did that did something wrong, I still know it's a crime, I don't think it should be a crime, I can understand why someone may think it should be a crime, I don't claim that someone who thinks that is objectively wrong, but I still don't believe it should be a crime.

It's the literal definition of crime. If no government existed then there isn't such a thing as crime. There are still immoral activities, but technically no crimes.

The problem is more the fanatical supporters that inhabit this subreddit and similar communities. The ones who only are interested in Bitcoin because "fuck the banks and government" and to get rich quick.
There are a lot of others who are a lot more reasonable about the benefits of Bitcoin and aren't out to make a quick buck on speculation. Even the more listened to figures like Andreas Antonopoulos are far, far more reasonable when you actually listen to them. Saner supporters agree that the price needs to stabilize, or at least make better arguments. They agree that at least some form of regulation needs to exist, that it needs to be taxed, and that there are some downsides including lack of consumer protection (although this can be remedied through escrow services and the like). They are the same people that don't recommend treating Bitcoin like a safe investment and don't claim that the price will definitely skyrocket.
I've seen people counter the claim that it's a scam with "it can't be a scam because I got rich" as if that meant anything.
Just look at it all as a large experiment (which it is) and don't take the people here to be the norm for supporters.

It's far cheaper for merchants. There is a direct motivation for merchants to want to accept it. The savings *may* be passed onto a consumer.
Also, when using a credit card you are trusting the merchant with your credit card number every time. With crypto like bitcoin, the code you are trusting the merchant with isn't a security concern for you, and they never have to see the code or anything else that is actually important to you when you are paying them.
Of course the downside to that is you don't get the consumer protection you get with credit cards and paypal. Two-edged sword.
And yeah, a lot of people here in give bullshit pseudo-economic reasons without considering the advantages and disadvantages for a consumer.

Saying someone is a criminal is not the same thing as saying that they did something wrong. Saying someone is a criminal is saying that they committed a crime. It is not a judgement on whether that crime should be a crime or not.
Saying he's a criminal has nothing to do with saying whether the government is right or wrong. You can also be a criminal, yet not be punished for being a criminal. HSBC could have done something criminal and not been punished for it.
I believe the government is correct in thinking him to have done something that broke a law. I believe the government is wrong in deciding that law is how it should be. That isn't really hard to understand. And things aren't just broken down to a vague "government is wrong" and "government is right." I can think the government is wrong with some things and right in others. Anyone who doesn't think that is usually rather simple minded.

We may think morality is 100% subjective, but that doesn't mean that we think that the majority of our current society follows a moral code that we at least mostly agree with. 
If I was a jew and I lived in Nazi Germany, then fuck yes I'd be scared to leave my house.
Humans are malleable. Humans were not designed to be one thing and set down upon the earth never to change. It is entirely plausible for humanity to evolve to lose empathy. It is entirely possible for humanity to evolve to lose the capacity to kill willingly. 
You must either prove that what you consider to be "objective" morality (not empathy, morality) is something innate to our genetic code, or you must prove that "objective" morality exists even if humanity did not exist.

Which is why it may make sense to try brute forcing it for a while. But that's assuming some 1-5 character password. 8+ characters and you don't really have a chance without some mathematical flaw being discovered or relying on something other than classical computers. At 300 000 guesses a second with a pretty dedicated computer, you aren't going to be cracking those passwords in your lifetime.
And someone who even bothered to mine BTC in the first place is not your typical computer user. I don't think I'd call it likely that the password in this case would be weak. Throwing out 13 BTC wasn't a big deal when they were worth micropennies and no-one figured it'd be at the price they are at today. The only sign that it was a "typical" computer user was that there was still data on the drive, but that can be explained away by someone else having taken care of throwing out the drive.
As qnmaster said, no one is saying that users never have bad passwords and that bad passwords aren't much easier to brute-force. The problem is the impression you're giving about just how hard/easy it is to brute-force a password, especially since we're talking about the Bitcoin-qt wallet where we **do** know how it's encrypted.

You can use something without knowing it or having it. It's right to say that the public key is being used at least indirectly, the question is if it's right to say that you are using their public key. I don't think the definition is clear cut.
On a more laymen level, I think it's perfectly fine to say that you're using their public key. Most people don't know about public-private key cryptography, and hashing the public key isn't really the integral part of the Bitcoin protocol.

It's entirely possible to agree that he likely did not hurt anyone, but that it is also possible (not probable) that he knew that the money he laundered was hurting someone and that there is information that we do not know.
Saying anything that isn't "everything Charlie did was 100% moral" means that you 100% support the government in everything and anything they do. That's beyond childish to go into that mindset of "us vs. them." You ever actually stop to think about why the statement "you're either with us or with the terrorists" is considered ridiculous?

I actually entirely agree with this. I just also think that that makes up a good part of what morality is. 
We just happen to share a large part of our morality and moral code with those that we wish to participate with and emulate. It's a large part of the reason why abused children are likely to grow up to be abusers. I believe morality is entirely made up of one's own feelings and interactions with society (parents, friends, religion) and is an individual judgement on reality, completely tied to individual influence and therefore subjective.
The human brain is extremely prone to deluding itself. It will attempt to justify most actions that it does. I believe it's a combination of that, what you were taught to be normality, and empathy that makes up morality.

It could be universally accepted that a person who did something evil should be killed. The person being killed may think what they did is not worthy of them being killed.

I just found one, I didn't do it. You just need certain blocks and lines to indicate what area a scanner should be looking in, and then some kind of contrasting thing in certain spots to end up with a result. It also makes use of error correction where you have certain bits of information that help identify whether the message is messed up somehow, and even potentially attempt to correct it (like how DNA strands can be messed up, yet still be corrected as long as not too much is lost) which is how you can replace parts of a QR code with gibberish and still have it work.
[Here's an interesting video about such kinds of codes and with a simple example that sort of explains how such kinds of codes can work.]( And their own examples of making stylized visual markers that still encode information.
Today you only scan something when you know there's something to scan, but such kinds of "disguised" codes could have some pretty interesting uses if people were to say, be wearing things that are constantly scanning what they're looking at. Like looking at a mural on a restaurant window that has the times and special of the day pop up without requiring any kind of location information.

No, I'm saying it's still a crime, not that it deserves punishment. And I believe all laws lack objectivity, because laws and morality are both not entirely objective.
I can consider things just crimes. I can consider things crimes that don't deserve to be crimes and don't deserve punishment. Something being a crime isn't based on my opinion, it actually is based on whether the government considers it a crime. Saying something is a crime is essentially the same as saying that an action is illegal. Saying something is illegal is making no judgement on whether it should be illegal or not.

Whether homosexuality is acceptable or not is very subjective.
Whether pedophilia is acceptable is extremely subjective.
Rape of a foreign enemy civilian of a city you just sacked was considered very moral.
Go ask an ancient Roman about the "objective morality" of owning slaves. They'd laugh, and point at how virtually every society and person was alright with the concept of slaves, even the slaves themselves.

It's for machines that you can sell items to, not the other way around.
So this does nothing for ATMs that you can buy Bitcoins from.

I thought what you are saying was indeed the case. Which is why the ATMs in Canada, for example, are easy to use (you can only buy BTC with them though).

But they don't, which is another reason why you're using cash.
Also, are you seriously saying that there is no situation where you'd prefer to pay in cash rather than credit or debit? You seem to not care whatsoever if you're the victim of identity fraud.

Is not the same thing as "I believe the government is correct in thinking him to have done something that broke a law." Under the government's own declarations of what is law, they are correct in saying he broke a law. Because that's the definition of a crime. Not the definition of what is right or wrong.
That is not a statement about the morality of the law or the action and whether it was justified.
To use your example, I believe that the law about being able to enslave people is awful, but the government isn't incorrect (**which doesn't mean I think they're justified**) to think that those that try to escape broke a law and are criminals. I happen to also think that those criminals committed a **just** crime.

Arguing that morality is not objective isn't saying that I support the morality of whoever was doing anything at any time in history. Slavery was commonly considered to be a moral action, giving slaves a better life than they would otherwise have been able to have. Do I agree with that idea? Of course not.
We're not at all arguing that because something happened, that thing is right or wrong. Personally, I'm saying that there *is* no concept of universal right or wrong. Right or wrong is determined by society. I happen to agree with most of what our modern society agrees is right or wrong, but if someone believes something differently I'm not going to claim that they're objectively wrong, but I will still disagree with them.
If the entire population of mankind was taught to believe that slavery was moral and that was how it was done for many generations, that would be considered the norm. The slaves would even consider that the norm. I don't think there's anything innate in human nature that says slavery is wrong.

At the moment it's considered the lesser evil. Experience has shown that a fully free market is a disaster. Could it be possible to go back to such a system but approached differently to avoid economic collapse? Maybe. But the problem is that no one actually has an alternative that has been shown to work better than a planned or mixed economy.
Health care insurance, for example, has been shown to be far more efficient when government-run than privately run. Other things, however, have been shown to be more efficient privately run.

They don't serve all the same end purposes though. One of the main reasons I and many others opt to use Paypal is if they want some consumer protection when they're buying something from a sketchy site. You lose convenience and pay fees in exchange for insurance.

One direct reason is that it's cheaper for a merchant than debit or credit, but maintains at least most of the convenience of a credit card.
Except you don't need to worry about some malicious person having your public key, but you do need to worry about a malicious person having your credit card number.
On a consumer level, it really is best described as digital cash. It is as safe as just giving someone cash in terms of identity and credit card fraud, but it also loses the ability to have chargebacks like credit cards. It's cash that can be more convenient to use, carry, and transfer.

Only the more delusional on here that put their life savings into Bitcoin and aren't willing to consider any possible future where Bitcoin specifically isn't the only remaining currency in the world.
It almost makes me feel uncomfortable to claim to be a strong supporter of Bitcoin because of the types of people that also claim that and very much are the type of person to put way too much faith into anything.

Morality is very subjective...how the hell do you even argue otherwise?
Doesn't matter a single bit that laws are arbitrary rules, breaking the law is still a crime. We aren't talking about the morality of acts, only the legality.

[You can see for yourself what it looks like. When you make a change someone has to give permission for your change to be included in the "real" copy.](
You can fork the code to have your own personal copy that you can screw up to your heart's content, then when you're ready you can send in a pull request which will merge your changes to the main copy if it is accepted.
You can also fork the code to make your own version of Bitcoin, which is what happened with Litecoin and etc.
A huge advantage of using something like this is version control. You have all the past versions of the code stored, so you could easily reverse changes and look back at all the changes that have been made.

A law can be hypocritical (especially in America, where laws are sometimes sort of based on precedent, not what's actually written). You don't have to convince me about whether the laws are justified or not, I'm talking about definition.

No, Euclidean geometry was disproven as a side effect of Newtonian physics being disproven.
And yes, only disproven in the sense that it acts as an approximation of something. It is a mathematical abstraction. It is useful. But the universe is not Euclidean. The idea behind Euclidean geometry held that the universe followed Euclid's axioms, that is definitely proven false. If you say that something cannot be disproven because it is correct within its own rules, then I can claim that the Earth being flat cannot be disproven because in *my* model of the universe the Earth *is* flat.
I work in science, I don't treat anything as absolutely true. I'd call the Earth flat if enough evidence was brought up to suggest that and counter the notion that the Earth was not flat. I also work in computing, so I immerse myself in the abstract idea that I can be 100% confident that things are absolutely true, but only to serve a practical purpose in reality.

Most who would even be in the position where they'd know to and want to modify it? It's pretty standard knowledge for that sort of Windows user.

To be fair it's not great for small transactions. I had to pay something like a 0.0007 BTC  fee just to get a $3 transaction to confirm in a timely manner recently. Another with a 0.20 USD fee failed to confirm at all. [This recommends a 50 cent fee for the average transaction at the moment.]( The fee is amazingly small if I'm sending a relatively large amount overseas. It's quite high if I'm buying a $3 game or coffee.

Are you really saying that computers should only be limited to people of a certain skill set and level? Why do you use Linux and take the easy way? Linux enables neanderthals to use computers without having to make their own OS.   
The original point wasn't even anything like saying that people should or shouldn't use any specific OS. It was that you had the wrong idea of just exactly how limiting windows is as an OS.    
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:32:02
It's a pretty big jump from "Microsoft has support numbers" to "you need to call support to access something as simple as a hosts file." Using Windows is not remotely that limited of an experience.
