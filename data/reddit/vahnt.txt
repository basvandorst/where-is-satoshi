Gotta love all the people that are supposedly supportive of Bitcoin being unregulated and "free market" until that very nature causes their positions to go south 
This is part of the risk you assume when you get into this market. Deal with it

When I say "you" I mean any one individual in question, not necessarily YOU.
Exchanges have fucked shit up and impacted the price negatively for years, this is nothing new. The few people in this thread talking about legal action, etc. are the ones I have no sympathy for

What guy? The guy telling you that this is how Bitcoin works and you're a hypocrite for embracing it when it rallies and decrying it when it crashes?
This market isn't for the faint of heart. I lost around 1.5 BTC when Gox went down and although I've filed a bankruptcy claim I basically wrote off my personal odds of ever actually getting that money back, and this is just the shit that happens every now and then. If you leave an unreasonable amount of your fiat or BTC sitting on an exchange account, you run that risk, and I have no sympathy for you

Attacking grammar is the last refuge of someone with nothing meaningful left to say. Educate yourself before spouting off stupid shit in the future

A simple google search would yield a number of results for "problems with passive investing", but since you're too retarded to even understand what points I was trying to make I guess I should just leave you to go play in the mud instead

Yeah, past performance is totally a predictor of future results! Definitely no long-term existential issues raised by having a neverending supply of passive money continually just buying an index with no regards to efficient allocation of capital (which is the primary function of the market in the first place)
