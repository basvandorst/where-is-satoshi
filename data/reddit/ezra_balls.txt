IMO the futures market drove a lot of that growth as a more "legit" investment, and subsequently I feel it's played a bigger part in the crash than anything else. Especially considering the contracts are cash settled. The next big jump will come from a Blockchain settled future/option, and or the approval of an ETF, which feels somewhat unlikely due to the lack of demand for futures

"The first trading halt came about 2 1/2 hours after the session began, while the second one triggered after four hours. Cboe imposes circuit breakers to curb volatility, halting transactions for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and for five minutes at 20 percent.
Trading will stop for at least five minutes if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website."

Agreed, fees are lower now. But that doesn’t mean they can’t go lower still. 
In an ideal world transaction fees would be near zero, with enough volume to support network

Umm, that’s exactly what we said in the 2008 crash...

Sure, that too. The point is: economic downturn, no matter how large, is unlikely to drastically affect food supply. That is until the money runs dry and folks simply can’t afford to buy it
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:21:47
Not entirely, Coinbase is insured to some extent against flaws in their own system (not “user error”). But if bitcoin is to really take off a service like this is absolutely needed.  As soon as my mom can figure out how to buy it and hold it safely and confidently, that’s when we see real exponential growth from the private sector

Worth every Satoshi
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:46:28
They have several revenue streams. Purchase fees, sell fees, skimming transaction fees, etc
The point is, it’s a bit dishonest to call the fee a “bitcoin network fee” when in fact it is a “coin base transaction fee”, the later having no real effect on the speed at which your transaction confirms regardless of how high the fee is
This is further compounded by information all over the place directing users to pay a higher network fee for faster confirmations
An analogy might be a shipping company charging for a new “expedited shipping” when in reality all they’ve done is slowdown regular shipments by holding them in the warehouse for 3 days
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:15:25
That’s because distribution and food production is completely rudimentary by today’s standards. Disruption on that scale simply can’t/highly unlikely to occur outside of a major apocalyptic scenario like nuclear war or act of god.
You don’t really seem to understand economics. US economy is driven by tech innovation, industrial design and real estate. The fact that the entire market collapsed to levels not seen since the Great Depression IS in fact an economic collapse by today’s standards.
The resiliency and ability to recover is a statement to the advances we have made in the past few decades. Buildings out infrastructure that won’t collapse merely due to economic downturns 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:13:27
This is brilliant. Tank the Bitcoin Cash market by selling such high volume, that way the BTC payout is less

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:39:19
Because there is a lack of liquidity in the forked market. The “price” is deceptive because not all holders even know they have the coin decreasing supply, the ones that do want to flip it to suckers jumping on every “new” coin.
There can only be a handful of coins that succeed and thrive. We currently see a land grab of devs attempting to break out and become one of those thriving coins like BTC or ETH. The rest will slowly die out, with lots of volatility until they become the pets.com of crypto. Buyer beware

The latter arguments are based on assumptions the limitations and volitility can't be overcome. Nothing could be further from the truth, transaction volume improvements are nearly ready. The price was relatively stable for two years before the media hyped it up again. The only leg left in the argument is the fact that goods are still priced in USD.

There's a difference between spreading propaganda vs assassination. Blaming the election result on meddling meme posters is flat out embarrassing. 
Sounds more the US is filled with ignorant people who can't fact check their own political discussion on the internet. Where are the bleeding hearts for all the poor people who live under governments who do absolutely nothing but distribute propaganda.
There's a reason the US has become the power it is today. Freedom of speech and the right to say anything you want without censorship is the foundation of all of it. The second the US decides it's ok to censor "some" speech simply because it comes from scary international meddlers, is the day the slow and painful decline of the culture begins.
