Yeah I'm a developer myself (although I've never written any BTC stuff beyond the exploratory stages) and I am skeptical of course of BU's hostility towards making off-chain transactions easier, but as a developer I am also extremely, extremely devoted the importance of being "allowed" to fork and wrest authority from the maintainer if need arises.
As a side note I also think a doubling or even quadrupling of the block-size is warranted at this point, but giving the miners democratic authority to disenfranchise nodes by arbitrarily increasing block size unilaterally also seems dangerous. (do I understand the BU proposal correctly?) More dangerous perhaps than kissing the ring of whoever runs pull requests at Core (something I am also extremely loathe to do)

The Bitcoin protocol is not immutable, it has been changed several times over the course of its existence and it is very clear from Nakamoto's writings that he, a fellow libertarian, could not have intended that an organized group of maintainers should be the final and absolute authority on how the protocol should evolve.
Of course, I also find the argument that a simple majority of miners should be the ultimate authority on protocol matters to be patently absurd. I just don't want to see the community abandon its libertarianism in its desperation to end this controversy. 
All I am saying is that our loyalty to core is and must remain a conditional loyalty, at best, and I am seeing troubling signs to the contrary all over this community.

Hmm, just looked at classic, the approach of not having a hard blocksize limit at all and letting each node choose whether or not it wants to accept any given block may ultimately be the correct way forward. I haven't paid attention to the Bitcoin drama for a couple years, why was this ultimately rejected by the consensus?
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:25:24
I agree with you??
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:25:11
Agree with everything you have written so far. If it came down to strictly technical merits, I would prefer segwit strongly, and Core seems to be acting in good faith as benevolent dictators.
The only problem is that I do sympathize strongly with the argument that benevolent dictators should not necessarily be the ones dictating the block-size. In an ideal world, it would come down to proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-burn or some other "decentralized" method of parameterization.
Hell, it could just scale linearly with time.
I do find it amusing though that in some alternate-universe chain of events Core could find itself subject to this subreddits rule 5. ;)
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:15:05
If I paid the transaction fee for some portion of the block, I have the right to put whatever I want there. This is not a bug but a deliberate feature.
Unrelated PS: fuck core and the mining cartel be an anarchist lmao

But I'm not concerned about "the attack" per se, even if it was an attempt to establish an authority what btc classic is saying appears to be "more correct" to the Bitcoin principles I remember and that problem trivially remains even after the enemies are routed. Honestly I am getting weird vibes from this subreddit. Did all the cool people leave bitcoin in the last couple years?
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:52:46
The poster above you is mistaken. The fork is irreversible, you will have both and be able to sell both at whatever price you can.
Edit: Reading another thread, I am reminded that a transaction from one chain may be publishable on the other chain and the receiver has no incentive not to attempt to do this. An interesting thought...
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:47:23
Having just caught up with all the BTC controversies going on right now, I find myself extremely pro-fork. There is and can be no authoritative Bitcoin, and a reality check will ultimately be good for everyone involved. Although there is a strong likelihood that whichever side prevails will take their victory as a mandate to further reinvent Bitcoin, hopefully that party will recognize that they too can be brought down by the fork and show some humility for once!
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:34:43
This post is simply wrong. Even if core loses 75% of its hashing power difficulty adjustment means blocks would still be published at ten minute intervals.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:18:39
Yeah this is true, its impossible to know how stubbornly this will play out on either side.

I think "ability to raise money" refers to the power to tax, not the power to mint coins.
@_date: 2013-09-01 20:57:07
There is also the case where the miner is not profitable with just the blockchain reward but he is moving so many bitcoins around that the money he saves on transaction fees makes it profitable.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:01:35
1 block = 1 share, the pool can assign that share as it sees fit. Pool members are subject to the rules governing their pool, they are not a "sovereign force" in the bitcoin transacting consensus. And that is my intention, to let this "transacting consensus" to act pro-actively in an economically stabilizing way, rather than retroactively in a economically destabilizing way.

Some of the changes predicted on the horizon as bitcoin evolves will have an impact on the economic variables of the bitcoin equation. There will be strife, there will be drama, bitcoins will lose confidence unless the conflict is settled in an orderly manner.

Perhaps it is the anarchist streak in this community that is causing me to get rejection &amp; downvotes. If this organization was completely subservient to, and under the auspices of, the bitcoin foundation, would this be acceptable? Therefore they would logically have no more power than Gavin could convey.
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:06:11
Sure, but this is the same as any other transaction the majority of miners don't want to deal with... The minority still handles it eventually. 50% in this case isn't a special tipping point number.

The fact that economically significant changes to bitcoin are inevitable in the future (particularly, the block size limit comes to mind), and the stability of bitcoin values demands a peaceful solution.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:23:49
Scenario: A member first proposes that the block size be raised to 4MB after 1/1/14. Another member introduces an amendment to change this to 2MB. The majority concurs. The matter is put to a vote and passed by a majority. Miners implement the resolved change after it is ratified by Gavin. Absolutely nothing will happen without the explicit approval of the majority.

It must be from the block reward of the mined block.
Regarding your edit: No, the protocol already needs this feature to assign block rewards i.e. to pool members.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:16:20
You mean a 51% attack? Yes, they could do that if they wanted to, as they can now. What this makes interesting is that who you work for as a pool member suddenly becomes much more meaningful than who pays the highest fees, it is a transfer of political power.

I am considering the "natural law" of bitcoin, that the chain with the highest difficulty is the legitimate chain, it is already a majority-wins game. I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for you what you're saying is troubling. Perhaps this difficulty is avoided because we are seeking the consensus of a majority and cannot move forward on any minority opinion, even if that is a plurality. It simply means the **talking must continue** if we are to prevent future soreness.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:26:59
It relies on the law of averages to get an outcome like...9/10 baddy addresses gamble all their money away on silk road and are dead ends. 1/10 baddy addresses have 9.8x the money. Obviously it's highly volatile, but very usable depending on your tolerance for financial risk vs. your tolerance for legal risk.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:34:40
On the contrary thank you for the research!
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:29:49
Yes, but suppose you have 5 addresses, each of which is involved in one Silk Road sale of raw milk. One of these purchases is a straw purchase by the USDA. You transfer to a USD exchange which is a USDA informant and has your IRL identity. Now, if and only if the straw purchase address is in the pool of addresses that transfer money to the informant exchange will you be given up. Therefore you use SatoshiDice to whittle away the addresses down to 1. 80% of the time that straw purchase will lead to a dead end.

As you said nothing we can do can theoretically take power away from the users so why are you hostile to a voluntary organization?
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:36:52
Because the system would treat a single satoshi the same as 100BTC? You'd still get one vote, the excess would be used for the expenditures of congress, perhaps, or passed on to Bitcoin Foundation.
And the transaction must be an output from the block reward, so we know it comes from the miner.
@_date: 2013-05-24 01:18:44
I just had a fantastic idea. Why not allow people to "export" and "import" the block chain with removable media in the bitcoin GUI? Then in your rural neighborhood in Fuckoffistan, your neighbor lets you borrow a flash drive with the blockchain on it and you only need to catch up from the moment the blockchain was synchronized.
Also, perhaps a local high-bandwidth connected node could maintain the blockchain download, and other clients could connect to that node to route and verify its transactions / wallet balances as a client.
Anybody want to help me hack on these two ideas?
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:21:08
Nothing, once the fork happens, the dissidents are no longer mining "bitcoins" at all. But this was always the case. Do you really believe that the bitcoin foundation could push a change that failed to gain the confidence of the majority of miners?
edit: Now this is a more interesting criticism. I suppose some mechanism would be needed to decay voting power over time so that it represents a current distribution of the material sovereign power it is intended to create a parliament between.
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:11:18
It isn't even a 50% thing. Only one node has to mine the transaction for it to be considered valid by all nodes.
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:45:36
The bitcoin foundation is bad for bitcoin. They are pretenders who believe they alone get to decide what is and isn't the "wrong side of the fork".
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:55:38
What's stopping you from accepting BTC for housecalls, right now, for example?

Re Transaction Speed: Satoshi himself has said that it is probably unnecessary to wait for "block chain confirmation." On the technical basis, once you confirm that the transaction is available to all nodes in the network, it is valid, and the transaction fee is non-zero, it is unnecessary to wait for block chain confirmation as nodes will prefer to attach the earlier transaction to the blockchain. (This behavior is purely altruistic, so with the caution that rogue miners may still prefer to attach the later transaction if e.g. if the miner is cooperating with the scammer, or even perhaps if the later contradictory transaction had a greater transaction fee.) I would get in touch with your bit coin payment intermediary to discuss your willingness to tolerate what are frankly, quite complex attacks beyond the scope of the average bar patron.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:51:47
No, you are mistaken. The transaction itself is what conveys the share. 1 satoshi is just simply the most economically rational amount to send.

I am 99% sure it can. It's not automatic the outputs are in the final block signed by the pool.
