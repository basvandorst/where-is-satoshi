Buy them up and then sell them back to miners at a profit when crypto has its next boom.

It could be a small amount relative to the rest of his holdings.

It's an old pasta sir, but it still checks out.

Banks comitting fraud on a global scale and then printing more money when they get caught. That's the reason for its creation.
Because removing the gold standard, backing up currency with real gold, was a fundamentally bad idea.

You know it took hundreds of years for paper money to replace gold coins as a medium of exchange?  I'm sure plenty of people back then said the same thing.

What you've said about gold isn't really a reason for it to be valuable. It's a physical item, okay, but so are leaves a physical item. It only has value because people have a shared common belief of its value, and the scarcity of it.
Claiming that bitcoin is conjured out of thin air and assigned a value, at an uncontrolled rate and causes inflation is so far from the truth you should go back and read the basics. Bitcoin is modelled on gold.

You can gamble on selling the coins later at a higher price. And you can resell the GPU'S.

Once upon a time, the world used gold as a currency. There is a limited amount of gold on the planet, and as more and more gold is dug up and minted into coins, less of it exists in the ground, so the rate that new gold is dug up slows down until eventually there's no more gold left in the ground and it's all in circulation. Let's say there 21 million tons of it in total, for arguments sake.
The people who mined gold earliest made more gold than the miners who started later. Does that make it a ponzi scheme? The gold is still valuable to people who have never mined gold, and those people are safe in the knowledge that the gold they own can't be magically devalued by other people conjuring more gold out of thin air, only by mining more of the limited gold from the ground.
Where is the ponzi scheme? Why is gold valuable, it doesn't really do anything.
The argument that bitcoin makes is that *using gold as currency is a better system than when we replaced it with paper money*.

A little more than 2 years.
