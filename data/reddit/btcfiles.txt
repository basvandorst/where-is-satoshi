Nope.  The files themselves will be stored on a cloud of servers that I can access.  No links would point to this private cloud - no web server would be installed.  The files will be sent to the web servers from this cloud of servers.
The web servers where people can upload/download will simply be copies of files.  The original files with all the data will be stored in a private server.
The web servers WILL be shut down, but it will be VERY easy and quick to launch new instances of the server and make the project back online to its original state using the cloud of servers explained above.

Agree - will be added.  Thanks!

No worries.  Just have a look at this porn company: [Manwin Canada](  They started as mansef by doing illegal porn tubes (uploading porn copyrighted videos).  They own pornhub, youporn, tube8 and a ton more porn tube sites.
They started by sharing copyrighted files and made a business model where copyright owners would, at some point, make more money using their site.  They are now making 15+ millions per month in advertising from their network of sites.  Copyright owners of porn videos now upload their own copyrighted content to profit from these tube sites.
I want to create this business model with any kind of files.  I will have instances of servers shut down, but the network will always survive... and at some point, copyright owners of files will upload their own files to make money in BTC.  Stay tuned! :)

Awesome, thanks!

Yes, I also prefer gox's idea.  This option will be available.
I just wrote some information related to the anonymity of the project under [gox's message](  Let me know if you have additional questions ;)
The project will open within the next 3 weeks.  I just want to test the whole system and make it ultra stable before launch.

The profit share will be 50/50.

I won't use any developed script for this.  I wrote the whole project myself.  I am a web developer with 10 years of experience in my field ;)
Thanks for the offer.  Ill let you know if I need help.  For now, Ill try to run everything by myself.  Thanks anyway!

Oh, and if you like the idea, you can always request any feature(s) and Ill try to add it/them before releasing the site, if possible!
@_date: 2012-07-19 01:01:30
Great!  Thanks, this is very nice of you.  I will post more details as soon as the website opens.  It should be in around 3 weeks.  Like explained above, I want to test it heavily before launching it in a stable release ;)

I can do this on the internet and will do it.  I will even follow the DMCA law and still keep the files online.  You will fully understand once the project launch. :D
@_date: 2012-07-19 02:10:04
Yes, Ill make sure of that.  Thanks for the advice.  Very appreciated.

Like explained above, the full project will be anonymous.  People uploading to the site, people downloading and even the site owners.  The servers will be paid using prepaid Visa cards so make it impossible to re-trace us.
In other words, we will accept any file, even if they are copyrighted.  However, a % of the bit coin funds earned by the site will be sent to public keys created for copyright owners.  
My goal with this project is to build up an awesome platform where downloaders gets what they want for the price they want, and copyright owner, after a while, realize that this way of doing business is very profitable.  And hopefully, after a while, copyright owners of the files will upload their own stuff by themselves to earn money (bit coin).  More details related to this will be given once the site opens.

* Yes, you could download the files every 3 months.  However, I want to give the options.  There is some people that may like to upload a lot of mp3 files, for example (thousands) and stream them directly.  They probably don't want to download them all every 3 months.  So, paying a small fee to host their mp3 library might be a better option.  I don't think this option will be very popular thought - but making this available isn't much more work.
* This is indeed a very good idea.  On the download page, there would be a bit coin key related to their personal session.  If they pay the bit coins, the speed increases automatically.  Awesome idea, thanks!  Will implement this.
* There will be no account on the site.  People will be assigned a session when they will open up the website.  People will be able to pay bit coin to speed up a download based on a session.  When someone leaves the site, the session is destroyed (after 15 minutes).
I would also like to note that the site won't log any information related to users in the apache (web server) log files.  No ip, nothing.  I will also use SSL encryption with a [self signed certificate](  So, all data that people download from the servers won't be able to be traced by ISP's, for example.

Yes, that flow seems very logical.  Ill implement it that way.
I will use a similar system for confirmation.  I'm thinking of a way to do it internally, by myself.  The goal is to make the validation process very quick without depending on any third party.  
If you can help with this by sending me some links, it would be greatly appreciated.  Otherwise, Ill continue reading on this and will find a way to do it. :)

I won't deal with them, they will be allowed.
