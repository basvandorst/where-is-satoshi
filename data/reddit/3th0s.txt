I can't quite make them out. Did you put a QR code in the black box or what?

Wrong. Wrong. You're the puppet. Puppet.

Sports gambling is a lot of fun. You have to think about games very differently, and most of the odds are 50/50, minus 'the juice'. It makes watching a game a lot more fun, and if you wager small amounts it's not too bad when you lose (often). Plus you get to do all sorts of goofy teases, parlays, future bets, bets on sports you don't often watch/follow, entertainment/awards ceremonies, presidential elections etc. 
I wouldn't do dice, card, table, or slot gambling on my PC though. That doesn't sound like fun to me at all.

Can someone explain some of the possible scenarios of what would happen if OP had kept it? Or perhaps a hypothetical scenario less gigantic, like someone meant to buy something from my e-store with .01btc and instead sent .1btc? With traditional transactions or police there are ways to charge back, void the payment, etc etc. Is there any way for that to happen with a btc payment for a business? What would the recourse be, if any?

I don't follow what you mean by this, could you elaborate?

So I'm new to this, but what are the knocks against coinbase and circle? I used circle to purchase $100 in btc this week, and just moved it into a different wallet immediately. It seemed very convenient and easy, was there something big/sinister I missed?
