As you can see on most of those replies, most people have no clue of what bitcoin is about. They come because of the price and this obfuscate mainstream adoption.
I personally feel that another worldwide crisis or maybe other cases like Greece and Venezuela will be the main drivers of adoption. Its when people realize bitcoin is a hedge against governments that's when it will be really adopted.

It's a different transaction format. When calculating the space occupied in a block, segwit transactions get a "discount" because they utilize space that legacy transactions were not using. That's why you get lower fees.
A segwit transaction is one originated from segwit addresses, that starts with "3" instead of "1".
This new format not only optimizes space use but also fix an important issue (tx maleability) and introduces some extra features.

Exactly, until today we didnt find a way to provide a super secure distributed consensus system that handles every single transaction. (simply raising block size is not the answer because it brings a lot of other fundamental problems)
Its like a bank, they have some physical infrastructure that should be used only for the important transactions, for example when you create a new account, you transfer 100k from a savings to an investment account and so on. You dont go to the bank to finish an icecream acquisition, their streucture couldnt handle that. Notice that the transaction done inside the bank will be a bit more secure than the ones you do outside, but both are sufficiently secure to be used on a daily basis. A LN transaction will be much cheaper than onchain and will still be sufficiently secure for daily use.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:11:22
I forgot another detail: LN will also be dependent on liquidity. You will be using other peoples funds to "fuel" your moneys route. So, if you try to send someone 10k and you dont have a direct channel with that person, you will need a route of nodes charged with high amounts of money or the transaction wont go though.
As time passes, there will be big hubs that will hold milionarie nodes, but until there it will be hard to find routes to big money. In this case, you can simply transact using the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:35:00


If im not mistaken, this statement was made in the context that LN is still on beta stage, so you shouldnt use it to transfer high volumes.
Briefly, LN is a way to do bitcoin transactions without putting a burden on the blockchain but still using it. The objective is to use LN like your hot wallet. You charge it with an amount you will be using for a month (using a transaction from your cold wallet/exchange) then expending it during this period.
The charging amount for example could be $1000, so, it would be totally secure to transact more than $20 for sure.

It's the other way around.
There are miners that spend 3k, 4k,... 10k to mine. If price goes to 12k, it will appear some miners that spend 11k to mine. If price decreases to 6k, all the miners that spend more than 5k will simply stop mining/stop buying equipments.

To complement u/TheGreatMuffin answer, I strongly advise to use a smartphone wallet as your hotwallet. For BTC I recomend Samourai Wallet.
You most sensitive data is your secret key/seed. No matter what, even using something like Ledger, you still can fuck up soon or later (send incorrect amounts, somehow expose your seed to someone, etc). To address this, its much better that you charge your hotwallet once in a while in a controlled environment (in your home, taking your time, without pressure, checking if everything is right) and exposing a smaller amount of your bag to external environments.
A non-rooted smartphone is much more secure than a windows PC provided you don't install random crap from the AppStore/Playstore.
I've been also using Enjin Wallet for a while, it also support LTC and ETH tokens. Another one I hear a lot (but never used) is BreadWallet.

To prove my point: btc is been thriving for 9 years until now not because it's a PayPal killer (it can be now, with LN).
If you and me and the other people believed it years ago, it was because of other things.
Now you come and say you don't believe it anymore because it's a bad payment service (see your point 4). It's always been a bad payment service! It's slow, high friction (you need exchanges to buy it then spend), can have high fees, horrible UI, risky to hold keys, low merchant adoption, etc etc etc. How is this a good payment method??
LN is just the first tackle as a "payment system btc". It can or cannot be adopted. But this won't change the reason btc exists and people have been buying it since long ago: to hedge against government central banks. Against Fiat.

I would define a layer being composed of a specific set of rules aimed to best fit a use case.
Layer 1 - Nakamoto Consensus, resistant to changes, Expensive/Slower - Objective: Sound Money
LN Layer (one component of what would be layer 2) - Network of Peer to peer contracts, easily upgradeable/changeable, instant/cheap, liquidity thresholds, **private**. Objective: Micropayments, confirmation speed sensitive payments
Other possible layer 2 applications would be specialized side chains (like RSK for example) that will have rules fit to their specific use (centralized/federated chains like RSK itself, Factom, EOS).
The idea of organizing rules by layers is that its dumb to enforce the Nakamoto consensus between two parties that trust each other, for example.

Lets say FlashCoin(FSC) is much better than btc in the case you pointed.
I buy FSC (i help price to raise), instantly send to my old granny overseas, she then sell (price down again) again so she can buy some cake.
Do you really think this will raise the price of a coin?
As an investor, buying this coin hoping its price raises with this kind of use is, in my humble opinion, dumb.
Btc, as an investment, is something like gold or silver. It raises its value because people stock it, not because people (necessarily) transact it.

@_date: 2018-06-12 13:55:17
Good point.
Now imagine this coin had to give up decentralization to quickly achieve low on chain fees. Miners simply decide to have a nice inflation to compensate the low fees. Then, to patent everything so only their company can operate miners/nodes, etc.

And thats Ok. Layers have this exact function: to create new kinds of rules that people can opt-in if they think the layer better fits their use.

The existence of nonmining nodes force miners to attack other forks in an active way. This attack depends on much more than only having 51%. There's lot of luck, planning and perfect execution to be deployed to this attack. But its barelly possible, in the end.
By having zero nonmining nodes, the miners can passively execute this, basically at no cost. They hit a button and its done.

Personally to me, for a single reason: To force miners to a hardfork if they decide to change anything in the network (node software, blockchain settings). So, there will always be a legacy chain and a new chain. So, miners will also need "social consensus" among users because there will be always a option to use the default coin.
If only miners had nodes, they could do a change without "really" forking the chain, thus, giving no option to the users other than accept the changes or move to another coin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:18
I don't think its possible to permanently lead the block creation with 51% of the network hash. You need something much closer to 100% than to 50%.
Even with 90% of the hash you cant do it consistently (I could be wrong here). But then, if no one is mining the new fork, evil miners will be just (heavy) delaying the legacy one and abandoning their own chain.

An important point there is:


Today, receiving, verifying and seeding 2 HD movies per day for each of the 100k nodes **is** a big deal if you want to maintain the P2P network resilience feature.

Banks and governments are already closing exchanges accounts all over the world. Almost all exchanges require your personal info nowadays, if not, they risk being closed.

Bitcoin can also fragment.
Lets say we fragment the world internet in 4 isolated regions.
The bitcoin community on each of those areas can lock custom nodes with replay protection from each other, so if ever the connection between any of those parts are reestablished, you will have 2/3/4 different forks (the replay protection is important so one fork dont override the other).
While the reconnection dont happen, each fork will have a different price because the demand between the different regions would be probably different.

There are 2 concerns here.
Raising blocksize is a linear way to deal with scalability. It's simply inneficient, even just 2Mb. We need exponencial solutions. Taking drawbacks to adopt linear options will destroy the network for the sake of scalability. Even one small step towards this is a waste of time and resources.
Another point is that people are trying to push bigger blocks now saying "soon" X company will release X Megabytes drives. Why don't we wait those tech become available to roll bigger blocks?
If you observe those points you will suspect that scalability is not the primarily objective of bigger blocks.
Edit: forgot to say that bigger blocks also affect connection requirements, but for some reason this is not being discussed.
