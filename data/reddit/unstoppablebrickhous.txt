What if your mind is already blown?  How are you supposed to pick up the pieces and explode them again?  To what end?  And then how can your mind be blown anymore?  Take your should be blown mindset where it belongs, the nonsense pile.

11/16/2019 it was a cold day.  I opened my personal communicator and responded: How dare you try to invalidate what I said and capture some of it for yourself hogtallow is preposterous that is the main idea the fact that I have to defend against your attacks of truth and facts when I'm the one who came up with it is just silly, dog, and the fact that you would fight me with your words or try to, you know, capture some of my glory for yourself why there's enough to go around for all of us and I'll let a little light shine on you.
TL;DR I started shooting laser beams from my spaceship in time - words started flipping out like nunchukas in reality you looked away in horror only to save yourself forever
 
The end
I believe OP was talking about the absurdity  which is why he called it a hog wallow.  He's saying all the pigs like to get around getting muddy, so therefore pig beef fat would be a lot worse of a concept to wrap your mind around kind of like bankers in general or the whole concept of what a bank is, so it could be a lot worse.  You see I try to put my mind in the head of the guy that was writing this diary from 1934 or whatever century this diary was from because then I can compare his experiences to my experiences hundreds of years later and see what's the same and see what's different and learn how another individual lives identically in a civilization of values.

Better than hog tallow

It does from the perspective of the observer.  There is no other way.

I'll buy 30000 Bitcoin who wants to send them over
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:19:24
So what happens to that value if Bitcoin drops to pennies?  suddenly the past is not as wealthy that kind of pisses me off no offense
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:50:15
what about a super-tiny bank
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:04:52
That was my bad, I started that shit, I'm sorry, such is the power of properly applied philosophical reasoning, worth it's weight in gold it is
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:26:29
It is specifically a currency, even strictly speaking.  Oh, also, if you consider investing in 'yourself' as the most valuable rationale, what value do you place on your time, and how do you maximize your investment strategies in 'yourself' in order to show profit and not a loss?  I think the OP is talking about tangible results and reality, not some feel good made up rules, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:02:22
Bitcoin has an intrinsic value those who think otherwise are foolish.

Hey guys I am trying to fuck this money like you said but I can't find the hole IN THE PLOT DOGS!
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:09:36
Why be accountable for your purchasing power, or transactional history, when Bitcoin does it all for you?  Buy Bitcoin.

I wish encryption and anonymity were synonymous, but they are not.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:12:00
I disagree.  Down voting you is beyond stupid, because entirely new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time, exactly as you said, that part is genuine.

Thank you sir I don't particularly like rules but I like being pointed in the right direction
@_date: 2019-10-25 00:44:28
Yeah wow she's totally right 100% let's make it that way
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:14:40
Oh but hear me out I understand the principle, the very backbone of the Bitcoin experience, the winnowed out rationale that makes poets weep and powers the currency, this record of transactions, as it is.
Why would anyone participate in it's politically motivated use-definition on what it ought to be?  It is philosophically sound, why box it in and miss the point?
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:14:51
What are these rules reasoned out from the rationale of nature?  Zodiac signs?  I can create 13 rules for what makes a great dog, I don't believe it would get me anywhere.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:16:14
Yeah.  It's totally accurate, you can bet on it.  Take it home to the bank, one hundred percent certainty that's how you feel being a Bitcoin hodler, no days since suicide.

1 coin to rule them all one coin to bind them watch Bitcoin and it's ledger of transactions become the de facto standard for an unwavering unable to be destabilized currency from which all other currencies can be used to exchange a universal currency gentleman operating in an endless myriad of markets
