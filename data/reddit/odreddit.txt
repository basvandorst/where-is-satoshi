I'm not an expert, but I don't think it is possible to create a system to avoid the generation of duplicate addresses.
Also, while *possible*, the odds of someone finding a public key that generates a duplicate address are **astronomically** low.
There are 2^160 different possible addresses. 2^160 is 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976. Lets say there were 10 billion people, and each person had 100 addresses, and there was someone able to calculate (and check the balance of) a billion keys per second. That's ( 10^9 * 10^12 ) / ( 1.46 * 10^48 ) keys found per second. Which means on average, a duplicate address could be found every 1.46 * 10^27 seconds. A year is 3.16 * 10^7 seconds. We could expect to find a duplicate address in 4.62 * 10^19 **years**.

You're on the right track, but miners aren't working on individual transactions to find a hash less than the difficulty. Transactions are hashed together to form the "Merkle Root" which is then hashed again to find a value less than the current difficulty. All the transactions included in the Merkle Root are the transactions for the block.

If the router supports UPnP, and the full client is mapping the port, then a full client is a seeder without having to manually forward the port. This is the default for bitcoind/Bitcoin-QT as far as I'm aware.

I did look into it, I did play the game, and I received 4 lots of 0.0001 BTC to my wallet. This did not correlate to how much in-game "BTC" I won from playing. Payments appeared random to me, were always 0.0001 (whether I had just earned 10 in-game "BTC" or 2000 in-game "BTC").
Also, as far as I can tell, you can not withdraw the in-game "BTC." If you can, please tell me how, I would love to know.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:35:44
No, the in-game "BTC" has no correlation with the BTC you receive from the game. You can not withdraw the in-game "BTC"
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:38:59
I like the idea, but the way the payouts happen is poorly implemented. Each time you receive Bitcoin from the game, a new transaction is created, and a **fee paid equal to what you receive**
They should create a transaction every 10 minutes with all payouts, paying a fee once, and not flooding the Bitcoin network with dust transactions.
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:35:31
You also cant withdraw below $5 threshold, so expect to wait 4 months until actually getting anything...
I also dislike in each of their examples they go on to say " If the bitcoin then increased in value over time by 5x, you would have made $X per month."

1MB is 1k rev-limiter, but we currently only average 400rpm. If we remove the limit altogether, there's possibility for someone to redline and blow up the engine, or spin-out on the track. Picking 8k for the limiter is just as arbitrary. IMO we need a way for the limiter to adjust depending on the current state of the track, handling, engine, structural integrity, etc.

The size of the hash depends on the type of hash, but it is always a standard length. SHA-256 is 256 bits.
It is a one-way function, so no, the source can not be reverse-engineered.

You can not "transfer back" unless you have control of the address you are transferring to. If, instead, you mean create a second transaction and send to another address you control, this is called [double-spending]( Bitcoin-Qt will likely not let you do this as a regular user, but if you are able to send two transactions onto the network, it would be up to the miners to decide which transaction to use. Will the miner be greedy and take the extra fee? Maybe. Will the miner discard the second transaction? That's also a possibility. If the first transaction is already confirmed, then the second transaction will fail and be discarded.
If you control both address A and address B, transfer 1BTC from A to B with 0.001BTC fee, then *transfer back* the remaining 0.999BTC from B to A with a 0.1BTC fee, you will now have 0.899BTC at address A.

A+, B and B+ all have the same processor, only 700MHz single core. Pi 2 is 900MHz quad core. But I think the RAM is the limiting factor, the A with 256MB, B and B+ with 512MB, but the Pi 2 has 1GB.
I think you can set up the B/B+ to run with a large swap file if you really wanted, but it's not ideal.

You can create any transaction with no fee, it's the wallets that enforce a fee. It may take a while for the transaction to be mined, but a fee is not **required** for dust transactions. However, like you said, it would probably be easiest for them to try and combine the smaller amounts with a larger amount. With ~40BTC at that address, I don't really see them having issues paying too much in transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:06:55
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:39:15
I think a fixed minimum fee in the protocol is a **very** bad idea. Hypothetically, the price goes up 100x in a month. Then you urgently have to get consensus to hard fork to change the fee again. That's just not feasible.

You are correct, for how it currently works, but he was talking about putting it into the protocol as a potential fix for the spam transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:40:30
He is trying to use the very basics of the idea. He is not trying to prove that his name is "James D'Angelo" or any other information tied to who he is, just that he exists (and is known and trusted by Target, in his example, or like an account number). A person does not need a name to be a person. It's just the very basics of the concept.

pb1x made it sound as though 2 hours **between blocks being found** happens, instead of roughly 10 minutes. What he *meant* to say, was that you might have to wait 2 hours until your transaction is **included** in a block. We're all saying the same thing, but he just wasn't 100% clear, so I was making sure a newbie didn't come along and get confused, not trying to argue with him (or her).

You said "simplest" in the title, so these are look nice and should be easy to set up  but aren't particularly cheap.
However, you also said "cheapest" in the text, so the Orange Pi someone else linked is super cheap, but you'll also have to buy power cord, WiFi dongle (or ethernet cable), and SD card specifically for it, and possibly a case. You would also require HDMI cable, keyboard, etc, etc to set it up initially.

What portion of bitcoin sales do you plan to keep as bitcoin, or is your intention to convert everything to AUD straight away?
The Stripe website seems to allow bitcoin payments...  but I'm guessing something with Squarespace is stopping you... I would suggest contacting Squarespace and asking about it, if you haven't already.
Similarly to another poster, and probably a few other people, I feel like this post could have been presented better. I did not bother reading the whole post at first... I went to your site, saw the "bitcoin accepted here" image, added something to the cart, went to the checkout, and there was no option to pay with bitcoin.
I have since read the whole post, and here are some of my thoughts:
* Someone else already mentioned that "partners with bitcoin" is probably not the best phrasing. You are not partnering with the dollar, or AMEX or MasterCard...
* It's not very clear that you have not yet implemented bitcoin purchases into your website. A big flashy "bitcoin accepted here" image with the text "not quite yet" below it... Change it to a regular bitcoin icon with text the same size as the icon, in line with it, saying that you are working on adding it to the store.
* "Come from the bitcoin community? Order now and we will throw in a free 28g!" along the top... So everyone gets that extra, not just the bitcoin community...? This would confuse visitors to your site, both regular ones and ones from the bitcoin community. "Yes, I'm from the bitcoin community, how to I specify that I am, and get that free 28g?" and "No I'm not, but I would like that extra 28g, how to I get that...?"
* Domestic shipping for my order of 50g is $11. No one wants to ever pay twice the cost of the product on shipping. (I did not finalise my purchase, sorry)
* Going to bitcointalk to try and organise buying some with bitcoin would just be annoying for me, I very rarely go there anymore, let alone log in and check messages, and potentially take a few days or more to organise making a purchase.

Your prices when viewing the store in BTC are far cheaper. When you go to checkout, it resets to USD and then converted to BTC, and the price is far higher than what was listed when browsing. I suspect the conversion rates are different in the checkout than the rest of the site.

I think you've come up with a great concept, and that overall, it has been good for bitcoin.
I much preferred having your own wallet that is donated to, but this makes it difficult for people new to bitcoin to get into it. Using a service is the logical choice, and is better for bitcoin, not only causing more adoption, but also not flooding the network with dust transactions and paying just as much in fees as the tips ([which I mentioned in another post about the release of the game](
**However**, I feel that Xapo is a very poor choice, solely because you are required to **completely** verify to withdraw your tips. I played to get one tip to try it out, got an email that I received a tip, was unable to log in to the Xapo site on my phone, so I opened it on my computer. When I clicked on the wallet to transfer bitcoins I had to verify my phone number. I verified my phone number, and again tried to withdraw, but then got asked to verify with much more information, which I decided was **far** too invasive for a few cents. [I replied to someone from Xapo in another thread about this, but as yet have not received a reply](
In my opinion, either Xapo has to allow users to withdraw bitcoin without doing complete verification if you aren't converting to/from fiat and/or with small amounts, or you should use another service. Until that time, I think that this is actually worse for more adoption of bitcoin than having just a bitcoin address.
FYI: You probably also didn't make a lot of money from advertising, because you made it so easy to disable the ads after playing for 10 minutes.

I don't particularly like the term "Wallet" that we are using, and I think there are suggestions to change it to something else, but I don't think Luke-Jr went about the change the right way. Sure, there are different types of paper backups, and why not have a page for each of them (there will probably be more created over time), but a complete change seems a bit overboard to me.
I personally think there should be a "Paper Backup" page, to which "Paper Wallet" redirects. This page would then describe the different types (linking to their individual pages, if they are created), as well as explaining the term "Wallet" (also potentially linking to its own page that goes into it in more detail).

People make mistakes, and I feel a little bad for you (but also a bit annoyed), but I don't understand why you sent the email in the first place. You did not send an email for any other updates. There wasn't any indication that the email would be used for anything other than Xapo.
Was there external pressure from Genesis Mining to send an email out?
I noticed and would like to point out to others that the Genesis Mining link is actually an "affiliate" link, so that Genesis Mining knows how many referrers Sarutobi provided. Not that that's unusual for email marketing, however...

I gave my dad a small amount on a paper wallet along with a link to blockchain.info where he can see the value of it. He seemed interested in it when I had explained it to him previously, but he would be very unlikely to use it unless Bitcoin really takes off. For him it is more of an investment for the future rather than functional use right now, and is not much of an investor, so I doubt he would buy any more.
At a friend's birthday dinner recently, I asked if he would also like some Bitcoin for his birthday, which he was happy to try out. I got him to download Breadwallet, and I transferred some Bitcoin to him in a matter of seconds. Several people's reactions were almost exactly "Wow! Is that it? It can't be that simple..." and then wanted to know more about how it works. However, even though everyone thought it was amazing, they won't be buying any until if/when they can use it in more places, which is similar to what other people feel that I have spoken to about it.
My advice would be to know your audience when explaining it and start simple if you are finding that people are too confused.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:43:03
Thanks for the link, it cleared up a couple of questions I had. I previously did not look into Lighthouse in much detail. 
In case you were interested, my suggestion of multiple transactions doesn't work too well in Lighthouse's current form, and would likely require a trusted third party to do it that way, which Lighthouse is trying to avoid. Either way, I'm sure it's something they thought about, and hopefully they can come up with a way to solve that problem in the future.
I hope you reach your goal and are able to continue working on Hive. I tried it out when it was released and it felt a lot more user-friendly than all the other desktop apps.

Can you give more information about why you believe Fernando is a crook and a liar?
I hadn't heard of Xapo prior to this. A quick reddit search had titles like changing the credit card thing's fee structure *after* people had ordered it, but before receiving it, as well as high fees for withdrawing bitcoin.
I had a bad feeling about Xapo when they wanted me to fully verify to pull out a couple of cents worth of bitcoin (which I did not do). It's many companies' wet dream to get that much customer information for those prices.
However, I'm not sure how accurate those posts were, seen anything about them using the data, nor read anything specifically mentioning Fernando.

Hi Fernando,
I can see the advantages of using Xapo with Sarutobi (for you, for the developer, and for some users), but I see much more of a disadvantage for the majority of users of the game.
I already dislike that I am required to verify my account for services where I have to purchase Bitcoin, but I understand why. However, I totally disagree with having to verify my account for access to a few cents worth of Bitcoin, which was not exchanged for money. Most exchanges allow basic usage without verification, you should too, at least for withdrawing Bitcoin sent from someone (e.g. from Sarutobi).
I don't know if it's still accurate, but I also saw a post about Xapo charging a ~60c fee for a ~$130 withdrawal. I have not verified to see how much you will charge me to withdraw my one Sarutobi tip, and I don't intend on verifying my account to find out (or go digging through the website).
It might also interest you to know that the Xapo website did not work correctly on my iPhone 6+ in Chrome. After creating the account, it was stuck in a loop at the login screen. You might want to look into that, as well as the fact it does not play nice with password managers (on my computer, 1Password asks me to unlock my vault four times when trying to login to the Xapo website, once for each digit of my PIN).
I don't think that any of this adds up to a pleasant experience for **any** Bitcoin user, **especially** first time users, and believe that this update to Sarutobi is actually **detrimental** to Bitcoin. Something definitely needed to be done to stop people abusing the game to get money, but it has come at a cost to honest users.

It is not an issue if someone else can produce the same hash, only if the document is stolen, hashed, and put on the blockchain before you are able to do so. The purpose is putting the hash into the blockchain when the document is created, from an address you control. You can then prove the document existed at a certain date, and that you had it. If someone then stole the document, they could hash it and prove that it's the same document, but they can't prove they had it before you.
