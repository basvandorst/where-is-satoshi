I switch between British and American English as well.  I blame growing up in the US and being infatuated with Roald Dahl.

that's a fake account.  The IRC sarahcoinbit disavowed it.
Edit: see tharlam's correction below.

Super funny. :)

Good luck!  Rooting for you.

It's free to enter, so no downside.

Change is made when you break an "unspent transation" into pieces.  There can be multiple unspent transactions associated to a single address.  You probably just spent one and didn't touch the others.
You can see these with the command "listunspent"

Does ploshay have a reddit or bitcointalk account?  
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:14:37
Yes love the easter eggs.

Maybe you shouldn't voice your opinion so loudly if you are too intellectually lazy to even read a Wikipedia entry on exactly the subject you are pontificating about.
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:39:39
Electronics and non-perishable foods.
I would want to see concrete examples of what kind of deals I would be offered.  I highly dislike email spam so I am regrettably not going to sign up yet, although it looks interesting.

They are notorious for a one year back log.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:26:53
More recent and detailed than the planet money episode, which is also good.  
@_date: 2013-09-27 06:02:18
Just curious.  You seem precocious.

He is being paid to give clients advice on how to invest their money.  This makes his cursory reading much more negligent.

I don't follow politics much, so your endorsement of her has a strong positive effect on my view.
If you have time, you should consider running next year as well.

Also, noticed a typo in the 'What kind of deals?' section:

Just got back from buying.  We were their first customers.

You are in the eighth grade?
@_date: 2013-06-17 18:04:32
Nice, really glad to hear that!  And yes, we were indeed 'racing' you to be the first :D.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:51:46
Thanks!  That was the first bitcointip I've ever recieved :D
Modal works great now as well.
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:26:53
I pretty much only use bitcoins for online purchases at this point.  
New egg is a great place, but just not worth the effort to use a credit card.  Would love to put them back on my 'shopping list.'

You are kind of dumb.
p.s.  I've actually read that book twice.  If you are serious, please continue.  If not you may consider why to some one does what you only joke about, your mind reminds them of a like of trash some one was too lazy to dispose of.

We were the first customers to pay with Bitcoins.
They are using Bitpay as a processor.  We purchased the green tea pictured to test (using a coinbase wallet) then went shopping for real.
Confirmation time was rapid, maybe 10 seconds.
Dan, in the pink shirt, is responsible for the integration and is planning to expand to other markets and restaurants he runs in Fort Greene, as well as bring it up at the next meeting of the local business association.

Just messaged them.  I will buy in person tomorrow if this is true.

'True' anarchists don't classify themselves according to statist political parties.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:00:27
So, suppose there were 100,000 people owning bitcoins. that would imply ~ 10,000 USD per capita... seems too high no?
Any good estimates for the # of people holding bitcoins?  
 I can't help but become unnerved by these back of the envelope calculations.

Icbit.se but the interface might still be a little to confusing for small business people with no experience with finance.
