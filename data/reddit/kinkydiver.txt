I may be missing something here, but the Vanguard Sp500 says it consists of Sp500 companies, and has the same industry diversification. That's pretty much how I define "backed". The only thing it doesn't say is it has ALL the companies at all times, I give you that.

Waittaminute.. If people try to withdraw illegitimate BTCs through an exchange, wouldn't they need an account there and therefore their identity be known?
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:50:57
Dunno.. I think for a breakthrough it would have to be a name with a reputation.
Once my Amex card was stolen. I checked online and found $1500 already spent. I called them up, and they credited me and sent me a new card. With that sort of thing, I'd happily use it on ebay.
We'll probably see some some big vendors (Amazon..) accept it first, and then THEM eating up any fraudulent charges.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:39:18
Probably didn't. I think FAs are more conservative with their investment advise. Can't really blame them, either!
For one, FAs deal with medium/large sums of money and clients, so going "rebel" would probably not be so much appreciated. Also, Bitcoin has a volatile reputation, akin to penny stocks, which I think they are not even allowed to promote.
Not sure about that last "allowed" part, but I have a brokerage account with my own firm, and it flat out refuses to deal with penny stocks, or even &lt; $1 stocks!

I must commend you for your civilized writing. I do think I see your point, it's just that I'm coming from a different angle. You believe that there is a market for every rate, and I happen to believe that lowball offers destroy markets and cheapen good work.
Perhaps I'm a little biased here, working in outsource- prone software development. Managers usually belittle our work, go with the lowest offer, then move on before the fallout of a thousand bugs and design flaws - most preventable by doing good work upfront - hit home. ^offtopic, ^I ^know

You're refering to what is called "online security" in the crypto world. Yes, if the authentication mechanism is behind a server or in hardware (like a hard drive encryption chip), short passwords can be very secure.
But this all goes out the window once you ship the decryption code. At this point, hackers will decompile it, and come up with their own cracking scheme, without having to go through the nope-wrong-lets-wait-a-minute mechanism.
Granted, this takes a significant amount of knowledge and criminal energy.. but it's totally feasible.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:29:27
Yeah that was my point, thanks for "getting" it :)
I'm bullish on BTC myself, but I'm no fool. There are so many things that can go wrong or askew. This is a high- risk investment just like biotech startups.
As for GPSs, I have six, and I haven't even tried! Multiple phones/ipad/ipods, car and hiking navi... however, I didn't pay $600 for each of them as people erroneously assumed back then.

But Unix *is* inherently more secure, barely targeted (no internet explorer for example), and people don't install questionable closed- source stuff on them (like cracked games or DVD rippers). Windows has its advantages, but security sure isn't one of them.
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:38:08


That depends on your definition of big picture. If you mean current market cap, sure.
But what about opportunity? Imagine one of the big banks becoming Bitcoin- friendly, so you could walk into a branch and get BTCs just like Pesos (may have to wait a day or two, again just like with fx). It sounds outlandish today, but who knows how things look in a year or two. Anticipating a new market can be a huge money- maker, eventually reflected in the stock price, bonus, etc.

For two reasons:
- If you want to stay in business for a long time, you better keep an eye on new trends. The earlier you spot something, the more you can leapfrog the competition. Remeber how everybody laughed about the iPhone?
- Not all banking business is ultra high money. Most have their hands in retail and/or emerging markets as well.

Garmin is just one example where I remember people shouting "to the moon". If you buy and hold it doesn't matter what it is. Back then the argument was "everyone will have a GPS", now it's "1 TT will flow through the network". Actually, the GPS thing came true, and yet... :)

These announcements are starting to have the opposite effect on me.
People make claims all the time (for some, it's a job), but when they're outlandish, I listen.. I've been there when Garmin was *the shit* in 2006: people said the stock would be in the thousands. Today? About 40. And when Woz said "Apple could reach 1000", that's when it sank to $300.

Uh.. hi. I'm unaware of any publicized Bitcoin research.
As a mid-level employee of one of those firms, I don't get informed about direction or research per se. I do get emails about who is replacing whom in the corporate ladder system, sure, but that's about it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:28:02
There is no official stance or research as far as I know. Most peers know about it, but don't speak for or against it much - it's more of a water cooler type of conversation.
I have a suspicion that Financial Advisors are more prone to laughing about it - those guys deal more with "mucho dineros", whereas we corporate types (global business, investment and IT) are taking it more seriously at this point. Again, that's my opinion only.

It's software that keeps track of all changes to project files. Most importantly, it prevents accidental overrides when multiple people work on the same system. It's also used to snapshot releases, for example it will know what exactly went into the "feb 20 release".
Most version control software is free, and trivial to use once the server is set up.

Have you not been around during the crashes when people cried how they lost all their savings, suicide hotlines being posted, etc? Some people obviously don't know this basic rule and therefore it bears repeating.
Remember, bitcoin has no barrier of entry. You don't need a trading account, or bank account even, you don't need to be an adult, and no one is going to warn you about the downsides (unlike with traditional investments where you have to sign you understand the risks).

Here's my problem with that attitude: first you belittle the task ("small feature", "quick job"), then you point out how designers are numerous ("a billion"), desperate ("building up portfolios"), and inexperienced ("in college"). Then for your math you disregard overhead such as no-benefits (for self employed), unemployed periods, and administration.
If you bring this sort of thing to a studio or experienced designer, it'll cost you, for a reason. I'm not a designer but I empathize with them, because I hate having my job belittled. Just yesterday I heard "hey yeah I need you to switch the app to a different authentication. Easy right, it's just a new class then it goes into the spring config". *rage*

OK, sure. The intro mentions "the underbanked" and emerging markets, and the very high fees involved in "alternative payment systems". Bitcoin and Ripple are named specifically.
Panelists are compliance officers/consultants/CEOs of small firms.
Note this is not "offical business" just yet, it's more of an info session. Our CEO could stop this sort of thing in its track easily. That said, I found it astounding how fast the seats were gone, so there is definitely huge interest.
@_date: 2014-12-06 14:33:03
I'm not disputing that, but I'm saying the risk is substantially lower on a dedicated Linux box (they're always dedicated because they're not as versatile) than on a Windows machine which is used for everything.
Of course, there's no 100% security and safety. Even paper wallets can be stolen or burn in a fire.

I like the suggestion that was made: to have the custodians regulated. It doesn't seem right that exchanges would be allowed to walk away with customer's BTCs just because they were too "dumb" to trust them to a third party.
BTCs and payments would still be unregulated, but online wallets and exchanges would be made safer.

No good: how would you use the API if you need hardware support? Some sort of dongle perhaps, but then will it have support for my OS? Etc..
Anyway, in this case, the problem seems to be that Coinbase allows side- apps to access the account. Perhaps *that* is an idea worth reconsidering (and tossing). 
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:57:31
I'm with you. If some random website wants feedback, third parties are fine with me. But Coinbase is basically a bank (and one without insurance, even though they're being nice). So, everything I do with them will have to be on their domain and use https.

But how long did it take you to find out which exchange and which transfer method? I just did the same as you, but it took me several days, mucking around with MtGox, opening/transferring money to Dwolla, checking out countless other websites. Not to mention, the BoA way charges a fee.
If I could have just bought them with a CC, I'd have been MUCH easier!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:50:33
You're a better googler than I am, then!  I was going for MtGox because of all the scare stories of exchanges that packed up, etc.
BTW I am opening a CapitalOne360 account as well; no fees to fund bitcoin! Although I read somewhere that it takes time for it to be operational. They probably send an application via snailmail :)
EDIT: the CapitalOne360 connection is mentioned on the bitfloor.com site as an option to fund your account. Capital One has no connection to Bitcoin, it's just a way to transfer money.

It would, and many times more so if pressurized! I've heard that steel tanks can burn down just because you "ding" them and some organic molecules inside start a fire thanks to the 3000 psi O2. Never seen it, but that's what they tell Nitrox (higher O2 air) divers.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:59:34
Oh no, you were clear... just agreeing with you that separating things with a membrane doesn't mean all of a sudden you can use that substance for cooling with nothing else.
You're right also there is a thing like oxygen poisoning. But you'd have to breathe the stuff under pressure (to the point you're getting so much O2 that your body cannot metabolize it and it goes into your blood and tissues). At surface pressure, it's ok, and actually the first aid for decompression sickness.
Anecdote: I once forgot to set my dive computer; it assumed 50% O2, then when I came up it locked itself up for 2 days because it thought I was dead anyway :)

Right now the option is missing, but before this event you could and pick "deposit" on bitfloor, and chose the Capital360 option.

I don't actually know how the wallet apps are, hence the "I think.. ".

@_date: 2013-12-14 14:05:21
Ok, well thanks for that. Says right there in the article that it doesn't work though, and that the only winner will be the casino.
A 'strategy' implies that you know something of the game that will make you win. That works for horses or the stock market, and even coin tosses (contrary to popular opinion, that's not 50/50^*). But here the data is random, so things like 'approaches' are moronic.

I know this as "nitrox membrane" from diving where it's used to create air with more oxygen. However, the gases are just separated, not magically supercooled :)


Actually, I don't think that's true. You can breathe 100% oxygen on the surface (but not deep under water).


I just stopped at "onboard Nitrogen compressor". That's so ridiculous for all the reasons you have listed. I actually appreciate that they put this right on the front page! No time wasted there.
