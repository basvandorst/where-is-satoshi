The FBI profited by arresting a crime ring kingpin. I don't particularly agree with it, but its better than what Ross did.

You really think its that preposterous that ISIS and other terror orgs peddle drugs to fund their activities? And would take advantage of burgeoning online black market rings? Also there are plenty of domestic terror orgs, white nationalist/ultra-right etc that probably are in the same game. 
Its not preposterous, lmao. If you think its an outlandish idea then you are a fool.

Unfortunately, facilitating drug buying js still quite illegal and profiting off it is more so. And yes there was also the whole hitman thing which could be suspect but I don't want to debate that because he was not prosecuted for it.
Bottom line - dude profited from people buying and selling coke and heroin and that is illegal. He did it in the US and was punished for breaking the law to an extreme extent. Who knew how many criminal enterprises, terrorist orgs, etc used Silk Road to sell their drugs to pay for their shit?
I think drugs should be decriminalized and properly regulated but black market is not the way to go.

Good point we should stop arresting murderers cause it won't stop other people from murdering again.

Not really, I was asking a question about the limits of what a website that can "contain anything" meant.
For what its worth, they answered my question affirmatively. They do believe people should be able to host child porn and view it in their own home.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:46:52
Look I wasn't pointing any fingers. I asked a question. They responded they thought people should be allowed to host child porn websites.
I agree, people should be given freedom. But when they are discovered to have been doing shit that is illegal - running drugs, selling illegal firearms, hosting and selling child porn, etc...they need to face the repercussions of their actions.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:33:35
He/she said, and I quote, "anyone can run any web-site that contains anything". 
I asked if this includes CP, because that is a legitimate problem on the dark web. They then responded an affirmative to my followup.
You are defending a child porn enabler/enthusiast.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:59:32
Hey I think drugs should be decriminalized and regulated properly, with some exceptions, and I'm not a fan of alcohol. 
But that wasn't the point I took contention with. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:42:41
Sorry for stating a fact? 
Also, I'm in favor of decriminalization and proper regulation. I'm probably not as uptight as you think. But that doesn't mean we should just ignore large scale drug operations, because they often fund other less than ideal operations 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:59:54
Selling drugs is a crime.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:34:42
You know what else is a nonviolent crime? Tax fraud. Money laundering. Theft. 
Should we stop placing people like that behind bars too?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:30:41
I'm not personally entitled to shit.
But if you live in a society you pay to help improve said society. If you evade the taxes you owe, you are a drain 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:52:33
Why? Why should an unregulated black market for drugs exist when we can have an above board market for drugs that everyone can benefit from?
Where we know who is selling to make sure they aren't funding other illegal operations? Where we can make sure that whatever someone is buying is not tainted or cut with fentanyl or some other shit? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:21:24
So you think people should be free to run child porn rings free from government intrusion?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:27:20
He literally responded yes to this question so.....
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:48:18


I asked if he/she thought this included child porn. They answered affirmatively.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:29:00
Yeah white nationalist terror orgs are on the same level as other terror orgs. GEE WHAT A FUCKING LIBERAL IDEA

If you sell drugs in the US you best pay your taxes or Papa IRS will getcha.

That's my plan with other cryptos. I'm going to sell either half or a quarter of my coins when they hit a certain threshold, then hodl the rest in the hopes they hit anywhere near where BTC is at now. 
Hell if some of them hit where ETH is at now I'll make a ~$60,000 profit.

The reason cryptos will never replace currency right here.
You sound like the financial version of someone who stockpiles firearms and canned food in his doomsday bunker.

Man it is so easy to bait you people.
For the record I am very much pro-crypto, but I realize its limitations and I also realize that the current banking system has its merits, flawed though it might be.
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:24:39
To be fair I'm sure its at least partially due to ZWD being no longer a "real" currency. It was replaced by ZWL a while ago so $100 Trillion notes are basically collectors currency.
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:19:11
Its pretty funny that a 100 trillion Zimbabwe note is worth like $.50 USD but sells for $50 on ebay
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:43:45
I'm looking at ebay and most are around 50

You were making a comparative situation, thus implying that the government asking someone to do something under duress was equivalent to a thug robbing him for his wallet.

Manipulating people is pretty much the same as manipulating currency.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:19:33
I'm aware you don't have to buy a whole BTC. Transactions can be purchased as low as a dollar or less. But think about how far the price has come even in the last 6 months. I think when they took down SR the prices were what, $150 USD to 1 BTC? Now they're up over $800. I'm just saying that it feels like I might not get as much of a return on bitcoins as I'd like for an investment, and was looking for advice to see if maybe that was correct.

@_date: 2013-11-26 00:09:11
Would you mind explaining why you're confident? I mean I can see that it likely will continue to go up in price, but at this point at buying for $800 per, it feels like I'm going to hit diminishing returns on investment compared to buying at $150 or so when I initially wanted to. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:43:47
$12 seems a bit much for one coffee, is it normally this much or is it because the USD value in bitcoins is shit? 
I suspect it is because my country's currency is garbage.
