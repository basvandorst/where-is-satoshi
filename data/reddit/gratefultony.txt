This is a very interesting concept. With a good atomic transfer, users have a very good privacy outlook, at the expense of MW taint-- which is _better_ than blockchain taint as we know it today... insofar as it closes on ALL MW-tainted coins (if I'm getting this right)
The question is: how do we (and our beloved rulemakers) interpret MW taint? as the best possible, or the worst possible interpretation: e.g. hitler himself transferred coins into MW... now all coins that come out of MW could be hitler's coins... do we blacklist all MW coins?
_or_ joe blow didn't want people to know about the gift he bought for his mom, so he used MW... his outputs have the exact same taint as hitler's.
Do we simply average the taint of outgoing MW coins to the integral of taint going to MW before t0?
fascinating...

properly implemented sidechains with working 2-way pegs should be perfectly convertible into and out of bitcoins. Sidechain miners will probably collect fees in sidechain tokens and later convert them to bitcoins, or just use them on the sidechain. A  sidechain transaction will almost definitely have less fees than an equivalent main-chain transaction, but my conventional rule of thumb is that they might have less hashpower securing the sidechain, so they aren't "buying" as much security with their fees. For most people, the insane main-chain security isn't necessary, so they would want to hang out on the sidechain most of the time to keep fees at the level which provides the optimal balance of security and cost-effectiveness for smaller transfers.

perhaps it limits some use cases, but I am a firm believer that it should be impossible to fork the blockchain for feature requests because it opens the door to human factors and weakness in the protocol. I obviously don't care if what the transaction rate is: though I'm optimistic that people will find ways to use the protocol to secure high-volume payment systems without a fork.
We already have a monetary system which can be altered by democracy and debate: it's called fiat currency.
I am interested in bitcoin because the policy is immutable, and governed by mathematics, not committee and lobbying.
Perhaps it's a shame that the blocksize is essentially a consensus-level parameter, but it's a fact I'm willing to live with. Perhaps you disagree with programmed scarcity in the transaction rate, but to me, because of the way the protocol exists today, I consider the gravity of changing it to be identical to the gravity of changing the 21M coin limit (Infinite gravity). Bitcoin is an experiment in programmed artificial scarcity, and a change to a consensus-level parameter to me equals breaking Bitcoin: or more subtly: a demonstration of the inefficacy of the designed/emergent mining economics. 
I'm saying we shouldn't have to refuse to fork at any or all costs, I'm saying: I hope it's economically impossible.
In my view, the scaling conferences were support groups for users of a system they are incapable of changing, and I could really care less about the hard fork wish-list you, Toomim, the core devs or Big Bird come up with.
If they get adopted by miners, to me, in that contingency: Bitcoin has failed.
Bitcoin does not fail if it never achieves some human-desired number of transactions. I don't care at all about new users or adoption: an unpopular belief, I know: this shouldn't be a ponzi/pyramid scheme to make us rich: it's an experiment in cryptography and trustless systems. If Bitcoin changes to appease a bunch of scared lemmings, it's failed.

I have been fond of sidechain-scaling approaches: to me, they lend themselves more naturally to hierarchy such as is needed for exponential scale...
We have only begun to explore the possibilities available to us using the blockchain: in the future, there will be many Layer 2 scaling solutions competing for adoption. 
This being said, LN is also a great innovation and will probably get to some state of utility before sidechains get much attention by the looks of it.

I'm sure these questions will all be asked again in the proper AMA, so maybe it's a bit off forum to get into it here--
I'm fully aware of the identity token schemes-- IBM Identity Mix perhaps being a canonical example, and all shades between that and one's own SSN being hypothetically within scope as a permission-granting token-- but the question is not whether the degree of privacy or compromise thereof granted by the permissioning scheme is acceptable, but rather whether a similar regime could be implemented on top of Bitcoin and coupled with state-sponsored legislation of the variety claiming that businesses or individuals participating in unpermissioned, "unlawful" blockchain transactions are to be sanctioned: creating a perfect balance of blockchain utility and attrition of freedom so as to cause unpermissioned, "unlawful" Bitcoin transactions-- or miners who mine them to be persecuted, but the endurance of the underlying system's survival and incumbency. 
In a particular Bitcoin Doomsday, a regime such as I have described, driven by the technology in question, enabled by financially-compromised miners creates a pseudo-permissionless ledger atop a permissionless ledger, below the level of which transactions are forbidden for well-standing individuals and businesses, yet which retains enough legitimate commerce to retain a lion's share of global hashrate.

Can we unpack this a bit more?
This is the killer use-case which I think many overlook, and admittedly, I myself have less than complete clarity on:
Is there a document, research or whitepaper on this?
In the case than Paul Lee B. has no bitcoins, but has an exchange account, or an employer willing to pay on LN-- does Paul need to open an channel anywhere? or can the exchange/employer simply open a channel with him to begin his LN connectivity?
edit, three days later for posterity:
having thought about this more: YES! this _is_ possible... Yet not ideal... If the employer or exchange has channels open with other merchants, Paul Lee B. Can definitely send some of the coins back to the exchange over the channel, which can then be routed onward through the exchange or employer. This allows Paul to have complete control over his coins, and still be able to spend them. It is probably the case, however, that Paul would want to open some more channels with other parties to get some diversity in his connectivity.

As it stands, we can do about 300k transactions per day with no innovation at all. We will get innovation if there is demand. Although I disagree with changing Bitcoin to fit our post-hoc expectations, I do firmly believe that the protocol, as is, is such a useful mathematical construct that we will discover profoundly innovative ways of using it once we accept that it is static. 
I tend to think of the protocol and the network as almost a force of nature at this point: we are still _discovering_ how to best use it. We may still be having cryptographic breakthroughs decades from now which help us use the protocol and blockchain in ways not yet imagined: all without forking for feature requests.
Again, forking for feature requests to me is an anti-feature which nullifies a lot of the fundamental economics and mathematical assumptions/properties of the system: which in my perhaps extreme viewpoint, are profoundly useful as-is.

It's my understanding that a system like chain anchor would incentivize users to compromise the pseudonymity "voluntarily" in exchange for having their transaction included in a block sooner (if at all). That is, compromised miners only mine transactions which self-compromise identity. Chain anchor obviously can't reverse prior observances of blockchain-privacy best-practices, but can drive future privacy fails.

Easiest way to bootstrap is to use a flagday: start requiring the other nonce for the previous block at some flagday and start the auxilary difficulty at zero. Remine the previous block with zero difficulty and include the nonce: 0. You would base the aux difficulty on something besides Eventually, (as is the whole point) it will be better to cache "pretty good" nonces from the previous block for re-use. The "loyalty reward" Edit: I'm more convinced a static aux. difficulty might be in order-- miners would want to start caching silver nonces the block before flagday.


Interesting question and great food for thought: Why would it be problematic for previous block difficulty to be larger than current block difficulty? The extra nonces laying around from failed attempts at finding the previous block will generate previous block hashes uniformly distributed and above the current, and generated at the previous difficulty so block n+1 will always lag, and the hashes will almost always be there, leftover from before. 
The system could be configured so miners would virtually never have to go back and re-hash the previous block: somebody would have a valid nonce for it under the aux difficulty algorithm, especially if some simple rule like previous_nonce_commitment_difficulty = difficulty_previous_block * (k&lt;1) were implemented. (or a difficulty algorithm that caps below prev_block_diff * k) This would ensure that there are probably multiple nonces generated in the previous mining epoch which would satisfy the criterion with configurable probability... We want those "silver nonces" to be valuable, however, so we'd likely choose k slightly below 1

Think about it this way-- segwit adoption is a process. If you block a single aspect of the process, you block the entire train. Nobody was going to invest their previous time in developing ahead of the process which looked like it was pretty much going to stopped in it's tracks by the obstructionist miners with a clear conflict of interest. (and let me spell this out for you: this conflict of interest is ASICBOOST) 
Developers were busy, instead, with preparing for war with these jokers who thought they could push the users/node operators around with hashpower. We won another very important victory while you weren't looking: UASF Users, node operators and holders control the network. NOT MINERS. Miners are paid to do a simple job, and UASF proved it. It's not like the development community was just sitting on it's hands that whole time... 


Maybe this is a good time to remind you that Bitcoin is an experiment. The reference client itself is beta software: Bitcoin isn't even 1.0 release yet. 
Segwit is usable in the core client using the backend, and if companies want to support Bitcoin, want to serve their users, they are perfectly capable of using that API to expose segwit functionality. It has been done by numerous companies already-- it's not like it takes some software miracle. Even Shapeshift figured it out.


This is where you lose all credibility. Comparing ASICBOOST to permissionless sidechain development requires profound misunderstanding of pretty much everything Bitcoin is all about.
I don't need to defend sidechains: they are undoubtedly a breakthrough innovation which will take Bitcoin Maximalism well into the 21st century. Indeed, if we can't agree on this point, I'm not sure why I would waste any more of my time discussing with you.
**Defending miners' Blocking Segwit to protect asicboost as being on-par with developing sidechains? what are you smoking?**


No. It's hard, and anybody who knows shit about software knows it's hard. This underscores the beauty of the segwit implementation: you don't get kicked off the chain if you don't update your software-- you just don't get to use _one particular feature_. Yeah, we wish people would choose: Use Segwit, or don't whine about fees... but at least they're not getting kicked off the network.
Your last paragraph is fluff. Of course companies should be careful with their customers' funds... But upgrading to use segwit, as has been done by numerous companies already isn't some technological miracle-- it's a basic competence of a Bitcoin company.

In Bitcoin, nodes don't trust miners to give them a valid blockchain regardless of POW invested. Nodes check the blockchain themselves.
The concept of POW without a backing protocol is absurd, since the policy of the POW conditions are set forth by the protocol.
SPV wallets are touted as big blockers' solution to ability for self-validation of transactions. Which is the entire point of Bitcoin.
However, SPV wallets of various types typically outsource this validation in favor of simpler heuristics which don't require downloading of entire blockchain. (necessary for big blockchain verification tractibility)
However this trust delegation model opposes the fundamental principle of self-validation. If only there was a way to restore true trustlessness and ensure the validity of a blockchain.
Never let anyone tell you you shouldn't be able to validate your own transactions, which today, requires downloading the entire blockchain.  SPV Proofs may ease the burden.

@_date: 2018-01-09 16:30:34
Segwit has been supported by the core wallet backend since its release. so claiming there is no support is pretty weak. Yeah-- it's not in the front end yet. Whatever... most people "begging" for blocksize increases don't run Bitcoin software anyway, and the third party services they trust are probably going to use the core wallet headless anyway.


Rollout is _just starting to occur because of obstructionist miners with a clear conflict of interest_. Segwit would be years ahead if the adoption which is just beginning now started as soon as the soft fork could have been activated.
Sure, it's going to take a few months to get uptake for software that looked like it was going to get blocked forever... Compare these few months to the years it took to get miners on board and it becomes obvious why it took so long to scale Bitcoin.
And acting like a blocksize increase is somehow not also opt in is also pretty weak by the way... for people actually running nodes... For everyone else, they are dependent on the services they run who should understand that running experimental financial software might require updating your damn apps every once in a while.
Yeah, I applaud the services who have done so for doing their job. Those who don't do their job ought to go out of business. just my opinion.

I assure you, I get it. It resembles a bank... sure. to some extent... a bank you can run yourself. _be your own bank_. Second layer _is the only way_ to get exponential scale. Core _is_ working on on-chain scaling via at least two different approaches I can think of off the top of my head-- and LN and segwit to some extent might exponentially reduce demand for on-chain transactions when they gain adoption. On chain fees would be significantly less than they are today with LN penetration due to freeing the blockchain of coffee purchases.

1) LN can have a far more complex network structure than you are envisioning. Yes, it's possible for there to exist larger hubs and smaller nodes, and everything in between-- but there will be no force compelling users to route via the centralized corporation hubs, rather than the TOR-connected darknet hubs, for instance-- though it may be reasonable to guess that larger, more-well-connected hubs might have lower fees. The marginal cost of setting up and running a LN routing node/hub is far smaller than setting up a  mining operation, so it will likely be more decentralized than mining is now.
2) If people use LN for more than two off-chain transactions (thousands or millions are theoretically possible) then the cumulative fee reduction per transaction will still be very significant. At the same time, the user has taken those thousands of transactions out of the blocks they would normally have been stored in... further freeing space and reducing fees on chain.
3) You absolutely don't need to trust LN hubs or routers-- the reasons for this are complex, but you will understand as you become more comfortable with how LN works. Essentially, if a router or hub "misbehaves" due to HTLCs and CSV and the ingenious design of LN, we have recourse against it: which makes it pointless to try to cheat the system. The cheaters get punished, and do not profit from their attempted misdeeds.
4) You can't have your cake and eat it too: are you afraid that LN will take over _all_ transactions, leaving blocks empty and POW useless? Or do you think that LN won't do enough to free space in blocks and won't be effective in lowering fees? Either way, new block rewards will always need to get moved around-- and people will need to do some amount of opening and closing channels. 
I will add that there is one possible failure mode of LN which happens in the limiting case that miners are completely centralized, and will censor channel closing transactions for months on end: long enough to get the HTLC contingency contracts to sunset-- but I don't think this is likely-- and if it is: we have far bigger problems as it means the chain itself is insecure... LN can't work if the chain below it has a 51% condition with malevolent miners.
I think the most likely case is this:
Using only LN and Segwit (not MAST and Schnorr-- which will probably be ready before the case I'm about to describe will be fully-realized) I think we will see: 
1) Most "small transactions" being moved to LN.
2) An increase in on-chain transaction volume by a factor of 2
3) A possible _increase_ on-chain tx fees _but_...
4) A 1k-5kx increase in effective tx volume via LN
Note that effective per-tx fees are far lower than today-- we get higher value/utility per on-chain transaction, so they pay higher fees.
I think this should support enough user on-boarding to drive us to 1-5M USD/BTC. I calculated this somewhere in the past, but I don't want to dredge it up right now... It's in my post history.

0) Recall that channels can be connected together into a network. you can transact with people you don't have a direct channel with: indirect via some number of hops is OK.
1) The LN is designed so either party can tear down the channel at any time.
2) Opening and closing channels is an on-chain transaction, and follows normal on-chain processing times, while the in-channel transactions are instant.

It's definitely not the case that the developer could have crashed bitcoin. The nature of the defect would have required a miner to modify the client, produce a block which would still be rejected by many clients, cause a chain split and essentially burn an entire block reward for lullz because everyone would upgrade their clients immediately after the exploit and orphan any blocks mined on top of the bag block.

The protocol does change in certain ways, and it may be difficult for you to understand, but in terms of determining "What is the Bitcoin protocol", I would start by requiring that that which is the Bitcoin protocol is compatible with the Bitcoin network.
And FWIW, if "the protocol" is defined more by the hopes and dreams of the Luddites that use it than by math and science, the project is pointless. We already have plenty of mob rule in the world.

You basically have to do an extblock or spoonnet, but no I am not claiming it is impossible, just _reeealy hard_ like it should be.


The outdated node is only concerned with it's own transactions. Although it is possible to create soft-forks which will make it possible for the node to receive transactions it understands-- this generally hasn't been the pattern, and it would be hard to gain consensus to outlaw conventional transaction types.
For sending some outlawed transaction, like stealing the so-called anyone can spend outputs from a segwit output... the node might get confused when no miner ever includes the transaction... But again, we generally don't outlaw normal transactions that the node would try to make if it had never heard of the SF. This would be difficult to gain consensus for... Still, the node validates the protocol and accepts all blocks since they are valid.

Soft forks are compatible changes in the protocol. It's an important difference which makes it possible to reach consensus. Any change (save changes to the consensus layer) can be made using soft forks if there is consensus. See: spoonnet.
That's the difference. BCH made an incompatible change without consensus and it is obvious at various layers of the hack.

Has anyone considered an adversarial system in which some sort of "second-tier" p2p network can coordinate DOS or other sorts of attacks on large pools?
Indeed, the POW scheme itself is supposed to be adversarial, but since it is a single system, its strengths and weaknesses are exaggerated and lead to feedback loops... 
One might ask: why seek to design a system seeking to be useful for attacking Bitcoin? My response is that it will inevitably be carried out either by whitehat Bitcoiners or blackhat state agents... If we work on this now, we might be able to a) temporarily mitigate the pooled mining dissaster and b) discover network shortcomings and discover the flaws (and mitigations) before the blackhats do.
My first idea would be to build a simple ddos tool which launches against the ports of the ip which has mined the most blocks in the past configurable time span. Creating an interesting incentive to be the _second_ largest pool... creating a race to the bottom instead of the top... 
This tool could be packaged in a distro with full-node Bitcoin clients-- which could be run by people who are willing to exert a modicum financial expenditure (running the network-protector node) to secure their interests in Bitcoin, but not necessarily mining.
I think if there was a tool like this which could exert predictable operational stress on the largest pool, people would be more willing to participate than just running a full node-- with one small piece of software infrastructure, non-miner network participants can kill two (or more) birds with one stone... make the entire network less corruptible (by running a node) and fight miner centralization by changing the mining meta-economics.

I don't know very much about it... I'm not a miner myself, but here's its wiki page: 
The deal with mining pools is that you get a share of mining profit for your hash contributions... so the bitcoins come trickling in slowly and steadily instead of in huge lump sums (which may never come) for solo mining.
I think there is a program out there which enables it, but like I said... it's pretty new, and some miners already may be set in their ways.

We are keeping Bitcoin simple. Sidechains like the RSK pilot don't change Bitcoin at all, and initially don;t even require a soft fork.
The Drivechain approach for decentralized, non-federated sidechains only requires the creation of a transaction type where an output can be spent by POS or Hashrate signaling. Quite simple really.
This is exactly what sidechains are for. Keeping Bitcoin Simple, while allowing the token to be used for other applications.

I actually disagree with this premise: That Bitcoin's future will be decided by its degree of general adoption...
People are observing that right now, it appears that wider consumer adoption for B is driving a snowball of value being deposited in and remaining there in some residual. This is true, and in order to bootstrap B's value, pretty useful-- but I feel the most important thing we are doing by using b in everyday "consumer" transactions is vetting the technological features and security of the system. Crash test dummies, as it were, for this radical system-- we are literally beta-testers, Bitcoin is pre-1.0 currently.
In the long run, if the technology, security and meta-economics of mining all hold up to the best attempts to be broken by us-- the test dummies, then I contend that _consumer adoption is completely irrelevant_. 
If all of the underlying assumptions of Bitcoin are true-- there is literally no force that can hold it back-- if the assumptions are correct, it is in some sense, "better gold"-- and eventually, we may find that the only agents that possess it in any meaningful quantity will be state actors and large financial interests. Sort of like gold today. 
While bitcoin _does_ work great as a consumer token (I love making bitcoin transactions to buy crap because I don't need to give all my personal data to a third party just to get stolen because they cut corners on hiring netsec staff   governments might not be so happy to let their people hold this substance and undermine their internal incumbent currency-dynamics. Some states have already tried to make it far more difficult for individuals to hoard gold... and I think this is a clear behavioral precedent regarding what to expect from these organizations in the future. (I'd rather not get into the deeper philosophy of whether this is right or wrong-- lets just assume that the historical pattern which has been in place since... about... the dawn of time? holds true: States control the economic realities of their citizens.)
What, then, does bitcoin have to offer for state actors and huge financial interests that gold doesn't already provide? I offer that simply the existence of things like m of n security, relative ease of secure storage compared to a pile of gold, inability to pull a Nixon w.r.t to their debts to other states, some types of monetary scripting, etc offer significant value above what  "old gold" offers. (though I don't really predict complete replacement of old gold since Bitcoin loses a lot of its utility in case of a network catastrophe.-- yellow bricks will always be held as a hedge against the most dramatic types of infrastructure collapse.)

Any smart person in the cryptosphere should know that they need to be sure they are in the coin with highest utility if they want certain growth. Luckily, there is high liquidity between cryptos-- much greater than for fiat to crypto.


This is true, I admit there is a difference between technological superiority and utility.

...so I have a somewhat different/heretical conception of the term Bitcoin which i will explain here:
I contend that what we are all thinking about when we say the word "Bitcoin" is actually, "the highest utility system for performing secure, trustless digital accounting." Since the Satoshi blockchain is really the only dominant system most people who think about these sorts of things have seen, there is a bit of confusion of terminology- I claim. People are saying Bitcoin for "high utility trustless digital means of accounting" the same way they say "Kleenex" when they mean tissue.
The trick becomes understanding this utility, and there are a number of reasons Bitcoin as we know it has the highest utility today: In my opinion, the most important one is this: Bitcoin has less baggage blurring its ability to be used as a mathematically-sound unit of account (primarily related to its resistance to state/ outside interference). It might make more or less sense for states to use bitcoin as a currency, but as a mathematically-sound accounting system, it is quite well-defined. If a system ever improves on this ability, then IT SHOULD become the "true Bitcoin".
In my opinion, the other primary feature of the Satoshi Blockchain-based crypto is its network effect, which plays directly to its security, which is critical for utility. We all are familiar with how the combined power of miners secures the network, so I dont think I should have to expand much here-- but if another system comes along with better security, this would improve utility, and if that utility is higher than Bitcoin, then that system Should become the true "Bitcoin" (again, I realize I am ignoring the fact that the term Bitcoin literally refers to the Satoshi blockchain-- I am using the term like most people use it, like "Kleenex")
If a bank manages to produce a crypto with higher utility, it should become dominant. If it has icky bank crap built into it, it can only have less utility as a simple, secure accounting database, and can't overthrow Bitcoin. If it has _some_ utility, perhaps to a different goal, then maybe they can coexist. If they have the same function, the one with greater utility will always win.
So can a bank fork Bitcoin just to spite the existing economy? I don't think so-- not without presenting a system with a technical advantage. If they attempt to really screw over the existing cryptosphere by creating a closed-market (cant buy it with bitcoins) coin with technical advantages over bitcoin, they have failed to create a universal means of value-accounting by artificially imposing barriers on the flow of value in their system-- a value-accounting system without such barriers would seem to have higher utility, so the banks would have just created yet another shitty alt.

So, I can't have prices posted in BTC only? USD or nothing? 
The subway token example makes a bit of sense... But it would seem then, that Something that cost 10k BTC a long time ago would cost only a few now (think pizza) there is an effective exchange rate built in to the BTC price... Or: We need to post USD cost alongside BTC cost... where there would be an explicit exchange rate...
Why can't I have servers for sale, 1 BTC take them or leave them... oh, you want to pay with dollars (grumble, I don't want to get sued) that will be (how many dollars?)
This seems like enough to make me not want to open my BTC server business... or move to Stickittothemanistan...

My reply:
The idea of using the blockchain to fight the tragedy of the commons is what I have considered Bitcoin's 'Killer App', and I am glad to see some proposals for concrete systems being published!
This being said, I think there are issues with, primarily the pre-mined-coin-per-person distribution scheme this system relies on... While appealing because of its egalitarian resonance, the task of assigning one coin per person is surely non-trivial as you rightly note. Moreover, as others have commented, the task of enforcement will also be a significant challenge...
I feel a correct system will integrate these aspects into the core of the protocol and transform them from challenges to strengths-- much like bitcoin has hypothetically incorporated the meta-economics of mining into the very fabric of its functionality-- Bitcoin does not rely on governments and corrupt cartels to enforce the fairness of the blockchain: the blockchain is, in its essence, the fairness mechanism rather than an administrative tool.
I would also suggest that you do not lose sight of the bigger picture: this is a tool to fight the tragedy of the commons at large, and not specifically for the address of climate change-- You clearly understand this, but I claim that in order for a project like this to be successful, you will need to address the full scope of the challenge to build a system with enough intrinsic internal cohesion to actually affect the change it aspires to.
'Whitelist address' is a dirty word in Bitcoin for good reason: the concepts of reducing the fungability of bitcoin and allowing the persecution of individual addresses are clearly contrary to Bitcoin's goal of being an efficient, unmanipulable, and fair means of establishing a distributed ledger with sound mathematical properties-- however, I feel using a sort of reputation system to deal with selfish players may be possible and effective for your uses.
If CO2 emissions are to be addressed, one simply needs to create a reputation channel for CO2 emissions, establish an opt-in audit service, and allow people to have means of proving they have passed an audit (or posted results or whatever...) If consumers (people who are ultimately deciding where the bitcoins go via their spending decisions) decide they will only do business with those who opt-in to the CO2 cap, they should have an automated means of determining whether their potential spend address is whitelisted on the CO2 cap channel, or is known to do business with any dirty players. Obviously, this could be done directly for bitcoin transactions and ethereum-like scripting to perform taint analysis. The bitcoins can be tracked as they pass through known 'gateway' addresses which may correspond to whitelist rows. Customers themselves, should they chose to opt-in to gateway addresses, will subsequently inherit the social onus of their downstream transactions.
This system relies on solely social forces and does not require premined-coin distribution (which is known to be problematic) or any sort of government enforcement of the will of the goodchain. Since bitcoins will be the primary transfer mechanism of value, and purveyor of the ability to allocate value to produce ends in the world-- If a system is to be expected to enact an end, it may as well be connected directly to the blockchain.

I'm not arguing the principle of the matter-- But I think it's an inconvenient political truth that we are going to get hamhanded regulation regardless of our wishes and regardless of what is best for bitcoin and its users.
As much as I hate to say it-- it would be best to have a place at the table of regulatory scoping, maybe get some scaffold rules on the books that will guide further development of the regulatory climate in directions more favorable to bitcoin. Otherwise someone else will do it for us in ways which are not scaffolds for good future policies.
It's not a moral justification for new laws-- and I agree that unregulated Bitcoin is closer to optimal Bitcoin... Especially if this protocol is going to continue to foster the sort of revolutionary entrepreneurialism and research/design ingenuity that it has enjoyed thus far... But if we try to take the moral high-ground here, we might end up with the practical low-ground.
I think the best-case scenario (which I don't see being pursued nearly as much as it perhaps should be) is scoping for regulation which contains provisions explicitly recognizing Bitcoin as being exempt from certain classes of regulation, perhaps conceding the applicability of other classes which recognize that bitcoin is an intellectual construct instead of legal tender or even asset class (IMHO).
Getting precedent in the courts is  and will lead to greater confidence and adoption once established. (Although, it looks like some of the precedent currently being set is a tad discouraging)

Lets put this another way-- if they managed to come up with a good way (good as in mathematically sound, not good as in the "goodwill" of politicians) to distribute the votes, OP has found something far, far more important that a cap and trade scheme-- OP would have found the HOLY GRAIL of the crypto-revolution (and human civilization in general): a fair, decentralized voting platform.
Cryptocurrencies attempt to get around this (as it is probably nearly impossible to even _define_ a fair distribution system, much-less implement one) by coming up with mining schemes to provision for some degree of fairness in the initial distribution of their currency units-- Cryptos with bad distribution schemes do not succeed because everybody knows that MaDChEMis-bucks were all held initially by MaDChEMis-buddies and those "in-cahoots".

I'm sure you are on the record elsewhere with your proposals, but in short, how do you see financial-type regulation being used to protect users with poor security practices? Allowing them to press civil charges commensurable with stolen BTC value against individuals caught "hacking"? I'm not a legal professional, but that appears to carry an implicit recognition of the monetary valuation of BTC by the legal system-- which would be a key piece of precedent needed to press for regs similar to a FX or other conventional asset class... Which is what I think we both agree is what we _don't_ want.
It would seem that non-financial-type regulations regarding network security certification (for instance) might be the best way to go about this?
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:33:30
I think one sobering realization the network has recently had is that it is far more difficult to estimate an upper bound of consolidated hashing power than a lower bound... Yet the upper bound is what really matters for the security of the network.
Pools currently have many means available to attribute their blocks to addresses/ ips/ tags etc. other than the ones publicly associated with them. This is why people are always talking about the "unknown" portion of the hashrate... The only way to be sure the network is secure is to prove that more than 51% (75% in a perfect world) is safe and accounted for in a relatively secure p2p pool... or preferably several. ...noticing that there is no obvious "bad actor" above 51% is insufficient.

There are two reasons to mine-- 
Reason  is to make money
Reason  is to participate in this interesting experiment, and help by securing the network.
Reason  is the reason mining exists, reason  is how Satoshi decided to motivate people to mine.
So mining is conducted mostly to secure the network, but you get a reward... but when you buy hashing power from an entity like CEX, you are paying a centralized entity to purchase some hashing power. (yes, they give you a cut of the profits).
The problem is that paying a central entity to buy hashing power does not secure the network... Is consolidates mining hardware to the control of a few and subverts the security and reduces the value of bitcoin.
If you are a reason  miner, you would probably be hurting bitcoin value long-term by subverting its security-- you could lose money. (If everyone did this, you would lose it all-- no one would use a centralized bitcoin)-- If all you want to do is make money, you are probably better off just buying and holding since that doesn't actively hurt the network or bitcoin value (actually, it increases bitcoin value and stability when people use it as a store of value)
if you are a Reason  person, you probably already know why hosted mining is a bad plan for bitcoin.

the 2, 4, 8Mb blocks are "just the tip".
It's not a strawman-- in BU, large blocks are the entire point. The debate in the community has literally zero impact on what miners actually do. An incremental capacity increase from segwit is a nice to have for now. (_would be_ a nice to have...) but the exponential scaling from lightning is a "need to have" later... The very real possibility of gigablocks under BU is a "should never be allowed to be even a remote possibility".

As far as I'm concerned, the next step to LN is SW. If we care about scaling and growth- this is issue number zero, and I find it positively mind-boggling that some people are misled to prioritize linear, blocksize-based scaling to SW/LN. The risk is disproportionately high to any derived benefit, whereas we have THE solution within grasp.
In the 5 year+ timeline, barring more cryptographic discoveries, I might estimate that users will begin to interact with LN only-- and coinjoin-like transactions could be used to coordinate channel maintenance more efficiently-- Really, that's quite a long time from now in the timescales of Bitcoin.

I estimate Bitcoin currently has between 50k and 100k economically relevant users (there's a blog post about this somewhere-- I can't recall where)... I assume it will only be necessary to do channel maintenance once a year for most users-- but lets multiply that by ten to be safe. That's 500k - 1M channel maintenance transactions per year. Bitcoin at 6tps does north of 100M transactions per year, so at my rather pessimistic estimates, we will be able to accommodate 100x more users if on-chain transactions are dominated by channel maintenance. Off-chain volume would be stratospheric. That's at today's on-chain scale-- we can probably conservatively double that with SW-- and more factors for other proposed SF scaling methods-- I assume in the future, new cryptographic methods will further increase on-chain scaling without HF. That gets us to 5 years easily.
corollary: if bitcoin usage goes (and value, presumably-- not accounting for metcalfe's law) up 100-200x to fill channel-maintenance transaction capacity, I will be fairly satisfied with progress.

@_date: 2016-03-22 03:50:09
It seems it's in the interest of miners to edge out other miners. To reduce competition for block rewards. Increasing the blocksize is one way: The effect of a large blocksize is essentially that when it takes longer to download a block, the miner has less time to try hashes, and has a smaller effective hashrate. If it takes longer than 10 minutes for a miner to download the previous block, they might as well sell their gear, since they'll never get a chance to mine on the chain. Any time penalty less than ten minutes reduces the miners' effective hashrate proportional to how long it takes to download. This can be combated in ways to the contrasting problem of orphan blocks.
Miners with better connections want to increase the blocksize to increase their effective hashrate. They can fill blocks with synthetic transactions to drive up dynamic blocksize algorithms to game the system. It's a bad idea. It leads to centralization.

users are extrinsic to Bitcoin. If there were no transactions, the protocol would be pointless, but user count doesn't mean much to Bitcoin (it could mean something to would-be users). I think Bitcoin has a minimum user count for utility of three. Any less, and you would always have a 51% miner, but those three could arbitrate value transfers between themselves.

It's semantics at some point I suppose. The fork has an air of legitimacy about it because shared-history (altcoins/forks/whatever) could be thinly-veiled doublespend schemes. Spend your forkcoins and keep your bitcoins at the same time ya know?
In my mind- a fork is change in protocol when the old protocol ceases to exist... So the doublespend isn't an option. 
If the coins were somehow fungible, this sort of doublespend wouldn't be a problem.

I agree everyone is suspect, Bitcoin is built on the principle of non-trust. Out of principle, I assume Miners, all members of Classic, Core, Coinbase, Blockstream, Gavin, Mike, Brian, and Satoshi himself are all malicious actors.
The protocol is designed to allow our cooperation in spite of the state of non-trust.
In the world where Bitcoin will never fork unnecessarily, this state of mutual mistrust may remain in equilibrium indefinitely, hypothetically--
This is a primary feature of Bitcoin.

Consider Bitmain has the other 25%-30% of the hashrate they need to instigate a 51% fork squirreled away or otherwise smurfed-- and the eastern authorities control the bitcoins of the exchanges and individuals they "protect"--
How do we, as bitcoin optimists, confront these circumstances?
Consider the likelihood of all out blockchain warfare, with a preponderance of Bitmain hashrate blocking transactions on the minority chain-- while blocking the exchange transfer away from censorcoin due to key confiscation-- I would estimate that, perhaps, 50-70% of bitcoins are currently possessed by chinese hodlers...

The biggest concern with BU is of general concern about larger blocks in general-- and also relates to hard-forks in general, but the latter is of lesser concern...
Re: BU/ big blocks and you:
The most important aspect of Bitcoin is decentralization, yes?
Larger blocks play in favor of a vision of bitcoin in which a few colocated, centralized actors with priveleged network access to one-another: large blocks, especially unboundedly large blocks such as those proposed by BU drive centralization-- a feedback loop by which small miners who may not be colocated/ have preferential network access to the mining hub are at a severe disadvantage wrt. block propagation, and are eventually forced off the network-- they have to download the entire previous block before they can begin mining. Their statistical disadvantage follows as (block download time)/(10 minutes) How long does it take to download a few GB? The game-theoretic proposition/hypothesis that large-block miners will limit their production to blocks sized such that small miners will accept them seems tenuous at best, and certainly unproven.
The burden of node operators will also increase/become unmanageable, but even without this fact, the mining problem is fatal.
What do you call a Bitcoin in which a node is prohibitively expensive to operate and mining is centralized in datacenters/ the hands of large players?
Answer: The wetdream of the state.

From your POV-- would it be easier/ politically preferable to incorporate a one-way peg/ proof of burn mechanism into a completely different blockchain than implement such a fork on Bitcoin proper?

@_date: 2017-02-27 01:29:26
not sure anybody has come up with a safe way of dynamic blocksize adaptation-- so it's not surprising it's not been implemented in core. Honestly, I don't think people are thinking big picture: in segwit/LN world, per my calculations above, $1M bitcoins with a userbase approaching the number of economically solvent US households are possible today, without hardforks. So what if it looks like causing a hard fork is getting more difficult-- if we can somehow saturate SW/LN capacity, we will be in a different universe. Political obstruction will be far more potent than scaling limitations--
In the grander perspective, those concerned that "SW is the end of scalability" due to a network unwillingness to Hork demonstrate a profound lack of creativity: cryptographic innovations, sidechains, LN successors, etc will be the exponential solutions of the future--not linear blocksize increases.
Failing any material innovation in the space (unlikely), and confronted with the saturation of LN (unlikely within the decade) maybe then, we will see the network resort to hork for capacity-- but these probabilities are so remote, and the time of urgency so distant, that I think the call for a practice hork is hopelessly misguided at this time. (though I concede that this doesn't stop some from maintaining the viewpoint)
...And regarding post-segwit roadmap-- There are several proposals in the pipeline, which are contingent on segwit's activation. I think the community loses it's position to beg for future roadmap-- when the current roadmap is not progressing due to miner opposition or unreadiness.

I think everyone would be wise to realize that not Core, nor mr. Voorhees, nor the Chinese miners actually have any say in whether the blockchain is forked. Only hashpower and users' capital can decide this.
When viewing from this lens, it can be seen that the statements of Core were the best possible outcome: in the event of an apparent imminent forking: we will have the support of our most talented Bitcoin devs to make sure it happens in the best possible way.
That was the most generous statement they had the authority to make-- any misunderstandings of this only muddy the situation.

I guess I fundamentally disagree about what is the most disruptive use case of the technology.
I'm not worried about our ability or inability to make small payments. I'm worried about the ability of Bitcoin to compete with fiat currency as an instrument to retain value over time.
I'm indifferent about the fees in Bitcoin, and don't think we should attempt to re-engineer the currency to tweak fees for a use case which represents what I believe to be a small portion of the utility of the network.


You really don't: I'm quite familiar with your viewpoint. And I believe it's incorrect.
I think it's a bit obtuse of you to claim that arguments contrasting Bitcoin's utility as yet another payment network with its (disruptive) utility as a value store are absurd.
I'm afraid we are at an impasse, but at least I know where you were coming from. I hope we can find a way to get a sweet payment network someday (maybe with sub-10-minute settlement times), but I'm OK with sacrificing... 3%? of consumer purchase largess to compete with big fish like gold as a long-term value store. There is a lot more money tied up in those markets FYI, if you are concerned about the value of your hodlings...
Consumer purchases will look like dust on the wind when the true economic elephants see the remarkable system we have built, and wander across our borders.

I appreciate your long-term interest in the project, and assume you probably have the best long-term interests of bitcoin at heart, but you are basically cheating a metric to make your side of the debate look more popular.
I think the fact that users admit to running multiple nodes... and that so many nodes are in AWS probably makes it look less genuine. 
Fact is: because of how easily gameable it is, node count means nothing, and hashrate is the only important metric. If you really support classic (I'd argue you shouldn't, but that's another discussion entirely), you should get a mining rig.

I think the risk of a miner-exclusion attack is reduced to sub 50% hashrate threshold for activation with this BIP:
Perhaps it's less than 50%, since the t+1 cap is defined as 2*the median. If they can shift up the median, they can choke off the bottom % of the miners, creating a feedback loop until they have choked off all less-privileged nodes and miners.
All they need to do is shift it up delta at t+1, lowering the blocksize-increase acceptance threshold to sub-50% hashrate levels, albeit, for only a delta increase per interval.
Having less hashrate just makes delta smaller, but you eliminate the weakest nodes making your next delta larger.

The hard fork is the controversial bit. We soft fork all the time, but hard forks represent fundamental changes in consensus-level protocol and are not taken lightly.
Since segwit gets about as much headroom as big blocks, the motivation becomes painfully obvious that it's not about the capacity increase, but rather about capture of the protocol. Couple that with the downright obvious reddit manipulation and node count manipulation, and it starts to feel like we are under attack.

Not sure I agree completely here. Users only need Bitcoin insofar as they need to get paynet tokens... paynet miners probably need the blockchain they are pegged to... but once users have sidechain coins, they can safely ignore Bitcoin until they want to put some of their spendcoins into savings, so to speak.
If they are using only paynet tokens (backed by bitcoins) they only need to know about transactions on the paynet.
Oh, I see, you are saying paynet users should want to run full nodes... yes, this may be the case, then, if they want to run full-nodes, but the idea of a paynet is that it might be a bit less-secure than Bitcoin, and more convinient... SPV should be safe on paynet, and most users use SPV wallets now anyway.

Coinbase probably doesn't hold much equity in Bitcoin-- it wouldn't affect them much.
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:13:53
Of course, they would try to produce empty blocks to push the median down so they don't get choked off, but they are abandoning fees and probably have less hashrate to begin with, and thus produce fewer blocks to influence the median. Especially if the big miners are producing large blocks and the little guys are already beginning to feel the heat. This is related to the feedback loop I was talking about. Once the weakest miners get eliminated, there is less help for the next weakest miner to influence the median down... etc. _plus_ with the extra-bad way this BIP is designed, we get natural growth even if the initial blocksize dynamic is static when the blocksize standard deviation is small-ish. It's a completely unstable system with a built in push in favor of miners stuffing blocks and killing off their competition.

Miners are the party most-likely to exploit this weakness since they can do it for free: they just need to make sure their blocks are always full regardless of what the network needs at any given time: they can put zero-fee self-transactions in blocks to raise the median blocksize, and force smaller miners off the network raising their own effective hashrate for free. Since smaller miners probably have less hashrate and a worse network connections to begin with, they will be finding fewer blocks on average and won't be able to drive the median down as effectively as large miners will be able to drive it up: not to mention, sacrificing tx fees would hurt their bottom line more than stuffing blocks hurts the large miners.

If the utility of the sidechains is contingent on the underlying blockchain, can you really separate the systems philosophically despite the on-chain/off-chain apparent distinction? Sidechain tokens are really Bitcoins, (albeit, projected into a different utility space) no?

Agreed. When you wake up and see there is more to Bitcoin than 2mb blocks NOW OR ELSE, you see the core devs have been doing a lot of great work on a wide variety of projects which will bring us many awesome features, only _some_ of which are directly related to reducing fees for bitcoin-based microtransactions.
The fact they manage to get any work done in this toxic environment is a testament to their commitment to the project in spite of the loudmouths trying to claim they are somehow trying to sabotage the same project they have been helping build for years.
They have Bitcoin's long-term best interests in mind and their work and code show it.

You first:
Bitcoin's transaction rate isn't assumed to be proportional to its asymptotic value for reasons including, but not limited to those I exposit in my post. You seem quite bitter here, but I'm glad you have brought up the use of a strawman here, because that's exactly what you were doing:
"Bitcoin's value must be proportional to its transaction rate, bitcoin's transaction rate is limited, bitcoin's value therefore cannot grow"
in your own words:


I'm not strawmanning you (maybe you rightly accept we won't do visa tx-rate... but whatever) you're strawmanning Bitcoin.

I think it's the obvious conclusion given: 
1. Block-download latency reduces the effective hashrate of miners with bad connections
2. It is in the interest of miners to drive out competition to gain more blockrewards
3. Colocated miners can increase the penalty incurred by non-colocated miners by increasing blocksize, thus enhancing their own blockrewards
4. Dynamic blocksize schemes give miners means to increase the blocksize to facilitate this phenomenon. PLUS there is a feedback loop: once non-colocated miners start dropping out, there will be less downward pressure on blocksize, allowing colocated miners to increase return on colocation investment.
The comparison to HFT is more poetic than illustrative, but I bet there are real economic parallels at play here: My conclusion does not rest on them in any way however.
It's true that there are multiple centers of colocated trading, but often, they concern themselves with different/orthogonal (less-strongly-correlated) products/markets (unlike Bitcoin) and there is a BIG business involved in reducing market data connection latencies between geographically-distant datacenters since there _is_ edge to be found in being the first to use such a connection if you can afford to build it. Also, the reasons for the continued geographic distances between trading centers are mostly historically/regulatorily or politically-driven.
An interesting observation in the case of Bitcoin is that there is no advantage for miners to have low-latency connections to transaction-relaying nodes... only block-relaying nodes-- so there is no reason Bitcoin would have stable equilibriums in geographically-distant locations... even though it might be an intermediate, unstable equilibrium explored on the path to total centralization.

@_date: 2016-03-24 23:32:32
I think you're speaking past my most important points, and I'm not inclined to delve further-- you're right about my argument fatigue.
But ARRGGHH you get me wrong in so many places.
First off, for the sake of keeping this civil, this tone:


is quite unnecessary. I assure you, I understand the relevant topics,  could only be seen to have "failed to address how such a system would be de-facto censorship-resistant." if you misunderstand my position, and that I _do_ understand the ramifications of my argument quite well.


You miss the point that I excluded a decentralized layer 2/ hierarchical solutions. Maybe I minced terminology, allowing ambiguity between offchain third-party, centralized or exchange-based paper trades with bitcoin-based sidechains or payment networks (which are _in ways_ off chain, but still backed by actual Bitcoins). My bad. But since we were talking about exchanges in particular, I might expect you to inherit that context here... whatever. I hope we can let it go. To be fair, I did specify:


were the things I was ...accusing you... of ... accusing me... of supporting. ugh.


Compared to gold, Bitcoin _is_ and _always will be_ cheaper to securely store and transport and more secure to transfer. particularly for larger quantities/values. _even if it is expensive for small transactions_


I obviously meant a Bitcoin (or in the distant future, Bitcoin-pegged sidechain) wallet. It will be many, many years before fees make it noticeably costly for a weekly/monthly paycheck to be sent to a wallet, or this weeks pocket change/ spending money to be transferred to dollars or some other spendcoin or sidechain. The rest of that paragraph hinges on you misunderstanding that I meant third-party controlled, Bitcoin-denominated paper.


You are misrepresenting me here, obviously. I think on-chain will eventually be priced out for microtransactions, then later, for small purchases, but at any realistic growth rate, it will be years before we worry about fees more than a couple dollars value equivalent per-tx, which is fully in the realm of wire transfers, or most other _payment networks_ for transactions of nontrivial value (recall, fees are not a percent of the value, but roughly proportional to the kb). By then, Layer 2 should be mature, unless you believe it is technically impossible to build a good LN-like system or sidechains. If that pans out to be true, a lot of my argument _does_ break down, but I simply disagree. If we can't build layer 2, bitcoin is dead regardless of transaction rate.
...I was going to answer you point by point, but I think most of where you go on from there is based on a misrepresentation of my position, and mostly reiterates why Bitcoin-denominated bank accounts (in contrast to actual bitcoin wallets) are bad... I agree here... but obviously, I am not advocating that. I think users should control their keys.


What you seem to be missing is that in "my world" (thanks for that, btw) we are not simply replacing dollars in banks with bitcoins in banks-- we are replacing the overall components with decentralized counterparts: Bitcoin is the monetary base/ storage medium/ savings account, (not the pocket change or payment network), and no fees which are likely to exist soon are going to preclude those use-cases. And I think you'll agree that if we adopt the project of replacing legacy components (to create the decentralized revolution I think we both want) with decentralized counterparts, we need to start at the bottom: the monetary base. We can add the top layers/ the frosting of the cake, after the bottom is fully-baked.
I think we definitely do not see eye-to eye on what experience users will have with Bitcoin in the distant future: I see users existing almost entirely in higher layers, which _are_ decentralized and permissionless, which _are_ facilitated by Bitcoin's scripting layers, immutability and cryptographic properties, you probably see them using a tricked-out layer 1 Bitcoin... I guess I _do_ agree with what you describe as "Core"'s vision... as if they own the idea of building on top of primitives... And I don't think that's a bad thing. I really don't get why that approach gets so much hate. IMHO, it's _the_ way to go from a complexity standpoint. If you want a super complex system, you have to start with a solid, basic foundation and build up from there like a tree of complexity, where the failure of a branch doesn't greatly affect the other branches or trunk. I really _don't_ want a one-layer Frankenstein kludge...
I think we probably both agree on the features we want/ expect from the overall system some day, but disagree on how to get there. I wish we could have been more civil about it-- I think the very idea of a fork brings about this sort of contentious thinking "us-vs-them" "fork1 vs fork 2". What if we lived in a world where Bitcoin was Bitcoin, and we were all users capable of building on top of it _if we wanted_? I think that's where Core's and similar approaches lead... as long as they don't try to fork the protocol... If core advocates a fork, then all bets are off. I will no longer advocate their plans. And will choose a development team which doesn't want to fork. (let's not get into hard vs soft forks)
Anyway, I'd like to leave you with some sort of warm fuzzy, since we are all in this together-- 
I still believe whoever is right, you or me, us or them, forks vs hierarchy... the best Bitcoin will win in the end... even if it takes us a while to get there. even if there is a different genesis block. We're both Bitcoiners who want the best for the project. I'm not a troll, you're not a troll, we just want Bitcoin to succeed. We want freedom and decentralization to prevail.
edit: grammar, wording and such.

yeah-- I didn't have anything too specific in mind-- just wondering if it would be possible to lock an input using some combination of scripts so it can only be picked up by a miner on a certain leaf-- and that miner could merge several transactions back to the main chain via some commitment scheme. What I was thinking sounds more like a merge-mined sidechain... but poorly articulated :p
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:16:28
(members of) Core (I hate this terminology btw-- they are individual contributors to an open source software project) have more or less said that if there is real need for a fork, they will help implement one. That's pretty smart... since there actually _are_ cases in which a hardfork could become uncontroversial and necessary for the network. 
It's not on the roadmap because it's not "Plan A" so to speak... and putting it on before the other optimizations have had a chance to: 
a) diffuse some of the present tension
b) attempt some real network improvements above and beyond a HF
would be a political move. Bitcoin doesn't change the protocol for politics, mr. Voorhees.
What offends me (more like irritates, actually) is that you probably already know this, and yet, continue to make political potshots like this OP.

@_date: 2016-03-07 00:18:10
We don't fork to cater to certain use-cases. It is bad because it shows that if lobby, spam and complain loud enough, you can break consensus. "Just the tip" Whatever. we know 4mb blocks are right out The network would break. 2mb blocks _could likely_ be bad for centralization, but that's just the beginning. a 2mb fork shows we aren't able to come up with creative solutions to scale.  a 2mb fork breaks consensus and for what? very little in return: a miserable one-time increase in tx bandwidth. I will never participate in a bitcoin with regular forks: every time we change the rules, we are opening the door to human failure. failure of the community to recognize mal-actors attacking the protocol. failure of developers to understand knock-on implications of their actions. Opening the door to RSA-NSA-like bullshit which we _know_ is coming the second state-sponsored economic terrorists start seeing bitcoin as a threat to their dominance.

I just don't think this is true. Sure, it's hard to fork the protocol-- this is a good thing... but lots of people do things in Bitcoin without Core.
Softforks might be an exception... But those don't tend to be quite so controversial. 
FWIW, I don't think a core-backed hard fork would fare any better.

Sidechains have potential to be less-secure. You are right to note they will usually have their own mining infrastructures which will likely be smaller than Bitcoin proper. Hopefully, they come up with innovative POW or POS models to maximize security. I don't doubt we will see a balance between security and the intended use case of the sidechain.
Centralization pressure will depend entirely on the specifics of the sidechain. 
Sidechains, like Bitcoin in general, will be completlet optional-- though many users will want to use them for the utility they provide.

Alright, 
you can be reasoned with:
We took from '09 to '16 to fill 1mb blocks (spam and all).
We are implementing segwit before a HF no matter what. I hope we agree on this-- you have stated elsewhere that everybody supports segwit. And people who understand don't need convincing that softforks are preferable to hard forks for a number of reasons... in this case, the reasons for SW first are even clearer, since aspects of SW actually could make a HF work _better_... so let's call this a given.
We estimate SW will be getting us an additional 0.5 to 0.8 mb per block when it's fully implemented... though we acknowledge that adoption of SW is in ways, voluntary...  so that might not be right away-- though miners who are ok with hardfork for big blocks would theoretically roll out SW immediately unless they had political motivations... (all bets are off then... but play with me here...)
So... we have SW now. Not 100% capacity increase like big blocks, but almost the same amount-- and some extra goodies that help a bunch of other stuff...
We now have-- say... 1.6mb blocks to avoid unwarranted optimism...
at our previous growth rate... that would take us close to 4 years to fill! Given a simple estimate of _increasing_ growth rate (we wish, right?) That could only last us two or three years... 
Do you really think LN which is currently in alpha (or other solutions-- I've got a few faves...) will take more than two years to deploy onto the network with the apocalyptic possibility of a hard fork on the horizon? 
I think it's fair to observe that we should have a reasonable plan-- and with all due respect, I think the proposed solution (the roadmap) is reasonable. Instead of insisting we put the nuclear option on the calendar, perhaps you should request a discussion of the contingencies which must be met in order for its prioritization? I'm afraid this is where many real disagreements are-- but I think the possibility of a queuing disaster might be a good place to start from your position-- Please spare us of insisting that gameable stats like those mentioned in the top comment to this OP should qualify.
That sort of approach would come across as a lot more diplomatic.

Except this is actually a bad solution. Even BitPay's own figures show a qualitatively unbounded growth pattern, as would be expected from the blocksize growth algorithm posited. Allowing large miners to stuff blocks to choke out weaker miners and effectively prune network hashrate behind sup-optimal network connections to cause an effective boost to their own hashrate and higher profits. Not to mention, a positive blocksize-feedback loop which strengthens the pattern.
We all know that due to the difficulty adjustments, it's nearly pointless to mine with generations-old mining hardware: with dynamic blocksize, it will become pointless to mine without an industry-leading download speed also. Obviously leading to centralization. This is basic stuff. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:38:27
I guess what I'm saying is that when the protocol is actually in trouble, the consensus formation would appear "magical" compared to the current bickering... and implying that the current bickering is a fruitless enterprise. we could focus a lot of minds on more important matters if we move on. Bitcoin is still plowing uncharted waters, and still leading the industry in spite of it's community right now. we could turn up the gas even higher if we let the fork proposal die and focus the community and development efforts on real improvements. we have shown the network is unwilling to fork intentionally, but also shown it is capable of doing so when it really matters. these are important findings, which bode well for bitcoin imho. the only thing left to do now is for the community to move on.and resume building awesome applications.

True, lots of testing is being done. By the time it's deployed, we can be pretty sure the network is as ready as possible. Good news is, it's a softfork, so if all the nodes around the world don't implement at once, there is still almost no chance of a consensus crisis.

because dynamic blocksize algorithms obviate the difficulties of mucking with the blocksize. As in this case: there are obvious problems. A one-time boost would be preferable to a scheme like this since they are maybe less-gameable, but these sorts of algorithms take into consideration that we would need to enhance the blocksize periodically to grow tx rate via blocksize to match new users. Alas, they are almost always trivially gameable, and probably non-obviously gameable in as-of-yet unarticulated, more complex blocksize growth paradigms. We are left with this: devise a provably non-gameable block growth approach (This isn't one) or scale in other ways.

Ultimately, the decision to use hashing infrastructure to mine one chain or another is up to the miners. If users don't like what the miners are doing, they can vote with their feet, but miners gonna mine. I don't think they would intentionally do anything which would hurt the value of the coin, since ultimately, people buying the coins give them value (as you note, they need to profit) but it's difficult for them to know what's best for the value of the coin in uncertain times.

If a miner waited, another miner would include the transaction in the block.
I think it would actually keep fees lower: In times of low network load, the fee could be set low/zero and still have a chance of getting included... (though miners can mine empty blocks if they want, like if all mempool transactions have zero fees.)
If there is high load, the wallet will automagically bump up the fee to get included. Wallet users could set an urgency for the transaction which dictates how fast the fee bumps up... not all transactions NEED to be executed in 10 min. If people could be confident that the tx would get included in x minutes/hours, they could rest easy and not worry about babysitting the transaction-- the wallet is handling it.

miners with large hashrate can push the median blocksize of the past n blocks around. Up or down to their choosing. If they want to push it up, it wouldn't need to be due to network demand: they could make their own synthetic transactions to make sure the blocks are _always_ full if they want.
Do you get why some miners would want to raise blocksize to increase competitors' orphan rate, or decrease effective hashrate of the miners on bottom-tier network connections?
With a dynamic blocksize as proposed here, once the median shifts, the ceiling raises to allow further median shifts. The miners with large hashrate can, again, push the median up.
Now, the deal is that with less hashrate, their ability to push the median around doesn't go away: it's just proportional to their hashrate.
Even if a miner, or group of miners interconnected with super-duper network connections have far less than 51% of the network hashrate, they can still push the median around somewhat, increasing the blocksize substantially, potentially... due to the 2x median rule...
Eventually, the effective hashrate of the non-interconnected hashpool will decrease/ their orphan rate rise and the attackers now have a more powerful attack.
The feedback loop persists until they _do_ have a large percentage of hashrate. The only thing that changes if they have smallish initial hashrate is how fast it takes to build momentum, not the ultimate outcome.
I think the attack might not be feasible to very small miners (who probably have bad connections anyway, who wouldn't attempt this attack.) because the orphan rate they would experience from other miners pushing the big blocks back at them would be too high. But maybe for 30% or higher, the attack is feasible until they control the network.

Everybody needs to cool it about the 2mb fork. There are good things on the horizon in Core. The sky is not falling-- time to confirmation is within historical range-- if IF there is an increase in average confirmation time, you might have to pay a fee. Increasing blocksize just lets us spam the blockchain more effectively. More likely, the upcoming segwit will get us past the immediate tx rate scalability challenge, and in the future, sidechains will help us scale exponentially. The 2mb fork does too little to justify hard-forking, and is divisive for the community.

The endgame has all miners in the same datacenter for optimal network bandwidth. Colocated miners will ensure blocks are always full, even if it means using synthetic transactions, driving unbounded blockchain growth as non-colocated competitors are edged out. This is an unacceptable endgame for bitcoin: not in any way decentralized.
Of course, colocation will be a good investment for miners who can afford it: just like in the high frequency trading markets. It will also be bad for Bitcoin.

Well, for the most part, core nodes _aren't_ hosted in AWS. They are hosted by individuals on more diverse hardware and network endpoints. But if they were, yes. 
Generally speaking, from a network security perspective, it is considered best to own your own hardware and internet connection when you run a node. This ensures the least dependence on centralized policy, such as on AWS. From a practical perspective, an overabundance of nodes within a single datacenter, such as an AWS site provides little value to the network: the nodes do not help create a complex mesh with other independent nodes, but rather cluster together behind the infrastructure of the VPS provider: the connection graph will be nearly bipartate with one or two bridges between the AWS nodes and the real network at Amazon's routers: central points of failure. 
In reality, having one, or two nodes for redundancy inside each AWS datacenter is probably sufficient from the perspective of securing the network.
We _do_ know, however, that it is a common practice among Classic supporters to run many vps nodes to create the appearance of support for classic, since in the olden days, one node roughly corresponded to one user. This rubs us the wrong way as it comes across as dishonest, but mostly underscores the fact that node count has little to do with network support of one implementation or another, and reemphasizes the fact that in this sort of situation, only hash rate and user economic support mean anything as long as there are at least a few nodes.

I think it's less than 50%, since the t+1 cap is defined as 2*the median. If they can shift up the median, they can choke off the bottom % of the miners, creating a feedback loop until they have choked off all less-privileged nodes and miners.
All they need to do is shift it up delta at t+1, lowering the acceptance threshold to sub-50% hashrate levels.
Having less hashrate just makes delta smaller.

In the far more likely scenario, we will never need a fork due to actual technical improvements in the network (Layer-2)...

fake nodes are used to bluff community support. Some on AWS might actually relay transactions and blocks, but the purpose is propaganda.
This being said, having large numbers of nodes in AWS is bad for centralization. If Amazon becomes hostile to Bitcoin... POOF nodes gone. Not to mention that they do very little to decentralize the connection graph... AWS nodes by location are all sort of in the same datacenter. Sure, you can send traffic to all of them, but it all goes through the same routers. AWS is basically one big computer per site with lots of ips.

soft forks, in general, are optional for clients. The fact that we tend to all run compatible clients is a nice property of bitcoin in its present state, but this may not always be the case. I agree that forks are needed, like to address emergencies like in 2013, but tend to disagree that they should be used for incremental upgrades.
I'd like to reiterate this important point: softforks are only dangerous to clients which implement them.

In theory, Bitcoin is antifragile, and the hemming and hawwing of the community is just a bunch of hot air... The right solution will be found, and the blockchain ticks along and ignores all of the drama. Someday, we will have more faith in it I guess. Or it will fail.

nope. It's a valid observation: Bitcoin has most of the good properties of gold without being a payment network... is making the usual big block crappy argument that Bitcoin has no value if it doesn't have a visa-volume, on-chain payment network, but that argument is easily defeated. By observing that there is at least one system with high market cap (gold speculation) which bitcoin improves on without needing big blocks. This is not to mention all the other fancy things which will be built on top of Bitcoin's scripting layer, which I suspect big-blockers simply don't understand, or are too impatient for moon to wait for... and mistakenly think buying everybody's coffee==moon.

This is a good argument, and not really what you were saying before: I agree, LN would be a better payment network than a 2mb bitcoin pegged sidechain would, for instance. The problem of scaling sort of goes hand-in-hand with a bottleneck like all txs have to go into a block. 
I completely agree with you so far-- but to say that pegged sidechains aren't a scaling solution because today, LN is better than any scale-encouraging sidechains we have thought up yet goes a bit far imho.
You could make a sidechain with 10mb blocks and a 30 second block time if you wanted... not exponential scale, but it does offer some linear scale.

I see what you are saying, but in one possible use-case, a certain class of user might _only_ use the pay-sidechain. They might need another wallet, or a wallet which has multiple blockchain spv support. This isn't really a big deal. 
Miners on the pay chain are motivated to exist because they can collect fees in pay-coins, redeemable for bitcoin-- making the need to maintain two blockchains more appealing. 
You raise a good point that nodes and miners who wish to use the sidechain need to watch both blockchains, but that's the case with all sidechains, isn't it? and isn't really a unique shortcoming of those specifically focused on providing payment networks?

The time to download a 1mb block is already a small percentage of the time it takes to mine the block (10 min) so while, yes, theoretically, the phenomenon could exist right now, in actuality, no, it doesn't make that big of a deal-- (though we still _do_ see orphaned blocks) and is a far weaker effect than other factors to the point of being negligible.

is this from the future?
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:02:27
2mb is not going to buy us much time. larger blocksizes will certainly be detrimental to the network, while 2mb only _might_ be detrimental to the network. we will not be able to scale very much more by increasing it: so all we are doing is buying time.
Eventually, we want exponential scale. This is only possible with layer 2 solutions. so they will be needed with or without 2mb blocks. People claiming that the fact the core developers want to support layer 2 solutions is somehow evidence of an effort to sabotage the protocol are completely off base, and most likely attempting to spread FUD.
Segwit, a core proposal, also buys time. almost as much, in fact, as 2mb blocks. In addition to allowing more tx rate, segwit also adds numerous other improvements to the protocol. improvements which will help with layer 2 solutions.
The future is obviously layer 2. the question is how do we get there? segwit or 2mb blocks?
The answer is already clear. It's segwit. 2mb is unsafe without it, so we probably wouldn't be very smart to deploy 2mb first. Segwit WILL be deployed first, whether or not 2mb blocks ever follow. The question is then: do we still need 2mb blocks _ever_? I contend: no. 2mb blocks aren't the future, theyre a band-aid to get to the future, only: we have a better band-aid. Segwit.
Is there a case in which we need both segwit _and_ 2mb blocks? I contend this is unlikely. Even if you would rather fork the protocol than see average fees approach a dime rather than a nickel, we will probably have real scaling solutions by the time we need them. I estimate segwit buys between 1 and 2 years, even at a superlinear... an increasing growth rate. Blockchain spam like we saw last week is no justification for urgency. If anything, the spam proves blockspace is still too cheap.
My personal belief is that Bitcoin should be fork-resistant. This makes it a trustworthy crypto, and untrustworthy cryptos don't deserve economic investment. This resistance is worth far more to me than a miserable one-time tx bandwidth increase like we would get from 2mb blocks. I contend there are other networks which can share the load for low-value transactions if Bitcoin's fees ever get above a dime. LTC comes to mind: that's why it was invented. 
In the end, I am one of those that feel the primary purpose of Bitcoin is to serve as the first digital state-free global reserve currency, like gold, and as such, no sacrifices should be made to bend the protocol to being a payment network. There are many suitable payment networks for low value transactions: including centralized and decentralized ones based on Bitcoin. 
Forking the protocol because worst-case-in-near-future dime fees are too much, to buy only a little time until blocks are full again and we repeat this shit, after which point we will be unable to boost blocksize further, when we have a different solution which gets almost the same boost to buy time until when the next layer which is already showing promise in testing phase is ready more or less prove a fork to 2mb blocks is "about the worst idea ever" (TM) -- and there is a lot of competition for that title.
The idea is so bad-- and the foodfight in the community has been so bad that it leads otherwise level-headed people to suspect we are being manipulated by mal-actors who may actually be "out to get Bitcoin"

You basically just contradicted VenomSpike.

Nothing really, just inflates the appearance of the popularity of Classic, when in reality, they are a vocal minority.

true. I see softforks more as client features. nonconforming clients may ignore them. core make a client-- so by my estimation, they can make whatever features they want. as long as they don't try to hard fork to enable their agenda.
To clarify terminology: I see softforks more as forking the client.

There is nothing inherently wrong with forks-- especially when all fork-introducing actors are trustworthy: the problem underlying the reluctance to fork (I agree, the ability to fork in emergencies is very important, as demonstrated in 2013) is that it demonstrates malleability in the protocol, and weakness to attacks.
I tend to be of the inclination that a primary feature of a cryptocurrency is that it should be assumed consist of a static protocol, around which, systems can be built if the protocol has merit: the protocol becomes the set of economic axioms underlying more complex systems. I know this is a philosophical position, and people have differing opinions-- but I think the mathematical integrity of the system depends on the fact that we only fork in emergencies. I also think the economic value comes from this mathematical integrity.
To me-- "Satoshi's Conjecture" means that a well-designed protocol will _never_ fork. The fact that we have resisted unnecessary forks so far gives me confidence in our project: If I were inclined to believe we would fork the protocol every time we dream up some "nice to have" feature-- or want lower fees or something-- I would divest immediately-- perhaps staying in the project for a technical interest-- but I would assume the underlying protocol to represent zero economic worth: then it's just code.
As both a coder and a mathematician, I observe that this attitude tends to be shared by fewer engineers fully on the code side: they see the protocol as just that: a protocol-- which can be changed with relatively little consideration or gravity. I know we change and upgrade code often-- and this is why I usually am OK with soft forks... but to me-- the protocol represents something greater. Something which should be immutable out of principle, and what's immutability should be seen as far more important than any bolt on utility which we think could help this or that aspect of the project...
That's my use case, and why _I'm_ in Bitcoin. If there were a different crypto out there which demonstrated greater fork-resistance: I'd exit Bitcoin and enter that crypto. It's just that Bitcoin has demonstrated this property under greater duress than any other example I'm aware of.
Of course, different people come to the project for different reasons.

I think the terminology is inherited from "forking" a codebase... the forker doesn't have to try to re-merge changes from the parent, and could carry on their merry way with never thinking about the parent again. In cryptocurrency, I don't think the analogy is as apt as many think.

Trading doesn't necessarily mean using a lot of on-chain transactions. Think about gold... A ton of gold gets traded every day, but almost nobody takes delivery. Sure, there will be a boost in wallet-exchange transactions, but I bet things will work out alright. People who want to sell should make sure they have planned ahead instead of freaking out if they dont get next-block confirmation. All in all, the Bitcoin side is pretty predictable... the exchange side on the other hand? I'm more worried about that...

Not advocating "normal" POW HFs obviously.
It's just an observation that with broken POWs, Bitcoin should be expected to switch-- as Bitcoin can not function with a broken POW.
The Idea of a fake out fork isn't crazy at all... Really, it's just two reactive POW-broken forks in close succession. We are dealing with an APT with potentially-large capital reserves. It might be wise to anticipate vigorous attacks, and prepare to act with agility until APT is exhausted.
@_date: 2016-03-07 06:47:14
users may decide not to use clients which implement a soft fork. In this case, they will interact with the network fairly normally (they would observe a change in p2sh outputs in other users' transactions, and would need to request payments in a compatible format, which soft-forked clients aren't _necessarily_). In the event of a hard fork, users not wishing to implement changes will experience de-synchronization from the network: they will ignore blocks sent by the miners since they are nonconforming.


Not sure about that proposal you are referencing: I don't follow all new proposals until they get a bit of momentum... From what you are describing, though, it sounds like a hard fork to _enable_ all hard forks... highly undesirable to me: I think the protocol should be very difficult to hard fork.

It was always assumed Bitcoin could change POW is sha2 was ever broken. This is one of the admissible family of HFs... the ones that, in absence of... Bitcoin couldn't function. Community may have to decide if temporary DOS is sufficient to qualify gross malfunction.
The good news in this situation is that if BU has anything less than 75%... such a HF/stay-behind-attack is unlikely to succeed. They wouldn't be able to maintain 51% on the og chain to build their "long attack chains" and secure their own network at the same time... I'm not sure what the over/under is on how much "ice-berg" hashpower Bitmain is amassing to participate in the attack. Either way-- BU has it's own host of attack vectors which can be exploited far more efficiently than DOSing the OG chain.

That's actually a rather nice metaphor, but I'm still unconvinced. Maybe it was a big mistake by Satoshi to make blocksize a consensus-level parameter, but here we are.

This is one of Bitcoin's advantages over gold as a value store: you can take delivery in large amounts of Bitcoin but not gold. You can trade in actual Bitcoin, not paper.

@_date: 2016-03-22 00:35:39
I like that this proposal actually encourages us to try to design an optimal system instead of a reactionary (simplistic) omgbiggerblocksnow! approach: with this formalization, we will begin to design the theory which I believe will demonstrate that raising the blocksize is an important and nuanced decision not to be trifled with due to _real_ concerns of miner centralization.
I think serious holes have already been poked in this proposal, but hopefully, we can begin to have a discussion about a blocksize policy with mathematically describable ramifications which could eventually lead to ...god forbid... some intellectual discussion on the topic among the community.
I think it will be found that almost _all_ block growth algorithms are gameable and will lead to centralization, but I'm willing to entertain well-thought-out approaches.

You're missing the point:
A statement of contingent support for a fork (contingent on it's hypothetical future necessity) is not a reason to put it on the official roadmap before other options have been exhausted.
This type of support obviously has the best outcome for Bitcoin in mind, though, since it potentially depoliticizes the matter while still leaving it as a last-ditch option.
Let me ask you a question: Would you admit that a future Bitcoin which achieves a certain degree of scale capacity by non-fork methods is better than a future Bitcoin which achieves the same scale capacity through the means of a blocksize fork? Or is the fork more important to you than the capacity?

He's really just saying miner's can't be profitable if all the tx fees go away due to really well-working layer 2... this is _totally_ fair.
I believe that a well-working L2 will drive adoption, and eventually, as blocks remain full, and L2 coordination transactions dominate, they will come with even higher fees due to their high utility-- this may not happen right away, and could pose a real threat to miner bottom line. If we could find a way to assure the miners that they won't be knocked out in the early days of L2-- before coordination transactions re-saturate the blocks/ high fees... higher than before... the end of the conflict is in sight!!!one!!! this is REALLY encouraging.

How could you possibly know that your transactions have been broadcasted, or your payments have been received without trusting a third party who is capable of running a node? or a cabal of third parties? How is that any different than the legacy system? Maybe someday, we will be able to have trustless SPV systems, but until then, if you don't control a node, you are trusting someone who does-- which eliminates the "trustless" aspect of bitcoin--
Yes, it is possible that there is a sweet spot, where there are enough trustworthy node operators that you effectively don't need to worry-- but still, the only true financial sovereigns in this system are those who can validate their own transactions and not need someone to do it for them -- but this is a rather unstable equilibrium which would likely be fleeting as nodes get harder and harder to operate.

The game theory is clear-- Jihan is worried his investment will go kaput due to changes to the protocol. He sees TXMalleability as a feature, not a bug... a feature which enables _his_ use-case.
This makes a productive path forward: How can we assure miners that L2 won't eat their lunch before Bitcoin grows enough miners make _more revenue_ _despite L2_

Sorry, I have gotten a bit defensive, it's nasty around here, if you haven't noticed. Your post does come off as a bit troll-ey, but in the past I would have given you the benefit of the doubt. Of course I don't think more centralization is the answer: I'm a bitcoin maximalist and think Bitcoin is the key to developing a decentralized economy but we aren't talking about answers here in the first place... (I'll explain below) 


I guess, I wasn't saying anything is the answer to anything: I was making a normative statement about how exchange volume tends to be large compared to on-chain volume. Your "argument" sounds more like an accusation... If I observe that exchanges are capable of doing lots of paper volume (as is the case in _all_ commodities, including Bitcoin) then I must think that centralized systems, like coinbase payments or exchanges doing paper/offchain bitcoin/fiat trades, must be the solution to bitcoin's "scaling problem"... which I have learned lies behind most troll-ey posts around here lately.
Have I mischaracterized your statement?
In fact, I think a rich and vibrant decentralized economy will have a bunch of popular cryptos (or, ideally sidechains), some geared towards payment networks, some geared towards settlement/ value store. I think Bitcoin will be the cornerstone of all this because of its long history of stability and proven strength (I think voluntary forks undermine this but, that's just like... my opinion man...), and any shortcomings in Bitcoin's ability to have millions of cheap-on-chain transactions per day don't undermine it as much. I tend to refer to how gold allowed for the creation of a large global economy, even though it mostly sits in vaults. Bitcoin can do much better than gold at this because everybody already has a supervault just as good as the richest bank or most powerful king (their brain): not to mention it is actually way easier to transact/ transport Bitcoin than gold: not to mention it has awesome mathematical/cryptographic properties which allow it to be easily extended and built upon.
To answer your questions explicitly:


I don't think it's likely people will transact Bitcoin every day, but I do think it's likely everybody will own some Bitcoin, like a bank/savings account or vault. They have the option of using centralized solutions/ sidechains/ altcoins with less security to make daily transactions-- but most will probably use credit cards anyway for... the credit. People _want_ to use services... but hopefully, having a mathematically-sound monetary base/ global reserve currency like Bitcoin will eliminate the corruption and problems that flow from having a coin mined by [fed] policy instead of a static, fair protocol _even if it's not used as a payment network_.
The point is that Bitcoin gives you the ability to not use banks to store your money when it is sitting still: banks can't use fractional reserves based on deposits they don't have... Third party payment processors/ credit companies/ or decentralized schemes based on Bitcoin will act more like service providers than property (capital) owners. 
Bitcoin gives individuals (at least):
1. a supervault to store their savings
2. protection from having their savings "fedded" away, to coin a term, and freedom from being forced to financialize their savings via investments to even retain static value.
3. hooks to connect a commonly-visible "meter-stick of value" to myriad other systems which will be spared of the difficulty of fairly creating and distributing tokens... allowing cryptocurrency/sidechains/cryptographic protocols (maybe even something like zcash) to work on innovating features and services rather than token creation.
4. A "sound as possible" public cryptographic commitment protocol to serve as a root for child cryptos-- allowing hierarchical complexity to be built on the bedrock of Bitcoin...
I have rambled a bit here, but hopefully, by now, you are at least seeing where I am coming from...
My only fear today, really, is that it may be a bit difficult to attach sidechains... but I'm optimistic about that, mostly due to point (4) above.
I am not concerned so much with the short-term value of my "hodlings", so onboarding a bunch of new users _now_ to boost market cap is of secondary importance to building the _right_ system... which to me, consists of an immutable protocol, and emergent complexity based on sound mathematics.
I don't really want to get into blocksize anymore right now, but if you want to delve further, we can have a chat about that later...
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:03:38

@_date: 2016-03-22 22:24:38
I think Bitcoin should be fork-resistant. There is already a lot of flexibility in the protocol, and sidechains/layer 2 will do a great job of providing fancy features without messing with consensus parameters.
I think we will soon find that the fork resistance is stronger than we think... and in the end, we will find that there really isn't much we can do to cause one. All in all, I think this is a good thing, even though it means there will be other coins (sidechains more likely) with shinier features, faster conf times, or higher tx volumes. Bitcoin will be like a crypto-bedrock in ways we can only guess about today. More like a reserve currency I think.

I'm not sure where you are getting your counts for "a vast majority" of the community-- but your notional estimate of the popularity of a given proposal among a very wide swath of users with different needs, wants, use-cases and levels of technical expertise is of little comfort to me when we are talking about consensus protocol.

Voorhees enabled this belligerence by facilitating/contributing to (whether out of good faith or not) the astroturf blocksize campaign.

If any one specific proof of work algorithm is insufficient to maintain the desirable properties of a cryptocurrency-- it ill be replaced. The most valuable chain survives. Not the chain with some amount of physical capability with regard to any particular hash function or computer trick. Choice of Sha1,2,3 is irrelevant. If successive POW algorithms are again shown to be incorrect, they will be successively replaced.
The semantics of the term Bitcoin are fairly irrelevant. Satoshi was a pioneer, but failed to predict the consequences of POW.

There are many Bitcoin forks-- most of which had the dignity to mine new genesis blocks.
Both the broken design principle of malleable consensus rules as well as the poor developer quality, which probably is more of a symptom than an independent issue-- are serious problems.


Probably not-- there are so many problems with user-configurable block size that it's unlikely any amount of skilled dev horsepower could align the incentives and balance risks to consensus-- and then... _if_ you could come up with some respectable engineers who were such patrons of lost causes the'yd devote serious work to the concept, I would probably not support them in a bid to undermine Bitcoin consensus-- I would encourage them to start a new blockchain and see how it goes. If the idea has merit, I'd consider diversifying into some hodlings of their coin.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:09:50
*I have to disagree that Bitcoin's primary use-case is for a low-latency, low-fee, high-volume payment network.* This was propaganda pushed by short-term hodlers who saw this as a way to pump the network to VC. The purpose of Bitcoin is to create a mathematically-coherent currency free of the influence of central banks. When deciding the future of bitcoin, if we really wanted to re-create Visa, we could just BE VISA. The difference between Visa and bitcoin is decentralization and uncensorability. If we want an open-source, decentralized payment system: let's build one-- but let's not sacrifice the soul of bitcoin to do so. Many would rather use a credit card (for the credit-- which Bitcoin should never attempt to emulate). I would love to pay my Visa bill with Bitcoin-- they already built the payment network. 10 minute block times and nickel transaction fees are not a problem there.

No. Miners can only choose which transactions to put in blocks. their hashpower is useless if they don't know how to assemble valid blocks.
For instance, if a miner wanted to give themselves absurdly high blockreward as not per the protocol, their block is invalid. Nodes decide.
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:00:35
right-- we can probably estimate fairly well based on past blocks.

I still give you the benefit of the doubt in terms of looking out for/ having the best interests of bitcoin in mind, but you seem to have gotten carried away on the fork hype bandwagon.
These types of posts accomplish nothing and are divisive to the community.
Maybe the comparison was pushing it a bit far, but the opinion of this community is under attack. This sort of pro-fork propaganda will do nobody any good, and will keep this foodfight going for months, bringing toxicity to the bitcoin community until SW comes.
This community has been repeatedly let down by its public figures... there will few left without pie on their face after this is over.
What we need right now is for a bit of benefit of the doubt to be given to the core implementation and scaling plan, and for everybody to take a deep breath. Not posts like this.

The bitcoin I signed up for didn't have malleable rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:18:05


is a pretty bold assertion with no rationale.
Obviously, unlimited blocksize will make it more difficult to run a node, effectivley centralizing block validation: taking power away from users and giving it to authorities. You can't be a Bitcoin user without running a node (Trusting another node operator/ SPV is another matter)
We all know that if miners mine blocks with inappropriate blockreward, say, those blocks will be rejected by the network, and most importantly: my node. Likewise for blocksize.
If BU users want to trust a third party wallet provider to track their funds-- fine, that will probably still work in BU-land, and they are free to follow that chain if they want... but in Bitcoin, I can still run my own wallet.
Miners are currently "voting" on nothing more than their own ability to waste electricity mining invalid blocks. Maybe Governments will prefer to support BU because it is easier to control wallet providers than an internet of pseudonymous phantoms.

Bitcoin is in its infancy-- I think a lot of us think it _will_ become transparent to the user. We are in the BBS days of Bitcoin right now... you still need to have some technical ability to use it. (not that much, though-- the system is accessible to people who don't understand the protocol at a deep level) but this won't always be the case. Bitcoin isn't grandma-friendly yet, but then again, you could argue that it has only been in the last few years that the "internet" (TCP-backed stack) attained that status.
In your case, since you have worked in IT, I contend that Bitcoin _is_ simple enough for you to understand if you put your mind to it!

@_date: 2016-03-22 04:08:50
It would be advantageous to any miners who can get closer to the network bandwidth centroid to pad blocks. The effect may or may not directly play in favour of the current hashrate cartel... Honestly, I'm not an expert on chinese internet connections... Nor the complexities of what could happen in the event that the network bandwidth graph is partitioned: imagine the case in which 60% of the hashrate has an extremely low latency connection among itself, and a much higher latency/low bandwidth to the rest of the world... like if all the miners on some continent colocated: In this case, the low-bandwidth connection to all other miners only worsens the problem. I doubt any miners in this situation would push empty blocks. The colocated peers get an effective hashrate boost.
@_date: 2016-03-23 02:04:11
I'd be ok with extension blocks too, or merge-mined parallel chains or whatever. That's cool stuff. A fork really only needs 51%, but it's ugly. maybe the ugliness needs more formalization, but that's my point I guess. Maybe the economic risk increases exponentially as consensus diverges from 100%.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:16:04
Compared to a lot of the online systems we use everyday, Bitcoin is actually quite simple.
If you can understand TCP, you can understand Bitcoin.

we're also dealing with no problem. The network is functioning in a desirable manner: not processing low fee/spam transactions (which compose(d) most of the backlog [edit-- it's back to normal now]) while prioritizing more important transactions with real fees applied-- which are still quite within what I would consider sane by any person not conducting microtransactions' estimate. The few cases in which people trying to make real transactions with unreasonably small fees are normally the fault of the wallet implementation they are using. This is driving optimization and increased efficiency in the wallets.

We will soon be getting a significant boost via segregated witness. It is my suspicion that that will fill up soon as well-- not because the demand is growing... but because free resources tend to be used. Just because there are a lot of transactions doesn't mean even the majority of them were made with realistic consideration for demand, and many have fees per byte which are hilariously low. (there is another post on the FP which presents nice data on this topic.)
In short-- people want to store information in the form of transactions on the blockchain-- its a valuable service. People want to do this as much as possible for the lowest cost possible, and if there is a chance of getting lowfee/free transactions included, they will bum rush our nodes' hard drives.

No doubt, it will not be pretty. Normal users trying not to split will be up to chance mostly. Sometimes the transactions will get replayed, sometimes they won't be. It's in peoples' best interest to split somewhat intentionally, regardless of what side they choose.
Would be better off with no hard forks in my opinion.
When people get a good system together, they will be able to split huge quantities of coin, and sell the properly split children plus commission for the splitting service.
For hands-on users seeking to avoid trusting a third party-- (as you note, there will be lots of scammers) Scripts can be written that float small-fee transactions preferably on B2X network (which will probably not be included in blocks on Bitcoin if significant hashrate defects.). Once these transactions are included in blocks, User issues the high-fee transaction which would doublespend the output (invalid tx) on 2X, but which is still valid on Bitcoin before someone can replay the transaction on Bitcoin.
This behavior can easily be encoded in an auditable script people can run themselves, on their own nodes, calling into their own rpc servers.
Attackers would have to CPFP every transaction into Bitcoin. This all assumes fees are high in BTC on Bitcoin and somewhat lower on B2X, which, again, will likely be the case  B2X gets significant hashrate due to block time increase and temporal transaction demand.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:32:32
My Bitcoin Core node is a compatible Bitcoin node.
If Satoshi had intended 1mb to be temporary, he should have included that provision in the protocol. I know full well what single sentence you are referring to, but Satoshi was capable of making mistakes. Some implications of the protocol are misunderstood by experts even today. We are still learning how Bitcoin works.
If you agree that rolling back soft forks is permissible, you are working with an inferior version of the protocol to those which can be actually upgraded without being destroyed.

Miners got to choose how to interpret the SW2X nodes. Just because they were real nodes, doesn't mean they were economic nodes as they claimed.
Evidently, miners took the threat of economic sanction seriously: it appears they believed the nodes were real, and had economic import.
My point is, evidence leads me to conclude that the UASF nodes were _not_ duplicates run by a set of parties much smaller than the number of nodes-- economic backing was hypothetical, but no one person likely spun up the majority of those nodes.
Again, node count and IP/AS entropy was evidence for, but not sufficient proof of economic support. It wasn't justification, it was a threat. Speak softly and carry a big stick.

You think the campaign to grow blocks is going to end with this HF?
You give a rat some cheese... he's going to want the whole wheel. They will spam the shit out of 2X just like they spam bitcoin. Miners can spam their own blocks as much as they want for very little cost. Spam attacks become more efficient as hashrate centralizes. 2X is going to increase centralization. If the big blocks stay relatively empty, the argument for large blocks was an obvious lie. I mean, it _is_ an obvious lie either way... 
If we cave to this abuse, this shit will never end until we have 1gb blocks, 1 miner and blocks spammed full until the _effective_ blocksize is as _small_ as _the_ miner wants it to be.

We don't get to decide whether we do it. The thing that will force pow switch will be out of our control. For instance, hash attacks or miners refusing to mine blocks. You can't just fork the protocol because we think it's a good idea. We fork the protocol because we have to. Luke is noting that the assumption that we need exactly the quantity and types of hashes we get today to maintain security may not be correct. a large centralized Sha2 hashrate may not be as secure as a lower hashrate of some other algorithm which is decentralized.

I have always considered that the protocol is what has protected Bitcoin. There are significant economic interests in other fields besides crypto--which don't contribute to those industries' decentralization, freedom or openness. Like hashrate... it seems significant economic interest is only useful to the extent it protects decentralization. And this is only via hashrate. Since we don't have decentralized hashrate, economic interest transforms from an asset to a liability to the project.


I will sell the fork coins since a corporate controlled cryptocurrency is not interesting to me. I've been in this since 2010/2011 not because I was trying to get rich quick... like seems to be the driving factor behind so much of the community now... But because I believed, both technically and politically, in decentralized money. Bitcoin was the project which seemed to have the most promise in that regard, so I've invested my time in learning as much as I can about Bitcoin. To the extent that I'm a Bitcoin holder, it's mostly accidental: Bitcoins I bought to use to play with the technology have nonetheless appreciated in value, and I guess I'm not mad about this. 
Semantics, again, are less interesting to me... and if the community wants to call a rotten squid they found on the beach... Bitcoin... there's not much I can do to stop them... though, philosophically, they'd be wrong in doing so: It's not going to be worth my energy to constantly correct them.
I'll move on to other, more interesting projects, and maybe, if I am correct in my conjecture that decentralization is the key point which has made Bitcoin more valuable than any other penny stock the unwashed masses may find popular at a given moment, the investors will follow the technology. I'll be at the technology first, because that's what I'm studying, and that's what I find interesting. 
Lately, though I have yet to fully abandon Bitcoin, I am interested in other projects like Mimblewimble/Grin and non-blockchain cryptocurrency solutions like the Tangle. I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about these topics than I am about Bitcoin, but am far more interested about learning about their technology than I am in listening to whatever asinine shit the centralized "captains of industry" come up with next.
In all reality, S2X would be a blow to cryptocurrency in general, not just Bitcoin, because it calls into question the economic assumptinos/consequences/plausibility of decentralized access to mining hardware. I think mining centralization is the linchpin which may be leading to Bitcoin's demise, so I will be keenly interested in other cryptos which seek to address this issue.

To prove centralized forces own the currency? To prove miners can brick the chain if they want to? To validate this tactic in forcing protocol changes? There is no upside in 2x. All downside.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:47:48
Why don't Segwit-supporting miners accept transactions directly? Or release a pubkey so we can encrypt our transactions to them and use off-channel tx-propagation? We can subsidize segwit supporters and cut off fees from opponents.

As soon as the 2x miners hit flagday, they will mine on top of the 1+ mb block, and all work from that moment on will be invalid. It will happen instantly. It would be antithetical to preemptively hard fork difficulty adjustment.
Core rightfully sees a possible drop in hashrate and possible attacks on the network as emergency situation, and will probably deploy solutions reactively to any attacks that may come to pass.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:50:47
In defense of u/theflair : Yes, the concern of "scaling" is a valid one... It's just that we have had a trillion waves of both well-intentioned newcomers, as well as hardcore-diehard altcoin/establishment trolls who hide behind this "valid concern" as an excuse to promote their chosen altcoin or tear down Bitcoin. Eventully, people either get it: We want to be true to the protocol, and this is actually more important than making it accessible to coffee money use-cases if the goal is to replace reserve currencies and eliminate financial corruption on the highest levels. Or they don't: "maybe we can get lower fees, higher adoption and moon if we change a one to a two in the protocol."
To the latter camp, the message has always been clear: start an altcoin. This is exactly what Litecoin set out to do... and by-in-large, Litecoiners are well-liked typically in the Bitcoin circles, because they did the right thing... Saw a perceived flaw in the Bitcoin protocol, and started a respectable altcoin to address it.
The fact is, every armchair developer sees the block size increase as obvious, and (almost) every seasoned developer could tell you several reasons why 2X, if not any block size increase isn't such a good idea.
We are cursed. Cursed by both naive good intentions, and bad intentions... to have an interminable "block size debate" which hasn't changed on a fundamental level in years.
We were optimistic to think that bcash would appease them, but it's becoming clearer that they won't rest until hard forks in _Bitcoin_ are accepted... And Bitcoin becomes coffee money/paypal2 instead of a credible threat to the aforementioned financial corruption, as it's clear that a protocol with malleable rules is a risky store of value.
So while there has been significant debate, and acknowledgment that scaling is a "good idea"... in 2017, many are running out of patience with continued "debate" and the combination of beginners and trolls that perpetuate it. 
I don't know your level of experience in the area, so I'm not making statements about yourself... Just helping you understand why the community will be galvanizing against this viewpoint, and running out of patience in general. Why u/theflair might have reasons to be short with you on the topic, and why he might have mistaken you for a troll.

Segwit 2x is a hard fork (arguable altcoin) and will likely cause a persistent network split if it manages to retain miner support near 75-80%. It has mostly the same goals as bcash with the addition of segwit (which bcash is free to implement at any time). Many wonder whether the community should allow yet another split, or whether it should be annihilated economically with extreme prejudice.

Indeed, but still antithetical. Bitcoin doesn't exist to hand out favors. If Bitcoin doesn't have enough hashrate, it will need POW switch-- If miners don't want to deal with this... They should make some new "agreement" which nullifies the NYA to keep everyone rowing together. The users aren't going to take NYA laying down, and I'm pretty confident there will be significant attrition to the NYA between now and Nov... and/or other creative shenannaginz.

1TB cap, usage above that charged by the GB... $0.5 iirc.
Mixed with regular home usage, nothing crazy-- always at or above the cap. I profiled usage at the router, and the node was doing a high percentage of that... 20-30% when I checked. High usage both upload and download. Nodes do a lot of traffic-- not just downloading blocks-- also synching the blockchain with other users... relaying txs, etc. These are important node functions, admittedly above and beyond the bare minimum for validating transactions-- but crucial for the network. Default config, up-to-date UASF core. Lots of peers.

People need to get over hard fork mania. It's not going to happen. We need to work within the protocol. The sooner people stop trying to fork the protocol for this reason or that reason, the sooner we can start being productive, and working with what we've got, rather than chasing some impossible optimization which probably only appeals to a subset of wishful thinkers.
Finding new ways to do soft forks where multiple soft fork versions can coexist on the network would be a far more useful thing to do with developer time than bicker interminably what the damn block size should be.

Ok. sit down before you hurt yourself. I'd recommend reading a bit before trying to rattle off some nonsense and try to look like you know what you're talking about, but we were all beginners once, and I can forgive your misguided enthusiasm.
UASF Bitcoin had compatible rules with the bitcoin protocol. Full stop. It also had the ability to cause a chain split. Okey doke. I can't blame you for not quite understanding the differences between chain splits and hard forks (this might even be second-level bitcoin knowledge, so I'd suggest grasping the basics first) But to sum up the relevant bits, if UASF, despite having the potential to cause a chain split... _did_ split... against all odds (which it didn't) It would still be compatible with bitcoin. that is, if the UASF chain ever became the longest chain, Bitcoin would be identical to the UASF Bitcoin chain, because UASF blocks are _valid bitcoin blocks_ unlike BTC1... which accepts otherwise invalid Bitcoin blocs. BTC1 will cause a chainsplit _no mattter what_. It doesn't matter how long a BTC1 chain gets: it will _never_ be accepted by Bitcoin nodes: It will _never ever_ be Bitcoin.

SW gives up to a 2x capacity boost when highly utilized. This cuts the 1/5 slowdown over today's transaction rate in (almost) half.
If LN gets fired up and used quickly, we could have a higher real-world transaction rate than we do today, even with an 80% drop in hashrate. I'm not as optimistic that LN will be highly utilized that early: I don't think demand is high enough.
75% is an important number, as it is the crucial threshold below which it is nearly impossible for 2X sympathetic miners to 51% attack Bitcoin and retain the "longest SHA256 blockchain" title, which some are so keen on being *the* definition of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:27:59
Luke uses an interesting vantage point: It is impossible to "plan a hardfork" in a meaningful way in Bitcoin. Some dorks in suits shaking hands doesn't mean anything to the Bitcoin protocol. That's the point of Bitcoin. To stop dorks in suits from making decisions about our money.
The interpretation can get deeper than that, but the above should be sufficient to explain Luke's confusing, but correct statement.

Today, yes. I'll accept valid blocks mined, sourced, or relayed by Classic, BU or any other node. that's the beauty. If they are relaying valid blocks, they are legit nodes. If they start relaying invalid blocks, banhammer.


Forgive my incomplete historical knowledge here, but did Satoshi himself not merge the irreversible 1mb logic?




In the interest of space, I'd usually say layer-2 for the win... With the added point that LN is not the be-all-end-all of second layer solutions, but certainly enough for the immediate future. It will provide orders of magnitude more benefit than any linear blocksize increase ever could.

Operational enough for people to dump their 2x and then miners will get the message: stop forking with the protocol.
Even if all the hashrate switched: we could still dump our 2X and invest in better alts.

It's a corporate hostile takeover attempt. Any attempts to cast it as a compromise of some sort are intellectually dishonest. A small group of companies mostly owned by the author of a backroom deal referred to as the new york agreement purport to somehow represent the community, and are creating a poison pill for bitcoin. The goal is to normalize hard fork protocol changes to soften the community to further degradation of the network. 
Assertions that a compromise is wanted warranted, helpful, or possible, again are intellectually dishonest. The nya/segwit 2x is the last ditch effort of bad actors to capture the protocol after a string of other failed attempts including bitcoinxt, bitcoinclassic, and bitcoin unlimited. The false narrative is that there is a legitimate quid pro quo between segwit promoters and those who would seek to harm the protocol through hard forks. 
Perhaps there is a small, uninformed faction who would accept these terms, but to most knowledge community members, destroying the protocol via hard fork normalization under political corruption is not an acceptable quid pro quo in exchange for segwit... That is, many people would rather have a strong protocol without segwit than a weak one with segwit 2x. 
The lies continue, in light of the above, that segwit 2x/nya demonstrably influenced the activation of segwit, when in reality, a perfectly good explanation for its activation could be either slow miner upgrade dynamics or bip148. 
Segwit 2x is an effort by corrupt actors to steer the narrative to disguise a dangerous precedent setting technical mistake as a community lead project after falling to exercise their malintentions by a variety of other means. 
Further technical complaints which are axillary to the fundamental problems mentioned above wrt general corruption include :
Incompetent developers
Failure to implement replay protection 
Failure to accept community review of the codebase leading to numerous low quality implementation details such as non use of the hard fork bit in favor of a disgusting hack to force hard fork via mandatory invalid block creation etc. 
There has been no routine maintenance on the S2x codebase in over a month, while bitcoin proper had made a high number of non consensus improvements that competent fork developers would have merged, etc.

The community wasn't at the table. For this and other reasons enumerated above, it was a deal between certain players, not a meaningful compromise. Attempts to disguise it as a compromise, to me, are repugnant. 
Regardless of the semantics of the nature of the deal, the proper way of executing this fork in a responsible manner would have included replay protection to let the community vis a vis the market have a say in the success of the deal. 
The current state is untenable and indeed if this fork goes through without serious miner S2x attrition, it will be a fatal setback to Bitcoin and a serious setback to faith in cryptocurrencies in general.

Yes. The debate is over. Big blocks are on bcash. If you want big blocks, go buy bcash. End of story. Big blockers got what they wanted. If you are a Segwit supporter and still want "Big blocks now!" for some reason, I ask you to reconsider your reasoning. If you can't tolerate bcash, consider for a moment that these are your philosophical peers. If this makes you uncomfortable, it is time for introspection.

S2x would provide minimal short term relief. We'd be right back here next year crying for 16mb blocks.

It's safer in a way to be a receiver: you watch your node until the money shows up and confirms. For senders, it's far more dangerous: If you are uninformed, and send unsplit utxos to Bitpay, they will get both Bitcoin and B2X. If both tokens have value, you're getting screwed. You only needed to send the 2X: you should have been able to hodl the Bitcoin. Users will have to manually split the Bitcoin since there is no replay protection.

And I will argue the opposite, because they care about decentralization and freedom-- fees are low and about to get lower due to SW, then lower again due to LN.
to the extent that fees are high-- it's caused by the same bad actors which are pushing 2x: Jihan's spam war.  stockholm syndrome.
Most users that support 2x probably do so unwittingly by holding coins on Coinbase, and probably don't even remotely understand what's at stake here.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:14:28
SW will not affect the hashrate, you are correct. But it will allow the transaction throughput to be larger than it presently is for an arbitrary hashrate by the "2-ish" factor mentioned. So we get an effective doubling of throughput after (before, actually) the 80% reduction... for an effective reduction of 40%.
Again, we are discussing the viability of Bitcoin after 80% hashrate disappears. 
Now, if you consider that some percent of blockspace is from spam transactions which miners mine themselves, effectively for free, we can further reduce the quiescent blockspace demand estimate, as, presumably, unless they are attacking Bitcoin, 2X miners won't be able to spam in this way like they (allegedly) do now.

Electrum has made strides to make it easier for the beginner, and I'd guess people/the community will make easy scripts and services to do it for you, but basically, you get your outputs to diverge. You need to get your outputs into two different addresses on the different blockchains. Just because the transaction is initially valid on both chains, doesn't mean it will be included in the next block on both chains.
We want to cause the situation where UTXO1 goes to ADDR1.2X in block (n) but not ADDR1.Bitcoin. We then send a higher-fee transaction on Bitcoin to send UTXO1 to ADDR2.bitcoin in block (n+k) The fact that the networks will likely have somewhat different fee dynamics will make this easier to do.
Once the outputs have diverged, the transactions involving that input are no-longer valid on the wrong chain.
But it's not going to be quite as easy as it was for bcash, you're correct there.

This may be tested by 2X in November. Theory is, if hashrate gets destroyed by a flood, or a bomb... or miners' own profound stupidity, Bitcoin will have an emergency reactive POW modification HF to continue functioning.
In normal network operation, if all the blockrewards have been mined, miners are supposed to rely on fees to subsidize the electricity and hardware they need. This is why people who expect free/low fee Bitcoin transactions have been sold something that Bitcoin is not. Fees are designed to become significant as the block reward dwindles. Not shrink as network demand and miner load increases.

Do we have a way to cross-reference the fullness of blocks vs whether it contains segwit transactions?
It would be interesting in light of the hypothesis that: BITMAIN was using ASICBOOST, BITMAIN was stuffing blocks with spam, and Bitmain is not mining Segwit transactions due to incompatibility with AB.... Hence, blocks with SW TXs might not be stuffed.
Though I have seen that the majority of blocks are containing SW TXs... Even BITMAIN's blocks?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:48:34
The internet/network load is the far more expensive factor here than disk space or computer power. In the US, Full node operators on "high quality" cable connections regularly hit against their maximum bandwidth limits for a normally-configured node... This can get extremely expensive.
A further danger is that increased network load makes Bitcoin operation more difficult to run in a concealed manner, eg. over TOR, and are a liability against the ability of the system to withstand attacks on the network/node level.

LN gives us many ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE of effective transaction rate increase for everyday transactions-- the maximum possible impact of block increase is some small k.
 
Yes, top-level channels need to be settled-- but if every top-level channel takes 1000x (perhaps conservative) transactions per settlement tx pair-- we can rest assured, we have scaled.
The degree of uncertainty in the utilization of LN is orders of magnitude larger than transaction rate impact of incremental blocksize increases...


If people don't use LN because p2sh transactions are so cheap-- we are ahead of schedule.

It most certainly would. Not everyone is willing to run 2X code, regardless of who authored it: be it core, or Jihan.
Aside from this, the point is, my Bitcoin node doesn't magically become not a Bitcoin node just because Miners stop producing Bitcoin Blocks.
My Bitcoin node is not receiving blocks, the network is not operating. Bitcoin nodes declare the Bitcoin network dead.
In order to be Bitcoin, you have to be compatible with Bitcoin nodes. If you are not compatible with Bitcoin nodes, you are not Bitcoin. All Core nodes are Bitcoin nodes because they are compatible with each other, not because the binaries were published by core...
SW2X is _like_ Bitcoin in that it uses a similar protocol, but it _is most certainly not_ Bitcoin, because it is incompatible with bitcoin nodes.

The relevant ideas here are:
(1) the decentralization of the hashrate
(2) the magnitude of the hashrate
(2) is a means to (1)
By having a large cumulative network hashrate, assuming it's decentralized, theoretically, you make it harder for a single actor, like a government, Chinese government per-se, to procure a supermajority of mining hashrate through direct purchase. It'd be too expensive, even for a large government, to buy enough hashrate to become the 51% majority and attack the network by forcing forks or denial of service which undermine the functioning of the network and decrease it's viability as a threat to said government's regime of economic control and corruption. 
1-- having decentralized hashrate is all-important to the correct game theoretic operation of Bitcoin. With properly decentralized hashrate, the protocol becomes stronger because coordination between miners to corrupt the function of the network becomes more difficult.
Today, we find ourselves in a most undesirable situation: a single company has monopolized (nearly) hashrate production, and we have estimated ranges everywhere between Bitmain's 40 to 70% control of all Bitcoin hashrate. Incidentally, they are also launching denial of service attacks and advocating forking the protocol.
This insideous misfortune is probably the biggest black cloud hanging over the future success of the protocol. Because of these disastrous circumstances, and further evidence for them presented recently in the hard fork drama of recent years, many have wondered whether the system would be better served by a different POW system-- one which will be initially decentralized to a greater degree than the current SHA2 debacle.
Opponents of this position take a "devil you know" attitude and point to the magnitude of SHA2 hashrate as if it has some importance when said SHA2 is centralized, but the reality is, if SHA2 hashrate is centralized, it is completely useless. 
The mists of uncertainty have plagued the successful proclamation beyond any doubt that the degree of centralization is as bad as many have estimated, and until now (in the era of Segwit Embargo, ASICBOOST, SW2X attack, and whatever comes next) the system didn't _appear_ to suffer from weird artifacts of centralized hashrate coordination. These recent times have revealed chinks in the armor of deniability malicious actors once had while plotting the eventual destruction of the network...

They would be equally "not Bitcoin" in the purest sense. I agree.
However, the POW HF-d core. POW switch being used as a response to an attack/hashrate collapse vs. a proactive protocol modification is the more desirable altcoin.
FWIW, I expect the original chain will be functional enough to survive the hashrate drop, and not require a POW switch. There may _also_ be a POW switch core coin-- which would be an interesting dynamic: I would hold my OG chain coins, the POW switch coins, and probably not hold the S2X coins.

First off, to think that the level of contention in _this case_ is as low as 5% is pretty daring. I would personally be very surprised if it was as high as 50%. That's 50% in terms of held coins and supported market value. 10-20% seems a more likely optimistic value. Particularly given the "success" of bcash.
Secondly, 5% is certainly a nontrivial degree of contention.

That's a good one! lots of creative attacks are possible. one category basically becomes a graph coloring problem, where we selectively propagate tx broadcasts to partitions of the network... Every block, we can spend out of every UTXO involved in the attack in each partition. The trick is identifying partitions, and then, crafting a double, or triple, or whatever-spend in every partition. We attack the node graph to create and identify partitions. Eventually they will circumvent network partitioning by introducing trusted nodes... or just connect straight to jihan... which would obviously be farcical. Messing with tx propagation is infinitely more profitable on 0-conf-deluded networks than on real blockchains. BCash security under 0-conf basically reduces to tx-propagation efficiency, which will be tested under a spam flood.

I would rather have had no 2x, no segwit than 2x+segwit, but I'm happy to have segwit without 2x, as I suspect many are.


Agreed. I think the best possible outcome is for NYA backers to see bcash as their prized hard fork, and support it if they continue to see fit, but now that the NYA has been completley actualized (we have a hard fork to larger blocksize _and_ segwit) the further obligation of the agreement is nil moving forward. Maybe all the signatories need to run bcash nodes... Maybe the miners need to mine one bcash block each.

Basically, miners have 10 minutes to mine the next block. If some % of that time is spent downloading and validating the last block (this is larger for larger blocks), the miner of the previous block gets the advantage because they don't need to download and validate it: they already have it. You can see how this is an advantage to miners who mine a larger % of blocks. A centralization feedback loop.

What I'm saying is that "normal" is normative. If people normally use a different transaction than p2pkh, that will become "normal".
I can't see any justification to protect any one kind of transaction type over another, particularly if we discover an alternative which can more efficiently produce the same result.
regarding extblocks, There are a lot of ways to make them work, and sort of lie on a continuum between sidechains and blocksize increase. I favor opt-in methods which look more like sidechains, but would require gateway transactions to allow old nodes to still validate transactions relevant to them, and ignore those with an input in an extblock...

1. There is no such thing as a "normal" transaction... It may be possible in the future to aggregate massive numbers of transactions using Schnorr in trustless coinjoin protocols... this would become the "normal" transaction since it could offer scaling proportional to the number of participants...
2. I disagree that LN and sidechains will be centralized, but let's not worry about that in this post.
3. Extblocks could be designed as opt-in, allowing those who don't wish to use them to opt-out. This could require gateway transactions...

This is a good point-- In some sense... it is a bit contrived to shoehorn a blockchain into every public-trust problem, and I am in no way denying that there might be other systems which can address the voting problem better than a Bitcoin-like blockchain... BUT that shouldn't stop us from examining the abilities of a well-known system, with a good security reputation to solve the same problem: If all you have is a hammer and everything looks like a nail, that shouldn't be a problem if you are trying to squash a bug... Everyone knows a hammer can squash a bug... and we've already got a hammer.
I believe the vote coercion problem is solvable: 
Miner censorship would be immediately visible, and would require cooperation between miners (or a weak node graph) to censor a broadcast transaction. if the election isn't one-sided, I imagine there would be people running fair nodes. If 51% of miners want to censor transactions, a) I would be surprised, and b) it would be obvious long before the actual election is counted.

This is my pet project. There are awesome, complex things we can do with blockchain voting, but perhaps we should first make the case for basic American-style voting that's so simple, anyone can understand it. 
1. We need to decide what politician from among a list of registered candidates will get the most votes.
2. We believe we can have somebody walk into a voting booth, and fill out a piece of paper, and put it in a box with minimal opportunity for fraud... (may or may not be true, but we already assume this) 
3. People send a Bitcoin transaction (value is irrelephant) to an address which a candidate has proven he/she holds the P.Key for... not even necessarily on election day...
4. On election day, voters go into the voting booth as usual... after having ensured via many confirmations that their transaction went to the right candidate... they drop a piece of paper with the address they sent the vote from in the ballot box.
5. To count the votes, we ignore all incoming transactions to the outcome addresses EXCEPT the ones from addresses written on paper, and dropped in the ballot box.
If you are worried about people selling votes, we can discuss that separately, I believe the problem can be circumvented.
We can do way cooler stuff than this (like delegation voting), but people will know how their votes were counted... the election judges can publish the lists of addresses which voted for which candidates since the address-voter connection is anon. to attack this voting system is to attack the blockchain, or falsify dropping pieces of paper in a box (a vulnerability already inherent in the current system).
@_date: 2015-08-06 22:29:48

So if "people" wanted to raise Bitcoin's total issuance to 42M, that would be consensus?
Consensus is determined between nodes and miners in accordance with the protocol. The ability to drive out competing consensus mutations is a defining feature for a cryptocurrency. A test Bitcoin has been passing with flying colors lately. 
Cryptos are not democracies, so consensus may mean something different from what you think it does in this context.
At any rate, semantics aside, in Ethereum, Code is not law. I don't want a bunch of whining ninnies to be able to change my protocol just because they were too stupid to understand the contracts they sent money to. Hence, Ethereum is not my protocol. Bitcoin is.
I am interested in the protocol that is most difficult for "people" to change. Today, that's Bitcoin.
Full disclosure: I lost money in the DAO-- I just didn't want it back at the expense of the legitimacy of Ethereum.

Although much better than similar proposals, I don't think this is the way to go. I would much rather see a solid ext blocks proposal, or at least some serious conversation on the matter. If half as much effort went in to designing a good extblock scheme as went into bickering about the existence, adjustment, or removal of the block size consensus parameter, I'm sure we could have some great ideas on the table in no time.
I believe it's possible to have unbound ext block size for opt-in participants at tiered opt-in levels for node operators with varying bandwidth capabilities at the expense of gateway transactions between bandwidth tiers, provided there is overlap in adjacent layer compatibility. And I think this is possible with a soft fork from the perspective of opt-out nodes, and an auxiliary datastructure for opt-in nodes.

The idea to mitigate buying votes is related to giving the voter a way to plausibly claim a different vote as theirs.
I agree that buying votes, and providing the "buyer" proof that you voted as they require is the biggest apparent weakness of public-ledger voting-- however, I claim there are ways to allow plausible deniability... or plausible claim to... a vote which was not overtly counted... at least in the trivial case of single-outcome voting (*as opposed to more complex schemes such as delegation voting*) -- that is: When the votes are counted, the private keys of all voting addresses are revealed. That is: anyone can claim any vote as their own, since they can sign with the (now public) private key... as long as one person voted for the desired (by the coercer) address, a coerced voter can claim that vote as their own... thus providing plausible claim to have voted in the desired (by the coercer) direction, when. in reality, they voted in accordance to their own will. 
A small problem exists still since since the coercer can demand that the coerced voter must put the transaction into the blockchain at an afore-agreed-upon time... but this could be remedied by requiring that all voting occur within one block-period. *(this re-opens the hole related to people having plenty of time and confirmations to verify the blockchain properly registered their transaction... there is room for optimization, however, as long as someone makes a vote for each party at least once-per-block, this might not be a problem...)

I'd like to model this as a 1:1 pegged sidechain which has big blocks... any reasons this is an inaccurate way to think about it? This would seem to be the sort of thing _segwit_ would enable?

@_date: 2016-02-08 23:45:30
I see where you are coming from--
If we can multiply the benefits built on top of bitcoin by amblifying the root of the network's capacity, we should be able to multiply the utility of the network by whatever that factor is.
I differ though, I think if we can invent exponential scaling solutions on top of Bitcoin, linear multipliers on top of that exponential technology are kind of irrelevant.
If we find a way to make hierarchical blockchains, which share a root in Bitcoin-root, we will be adding some serious exponential value.
I think the capabilities of soft-forkable sidechains already allow this... We are just in the very early days: we haven't really needed those sorts of things before.
I'd rather build scalability that way because I think messing with the core of the protocol endangers the entire system built on top of it... most of which doesn't exist yet, admittedly. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:55:06
So, it must not have a better value proposition then. Seems simple. Maybe you just needed to wait until bitcoin's "blocks are full" for people to flock to the 2mb coin? surely, the early adopters would be well-rewarded when the masses flock from the 1mb coin to the 2mb coin with higher tps?
If you are worried about hashrate attacks, you could choose a different POW algorithm?

IMHO, not as undesirable as a fork-prone Bitcoin.
300K TPday is perfectly-well suited for value store and settlements.
Bitcoin's uncensorability, stability, scripting capabilities and usability as financial glue make it far more valuable than it could ever be as a mere payment network. We are having growing pains-- Layer 2 isn't ready yet-- we have grown too fast-- (shouldn't be a bad thing unless it causes us to miss the forest for the trees) It's nice that there is demand for cool new features like LN-- and this certainly helps them get built.
IMHO a fork for 2mb blocks is a better consensus attack than it is a scalability solution.
@_date: 2016-02-08 05:02:13
The good thing about a soft-fork scaling solution like Segwit is that there is no catastrophic economic event, or ambiguity about what chain coins are being sent to/ tainted on. We can roll back completely from such an experiment with nobody getting stuck on "the wrong chain"-- whichever that might be... Adoption can happen gradually with no ill consequences. 
You have a point about running a node and not being able to fully parse all of the data as a fully-implemented node would in it's blockchain, but the blocks you create and relay are still a-ok and you're always in synch with the right blockchain... That's the awesome thing about soft-forks: if a subset of nodes want to have their own intra-protcol, they can do so without upsetting the rest of the network. People can join them if they want.
I think Segwit will provide us the transaction rate bump we need to see us through to when the next layer is ready. Just as well as a hard fork to 2mb would, in fact, with far less risk. I am also confident that it will be ready in time for the transaction rate pinch.
The next layers are a bit farther out, but segwit gets us there just as well as 2mb... using both together (hard forking 2mb after hitting the ceiling again some time after deploying segwit) would be a last-case emergency solution to a really-delayed payments layer, but I think it has to be segwit first: it's less trauma to the network. All the disadvantages (besides soft forks being confusing and "messy" as you claim) are shared between soft forks and hard forks. Hard forks have some that soft forks don't...

Except high fees only, maybe, hypothetically _slow_ further growth. In a world where growth slows, the worst-case scenario, the existence of Bitcoin is in no peril.

@_date: 2016-02-08 04:04:37
I respectfully disagree with most of your points, and I expect there will be little common ground... 
But I want to help, so let's discuss.


So when Classic inevitably dies, will we get a 4mb Bitcoin which provides identical security, and is "obviously" superior from a tx bandwidth perspective than a 2mb coin?  What ever happened to XT anyway? 


Regardless of what the original intentions of cryptos were-- they can be an excellent store of value. Superior in some ways to precious metals. Only one of those ways is rarity. I hope we agree that in terms of being future-proof, cryptos are superior compared to metals in the rarity department... Arguably they are inferior to metals in the "zombie apocalypse" future when the internet dies and we can no longer relay large amounts of data *cough cough* over the internet...
In terms of storage? Cryptos beat metals again as a *store* of value! Would you feel more secure with a billion in gold in your basement, or a brainwallet with a billion? Transportability? same story. Maybe Bitcoin is too slow to buy everybody's coffee, (Classic won't fix that either, btw, for more than a year or so) but it _is_ way faster than getting a forklift and a bunch of armed guards to move your gold around.
We don't cripple Bitcoin in any significant way as a value store by observing that a single-tier Bitcoin has a finite transaction rate.
What _would_ cripple Bitcoin as a value store? Messing with consensus, for one thing. That would do it for me. I contend that a hard fork here a) negatively affects value storage utility of _all_ cryptos (including Bitcoin's forked-successor), not just Bitcoin (for reasons we could get into if you want) and b) does not actually provide any sustainable scalability apart from a one-time boost to allow more zero-fee spam.
As I'm sure you can tell by now, I'm pro scaling bitcoin via soft-fork and _very_ pro scaling bitcoin as the "internet of money" by building pegged sidechains and other systems on top of bitcoin-- which will always provide the "gold standard" as it were to other cryptos, who are free to implement whatever transaction-accelerating features they wish.


Bitcoin isn't failing. We are discovering and affirming its merits and discovering that it has some limitations which are inherent with this blockchain POW architecture, not the blocksize. I contend that while some may be disappointed in the inevitable failure of blocksize forks, we will discover Bitcoin has something far more valuable than a wee boost in tx rate: _fork resistance_ 
I am not intimidated whatsoever by other altcoins-- and hold several myself because I feel they will be found to have some utility apart from what Bitcoin offers as a store of value, like better privacy, or transaction rate... But I'm not worried that Bitcoin is about to be dethroned any time soon in terms of market cap... Unless it has a hard fork, which would call into question, for me, it's primary utility.


Really, no need to apologize. I'm here to help!
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:34:34

Basically, consider many nearly-bitcoin-identical sidechains with no coinbase, obviously-- token creation comes from Main chain-- but there are transaction fees for the sidechain miners.
If Alice wants to send Bob a Coin, they have the option of settling on main-chain if they need really high-security, or their shared pegged sidechain if it's a low-value transaction and they aren't quite as worried about miner attacks.
If Alice and Bob don't both want to settle on a given sidechain, they have the option of settling on the parent chain instead.
In the simple case, there is only the sidechain and Bitcoin-- but there is no reason the hierarchy can't be deeper. They need to find the lowest common denominator they are willing to settle on. (optimal security vs fee tradeoff)
I can envision that: companies have their internal hchains for internal use. There is a B2B layer above this: there is a national, or regional-centric chain above this... and bitcoin above this. All tokens are Bitcoins via pegs or pegs of pegs, but a lot of settlement happens in the child-chains. 
Ideally, the bitcoin-like sidechain protocol can negotiate this automatically, but I'm not sure if any technology exists presently to securely automate chain escalation. (Bob and alice live in different regions, and maybe they don't trust each-other's local chains-- they should be able to settle on their common parent transparently. probably for a slightly larger fee...)
I think hierarchical solutions naturally lend themselves to scaling. Especially when you realize that different transactions have different security needs and risk profiles. A unifying protocol which encapsulates this hierarchy would be really neat, and almost seems possible given vetted sidechain concepts. Again, I'm not sure the chain escalation is possible with known technology.
Admittedly, this bears nontrivial resemblance to LN. Clearly flatcoins are inefficient-- hierarchical solutions offer lots of promise.

Nobody is limiting the transaction space though-- it is already set. By your logic, you could argue that anybody who isn't actively lobbying for some or another fork is attacking the use case the hypothetical fork would support... by doing nothing.
Blockstream is trying to build on top of Bitcoin and is not arguing for any fork. That's what we all should be doing.
Fork proposals are very killable: no contentious fork has ever been adopted. non-contentious, to me, means bitcoin would be completely broken without it and there would be no need to argue about it. In fact, I have argued this is a good thing. This time, you seem to support the fork, next time you may not. Be happy the protocol is stable instead of sad that its a bit inflexible. It makes the game way more fun when you don't always have to argue about the rules.
Regarding your last point: I don't think you can argue that Blockstreeam is shaping the protocol at all. they have soft-fork improvements which help their ecosystem, true, but we could ignore all of those if we wanted to and still use Bitcoin as before. I'll start getting mad when core tries to fork the protocol for fancier segwit or a 2mb appeasement or the like. Luckily, I think they would fail to activate it as other forks have failed.

I would love to be the one to save the day with the synergy-creating sidechain solution... but I'm afraid when it comes to cryptography haxx0r skills, I'm at the shallow end of the dream pool.
I did just build this super sweet blockchain-backed revocable voting system though. some lot of good that will be once we fork away from the assumptions it's based on :(
In the end, I mostly believe in the roadmap set forth by by core... Without hard forks... I'm not sure where we are on that today...
But if the miners want to throw the baby and it's bathwater... or however the analogy goes... I'm just a spectator.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:54:35
Bigger blocks wouldn't necessarily hurt settlements, but does represent a change to the protocol to benefit a subset of users... which is why changing is the skew. Not changing anything doesn't change anything (lol) and can't skew anything since nothing changes... the protocol has benefits for certain use-cases, not all use-cases.
Trying to make it fit new use cases is the skew, and I argue (some disagree), should be the purview of the alts.


The reason they are shutting down in this hypothetical situation is because it may not be profitable to run huge hashrate to collect a few BTC in fees when the blockreward gets too small to subsidize insane hasrate. Another miner buying the rigs and running them doesn't change this.
Ideally, I'm sure we agree, the value of BTC continues to rise, and the hashrate can always rise in kind because the miners will be able to subsidize the hashrate with ever smaller block rewards and more-valuable fee bounties with a more valuable bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:41:23
The reason we need forks is to change the protocol when it would break down and die without a fork. (eg. sha256 is broken, or a bug allows the network to accidentally fork...)
That is _not_ the case with the blocksize debate:
some _feel_ they _think_ that bitcoin _should_ have bigger blocks/more coins/ faster blocktime... whatever... but Bitcoin will work fine without their new _feature_... so the original chain will not self-destruct in the absence of a fork... the two would co-exist, and in all likelihood, economic turmoil would result-- harming both sides of the "fork".

It _is_ decentralized... much moreso than other payment processors we have today... and if you really dont like it for some reason, use the main chain.

Not all transactions will be included in all blocks on both chains. A transaction could be included by miners on either chain as long as its inputs are valid...
Once it diverges, it would seem there is a chance it will be valid on one blockchain, not the other. You tumble until this happens.
that is, it is possible for a subset of transactions to be included on both chains, yes. If miners on both chains propagate the exact same transactions, use the exact same outputs as inputs, and output to the new addr, we have mirror coins on both networks. If I "sell" a mirror coin, it could be sold on either network and there is no guarantee of selling only the 2mb coin. However, when miners pick up the transaction on one chain and not the other... (for instance, by broadcasting it only to one sort of node, or just waiting for them to stochastically diverge, or perhaps by using a low fee) you can break the symmetry.
What am I missing here?

Supporters of Classic/XT are pretty much the same people.
_sooo_ if there ever is a 2+mb altcoin, it will probably be one or the other or some other old shit new bowl altcoin.
In reality, while 2mb has some level of support, there will probably not be a fork anytime soon, despite the aggressive ~~propaganda~~ PR campaign. 
At the current rate of growth, planned soft fork improvements will probably stave off attacks and new technology will take it from there. In the event of an emergency, the reference implementation is planning it's own fork... But I think the odds of it (like other 2mb forks) getting activated are slim.
There is still nothing stopping other altcoins from supporting whatever cryptocurrency they want, and if miners want to switch from Bitcoin to some other coin with 2mb blocks-- there is nothing stopping them. The only problem Bitcoin would face would be a large drop in hashing power, taking the difficulty a while to compensate.
In the apocalyptic world where _both_ XT and Classic get any meaningful support, I'm getting out of cryptos, so who cares. lol.

There is real scarcity on the ability of the network to relay and process transactions. The 1mb magic number may seem arbitrary, but so are other numbers in the protocol. We set the bandwidth requirements on the network to what many now seem to consider "artificially conservative"... but there needs to be a limit or else only high-resource nodes will be able to contribute... leading, as discussed ad nauseam... to centralization. Could we handle 2mb blocks? maybe... but a flex cap would be folly. The protocol is set in stone partially to prevent politicizing the magic numbers. As is happening now... to the detriment of the protocol IMHO.

building off-chain layers-- aka building complexity on top of immutable laws-- is THE ONLY WAY to actually scale bitcoin.
Consensus crisis aside, we _might)_ be able to support 2mb blocks, so we can double (almost) scale once... after that, what do we do when we get more users? double the blocksize again? Ideally, we are scaling our users faster than the bandwidth bit-velocity is scaling... so bloating the blocksize will never be a solution.
Get some insight into the network effect and complexity of scale, and you will see LN and the like are technological necessity, not some scary conspiracy. Just because Blockstream can see that a bitcoin with higher layers is more valuable than a flat Bitcoin... and that scaling without breaking consensus is preferable to breaking consensus to implement short-sighted band-aid fixes... and plan to find a way to improve bitcoin _and_ make money doesn't make them bad guys.
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:28:03
If the coins are included in a transaction in a 2mb blockchain, they are 2mb outputs. I tumble to myself until they are tainted, then sell them. Its not a doublespend on the new network, and I get to keep them on the old network.

I consider fork-resistance to be of higher importance than transaction rate and payment network utility. Some disagree. I don't really care what they do, I'll vote with my funds. It's really sad to see the former strongest crypto failing like this. (it's not over yet, though-- if we resist, I'll consider it bullish) If they fork the protocol to pander to some use case or another, I'm out: Bitcoin is broken in that scenario. There just aren't a lot of other places to go: Bitcoin has obviously had the longest history of no unnecessary forks... if it breaks, I consider LTC to be broken too since the mining works the same, and I essentially consider this a 51% attack (forget 75, that's just nice words)... I've never been a fan of ETH's mining profile.
I don't really care at all about what Gavin says: he has no more sway than anybody else on what happens to the protocol-- This being said, my opinion of him used to be high. I used to consider him an asset to the project. Now I consider him somewhat harmful because he keeps on reopening this issue and rubbing lime juice in it. Harming the community. The best thing for the community, in my opinion, is to move on from this: but Gavin _really_ can't seem to accept that. Beginners like to listen to him, so here we are.

It would seem to me that from a technical standpoint, the difference between 1mb and 2mb blocks is trivial in the context of the best Bitcoin(TM)'s long-term growth goals... Sure, we'd all like a little wiggle room in the blocks... but that extra megabyte is going to get eaten up fast if there's no fee pressure keeping it open.
From a philosophical standpoint, a hardfork is a break in consensus which should be avoided at all costs. Consensus it the only reason Bitcoin matters, and is the only reason it has value. I think the philosophical importance of this premise is subtle, and often overlooked, but I feel it has serious implications for the utility of cryptocurrencies... in a larger sense than Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is the testbed obviously.
If nobody has articulated this to you before, or recently, I'll be the first-- or recentest (-:. I don't think there _can_ be a successful hard fork for scalability or new features as long as Bitcoin works. I don't think it's as rare of as a position as you might think.
That the question about "new feature" hard forks is _when_ rather than _if_ is still far from uncontroversial... Despite what the discourse may seem to be on Reddit... Which is why I asked specifically about how you are polling the community. 
The technical aspect is obvious: The only opinion that counts is miners' -- though miners seem to think public perception, even in the absence of technical or philosophical justification to some extent, is important. Obviously because of the impact of the public perception on price. A nontechnical detail which is all too important to miners who must live in the world of economic reality.
This leaves us with an unfortunate situation: the technical governance of Bitcoin is going to be decided, by miners, based on _perceived_ economic outcomes.
That's the crux of the biscuit, and where we would seem to be today.
I would love to have a technical discussion to vet this out, but it seems the exact intersection between technology and the economics of the system is somewhat difficult to identify.
I still think a futures market with support for trading different possible forks would be a good place to start to refine this decision making process... To reduce risk to miners, but that's not the answer either of us want: we want to answer a question like: what will make the best final-state Bitcoin? How do we design the perfect system? We are engineers, not economists. Unfortunately, I feel there is no disentangling these needs in a system like Bitcoin.
We are in somewhat uncharted waters and regrettably they are infested with shrieking economic eels.

Isn't it neat that we have a financial fabric on which we can build all manner of complexity?
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:54:05
I'm not saying we can't try to fork away from it... that's how the limit was introduced in the first place... It's just that it is really unlikely. It was easy for satoshi to fork away from 32mb because there were very few users and mining was centralized by satoshi. Now, the landscape is really different. I argue that the costs of forking outweigh the benefits of a block-size increase... especially since bigger blocks aren't really a long-term solution. That's why the network doesn't support the fork.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:55:32
The point is that if they can avoid getting real solutions deployed, _and_ break consensus at the same time, it's a double victory.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:05:36
I'm just not there yet: I think the utility of Bitcoin will prevail. Is there another crypto which actually appears to avoid the problems we have seen in Bitcoin? Or, if it fails here, is it game over for cryptocurrency? Miner centralization, in the end, I feel is the root of problems like we are seeing today. 
Until I find a crypto which is undeniably superior, I will stay in Bitcoin... if it forks, I will sell the fork and keep my Bitcoins, even if the true-chain hashrate declines.

@_date: 2016-02-08 16:53:33
Some miners have supported a fork to 2mb blocks without explicitly backing Classic. Recall that some miners also supported XT.
(I think the economics of a fork hurt miners a lot though, so I expect it's actually a lot of hot air to put pressure on the developers and speed the creation of better features on Bitcoin)
Classic has node code out, and it's adoption is looking a lot like XT. Fast in the beginning, but no sustainable growth.
I think this will all have blown over in a month or so.
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:15:08
When we implement a transaction rate increase via a softfork like Segwit, we will be buying the same ammount of time as we would have bought with Classic:
Both Classic and Segwit seek to put a band-aid on the transaction rate problem until we can build higher layers on top of Bitcoin which will support many, many more transactions per second. Segwit is a soft fork which carries far less economic risk to the network: there are people who disagree with this, that the hard fork carries a lot of economic risk-- but I think they are misunderstanding what actually happens in a fork. It seems to me, and a lot of other long-time Bitcoiners (with a few notable exceptions such as Hearn and Andresen) that the soft fork is the preferable way to band-aid scale with fewer hazards to the network. The added benefit is that Segwit improves bitcoin in ways which will make it easier to implement new features in the future.
If we run out of space _again_, after implementing Classic or Segwit, it is true that both can be run at the same time... that is, 2mb blocks+segwit, to get another one-time boost in tx-rate which seems quite similar philosophically to one or the other to me. Hopefully we will have real solutions by then which will help us scale exponentially, and we won't need to keep monkeypatching the blocksize/ transaction cram problem: there will be a better way.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:27:05
In a multi-billion dollar system, stability is a good thing. new cryptos exist to build on the theory and knowledge gained from Bitcoin. They offer new features. ETH and BTC serve different purposes and ETH has a lot more fancy features. What Bitcoin is good at is being stable and secure, and you don't need a ton of constant upgrades to make that happen.

keeping it low doesn't skew anything: That's how it already is. Enlarging blocksize skews utility towards a payment network.
I think as the block reward decreases, miners will shut down and the difficulty will drop. Eventually, there will be equilibrium... Fees probably won't ever be 25 per block total...
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:57:20
Yes, if you can get your coins tainted on the fork-block, you can spend them (if anyone will accept them) or trade them for some untainted coins if you can find a counterparty.
These transfers will not exist on the main block, so your coins never moved in the eyes of the original network. I think it's unlikely you will get to buy whole untainted coins with tainted coins though... the exchange rate will be less than 1:1.

Truth is: we don't need it yet, so it's worth it do do a lot of testing and maybe be a bit more academic with it's development to make sure it is really great before rolling it out.
We'll get segwit which will keep things rosy for a while (just like 2mb blocks would have, but with lower risk (discussed ad-nauseam, so let's skip it here))-- hopefully, by the time small-value-tx merchants and other small-value tx users get squeezed, we'll have enough confidence in LN to release it and spearhead integration.

Thank goodness for sanity. I was starting to think we had all gone off the deep end.

neat. I use Bitcoin primarily as a value store and can see that it is not designed as a payment network. When people get better ideas of which cryptos suit their needs best, I'd encourage folks to adopt them.
As far as it's utility as a value store, I think if a bunch of people who were just in it for the payment network leave, that could put price down a bit short term, but I think longterm, as long as Bitcoin exists, it will be a good value store.

They're different use-cases is my point: ETH is the one trying to provide all kinds of shiny complexity. For some applications it will be better than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin needs to stick to its guns: it will never be everything to everyone, but what it does, it does very well. However, if other coins have better value propositions, people should use them.
I don't feel threatened as a Bitcoiner by ETH: I don't think it could be as good a store of value-- particularly with its mining/ POS profile. It was designed more like a consumable, for-pay service IMHO. I will be happy when there is programatic liquidity between BTC and ETH-- but this might be unlikely unless an ETH clone is deployed as a sidechain...
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:13:25
Your second point is more-or-less where I see the best-possible future.
My case against the hard fork is philosophical and economic: You can't break consensus in cryptocurrency. Moreover, if you undermine the philosophy which underpins the value of the parent chain, the child-chain is doomed.
I feel no need to convince the hard-fork group for the sake of the _technology_: their position is philosophically flawed, and undermines the philosophical root of it's own project. I do however, attempt to advise them to prevent economic catastrophe in the cryptosphere. Already, this infighting is hurting the public perception of bitcoin, and hurting a lot of well-intentioned small-time investors in the process.
Worse yet, it is distracting the discussion away from more productive solutions like you discuss in your second point.
The point is:
Sidechains create mutual benefit and synergy, while hard forks cause harm to the consensus assumptions which underly the entire system, harm to the overall security of both sides of the fork, and engender division in the community.

There's no guarantee that a better crypto won't come along: and if it does, I hope it gets used more if it is truly significantly better.
This being said, I think the odds are that bitcoin remains the dominant bottom layer. It's strength and long-running history of stability will make other projects want to ally with Bitcoin instead of fight it. The economics of mining and equitable token distribution alone give Bitcoin a huge advantage. To tie things back to the present concern about blocksize: I think fork-resistance is a feature of the low-speed, high-value, high-security network-- while high transaction bandwidth is a feature of a spare-change-coin or sidechain. We shouldn't sacrifice the former to get better at the latter. 
I think LN is awesome, though I don't think it will be the final word in layer-2 development. I can't wait for the day cross-pegged-chain liquidity becomes effortless: then we will see the promise of rapid crypto development come to full fruition. People will be able to create any altcoin they can dream of without positioning themselves against Bitcoin: if people want to use that alt, they do so via Bitcoin-- and user's don't have to worry about a new premine scheme, weird token-distribution among early investors, etc... (any more than they worry about those things in Bitcoin) Bitcoin, in turn, will welcome these sidechain alts: If they are awesome, both Bitcoin and the alt users/miners will benefit. Synergy beats fighting any day-- and I think the community will be a better place once we figure this out.

It will be the same as any other pair of cryptocurrencies. If a lot of mining power jumps to the fork, it might take the difficulty on the smaller chain a while to adjust, but there is no technical reason the chains can't coexist. 
For the parent chain, it would just look like a bunch of miners switched off.

When fees actually are prohibitively expensive for transactions of a dollar or greater, we will have much higher adoption than we do today. 
That there is a cap on transaction rate is not in any way _artificial_. There is a real limitation in the abilities of networks to relay data. Many are arguing about how much data networks can be expected to relay, but nobody who knows anything would tell you that bitcoin will ever be able to relay arbitrarily many transactions with its current network topology. a fee market on the main chain is an inevitability regardless of blocksize, and it's a good thing: node bandwidth is a scarce resource.
We will eventually get micropayment networks which build hierarchically on top of bitcoin, but the _main network_ has limitations in its structure which give it great security, but limited transaction rate. It's a known tradeoff.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:07:36
Trustnets aren't necessarily vulnerable to sybil: You just don't inherit trust from other/unknown parts of the network: I.e. you seed the trustnet at trusted nodes only: non-trusted actors spinning up sybil graphs never get propagated into...

Yeah-- a lot of the present turmoil could be explained by people being too afraid to diversify.

A lot of the people whining about transaction fees and blocktimes would have a lot better time if they got into LTC, for instance. Bitcoin is what it is... if they want something else, they should invest. I also am closely watching XRM since it offers privacy currently lacking in Bitcoin... different coins... different use-cases. Bitcoin is Gold unless we fork it.

seems like the bad-luck streak subtends most of the worry time.
On the contrary, I sent a tx this morning with standard fees just to test the network when people were crying about load and it went through fine. So I guess I refuted your anecdote?
Seriously though, we both know neither of our experiences mean much: the stats and network averages are what describe the majority of user experience.
I know it's bad when miners get unlucky and NO TRANSACTIONS get confirmed for a while, and this is bad for Bitcoin's image as a high-speed payment network: I get it... but the point is, things are still about normal for most users most of the time and all the current catastrophizing is mostly unfounded.

Isn't this what you meant? Did you mean something else here?
I know when my transactions are delayed, it's usually because there is a high-ish block finding time... a whole hour is longer than I have ever had to wait for a block to be mined though. I think the longest I have ever waited is like 30 min. I do blockchain research and have made lots of transactions...
The point that I was trying to make above, though, is that even though there are outliers... people who sometimes need to wait an hour or two (as in your case)... this is definitely NOT the normal user experience-- as shown by the network stats.
I'm also glad we're making progress as a community. It's slow-- It's painful... but in the end, Bitcoin will be stronger for it.

I, on the other hand, think Bitcoin will find its place as the highest-security, slightly slower, large-value-transaction settling network-- even if that means it is not-well-suited for low-value, high-speed, low-fee txs. I think we need to accept that weakness, embrace the strengths, and move forward in creating a bunch of awesome cryptocurrencies which ideally cooperate with one-another, finding complimentary use-cases. I'm really stoked for the day when it's really easy to create a pegged sidechain on Bitcoin to implement a new feature, but without creating new tokens: I think this will usher in a new age of synergy in the cryptosphere.

Me too, but its hard when there is a coordinated team peddling misinformation to people who haven't had time to become experts yet.

Ideally, yes, we would operate at highest safe bandwidth.
Ideally we don't fork frivolously
I argue the second is more important.
Though we might not be _at_ the max, we may well be near it. What if the max bandwidth was 1.1mb? would we still want a fork? Is 2mb really that great?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:44:30
It's true that bitcoin fees are not dependent on transaction worth. This means that smaller transactions will have to pay, on average, higher fees in terms of percentage. This also means that you can send large transaction worth for absurdly small fees by %.
This dichotomy is built into the fabric of Bitcoin, and it may well be the case that some use-cases are ill-matched for the utility of Bitcoin (hypothetical block-size increased coins not withstanding).
The good news is that with a financial glue like Bitcoin, simpler systems can leverage the security of the blockchain while providing much smaller tx fees (and higher tx rate...)

@_date: 2016-02-26 20:54:01
I don't think we should kick anything. I welcome payment systems that inter-operate with bitcoin, but I'm not willing to sacrifice consensus to coddle them into existence. I think Bitcoin could be quite successful without being a payment network, but like I said, it would be a "nice to have", not a necessity. The good news is, with a cornerstone like bitcoin, a trustworthy foundation, we can build lots of amazing things. Again, I don't think we need a fork to do it: there are lots of things I could brainstorm which would be nice to fork for-- things far more important and useful than main-chain txrate boosts... But I fundamentally oppose that approach. I think the protocol, as it exists, already provides plenty of flexibility to GeT cReAtIvE!!
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:45:36
A fork and an abandonment of the old chain is by definition the destruction of Bitcoin, and the creation and adoption of Classiccoin. That's what a hard fork is.

zero-fee transactions can still theoretically get through if miners want to include them. Zero-fee transactions were possible because the network was under very low load and historically, miners have been more interested in the block reward than transaction fees. This is changing unsurprisingly, as the block reward gets smaller and the network load increases. Miners can choose to include whatever transactions they want: but there is very little incentive for them to include zero-fees. It so happens that the default client has a selection algorithm which assumes miners don't want to mine spam transactions.
I see what you are saying about social justice and all, but miners are assumed to act in self-interest and always have been. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:30:05
This is correct. Bitcoin is what it is-- and value will be built on top. Breaking Bitcoin to fit in a few more transactions is antithetical to the project.

Blockstream isn't the entity pushing for a fork. I don't know why ~~everyone~~ a noisy minority always accuses them of trying to capture the protocol.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:25:24
The point is that it doesn't really matter what Blockstream wants as long as they don't break the protocol. I am all for them making products on top of the protocol as it exists. I will revoke my ambivalence towards them when they start trying to materially change the consensus for their own ends, but as far as I can see, today, all they do is make a popular client implementation and related products with extra features. 
I think it's ironic that some are claiming that we should fork to stop unwanted influence from blockstream-- when a "forkier" environment clearly favors those trying to grab influence. I would be a lot more afraid of entities like Blockstream if I thought they would be able to fork the protocol.

Bitcoin was made to be Bitcoin, no more, no less... it is still revealing to us what its greatest strengths and weaknesses are. I'm not a cult of Satoshi member... so I think the text of the whitepaper is of secondary importance... what matters is the protocol, and that's not really open to interpretation.
The fact that people have found Bitcoin useful for certain things including payment networks, op_return notarization, public messaging etc. is awesome-- but they used it for those things because it was good for those things at the time.  
DOS attack vectors haven't gone away. In retrospect, maybe satoshi should have left it at 32mb? who knows... but he forked it when he was doing almost all of the mining and we're all on that chain now. Now mining is somewhat decentralized and users are signing up for the social contract expressed in the protocol when the acquire Bitcoin. We can try to fork the protocol (I personally think it's a bad idea) but it's going to be a lot more disruptive than when satoshi did it (he was most of the users-- the only one? I'm a little hazy on the timeline to be honest... those were primordial times.) because there are far more parties involved.

I completely agree-- The current phenomenon in the Bitcoin space is detrimental in many ways.
I'm not sure I see a good path towards developing/defining a well-defined process as you suggest. I sure don't think the current attempted methods are helping in any way right now. My solution is, in lieu of a good way to change them: don't change them... but I know there are many who disagree with this.
Bitcoin is fork-resistant, and I think that's a good thing even though it means we won't have all the shiny new features we can think of built directly into the protocol... I'm optimistic for sidechains for this, but that's another discussion entirely. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:27:37
Dogecoin obviously. Very forks. Wow.
Seriously, though. Let the ecosystem evolve within its rules. If there is actually a crisis, the fork will happen. If there's not, it won't. There is no crisis immediately, and segwit buys a lot of time.
I predict we will find ways to a) fit all nonspam transactions in blocks for the foreseeable future. b) Develop, in time, scaling solutions which go around the bottleneck that all transactions in the world need to get packed into one block every 10 minutes. 
There is no blocksize which is going to make bitcoin scale like we all want it to-- so we will need a real solution sooner or later... might as well start building it now.

You are mistaken if you think there is no limit on network bandwidth besides an "artificial constant"
It's true that there was never any pressure on the network before, but the fact that this emergent property of the network didn't always exist doesn't make the phenomenon unnatural.
We can argue 1mb/2mb blocks... whatever... but we will NEVER support 1gb blocks. When exactly do we hit the limit? When does the network breakdown?
I'd rather hedge on fixing our scalability problems without waiting for the actual transport layer of the network to break down-- that would be a very sad day.

When you transfer fees on an exchange:
a) you need to trust the exchange to not steal your funds
b) you usually need to pay (sidechains probably wont be totally free though)
c) you need to mess with an exchange/ deal with spreads and liquidity
d) the whole affair won't happen as cleanly as sending a single transaction (some exchanges are making this easier, but you pay for it)
The biggest difference is that you are subjecting yourself to the market forces of a completely different currency when you do this... Also, you are taking away from one crypto's market cap and adding to another's... in a sidechain alt, the value stays in bitcoin, to create synergy... that is: you can't lose or gain bitcoins simply from transferring to and from a sidechain (besides the tx fees)... to hold the sidechain-alt means also holding bitcoins. instead of one or the other. But, you still get to use the features of the alt-sidechain, so the user benefits by being able to use the new features, the sidechain miners benefit because they will be able to participate in a lower-difficulty (maybe) mining operation and collect fees (probably no coinbase though), and everybody in bitcoin benefits, because the value in the ecosystem goes up: if the sidechain brings in new users or capital, it is necessarily bringing them to bitcoin too. Synergy can be a strong a force as competition, but the gains are mutual to all participants. 
What's your outlook on this?

It will be a cheaper and faster alternative to full-on-chain transactions and an ecosystem will spring up around it if there is need... For your use-case, large-value Internet purchases, there is little need for LN, even a MASSIVE fee in Bitcoin terms will be a small fraction of a percent for a purchase over $100 and instant confirmation doesn't matter much in your use case.
Short term, LN will be used experimentally for things like streaming, bandwidth purchase, maybe some third-party low-value bubblegum buyer applications like gift cards or buying your daily coffee when you're a regular at the coffee shop.

In a world of artificial scarcity, "planned caps" are part of the system... the free market works around these parameters-- in this case for priority of transacting in the next block.

There is already a fee market and it's silly to think of a zero-fee Bitcoin (spam anyone?).
So it's impossible for Bitcoin to exist without fees... a fee market is not some tack-on that people are suggesting as a mod to the protocol. It's emergent from the protocol itself. Fees are the grass that the horse eats while it pulls the cart.
LN will be a great thing when it comes out, but even then, it probably won't be the final word in neat layer 2 systems. Nobody with real use-cases is going to be priced out of Bitcoin in the next 6 months, esp. with segwit. The average fee is 1% today.
@_date: 2017-04-03 00:15:15
Bitcoin is over as soon as the protocol makes a "political compromise" 
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:13:58
It would take exactly twice as long to download or relay a block.
If you already have a bad connection, the effect will be amplified. If you are trying to mine, you are getting a late start to mining because you are seeing the old block later. Only miners with the fastest connections will have a fair starting point in the race to mine a block.
Nodes already transfer a lot of data. The rate of blockchain growth would double.
The REAL reasons 2mb blocks are unacceptable is:
The premise of breaking consensus-- hard-forking, to implement a "scaling solution" which doesn't scale... is self-contradictory- and bad policy. The fact that 2mb blocks are exactly where the network breaks down (in reality, only a partial breakdown) isn't the real reason, though the decentralization arguments are completely valid.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:31:08


Tell that to long-term holders who have, up to now, maintained an unshakable confidence in the protocol.
In the end, nothing is stopping miners from abandoning Bitcoin to mine another crypto, in the end, investors have the opportunity to choose a side.

It's the simplest in terms of being "easy for non-techies to understand"(TM) (and it's fewer lines of code, so I guess that counts for something now...) but in terms of economic and consensus risk-- in terms of sending the project and the wealth of thousands... hundreds of thousands by our best estimates into peril by creating an unnecessary consensus crisis and breaking backward compatibility, leaving people at risk of accepting forked coins... when we have a perfectly good opt-in, backwards compatible solution, and all likelihood of even better high-velocity payment layers in the future just seems to me to be... worse in every way.

@_date: 2016-02-26 21:27:25
I guess we are fundamentally opposed. There are a lot of disillusioned people around here who think they know this one weird trick to get their money back: get more adoption! NOW!!!
I think people overselling Bitcoin are doing more harm than good. I would have rather seen slow, steady growth... from investors who know what they're buying... than a bunch of sheep flocking into a system which has been falsely represented as a global payment network to replace credit cards or paypal: which it never was.
Let's be clear: Bitcoin's design clearly reflects its emphasis on security over its transaction rate scalability. There is NO WAY a system with a bottleneck like "all transactions in the world get put into one block every ten minutes" could ever be an ideal payment network. That system provides great security though. And, I have previously believed, allows a fork-resistant protocol. Which is THE most important thing when it comes to long-term trustworthiness, which is the most important thing when it comes to crating a long-term value store.
The fact that it is a cornerstone, and not an all-in one combination hookah and coffeemaker which also makes Julienne fries doesn't detract from its utility or desirability. I would rather have a modular system than one monolithic do-all. It's better for security, it's better for extensibility. 
p.s. If I could have my wishlist for forky features, though, I would like to make sidechains more "idiomatic" so to speak: I still think we will get great implementations without forking. 
You seem to be well-intentioned: I thank you for that, but we may be at an impasse.

Someday, there will be people arguing that deflation is a tyranny, and that Bitcoin's non-inflation is causing economic phenomena detrimental to some users. Perhaps someday the smallest divisible bitcoin denominations will price out some users who can't even afford one satoshi. Then we will have "common sense" arguments that we need to alter the protocol to "help Bitcoin grow"... or to aid these "vulnerable" users... The fact is: the protocol is what it is and if people think a different set of features would create a better cryptocurrency, they should go create one. If it is truly more valuable, the market will react in kind.

There will be 21M Bitcoin... we can do about 300k transactions per day. 
Do you really mean to suggest that roughly 1/60 of Bitcoin will be used in transaction fees everyday?
In reality, if transaction velocity is really a limiting factor for Bitcoin, it will be transacted less. Fees will reach equilibrium with demand to transact and Bitcoin's value will match the utility of the use cases the technology provides. Don't tell me you're a 2mb blocker too? one thing at a time.
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:20:01
My point is, that if you fork bitcoin, you create arbitrage opportunities between the two chains with unpredictable consequences. A lot of miners or merchants might get burned by economics even though the technological and idealogical questions might seem tractable. 
The economic complexities of the system still aren't fully understood, and they mostly weren't in the whitepaper: they are emergent.

A more-well though-out statement than I'm used to w.r.t. this topic-- thanks.
I would say that you have a great point about ETH, and I myself have started learning the ETH network and codebase because it clearly offers a significant upgrade of features on top of Bitcoin (better than 2mb blocks anyway)-- and as a Bitcoiner, this doesn't threaten me at all as I see the networks as having completely different purposes:
As investment continues to flow into cryptos, it's nice to have a bedrock like bitcoin-- in production for close to a decade-- resilient consensus... a small, easy to understand featureset... It's everything we need as a reserve crypto-currency in a world of diversified alts with neato features.
I think the future is definitely in the crypto economy, and Bitcoin is the lingua Franca. This is why I disagree with those who want to make Bitcoin the do-all... It's longevity and resilient consensus alone are reasons to believe in it even if it doesn't have _this fee_ or _that transaction velocity_.
w.r.t. ETH, I am beginning to see it as a better swiss army knife than Bitcoin-- it's scripting complexity will make it far easier to build next-level networks on top of the system, like payment systems for instance.
Bitcoin users unaffected:
Bitcoin has something ethereum doesn't have: a history of consensus going all the way back to the genesis block, and widespread acceptance. Maybe, in the distant future, people will come to see eth as just as good of an investment vehicle, and Bitcoin as completely irrelevant since it's features are a subset of eth... which is fine... but no reason for us to start hacking more and more features on top of Bitcoin*. Bitcoin's core simplicity is an advantage here: less fancy features, less to go wrong, less chance of consensus failure, etc.
I think these two represent a yin and yang of crypto features which complement each other very well, and hopefully better someday in the future when we can establish some sort of pegged liquidity between the systems.
One thing I do know, though, is that ETH is the newfangled newcomer and BTC is the incumbent. There will be other cryptos trying to build this or that feature... maybe faster transactions per second or lower fees-- who cares... we already have LTC... but there will always be BTC as long as we don't ruin everything by breaking consensus.
I hear what you are saying about the Chinese miners... mining centralization is the largest problem facing Bitcoin in the long run, and wherever they are centralized and under potential state-sponsored duress, be it in China, the US or anywhere really, there is a real threat to the network, but the reason network centralization is a threat is because of the impact it has on the core consensus of the protocol. Breaking the trust of miners... implementing forks which target a specific mining community, like Chinese miners with bad internet connections for instance, is antithetical to Bitcoin if done for reasons to break miner centralization... The consensus is everything, and without it, (and the long history of reliability in production) there is _no reason_ to prefer Bitcoin over other alts with better features. (no, 2mb blocks aren't that great of a feature compared to what other alts offer)
Just a thought. I see the future in pegged sidechains, and I think we can get there without a fork. I like the features of eth, and would love to see non-exchange liquidity between BTC and ETH. I think that may be likely in the future, and ETH is going to be the network to implement it on imho... but the benefits will be synergistic. If we can maintain consensus, the future is bright.
*footnote-- I am all for hacking Bitcoin using soft forks: they don't affect consensus and build cool, useful... dare I say _neato_ things on top of or within the network using the flexibility found between the consensus-hardenened lines of the protocol.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:31:46

because they aren't PR experts. The devs who contribute to the incumbent consensus-bearing codebase are obviously not bad guys. this is slander.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:43:01


There are literally DOZENS of us!
The softforks are opt-in and don't break backward compatibility in the protocol. If lots of people want to use them, they can, but they don't have to. In a weird world, there could be multiple soft-forked bitcoin super systems operating on the same blockchain, and the existence of one doesn't interfere with the existence of the other. (not the case for hard-fork changes)
If we really want to fork, why not address a bigger problem, miner centralization? I think we'd agree that miner centralization is the elephant in the room and poses a far more prescient danger to Bitcoin than any of the probelms people seem forkably-concerned about today. Were you around for the ghash.io fiasco?
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:46:15
You raise a good point about the time it takes to synthesize a connection-- and how once established, a connection has a nonlinear bandwidth/time profile which tends to increase.


I've shouted myself blue in other threads trying to explain the complexities of the hard fork... and why ultimately, a hard fork for this reason (or any reason which is not an immediate, existential risk to the network) is a bad thing for Bitcoin-- even aside from the reasons it may be ultimately _impossible_... To answer your question, I don't think even a 99% consensus would be sufficient... not for my "preference", but for technical/economic reasons. The reason I oppose this so strongly publicly is that: when people get burned in cryptocurrencies, it is bad for everyone. I want people, especially beginners, to have a good experience in cryptos... But I feel many of these beginners are the ones jumping on the classic bandwagon-- ultimately leading themselves to slaughter-- economically...
Anecdotally, I have intermittently run a node, and on a modern cable connection, the bandwidth and disk footprint can absolutely be noticeable. The load bitcoind puts on a server is a bit surprising... even for 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:35:07
obviously, the truth will lie somewhere in between.
Asymptotically, the fees will reach equilibrium with the demand to transact on the network. If they are too high, people will use different systems. If they are low, spam will pack in.

thanks for the quick response...
I have been doing a bit or legwork here...
the $bitcoin -rescan doesn't help... and I think I know why...
(Beginner here FYI...)
aftr reviewing the blockchain via blockchain explorer, I see thatt there was a transaction involving all of the bitcoins to an address which isn't recognized in my wallet.dat (as evidenced by the transaction history appearing in the bitcoin GUI...).
I'm guessing I made that transaction after backing up my wallet.
(this was a long time ago and I have no recollection...)
The transaction was probably to myeself @ a different address, but it isn't in my backed up wallet.dat so I'm boned.
There is no mention of the "transferred to" adress in my logfile... but the bitcoins are still sitting at the address that they were sent to according to blockexplorer... This seems to be how we lose bitcoins.
I'm tacking this one up to experience... thankfully it was only ~10BTC purchased last spring when BTC was $14 per.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:48:11
I am not opposed to SegWit or other soft-fork-based improvements.
I am a firm believer that by nature, a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin _should_ be fork resistant. Unnecessary forks, such as one for a 2mb block size essentially falsify this conjecture: Bitcoin is _not_ fork resistant. (I know, actually, this remains to be seen) Posts enumerating the reasons why 2mb blocks are not necessary, and that the network will continue to function on 1mb blocks are common. I have made several, you have made several. 
A crypto which is not fork resistant in these unnecessary forking scenarios is not a well-conceived cryptocurrency. A crypto which is fork-prone is undeserving of economic confidence.
In the event that Bitcoin has some sort of liquidity crisis: (transactions being added to the mempool far faster than they are mined or prioritized by fee) could be a possible argument for ugly scaling solutions-- but I think we know this is pretty unlikely. Especially after Segwit capacity increases. I see Segwit as the bandaid well-intentioned people who want larger blocks actually want... We can continue long enough until real scaling solutions are found. I think you would find we are in a fair state of agreement w.r.t. how to accomplish this in the long run: LN, sidechains and hierarchical complexity. I think if Core can get these optimizations in place and usable in time: the clamor for a fork may subside-- that is _if_ the powers that are pushing for the fork are _really_ motivated by a capacity increase and are not somehow "out to get" Bitcoin.
 
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:19:00
I mean stability in the protocol. New features are fine... most core upgrades are in the scope of the wallet/client, and don't affect the protocol.
Malleability in the protocol undermines the assumption that Bitcoin will continue to play by the same rules in perpetuity, which I think, is crucial to its utility as a long-term investment.
I'm all for reading between the lines of the protocol as long as we don't change it-- and I don't think that undermines stability in the sense that I was invoking the term. Obviously, we want Bitcoin to be the bestBitcoin, which is why I supported segwit over a 2mb fork: it achieves a very similar end without requiring instability in the protocol. A key conjecture _I_ am closely watching in Beta is that the protocol is anti-fragile, stable, and resilient.
@_date: 2016-02-08 04:14:40


Technologically, Bitcoin will be fine regardless what some arbitrary percentage of miners do* (eg. mine Classiccoin on a separate chain)
If I were to worry about the non-conforming chain, Classic, I would find us in rather uncharted waters, and in the company of some rather sordid characters (remember all those successful hard forks in the alts?). A perilous economic situation for everyone who accepts forked coins. A perilous situation for a network which has never hard-forked without a good reason before.
edit: besides pull a 51% attack on Bitcoin... but I contend the economics of this are no different in the case of a fork than in ordinary cases...

The fork is a poison pill. If 2mb fails, we'll see propositions for 1.1mb. If bitcoin can only stand up to fork attacks for a year, what value could it possibly retain in the long-term?
I don't think there is any impediment to bitcoin's utility as a store of value with its current transaction rate. Any boosts are cake: nice-to-haves, but not worth forking over. I would never support a fork for transaction rate as long as it is possible to transact on the network for a fee. even if it is high. 
This being said, I'm optimistic for the value people will add within the space using Bitcoin behind the scenes: If Bitcoin remains trustworthy.
I think the cryptosphere in general will find ways to build payment networks with varying value propositions, and "Main-chain" Bitcoin's purview is probably not there: Bitcoin's value lies in it's stability and trustworthiness-- which I think is nullified once we fork for a reason like the present matter. I feel very strongly about this and ultimately, if you don't already agree, there's probably not much use in arguing. I think Myspace is a bad analogy, but whatever: we obviously disagree about the primary value of Bitcoin. Let paypal and Visa process everybody's damn coffees. That's what they are good at.
Let Bitcoin be a non-inflationary, trustworthy safehaven and it will excel at that.
Try do make it do both and it will fail at both.
that's my 2 bits.

Obviously localbitcoins if you don't mind the hassle...
otherwise, Bitfinex would be my recommendation at this point in time. Gemini also looks ok.
I'd stay away from Circle and Coinbase.

Interesting article. I tend to lean into the idea that the defensive patent thing is just another bitcoin-extrinsic thing which could help or hurt the system, but that you can probably ignore. If it happens to improve the situation, great... but I don't think it "makes Bitcoin dependent on blockchain-extrinsic factors"... it would just be that there is a "good" blockchain extrinsic factor in addition to the load of bad ones.
If it fails, or if we begin having problems because of this: we'll route around the issues. I still think pow change or modification or pos addition should be on the table if and only if there is demonstrable failure of the sha2 consensus mechanism as evidenced by an articulable network failure or 51
% attack.

@_date: 2012-03-28 13:44:28
Thanks... I'll try that. But I want to get this right in theory...
When I "create a new address" I am actually fetching one of 100 premade addresses from my wallets innards? So My wallet knows, at day zero, about the next 100 addresses I might try to use? Hence, even though I backed up before the transaction, the address was still associated with my wallet-- and I should therefore be able to somehow retrieve the coins?
Unless of course, the address is external... and somebody else has the coins now... (I don't know who I might have sent them to... and they have definitely not been spent according to blockchain explorer...)
If I transferred them to a Mt. Gox account or other service, is there a reasonable way to check if an address is associated with a well-known entity?
Edit: I've got the coins! Thanks everybody!
What worked: running bitcoin with -rescan and waiting overnight for the app to load and update itself. I'm not quite sure what just happened though... as the address which appears to have received the bitcoins on blockexplorer doesn't appear anywhere in my bitcoin app. Is it possible that the address which shows up in blockexplorer is one of my 100 addresses... but not one that I "created"... per se, but rather one that has been with my wallet invisibly since the beginning, and has now been used to receive my "change" from another transaction... But why did I have to wait for confirmations on a transaction which was presumably finalized months ago?
edit, edit:
One more thing that I am wondering... Is it a security (anonymity) pitfall to assume that just because one creates a "new" address, the new address will not be externally traceable to the other addresses associated with the wallet? ... but for true security, a new wallet.dat should be created which contains addresses in a different... namespace... as it were?

Market fluctuations mean: more bitcoin for me. For most who didn't buy significantly in the big runup, the market usually stays pretty stable/ goes up. The short term volatility mostly just hurts short-term/inexperienced speculators. for those using bitcoin as savings/money... these market conditions aren't that big of a deal...
I would recommend looking at the long-running moving averages to see what it feels like to hold savings in Bitcoin, not crazy bubbles... which are just ripples on the surface.

@_date: 2018-03-09 22:30:27
That was Bitcoin clashic: a completely different coin. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin Clashic... which doesn't even make sense, because Bitcoin Clashic used to be bitcoin Cash. I don't think these guys get it at all.
It's the same as if Ethereum had forked off of Ethereum Classic, then went down in BTC ratio...

Not like this. You heard wrong. the decrease to 1MB blocks was a softfork implemented by Satoshi. We have never rolled back a soft fork, or increased the blocksize using a hard fork. It's unprecedented.

No they can't. If they want to sell you a blockreward, which is about the only thing miners do economically, they have to satisfy _your_ node. If you are not trying to transact with them, you can pretty much ignore each other.

The uncertainty will definitely cause volatility. I argue the current short-term bearish trend is at least partially to do with 2x. I don't think the market can move freely until the uncertainty ends, and it could last a great while if 2x retains value due to the nature of the fork design... sans replay protection... 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:53:14
...not the lack of replay protection, lack of proper implementation, lack of competent developers, lack of peer support, lack of directed consensus, etc... And yet, hardly half of the people in the poll you link would have agreed to a hf on the NYA timeframe even _if_ all other factors were presumably ideal. Which, in reality, they are far from.
I think the big block community got what they wanted: there was a real live fork to large blocks vis a vis Ver's coin (whatever his preferred name for it is) No, it jihasn't supplanted Bitcoin _yet_, but it's there for people to use. Hell, if they get jealous of second layer solutions, they are free to UASF themselves. What's the big deal?

This is a credit to Bitcoin: It should be impossible to roll back transactions: it should be impossible to fork a blockchain for that (or similar) reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:54:49
First off-- Mining is dangerously centralized, and miners have obvious conflicts of interest when it comes to protocol changes. For instance, of course miners would fork to increase blockreward if they could: Miners have a short-term cost horizon, unlike holders who are more long-term thinking.
Philosophically, their opinion doesn't matter. All they can do is threaten to DOS Bitcoin if we don't give in to their demands. Which is not a reason to give in to their demands.
Second: it's not 85% of major businesses. It's just a few of them. 30% maximum according to coin.dance, who fallaciously claim to represent their users-- who probably weren't polled... No known community poll shows significant support for s2x.
Third: 
The community/ holders. The only party which actually matters here, wasn't consulted for the NYA. This is the most important aspect. Bitcoin is a peer to peer protocol. The peers/holders have the power, not some greasy ceos trying to keep their miserable jobs as their failing business models hemorrhage money because they misunderstood Bitcoin or tried to socialize their expenses to holders, peers, and node operators.
We should not be in the business of bailing these losers out. That's not what Bitcoin is for.

Miner signaling really has no enforceable effect. Miners mine what's profitable short to mid term. The BCash episode provided all the proof we need for this.

agreed. 80% is probably a good guess... Interesting that f2pool has denounced NYA but still appears to be signaling. I wonder how many other false flag signalers exist-- even before attrition begins among the "true believers". We are probably already far below 80%. This guun be guuud.

This is false. 2X was proposed by a mining oligarchy who saw all illusion of power about to slip through their fingers by UASF.

@_date: 2017-09-20 23:39:36
No. BIP50... (some even contest whether it was a true hard fork) was what I consider to be a "bugfix" hard fork. It didn't change any economic parameters, didn't add any new features... didn't really affect the way Bitcoin worked... it just fixed a bug, which, if exploited... could probably have ruined Bitcoin forever-- but was actually somewhat client focused...
It didn't need replay protection because there actually was _consensus_.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:25:50
such a Bitcoin is vulnerable to attack-- hence why it is crucial to prove that cryptocurrencies are immutable ledgers with immutable protocols... Otherwise, as I've said-- we lose. Yes, POW change is a possible last resort, but we all hope it doesn't come to that, because if it does, all cryptocurrencies lose.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:04:29
The big danger is the lack of replay protection-- which only is dangerous if you are _sending_ funds... But if you send funds after the fork, and aren't careful, you could lose money.
I suppose if you are a company, or someone/something with a legal crosssection, it could be dangerous to receive funds too, since people may try to sue you for refunds if they accidently send you unsplit utxos.

No need, it's quite simple:
To do a withholding 51% attack, and keep the longest SHA2 chain, as those who would seek to define Bitcoin as the longest (work) sha2 chain only without respecting the rest of the protocol, would require for "victory",  they would need to dedicate 25% of the global hashrate to the attack (to 51% the 25% minority chain), they would be left with only 50% global hashrate extending their own chain. Hence, they would not be the longer chain. It would be a tie.
This assumes the attacker is seeking to win the longest sha2 chain as the goal of their attack.
Variance and other minor issues aside... This is the _lower bound_, IRL, even less than 25% would be needed to prevent vulnerability if the attacker wanted to avoid chaos due to statistical variance-- hashing "luck"
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:08:20
So much UASF WIN.
This is all proof that the entire purpose of S2X, as I've said all along... was to get "revenge" on UASF.
What it also proves is that UASF users had _all_ the power, and can and will use it again to defeat S2X, as the same reasons UASF won are reasons for S2X to fail.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:09:08
who cares about Bitcoin cash? It has no development and no technical edge, just like 2x. I'm not worried about killing off something as harmless as BCH, in fact, I sort of respect Bcash supporters because they stick to their guns. No I don't think their coin has value, but at least they did the honorable thing and implemented replay protection and launched a proper worthless alt without trying to burn Bitcoin down on the way out.

Contributors can code whatever they want, frankly, but features more-closely related to open areas of research/development are more likely to get positive reactions from reviewers. For instance, the work around Segwit was motivated primarily by two main areas of active development: Quashing transaction Malleability, and increasing Scale. As an added bonus, Segwit gives us an awesome way to add versioned scripting systems... This proposal immediately got attention on the mailing list (often the place where contributions are first vetted and discussed) and generated significant interest within the community as a whole.
I suppose, it usually works like this: Somebody has an idea, they bring it up on the mailing list (which is totally public) if it gets a warm fuzzy feeling among the experts who lurk on the mailing list, some effort will be put into it's implementation by it's proposer and others willing to help, which will likely be open to the community even before making a pull-request on the main Bitcoin Core Github repo.
Once a pull request is made (which is public to all) there is some more discussion on Github and the mailing list, contributors will weigh in with their opinion (yes, even you can do this... but people will listen to you more if you are a proven expert) they might test the code, report what happened in their tests, and give a thumbs up or thumbs down, which is sort of like a straw poll. Again, this is all totally public. 
Ultimatley, someone with commit acces to the Bitcoin Core Git repo will either decide to merge, or not merge the changes. In practice, the commit-access maintainers just follow the casual consensus among the developers: they are peers, in theory, to all other experts who have weighed in with opinions. If they went rogue, and either rejected popular changes, or merged unpopular ones, it would cause a huge hollabaloo, and everyone would hear about it, but the role of the commit-access developer with merge rights to the main repo is effectively that of a community-accountable gatekeeper... This is just how Git works, and every open source project essentially works this way. Linux itself being a prime (and often comedic) example. Linus Torvalds could be argued to be even less tactful than Bitcoin merge-privileged contributors :-p

having four robust exchanges independent of the NYA makes it harder to embargo trade of Bitcoin in favor of S2X, and almost guarantees the existence of a chainsplit, 2 viable coins, and an exchange rate between the two, and almost guarantees that miners will support both to some extent (like bcash/bitcoin pair)... which favors Bitcoin being that the DOS threat was about the only thing S2X had going for it.

SPV wallets don't secure the network, and may not even follow a valid blockchain. SPV technology is still under research, but as of today, you still have to trust someone else's node to validate consensus before forwarding your SPV client transaction data. This goes around the security model of Bitcoin. If S2X thinks they can run Bitcoin on a fleet of SPV systems, they are claiming to completely redefine Bitcoin's security model... To something worse.

EDA Hacks make it trivial to spawn forks and is the dagger in the heart of BCH's claim to legitimacy, block size discussions aside.
Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm is an essential protocol feature which could be said to exist to allow hard fork upgrades without increasing coin supply by preventing the existence of minority forks.
BCH undermines this precisely to allow them to exist as a minority fork--something which would (and should) be impossible for Bitcoin--

1. I'm not interested in holding S2X, or any crypto controlled by people making backroom deals. I think the protocol should be very difficult, if not impossible to change, and if it's really this easy to change, Bitcoin is a failed project.
2. Why _would_ B2X hold high value? Obviously BCH didn't. The only difference between S2X and BCH is the DOS attack threat, but miners' threats don't and shouldn't matter.
3. The hypothetical _capacity_ not _scalability_ difference between B2X and Bitcoin is marginal and doesn't represent a significant improvement to Bitcoin. Nor does it offer any future benefits whatsoever besides an implicit plan to do this whole shit over again next time the blocks are full, ad infinitum, until we have gigablocks, and only government run nodes, fully-equipped with kyc.

Because there is no replay protection, Both Bitcoin and S2X pubkeys look exactly the same... Also the private keys and transaction metadata are all the same. If you aren't careful, when you try to spend your S2X coins, you may also be sending the receiver your Bitcoins (and vice versa)... effectively overpaying assuming S2X coins have nonzero value. To be careful, you need to be sure to split you utxos onto the separate chains. Bcash was polite and friendly by implementing replay protection, so users didn't need to do much here, but S2X has not done us such a favor.

We should never cater to users who don't run a node over users who do. This is basic stuff...
We should never allow it to become too difficult for individuals to run nodes... if they want to... And most likely, any change to the protocol which compromises this is "bitcoin unethical". You can argue that under these requirements, that even segwit is Bitcoin Unethical, but remember, segwit is opt-in. you can still use the old rules, properly validate transactions that matter to you, and have the same difficulty of running a node as always by not running segwit software. 
If some Bitcoin Users' customers don't care about financial sovereignty, but still want exposure to Bitcoin market volatility, or use it as a financial backbone for third-party services they use... that's fine. But keep them far, far away from protocol decisions. You're not a true Bitcoin user if you Don't use Bitcoin software: you just use bitcoins.

To describe very real centralization concerns as "myopic" reveals how out of touch you are with the guiding principles of Bitcoin.

1) You can't be sure you have any bitcoin at all if you don't run a node. The node is what tells you you have bitcoin. Not some website. This is the critical philosophical underpinning of Bitcoin, and if you aren't solid about this, you should go think reallly hard about why you're here.
2) If nodes don't reach consensus, what will? Miners are just nodes that do POW. Their opinion about consensus parameters in no more important than any other node... Miners create blocks and nodes (including miners' nodes) verify them. This is the core principle of Bitcoin.

In order to be a "Core Dev" all you need to do is make a pull request on Bitcoin and have it adopted. There's no application process, there's no paper to sign, there's no sleazy politicians to bribe: all you have to do is write good code.
Some people are sad that their bad code wasn't included in Bitcoin, and they get all angry at core reviewers for not stroking their egos at the expense of the quality of Bitcoin, but the fact of the matter is that all core communication occurs in public, there are no closed-door deals. You can support the core project by running the code or contributing to it.
There is no "core dev" business card besides actual commits of code.

Let all the get rich quick kids and greater fools enjoy their centrally-mined corporate coin. I won't miss them.
Turning my mind towards productivity, I'd suggest the community start considering this more seriously-- as in coded propositions.

Bitcoin is something really new and exciting, but the fact of the matter is: there is a "knee-shaped" learning curve that requires newcomers to understand the basics in a whole bunch of fields before they can fully understand how revolutionary Bitcoin really is.
I think that in order to understand this field, newcomers need to get up to speed on:
1. Open source software development
2. Adversarial and defensive thinking
3. Some really heady issues about trustlessness, value, and philosophy. (my favorite, and imho, the most important subject)
4. Cryptography
5. Networks
6. government/ history/ law
It's a lot to swallow all at once, and now, to make it all even more difficult, there are forces trying to _stop_ people from learning what they need to know.
I still believe that once newcomers learn enough about the above subjects, a lightbulb lights up in their brain, they have a "Eureka" moment, and the whole thing starts making more and more sense every day.

Pretty much.
Obviously, if SHA256 or EC crypto are borken, we'll have no choice, but if Bitcoin starts making changes because of people whining about their fees... Or whatever... The initiative is lost. If other cryptos are better, they _should_ get market share. Once sidechains are proven, I believe that's where innovation will occur-- but hardforking the protocol just because a majority wants it is wrong, and if it is possible, Bitcoin is broken. Compared to dozens of existing cryptos, Bitcoin's stability is it's greatest advantage. There are already several alts which can support greater capacity, yet, they can't challenge the stability of Bitcoin.

Hostile takeover attempt. You can lose coins if you aren't careful, so be careful. Be sure to split your outputs before sending coins on either chain (S2X _or_ Bitcoin) there is no replay protection.

Especially if your third-party partners are on this list and haven't withdrawn yet:

People still overwhelmingly run Core code. I suspect community support for big blocks is overstated.

This will end badly for 2x. Since their nodes are in a tiny minority, when they start getting banned by Bitcoin nodes when they try to publish invalid blocks in Nov, they won't have as easy of a time finding peers during the network disruption, and might be isolated in the dark for a while. Sure, BTC1 will ask them to connect to central whitelisted peers... in keeping with the centralized disgrace that is S2X.

It's easier to hide smaller datastructures. Some people think we should find ways to make our transactions more efficient instead, and still be just as capable of concealment.

It's a wolf in sheep's clothing that hurts Bitcoin's decentralization more than it benefits capacity.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:49:22
there's a nuance here though... Economic nodes matter: you're right here... but it's the total _value_ which flows through the nodes which creates an impact on the network... Above a certain threshold of nodes required to keep the p2p network up, it doesn't matter if Coinbase runs 1kBTC through 1 node, or 100... they still are running 1kBTC worth of transactions. 
What really matters is free individuals running nodes to verify transactions. Coinbase counts as one individual on the network if they only run one node... but they are a pretty important individual if they run really high transaction worth.
Don't let me come across as if I am defending using Coinbase, or any third-party wallet/node... I think they are cancer. Just observing how economic nodes work.
Coinbase seems to want to force all of their customers to use the node Coinbase selects... So coinbase has the aggregated power of all their users insofar as they are buying Bitcoins... But as soon as Coinbase's users wise up to the fact that they are getting screwed... I'd imagine they'd migrate to other platforms that actually support Bitcoin.
Most of Coinbase's users are pretty non-technical... so I think it's good to get out the word that they might try to _steal their customers' Bitcoins and replace them with 2X altcoins_ But if they can effectively bamboozle a huge amount of economic activity onto the 2x chain, there's not much we can do besides facilitate the inevitable lawsuits that will come when people get wise to what was pulled on them.

This is more or less how I see it. I don't think a corporate-backed blockchain is useful or viable in the long run for the same sorts of applications as Bitcoin/at all. It may take a long time to learn this, however, and could be a slow and destructive bleed of productivity--see: miners/Segwit embargo.
I would rather the corporates stick to their corporate chains/eth, hyperledger, etc., and the Bitcoin community keep Bitcoin. 
By the various parties focusing on their strengths, synergy will be obtained. yay!

A while ago, Garzik put out a message that the repo/team was going into "silent mode" whatever that is. Hasn't been a merge since, and development is looking pretty sluggish.
They did manage to do the so-called trivial "changing a one to a two"  flagday HF modification before the "silent period" began... and promptly had a fail on testnet due to "unforeseen" adversarial conditions...
Since then, there have been a lot of _nontrivial_ non-consensus (this just means it's not fork-related) improvements to the client software made by core, including some that address some pretty serious issues... but they haven't been merged into BTC1 yet. BTC1 has a branch which is sloppily copy-pasta-ing the Core changes into BTC1, but it's a mess, and needs a lot of work... I don't even think the branch compiles, and it hasn't been committed on in weeks, much less merged.
Meanwhile, as BTC1 laggs farther and farther behind on their ~~plagiarism~~ (whatever. it's OSS) copy-pasta duties related to 0.15, even more fixes are going to be pushed into a minor release of Core, which by the looks of it, will take exactly forever for BTC1 to merge. Forget about integration testing with 2x before the supposed fork date. They probably won't even rerun the tests core implemented to make sure their ~~plagiarism~~ innovation (lol) worked correctly.
Unless some miracle happens, they will be releasing a (at least) two version stale ~~client~~ POS, missing important bugfixes, as some kind of "upgrade" in Nov.
It's a complete farce. 
Also, FYI, BTC1 didn't write any segwit-related code. That was all "borrowed" from Core also. Garzik probably doesn't even fully understand how any of that technology works. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:16:52
Softforks follow the protocol. All previous blocksize changes have been softforks, or non-codified in the protocol.

The biggest concern with github-based development is that the community-accountable gatekeepers (the merge-priveledged devs-- a really small percentage of the dev population) could "go rogue" as I said, but there's accountability there... because of the open process.
In a perfect world, we could have a decentralized merge-approval process... that would be pretty neat... but in practice, I think the current system has proven pretty robust so far. To those that take the time to follow the open development of the core project, it's a really beautiful thing to watch. If you're interested, I'd totally recommend getting on the mailing list. Have your email client aggregate the messages into a folder so they don't clutter your inbox (there's a lot of volume)-- but you can see all kinds of neat technical discussion a level high above what you see here on reddit... It might seem sorta dry at first... but real software development isn't that much drama when things are going well :) Reading the mailing list is a great way to supercharge your technical knowledge of the software and protocol...

No way. Let corporate coin fork off. who cares. I'm sticking with Core.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:02:35
If Bitcoin breaks, Core has done an admirable job of trying to save it. If Bitcoin breaks, it's likely due to problems with the underlying system as designed by Satoshi. My money is on poor choice of hash algorithm/ pow protocol which led to the centralization of mining. Hard forks would be needed to repair the system, and Core isn't going to propose any of those until all other options have been tried.

It all depends on the number of inputs. 
For single input transactions, I don't think there are any savings at all (?)
But if you are consolidating several inputs, the savings should be proportional to the number of inputs as 1/n (?)

After the split, there will be two "bitcoins". You will have coins on both of them, but if you are not careful, you can lose coins while sending because all transactions are valid on both chains.
What happens is: 
1. I ask you for one Bitcoin.
2. You use your wallet, and send me one bitcoin...
2a. ...but since there is no replay protection, and assuming you haven't manually split your utxos, you will accidentally also potentially send me the same number of s2x coins.
3. I get to keep your money, assuming s2x coin has value. I got the Bitcoins you were trying to send me, as well as the s2x coins you didn't try to send me.
4. You just lost money. the end.

100% of miners on the UASF chain would be signaling SW... I wouldn't have cared about "obstructionist miners" chain, and I don't think too many others would have cared for that either. Eventually, Segwit chain would have reorged the non-segwit chain due to higher utility, and all those mining rewards payed to the obstructionist miners would be wiped out.
They had to get in line. they had no choice.
The community has the choose to accept or reject the 2x hard fork... and I'm guessing the answer will be 'lol'

No, all 2x nodes will be banned by all Bitcoin nodes as soon as they start sending invalid blocks. Core 0.15 bans them preemptively to prevent the p2p network from fracturing when the massive waves of bans start happening. It was a favor to the 2x nodes, and they are shooting themselves in the foot by disabling it because they don't want people to know how few nodes they have--How little user support there is.

This is true, but today, most Bitcoin "users" by definition of people who think the few DCG/Silbert/NYA companies represent any real user's opinion couldn't tell you the difference between a block and a nonce.
Those of us who explicitly oppose 2X are trying to help noobs avoid getting rekt, and trying our best to advance the average intelligence in the space until people might know what software to run, and how to run it to become real Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:51:29
I can't follow your suggested terminology of compromise. This term has been abused to no end around this concept, and I'm pretty much over it. Some people want to fork, some people don't want to fork for anything, and some people don't want to fork _for this_.
Most people and a preponderance of node operators either don't want to fork at all or don't want to fork for this, and don't want to 'compromise' with a tiny group of people, who claim with varying degrees of credibility to represent 'users'.
Again, and I've said it before, I don't care what miners think or signal. They are along for the ride and ultimately easily replaceable.

yes. The longer the fork lasts, the more damage will be done.
Currently, the market doesn't have very many tools for dealing with this sort of thing. In the future, after these attacks become more commonplace, we might have better policies/tricks to limit the damage, but I can't imagine how this could possibly be good. Basically, all Bitcoiners are getting a dividend. Where's all that money coming from? Will both sides of the fork have nonzero value? Will the summed value be somehow higher than pre-fork?

HKA is still as irrelevant as it ever was. The technical matter is that technical decisions shouldn't be made by political means. I guess it's up to the economy to decide this.


Because the technical merits of 2X are nonexistent. Those informed and capable already understand this. The only hope of 2X's economic, and knockon hashrate success is in the speculative eyes of non-technical investors, who deserve to have informed opinions assuming there is any sort of feedback loop whatsoever between the quality of technological governance and the market success of a cryptocurrency.

You need to validate your own transactions. This is the central principle of Bitcoin: your node tells you how much money you have--not some website or somebody on tv or whatever. The only way to be sure those bitcoins sit in an address you control is to download and validate the blockchain.
If you do validate your own transactions, you don't have to be worried about some snake who says they're paying you with Bitcoin, but in reality, they just payed you with Doge or 2x or whatever. If at all. 
BUT please understand that for the most part, nodes are used for receiving transactions and verifying your balance. If you aren't moving your coins, not receiving new coins, and are sure you and only you know your keys... the operation of a node becomes something more of a benefit to the rest of the network. Still a very valuable role.

Most people think CNN is news. Most people don't have root access to their own machines. Most people are pretty oblivious to how Bitcoin works.
I still hope their disagreement can't change Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value proposition, again, as I've said, is it's stability. No need to chase every feature and use case and risk the protocol. I'm fine going elsewhere if I need shiny features, but as an immutable store of value, Bitcoin is still unbeatable. Unlike the coin you just mentioned.

I'm not sure what Coinbase's policy is on BTCCash... so I don't know if they will give you your airdrop if you withdraw first... But I bet you'd like to avoid the same situation next time and get your s2x right away... It's not right what Coinbase has been doing re: the forks... same thing happened with eth/etc.
Anyway... yeah... nano or trezor are good. Paper wallets/cold storage are a great way to go...
Remember that when you spend coins after the fork, you'll need to split your coins manually first to avoid replay attacks. There's plenty of resources on how those work... but if you hold your own keys, and are careful before spending, you should be ok.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:56:40

I suggest using cold storage or a real wallet. Electrum may be a good compromise for you... they have an app for ios and android iirc.
If you are storing a large amount of funds i.e. more than 5 BTC, you should do your own due diligence on how to secure your own coins-- probably in a combination of cold storage and a hot wallet, like a Bitcoin Node or Electrum.

It's not a matter of being "allowed" to have an opinion, it's a mechanical fact that holders and people accepting Bitcoin for payments (becoming holders) give the coin value... Miners have no say in this value unless they are also holders on the side. They are at the mercy of the economy in every way.
Holders have all the chips: miners serve a function.
I see the dichotomy mostly as: Holders are a company's owners/shareholders... Miners are employees. Sure, the miners can go on strike... but they are fully replaceable.

It's pretty easy to tell the difference between McNodes, and "normal" nodes... Just look for the AWS and Digital Ocean IPs coming up in rapid numbers.
But in reality, interpreting node counts is sort of tea leaf reading, as we can never be sure of the economic significance of non-McNodes... (McNodes are almost definitley not relevant...) You have to look at historical node tenancy, what new nodes are coming online... and in what patterns, and on what AS's.
To me-- what I need to see to think there is any real adoption of 2X, would be to see long-running core nodes going down, and new 2X nodes coming up on the same IP.

Mining is very centralized already. This hardfork:
1) Gives miners more power if it succeeds
2) favors further mining centralization directly through block propagation latency.
It's very bad precedent, and we get almost nothing good out of it... A wee incremental capacity increase, kicking the can down the road... until we do this again out of precedent and make the situation even worse.

I'm just really not into the 2x model of the decision making. It appears to me (maybe I'm wrong) that the slippery slope is real this time--This would constitute a fundamental shift in the way protocol decisions are made, and it's somewhat more centralized. Certainly an attack surface: I can easily see more protocol "requests" and HFs being promoted by these businesses--and being pushed through by the miners (who have just as big of attack surface). I don't want to see RSA style meddling in these things: and it _will_ happen. 
The notion, in general, that miners decide protocol changes is another worth caring about in my opinion: If it were the case that most node operators mined--or that mining interests somehow aligned better with node operation, it would be a different situation, but we are on thin ice with the current degree of miner centralization (which I think people have rationalized given the node/economy drives mining interest hypothesis...). If we didn't have that philosophical hedge against mining centralization, I don't think the project would have value. Or at least not as much as the decentralized version.

Miners are as easy to replace as it is easy to change the block size.


2X no longer has that much hashpower. They are currently in the low 80's according to my block counts. (82.6% blocks today)
Moreover, I expect further attrition from "committed" hashrate in real life, so I would be surprised to see 2x hashrate much over 75%. If 2x hashrate projections are below 75%, they are more likely to be zero on flagday. Bitfury, among others, will most likely not mine the 2x chain if it looks as if there will be an active minority chain (per their statements at breaking Bitcoin)-- and it _does_ look like the original Bitcoin chain will continue to be mined by a nontrivial chunk of miners.
With the added capacity benefits of Segwit not being fully-realized, I would expect them to become so in the unlikely event that there is a network hashrate disruption... like 75% of miners jumping off a bridge together to mine an altcoin the market won't value (per futures contract evidence)-- I would expect SW capacity gains to be more aggressively-exploited. I would be surprised to see effective transaction bandwidth drop below 50% for more than a few hours.
Again, in the exceedingly unlikely event that 2X manages to "kill bitcoin" I would be happy to see Core merge a change which allowed for POW switch to Keccak or cuckoo cycle.
I'm a bit extreme, and think the current degree of miner centralization warrants this even without a hashrate disruption such as 2x, but this would be a welcome impetus to burn Bitmain to the ground.
Given the more conservative posture of core, I think keccak mining _plus_ SHA2 mining would be allowed with a softforked provision that SHA2 blocks must build on top of SHA2 blocks, and must contain the same transactions as the keccak blocks so we can re-org the "longest sha2 chain" that some seem to care about regardless of other protocol violations once this blocksize growth proposal fad is over.
I repeat, I'd be happy with a POW switch with or without s2x. mining is too centralized, though I don't think I'll be lucky enough to get one since s2x is DOA.

I believe this, and am willing to discuss civilly why I think it is and should be the case. I think it is central to the ethos of Bitcoin, the nature of a 51% attack, and the security model of the system.
I would also like to point out that in a very real sense, indivicual humans in the Bitcoin space can have multiple roles. Users (or owners, more accurately), vis a vis holders matter most, and are almost the only party that actually can make a difference. (not payment processors or ceos or miners) -- BUT CEOs and miners... if they want to matter... can become users/owners as well.
It's not an insult to individuals: it's recognizing a clear reality of the security model of the system.

I hear you. And 100% agree. I think this looks likely to transpire should s2x get the miner support which is currently claiming to be backing it. I'd add that a week (or some timespan) without a block should also be sufficient to trigger the activation. I want the code to be ready.
I also agree about your second point, but we need to keep a hard front up to tell miners that we will happily burn them down if they turn their backs on the users-- and we'll do it again and again until they get the message.

Your node is the only node that matters when you are receiving payments. You put the address you want to receive on into your node as a watch only address, tell it to the person that is supposed to pay you... Tell them what blockchain you're on... Bitcoin... Litecoin... dogecoin... S2X... etc... (so they know which blockchain to use)
...and then wait. You're not payed if you asked for Bitcoins and they sent you Litecoins-- your node will never validate that. You are payed when your node says the address has received the funds.
If no miner is mining your blockchain (there probably will be though-- even if its S2X or Dogecoin lol) then the funds will never arrive. If the sender sends the funds on the wrong blockchain... you will never get them, and the payer has not payed. Your node is the only one that can tell you if you have been payed, and you're not payed until your node says you are. You get to decide which software to install for your node... this determines which blockchain you use... (bitcoin, litecoin, etc, etc.) And only you can tell you what node software to run. This is financial sovereignty.

Like BCash, higher profits will go to those that sell the dividend sooner. If it looks like S2X might be viable, there will be even more upside for the avant garde that sell it right away.
I am not afraid of guessing wrong, as I have no interest in holding S2X whatsoever: It's like owning stock in the NYA companies-- an investment, sure... but not a real decentralized cryptocurrency. I guess this makes the decision easier for me... Limits downside risk and maximizes upside. (If somehow the OG chain gets wiped out, I will be exiting Bitcoin and moving to LTC probably, so selling 2X coins can't cause downside in my strategy.)

The key point here is miners vs. nodes. Old nodes will accept all transactions/blocks previously acceptable, but new nodes will reject some transactions which were once valid... This was the case in BIP148, for instance. It is still physically possible for Miners to mine non compliant transactions which softfork enforcing nodes will reject. This would cause a chainsplit between the new nodes' network and the old nodes' network. Note: this is a chainsplit, not a hard fork, which is a different thing. miners are incentivized to follow the new nodes' network as it can reorg the old nodes' network if it gets more work (it's a perfectly valid chain under the old rules) The old nodes' network can't reorg the new nodes' network, because they allow blocks which are now invalid.


Yes it causes the network to split, but it's crucially different from a hard fork in that all of the new nodes' network's blocks are valid and can reorg the old chain for all old nodes if it gets longer. Hardfork chains are never valid, so thay can't reorg anyone.
If miners think that a softfork will _ever become_ popular, it's in their best interest to follow it right away. See BIP148/UASF.

I think the answer is actually to build upwards... LN is a good first-step system, but I think a hierarchical foundation of sidechains will be the base of future LN's.

I think this is a very important realization: The value of the decentralized consensus system is _far_ greater than the advantage of the payment system. The philosophical power that comes from an uneditable public cryptographic commitment medium is beyond profound.
It's worth noting that a system like Bitcoin can be used as a primitive to build far-better payment systems than vanilla Bitcoin-- but not the other way around. We will get the payment systems-- obviously-- LN is a great first step, probably not the final word in Bitcoin-based payment systems-- but seriously... why anyone would prefer something like bare Bitcoin with 10 minute block times, 1, 2, 4 _n_ mb blocks with limited capacity, and, truth be told absurdly high security which is unnecessary for most consumer purchases (which you pay for at the same rate whether you are buying a stick of gum or a continent) over LN with _instant_ transactions, low fees, and crazy scaling potential is beyond me...
Sure, the payment channel routing confusion is a bit of "making the sausage" visibility, which most users will never have to care about-- but LN or something like it will someday provide a faster, cheaper, and probably more-user-friendly payment network than Bitcoin could ever be by itself...

Core prioritizes keeping the network united, but in general, does not control whether the community will back or oppose a hard fork. From this perspective, one can see how risky hard forks are, and core plays conservative.
It is always safer to make upgrades using soft forks because the risk of splitting the network is dramatically lower. 
Fwiw, I don't see core promoting any hard forks in the next few years at least unless there is some sort of emergency.

You have listed one of the few examples which would create a non-ambiguous, _instant_ migration of consensus.
I have often noted that in cases where the previous consensus-bound protocol becomes untenable or dysfunctional, it will become possible to hard fork with consensus.
Also, for what it's worth, comparing situations like we are currenly discussing (i.e. sha2 broken, ec broken, crypto otherwise broken by qc) to discretionary hard forks "I think the fees should be lower" "I wish we had 42M coins" or whatever is a bit of a stretch and really only weakens your thesis, as it is clearly a non-sequitur from what we had been discussing. It really isn't comparable at all to bcash or s2x.

That would be a horrible outcome-- the point of running a node is so you can verify your own transactions-- if you make a transaction, it's included in a 1TB block you don't want to download because you're not colocated, the 1TB-supporting part of the network sees the transaction, but you think it was never confirmed... that's like... the worst possible outcome.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:39:08

If you are voting to register your opinion with an un-trusted third party-- the problems run deeper than the context of the election. If you trust the registration process, the system works. In the future, we might use trustless systems to do the voter registration-- but this is far from a perfect solution-- what with the voters having the ability to prove they voted a certain way... that is... until somebody comes along with a good anonymization mod-- i.e. using coinjoin...

@_date: 2017-05-04 00:40:03
Pretty cute, actually.
I'd guess the network would reject it. The rest of the network ostensibly has nothing to gain from some random miner mining an invalid block-- and thus wouldn't have any different incentives to accepting an invalid block than they normally would. Even if the miner wanted to bribe other miners with the proceeds, it's only like 20 blockrewards. 3 hours of network activity. If you had to bribe more than 3~ish miners to hold half the hashrate for an hour to get 6 confirms... this would be vulnerable to a re-org. 
edit: in the distant future when blockrewards are less, this could be a problem... but would look exactly like a standard invalid blockreward to the rest of the network... Miner mines an invalid block: gets a ton of extra Bitcoin. Might as well give them a 100BTC blockreward. Block is just as invalid-- Would you accept bribes from a miner who mines invalid blockrewards? 
Sort of interesting philosophically now that I think about it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:22:08
I don''t think Theymos was arguing that it is categorically impossible to have a hard fork which could be considered legitimate in some sense-- he was simply noting that bcash broke from consensus (which has gone on apart from bcash) -- in particular, by changing their difficulty algorithm, conceding that even bcash knows bcash does not have consensus. This is in contrast to "the current consensus implementation" which seems to be what you are mischaracterising him as referencing. Obviously, you break consensus as defined in the code whenever you make a breaking change... but it _is_ possible to execute certain hfs in a manner which preserves the legitimacy of the rough consensus implemented in said code. However, BCash has not done this, and thus, is not consistent with consensus: can never be Bitcoin-- this was Theymos's point.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:12:28


This would be very difficult if not impossible to prove due to how easy it is to proxy miners. I think it is the case due to the game theory at play here. Bitmain would destroy the price by overtly being over 50%, but want to keep power over the network.
I don't intend to mine until I can get descent miners, 7nm, somewhere besides Bitmain, as it almost 100% the case that they keep a miner for every one they sell, subsidized by the suckers that buy from them at high markup.
There is a very large economy supporting SW, and UASF is probably the only way to get it. I think people will realize this and come around to UASF.

Seems like you are begging the question of miner support or a lack thereof. The chains can most definitely coexist as long as Segwit148 gets something like 20%-35% of the total hashrate. Futures markets can help with price discovery to reduce risk to miners (as they did for BCU-- lol). If UASF chain ever gets longer however, as we both know-- the other chain ceases to exist. So &gt;35% is unstable as the risk of reorg is intolerably high. &lt;20% is unstable because it is attackable.  


This will be the case whether or not they want to support both: if the 148 chain is viable... exchanges can't embargo it's existence: we have ways of routing around them... but the liabilities of not running 148 still exist: It's financially/legally risky for exchanges _not_ to run 148-- as has been discussed elsewhere.

It certainly would be possible to switch elliptic curves if this was deemed to be a viable attack vector.

There's no SF that can do this. Soft forks add rules. We already have the rule against oversize blockrewards. You'd need a hard fork to remove it. That's why those who _really_ understand this system plan upgrades via soft fork: they retain the philosophical integrity of the system.
Even a majority of hashpower can't raise the 21M limit. The influence of hashpower on the protocol has been greatly overstated by... those with a lot of hashpower. In reality, the only liberty of miners is to order transactions or DOS the network.
You are in no danger of having the 21M coin limit raised unless someone tricks you into following some other protocol, which they call Bitcoin, but allows hard forks. BU is such a sham protocol, and there will be others once BU is dead and in the grave. Stay vigilant and never follow a hard fork.
Segregated Witness is a soft fork, again, which is rules added. We still follow all of the old rules-- including, now and forever, 21M issuance limit. UASF is a way of making this soft fork happen in the context of belligerent miners, or miners who are too lazy to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:48:59
In the future, it will be possible to have exchange rates between soft fork implementations-- I am all for letting the market decide. Right now, the miners, who aren't assumed to be technologically knowledgeable, have no real way to gauge support in various proposals as there is no way to let the market evaluate SF proposals... When there is a market for SFs, there will be peace.

Am I mistaken in thinking this will allow effortless cross-softfork swaps without an exchange?
Alice can send Bob a sf-require-not-signaled transaction, which is only valid on pre-sf net, since it ignores OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION... and keep the sf coins since the transaction is not valid on sf-net.
Bob sends Alice some number of pre-sf coins likely smaller than the number of coins Alice initially sent Bob, because to Alice, that's free money-- the transaction where she payed Bob is invalid on sf-net where she wants to be. 
Alice sent Bob 2 &lt;NO_SF&gt; coins, keeping the 2 coins on-sf
Bob sends Alice 1 pre-sf coin, which Alice has the option of converting into a sf-coin, or a special &lt;SF_ONLY&gt; transaction, but it doesn't matter to Bob which, since they are both equally valid (Bob paid Alice transactions) to Bob...
Bob now has (2(from Alice) - 1(to Alice) = 1) &lt;NO_SF&gt; coins
Alice has up to (2(originally possessed) + 1(from Bob)) &lt;SF_ONLY&gt; coins
Exchange-rate between sfs with replay protection.
Never can a SF-signalling miner mine the Alice pays Bob transaction.
All of Bob's transactions are valid on both networks always.
This eliminates some of the biggest risks of SF- replay attack family.
It's an explicit SF for transactions. The most important feature is the ability to create transactions which are _not_ valid in sf_net. Presently, I'm not aware of any universally-easy way to do this? I always thought it was possible to do so by sending around a few transactions until things got picked up in the right blocks-- but the exact mechanism is escaping me? I guess it would come down to luck and timing...
Malicious miners can still mine empty SF blocks... But this gives a push to minority softforks being able to coexist peacefully. I don't think this is about fees.
p.s. this is awesome.

They're just going to collect payment from Ver and go back to whatever they were doing before.

It's obvious there will be no compromise, and it's obvious that BU will not be a successful fork. They can only stall.

I think 148 us a great experiment, that in all likelihood, will create a usable segwit network, whether as a chainsplit, coexisting system, a-la ETC, or by becoming the mainstream chain. True, having 51% support would be nice. However, for the reasons above-- i.e. users being able to use non-148 if they want with no disruption if 148 is far below 51%, or if far above 51% is the same as a masf-- I don't see why it should be controversial.

Bitcoin is what it is. The protocol defines that. The rules have always been the same and always will be. That's the value of bitcoin. Satoshi gave us a great gift in this family of technologies. There may be an alt which fits your needs, but the developers are doing their best to realize the full potential of bitcoin within the loose confines of the protocol. We will eventually find solutions to these problems, but if you bought into something you didn't understand, you can't expect the rest of the system to compensate for your lack of foresight. If you need cheap payments fast, you may want to explore litecoin... They already have cheap transactions and will soon have Ln with even cheaper transactions. Until bitcoin sloughs off a few rent making miners, it might lag behind in payments, but I wouldn't hold your breath. Wu and his company will probably live on for decades at least and this could be a slog for bitcoin.

Yes, but the chain split would happen if the legacy nodes were accepting outputs based on transactions which are invalid under segwit. Also, old (NON-UASF, Core) nodes have different activation logic, they won't necessarily see SW transactions as valid without IS_SUPERMAJORITY

@_date: 2017-05-28 05:52:12
I assure you I understand the relevant topics quite well.
If both coins are offered, the total capital the market has to dedicate to either/or both chains combined is presumably approximately constant (at best), and miners mining the original chain have to share the market with the miners mining segwit.
If the market favors the segwit coin highly over the original chain, those original blockrewards are worth very little, and the only ones left to subsidize Jihan's coins are the Party. Don't take for granted that anyone will want to buy either chain at all.
It's possible the market won't prefer UASF tokens... and it's possible the market won't want feature-constricted Bitcoin tokens either. The market decides which chain lives and which chain dies.
I prefer the market making this decision to talking heads on reddit with no skin in the game.

I'm fully aware of the normal transaction fee/ confirmation time complex.
Consider the condition when miners are subsidized to mine only permissioned transactions-- If the permissioned-only miners dominate the hashrate, quality of service for the entire network decreases for those attempting to send non-permissioned transactions? regardless of fee?
Are you suggesting that fee pressure would need to overcome permission incentives to establish some sort of equilibrium?

I don't think the situation is quite so dire, but it's nice to be holding that punch. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:29:06
There are two points I want to make here:
1) If Satoshi had intended it to be a temporary limit, he should have included deactivation logic. He coded it such that it would need a hork to remove-- so that's what we have to work with.
As you probably know-- I am firmly of the belief that removing rules from Bitcoin would be a dangerous precedent to set, and the immutability of its rules is one of the philosophical principles which to me, makes Bitcoin sound money. This is also why we favor modifications to the protocol which add rules: soft forks, instead of these which remove them: hard forks. Of course I have a hard fork wishlist (which doesn't include larger blocks, btw), but again, I don't expect these things to ever be deployed in Bitcoin, as they would harm the soundness of the system as hard money. I would prefer these features be added by way of sidechains.
now on to 2)
Do I think we need a 1MB limit? For a number of reasons, the exact blocksize I could tolerate probably isn't exactly 1MB, but it's within an order of magnitude of there, and 1MB is the largest we can go without hard forks. So the most benefit we could possibly get in throughput is k &lt; 10. Not worth it. Yes, I believe we need _some_ protocol-enforced blocksize, and a puny wiggle for capacity _not scalability_ again, isn't worth it...
Bitcoin will scale in smarter ways: layer 2.
FWIW, extension blocks, patched in by SF are infinitley preferable to me than a short-sighted HF blocksize increase.
I'm fairly sure we've been over this before. The debate is over. I am running UASF and will have Segwit and many more orders of magnitude of potential throughput, and a _scalability_ improvement on flagday.

Hard forks represent the possibility for arbitrary rule changes: This is ok for weird fluid projects like Ethereum, but absolutely unacceptable for a currency. 
Hard forks can reverse valid transactions as in Ethereum DAO fiasco-- or increase blocksize... as will not happen in Bitcoin... This being said, of course, I am open to the idea of opt-in extension blocks etc, which allow users to use Bitcoin's security to secure more transactions... as am I open to Segwit, LN, etc... these things are all possible in Bitcoin without hard forks... which can, in addition to raising the blocksize...
- Raise the number of coins over 21M
- Lower/raise the difficulty arbitrarily
- Steal funds without private key signatures
(and any other horrible thing you can think of)
Hard forks allow arbitrary changes to the protocol, and should not be seen as a normal upgrade procedure!

Merriam webster, and anyone using the glyph "economic majority" in some context other than this context has no bearing on what we're actually talking about here.

Other applications of the glyph,  "economic majority" are irrelevant in this context.

I think the mistake was to assume that centralized miners would support the same network upgrades as a properly decentralized system. Covert ASICBOOST was the wildcard that trumped this assumption _this time_ however, the dynamics of the system at various degrees of centralization aren't well known.
One could have previously assumed that while miner centralization is a problem, it isn't a problem w.r.t. upgrade uptake, and hence out of scope in context of deciding activation logic.
We know better now, and BIP9 probably wont be used anymore.
If it becomes clear that miner centralization is an existential threat to the network (as I increasingly believe may be the case), POW change or POWA is a perfectly reasonable course of action.

This doesn't make any sense. Blockstream and Core are different entities, and neither profits from the use of LN which is a second layer payment system which is open source and accessible to all without permission.
Au contraire, I have no desire to store your message on my node: Bitcoin's purpose is not some sort of free storage array for non-financial data.

As far as I can tell, there is very little risk in the UASF route-- of course, there could be a chain split-- and it might be prudent for users who want to remain compatible with other incompatible soft/hard forks/ chainsplits to run multiple nodes... but the ROI on attacking a SF split is probably pretty low. A minority can start up SW UASF via BIP8 and live happily ever after. Miners will decide whether mining the SFs is a worthwhile venture. The difficulty lag will be a bummer-- but I think it will be a neat experiment.

It's not a sybil attack. The number of UASF nodes doesn't matter. There is no threshold... Spinning up 1000 UASF McNodes like they did for Classic and BU would mean nothing.
If you want segwit... run UASF. You don't need permission from Bitmain. A new BIP is going to make UASFs unstoppable by immunizing them from replay attacks. All Bitmain can do is DOS-- which will be whack-a-mole. They can waste all the money they want trying to block this.

I guess the hope is that there will be a competitive fee market for unpermissioned transactions such that: (feePermissioned  + Chain Anchor bribe) &lt;= (feeUnpermissioned + 0)...
or else rational miners will accept the bribes and ignore unpermissioned transactions.
There is a fundamental economics question underlying here: Asymptotically, can Chain Anchor sponsors/ nation states continue to subsidize permissioned transaction bribes without reserve currency coining ability and stay competitive with unsanctioned legitimate commerce? If not, will it become the norm to bribe miners with "not prison" instead of fiat scrip?

I think sidechains will make block size increases/discussion irrelevant. Bitcoin can anchor a huge number of second-tier systems processing gobs of transactions, or even anchoring third-layer (as you mention) solutions-- the growth will be exponential. RSK alone, once properly decentralized, will open bitcoin to an absurd amount of capacity and innovation--not to mention, it will be possible to add RSK.1, RSK.2 probably into the thousands... Hierarchy FTW as long as the root of the tree is as decentralized as possible, it's branches will inherit as much of that virtue as they wish.
LN alone, again, provides exponentially more capacity than is available in bcash-- those two exponential solutions will provide mind-blowing capabilities in pure synergy with Bitcoin.

I don't think miners false signaling is a problem at all? The point of this seems to be partially-related to hedging against nodes not-enforcing the SF rules... With this OPCODE, you can hedge against SF activation by keeping your non-sf coins in-possession by sending them to yourself in a transaction requiring it is _not_ mined in your SF chain. False-signaling miners, in general, would be mining otherwise invalid blocks on your SF by building on top of sf-sensitive transactions in disagreement with the SF blockchain. Sure, if they mine valid SF blocks with "bad intentions", while signaling, they might be false-signalling their emotions, but they mined your transaction into the SF blockchain just like you wanted...
In essence, this makes non-sf chains vulnerable to re-play into the SF if they fail to include the proper OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION, but they usually can't mine valid OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION transactions anyway, unless they are actually on the SF.

Not necessarily...
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:04:45
Economies of scale in hardware production, mining farm operation, electricity access negotiation and other physical aspects of the mining industry lead to a centralization of hash rate control into the hands of a small number of organizations. This leads to the now familiar us vs them between miners and users. There is no protocol level check to this phisioecomic force, and market forces are all we have to protect ourselves from the dominance of this phenomenon, which is imho extremely hazardous to the Bitcoin landscape. 
Decentralization is the reason for bitcoins existence, and its very lifeblood. 
Currently, some 70% of hashrate is manufactured by a single company, and this same company is suspected to directly or indirectly control or substantially influence the operation of conservatively 50% operational mining hash rate. (see the other front page post on the subject) 
This same organization is now pushing for extreme and controversial, and by the assessment of many prominent experts, dangerous protocol changes, and is tacitly threatening to openly attack bitcoin as we know it if we don't play by their rules. 
This dynamic is a perversion of the decentralized ethos of the project, and is a clear and present danger to the continued autonomy of the system.

I'm just observing that the relationship between something having value and being a store of value are inseparable. Something can not have value... hold value... be a store of value... if whatever value it has is immediately lost. Store of value property is necessary, maybe, maybe not sufficient. Supposed utility as transfer mechanism is contingent on it's ability to transfer value, not the other way around... Transferability is also important, but the transactions themselves are less so... Value is like potential energy, utility is like kinetic energy. I have a very valuable thing if I _can_ transfer it to create utility. But I don't actually need to make the transaction in order for the value to exist.


This is what I was getting at. This conversation is around BIP148, NYA, and in general, how the _Holding_ Economic Majority-- not the wallets, not the exchanges, not even the transacting (spending*) users affect whether a coin has value, and therefore will be mined, and therefore, whether it will have blocks and be useful/exist. 


Exchanges could certainly cause friction by refusing to allow conversion into a coin they don't favor, but ultimately, exchanges serve their customers needs. 
If users held their own keys (like in OP), the exchanges wouldn't matter here: People could dump their coins by giving them away for free to children, not rely on some middleman. If Exchanges don't allow users to access/fork their coins as desired, they aren't serving their customers, and should be wiped out. (or their customers can't expect to be real holders )
*Spending users don't matter if all they do is spend. Transaction receiving users do, because they are becoming holders. holders _do_ mater.

But I am increasingly skeptical of this given recent events. Not sure if we'll last until the commodity hardware epoch at this rate. Pow change is a viable last resort, but we'll need more evidence of urgency... I am increasingly interested in the bip148 philosophy, which I can expand on if you're interested. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:15:47
So this gets philosophical--
The best answer to your question:


Is yes: Signed binaries--
Building from source ensures you have the right configuration for your system, and is the best way to know exactly what code you are running-- but if somebody else has the exact same system as you, you can have them build it, cryptographically sign the binaries (executable files) and then you can run them. Here you are trusting the person who has signed the binaries' judgment about the functionality of the executables they have given you.
Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there is no signed binary available for UASF right now...
The worst way you can participate is by simply changing your user string with a simple text editor, but not actually run the UASF code... _maybe_ better than nothing, but from a philosophocal point of view, is pretty meaningless unless you actually _do_ get the correct binaires before flag day.
The point of UASF is not about _signaling_ or _voting_-- it's about you, the user, activating the soft fork by running the code which adds the Segwit Rules to Bitcoin, and actually rejecting blocks that are invalid under the new, tightened, but more useful rules.
_Hold on there buckaroo!_ There _do_ appear to be signed binaries for Windows:
This is probably the best option for Windows users who are unable to build the code-- But you have to trust Luke-Jr or laanwj to understand and endorse quality code.

Without philosophical gravitas, Bitcoin cannot have value as currency: If it somehow transpires that the "pragmatic", under-principled corporate coin manages to retain value short-term, it will eventually succumb to the forces that created it-- and compromise principle after principle for the wrong reasons, until unrecognizable. 
It may even be possible that this Frankenstein maintains value as perhaps as some sort of cryptoequity in the industry that has captured it, but there will always be demand for a stable Bitcoin.

Bitmain probably has between 50 and 60% hashrate today smurfed out across several pools. the point of all this is that we are learning, as users, to operate in a somewhat mining-centralized world. The gambit of UASF is partially that the economy can force even centralized miners to behave. Just like Bitmain is forced to hide it's face and behave (to some extent) in today's Bitcoin.

You can argue that economic activity gives bitcoin _Value_ as an economic instrument _via_ holders holding speculatively, but it's an indirect effect. Nobody would hold bitcoin if it had zero utility, and one way for it to have utility is by a means of transaction. Another way for it to have utility is as a store of value. If bitcoin is not a store of value, it will have no value.
In terms of the market value of the coin: the amount of electricity you can buy with a blockreward, holders are everything that matters in the world today. Sure, it's nice that exchanges have arisen to reduce friction, but they are the tail: not the dog. Their existence might increase the value of the entire ecosystem, but Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;goods, or Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;forkcoin barter are possible without exchanges.

We need an open-source trustnet on the blockchain.
Just a WIP and an incomplete writeup on how to encode a trust graph between addresses!
trusted addresses can choose to propagate their trust to other addresses using, non-critically, a page rank algoithm. If someone you trust trusts a third party, you inherit some of the trust. You choose, as a truster, which nodes of the graph to trust before calculating trust relationship with another node.

Bigger blocks HF doesn't have nearly enough support. If they fork off with their 40% or whatever, UASF-BITCOIN will dominate Bitcoin-- non-upgraded, non-HF miners will follow UASF effortlessly, and we win. UASF/Bitcoin 60% BU 40%.
Another SF to become fully incompatible with UASF.SW would be cute, but ultimately irrelevant. The market will decide on the price of each soft fork and everybody is happy. I suspect Segwit will win.

If you agree that a large quantity of coins are held, holders are objectively the economic majority. People taking place in transactions aren't necessarily holding anything. Coins on finex, to the extent that they contribute to the economic majority relevant here, are being held on behalf of holders. If Finex has their own holdl stash, or exit scam their customers, they could become part of the economic majority, but their transaction volume means nothing.

You seem genuine, I would suggest going back and reading the mailing list. There are thousands of pages of communication between the global network of people working on bitcoin. If you read them, you will reflect on these questions and see them in a new light. Sorry if other commenters sound dismissive, but this topic is much deeper than it may appear at its surface and your post suggests you are looking at this project like an equities investor looks at a stock, which is not a particularly useful mindset if you truly want to get your mind around the relevant bitcoin philosophy required to appreciate the subtlety of the topic you are asking about.

Curious: why are you opposed to segwit?
I imagine that LN will offload all the small transactions and we will be ok for the foreseeable future-- (I have calculated elsewhere that we could see Bitcoin pushing $100K fiat valuation with a conservative use of metcalfes law given SW and LN alone, with some conservative assumptions about adoption-price correlation) and in the coming years, we will get a sidechain-based solution that gives another exponential boost on top of the exponential boost we will get from LN.

A while back, bitmain was sitting on all the mining rewards instead of selling them on the market. Not sure if this practice has continued or if they ever sold the mining rewards. At one point, they had more bch than satoshi. They were subsidizing bch hashrate with income from bitcoin.

you will get downvoted by the fork brigade, but you're spot on.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:22:40
I think something like a probabilistic transaction of sorts could be done on bitcoin using implemented script.
Bob pays Alice to release a signed transaction which Alice can reclaim using time locks after dt. Bob hashes Alice's salt plus an nonce and the script verifies that the result is less than some value, similar to regular bitcoin mining. The threshold difficulty and the value of dt determine how difficult it is for Bob to claim the transaction. Bob's luck in finding the hash produces the entropy.
Not sure how to achieve atomicity of the Bob pays Alice transaction.
Actually, you don't need it. Alice's transaction to Bob is how Bob accepts payment. Bob only broadcasts the pair of transactions if he finds the hash in time.
I'll add that the cost of the hashing Bob had to do is a point of consideration, but I think somehow, as long as the price of hashing approaches the worth of the locked bitcoin by the end of the period, the economics would balance out. Bob will get to a point of attrition where he concludes he simply wasn't lucky. Interestingly, this mechanism could also be used as a type of hashrate cost derivative.

Well, op, if you wind up doing the legwork on this, I'm sure it will be quite enlightening... I'm guessing the fees have stayed somewhat constant (or maybe even gone down on average) in sat/byte... but transaction size has gone _down_ as the fiat value of bitcoin has gone _up_... a phenomenon which might be asymptotic as available bandwidth is filled. I.e. Bitcoin value of transaction outputs is stabilizing.

a fork with more than 30% of the economy will have more than 1% hashrate.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:26:56
So as far as I know, all publicly comitted UASF hashrate is parked as Slush. There is up to 1% network hashrate that I am aware of... A point with UASF is that game theoretically, they benefit from signaling _on_ 8/1, or turning on more hashrate on 8/1-- I'd guess less than 5% right now. If Bitfury gets back in, like could happen if Bip91 fails, we are looking at some 20-25% known max UASF Hashrate- but Bitfury has been a bit difficult to read lately.
If all currently signalling Segwit hashrate goes, it will be 45%... this could also happen if Bip91 fails.
I'm guessing Bip91 will work, and we'll never know how much mining teeth 148 has-- but the real question is economic support: which chain would be worth more? which chain's hashrate would grow, and which would shrink? Vanilla Core? Some 2MB fork? 148? Blockreward buyers and people dumping the coins they don't want will decide this. the miners have to follow them.
I just noticed, 141 hashrate is getting mighty close to 51% right now... we might just see a regular old 141 activation if people want to avoid all this bullshit.

wrong. see: ETC/ETH. If there are split tokens, exchanges will let you trade them as long as we have an apetite to pay exchange fees. Plus, the exchanges don't get to magically decide which coin the economy wants just by delisting one side of the fork or the other. People will go to the exchanges that list what they want to trade. Ps. Bitpay is going to be gone soon. They are clearly in death throes. With LN, and increased crypto adoption, they are obsolete-- plus, they can't even seem to survive in this, their native [congested] network condition, without being at the teet of bitmain.

I respectfully disagree: Once hardfork features become something which can be fought for politically, it will become an ever worse attack surface, which will be attacked with greater frequency and fervor. Which is why I called out that scaling is only one head of this hydra.
The "scaling problem" is solved for a few years at least without the hard fork, which adds negligible capacity compared to LN.

This is all they need to do to make money. Potentially a _lot_ of money-- way more than the value of the coins they produce. They don't need the market to go back up again-- They just need it to go down when they think it will.

Satoshi's vision was to create digital money. Money doesn't have rules that change based on political _quid pro quo_. That was exactly the phenomenon we are trying to destroy in this project, and exactly what would happen if the "2x" part of segwit 2x happens.

Hard forks are reserved for situations where Bitcoin's functionality is at existential risk: eg. Bitcoin would cease to exist sans hardfork. This is not policy: it's a technical necessity which relates to the viability of competing forks.
If users (or a subset of users) decide that Bitcoin is UASF Bitcoin, then from their perspective, miners' inability to produce valid blocks (for whatever reason-- brain damage or covert state coercion perhaps) is _de-facto_ a technical problem. an existential dilemma to the system which can only be addressed with POW change.

You're right, it's a pretty outrageous situation in the extreme formulation, but I could easily posit less extreme plays which would yield less than a ten fold margin over honest mining for a year. Irl, in terms of more realistic trades, the threshold for shorting to be more profitable than honest mining might only be on the months to a year timescale... But who knows what the projections for maintaining hardware near monopoly are? 
By the looks of it, the global BTC exchange volume is something like 250K BTC, not counting futures- so that can put some of these numbers in perspective.

On Bitmex, the current open interest is 14mil XBTUSD contracts, worth 5-6k BTC,

you just answered your own question: a 51% attack is an effect of centralized mining power. The only reason to want high hashrate is due to it's perceived ability to keep miners decentralized due to the expense of catching up to the network hashrate.


But still, small decentralized hashrate will always be better than large, central hashrate.

It's a lot more complicated than that, and I _do_ understand what I'm talking about here... yes, _optimally_ the market will recover between spells of fuckery, but this is not necessary for miners shorting to be more profitable than honest mining. Clearly, they will make more if they can fuck over the market every tuesday-- but _how many_ times they need to do this is a complicated question with a minimum of one.
Things that make their shorting more profitable are: having larger margin in their account, making larger market moves, making repeated plays...
It's simple-minded to think the market needs to fully recover to be more profitable.
Consider Bitcoin is now ~2500USD... Jihan probably mines ~800 blocks a day, and figure he thinks he can mine for another year or so until the government shuts him down or his current batch of hardware expires or gets deprecated by killing asicboost... He will mine about 300K BTC in blockrewards this year on this hardware. These are worth just shy of $1B assuming the price more or less stays the same... now assume he takes those 300KBTC, puts them in a 20X short... and drives the market down to $1K by some HF fuckery or something... He has made $1500[profit = price0 - price to close] * 300K * 20xmargin = 9B less some fees and shit.
Does he really think he can keep his little game running for the other nine years it would take to break even being honest? If so, he might be better off being honest, but otherwise, it's profitable to do a one-time short. a massive 20x short that would either take massive balls, or the ability to reliably manipulate the market to pull off.
This all assumes the hardware is a sunk cost-- but really, If you're shorting, the total marginal hardware/power cost is _less_ than if honest mining...
This is just one scenario... Maybe not even a particularly realistic one... but in general, with the ability to reliably manipulate the market, honest mining is not necessarily more profitable or less risky than shorting. In reality, the equations a re probably a lot more complicated since we don't know what the sunk hardware outlay is (I've suspected Bitmain is subsidizing their own hardware with the profits from customer purchased hardwae, something between 30% to 100%) and we don't know how much Bitcoin margin they have available to short with...

Why wait for a useless block increase? This is a perfectly valid attitude to have even today.
There is certainly a soft fork or cryptographic application which can provide great scaling-- even if it takes a couple tries to find the right recipe. Something like extension blocks is always a possible last resort-- but I don't think it will even come to that.

If the economy disagrees, well, that's not my problem.

I would guess that fee pressure would be a large incentive to adopt the solutions quickly. Many wallets already support the changes, so this lag time will only take as long as users need to dip their toes in segwit transaction formats pond and get used to the way things will be in the future.
 (many wallets already support)
Philosophically, I don't think the "scaling problem" is any sort of existential risk to Bitcoin, so I would rather not see any emergency, stopgap hardforks used in this type of circumstance, but that horse is so dead I won't tire you with more explanation there.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:11:02
If Bitcoin is adding users linearly (users tomorrow = usersToday + k), and each user, new and old, only wants to make the same number of transactions a day as users did, on average, yesterday, we would have _linear_ growth in transaction demand. 
In reality, we are hoping that Bitcoin adds users in a superlinear, or even exponential rate: (usersTomorrow = usersToday*k) -- and this is plausible from a network dynamics perspective.
In reality, also, it is probably the case that as the Bitcoin network attracts more users, the existing users and newcomers will want to use Bitcoin even more than they do _today_ (due to network effects mostly, you are more likely to find a counterparty who wants to transact in Bitcoin as the percentage of bitcoin users increases...)
Here, we see that in an ideal world, we clearly have exponential growth in both users, and maybe even transactions per user, creating _super exponential demand_.
However, increasing the blocksize only gives us a linear factor of transaction capacity... and really no positive improvement in any efficiency parameters. We increase the blocksize by a factor of k, we get a factor of k more transactions. It's linear transaction capacity in blocksize. If we wanted to keep up with demand, we would need to be increasing the blocksize _exponentially_. This is clearly untenable in anything other than the extreme short term. _maybe_ we could tolerate a one-time increase, but there is absolutely no way we are going to be able to increase the blocksize exponentially sustainably. Consider, again, that even if we _do_ increase the blocksize exponentially to keep up with demand, the size of the blockchain goes super-exponential!
This would be an engineering disaster! And more notably, probably _not even noticeable to user experience in anything other than the extreme short timescale!_ We pay all the costs (centralization, network capacity saturation, p2p network issues... etc), and get _no noticeable benefit in return!_
Consider, on the other hand, the second set of solutions which seek to use layer 2, or other innovative technologies seeking to get... more transactions per transaction... That is, using on-chain transactions to settle some number of off-chain transactions where n is larger than one. These solutions get more capacity per transaction-blockspace, and any improvements to the underlying capacity are multiplicative or even exponential depending on assumptions! It _is_ possible for exponential scaling solutions to keep up with exponential growth in demand.
Why not both? you might add?
The solution clearly involves exponential-family solutions like LN: without them, we can never expect to hopelessly expand the blocks until the network falls over, so any solution not involving them is DOA-- but why not both?
Indeed, I don't think anyone is suggesting _not trying to improve on-chain capacity at all_, and both camps have their preferred methods for doing this... The seasoned engineers are looking to find ways to improve the efficiency of layer-1 (Schnorr, MAST, fancy shit we haven't invented yet) to again, effectively get more transactions per underlying resource unit... while the less-experienced users and engineers might still be clamoring to "throw more resources at the problem".
Once we get used to using L2, I think we will find that there will be entirely new families of optimizations we can get through more creative use of L2, while maintaining the trustless, decentralized properties of Bitcoin, but we need to walk before we can run. We should be working on as engineers, and discussing as a community how to fly after we can run, and maybe now you can understand why nobody should really want to talk about _crawling faster_

As I said, that's not my main point. It was just an aside. Anyway, I'm willing to swallow the extra data somehow because I think segwit is worth it, unlike larger blocks which only scale transactions linearly with blocksize. My main objection to larger blocks, besides the centralization increase (which will worsen when we go to 4, 8, 16MB blocks) is the hard fork upgrade path. I am fundamentally opposed to upgrades via hard fork, and the accompanying political _quid pro quo_, which is diametrically opposed to the ethos and logos of Bitcoin.

A small blocksize increase harms decentralization. The next blocksize increase kills decentralization and non colocated centralized mining operations. The hard fork after that raises the block subsidy.

one measly bitcoin per wallet?

Your node is the only reliable source of information about Bitcoin. If you run a good node implementation, there can't be a split and Bitcoin will always be whole. The worst that can happen is that miners quit mining blocks for your node. There is no reliable way of predicting whether that will happen. All miners could get arrested tomorrow, and shut their hardware down... Your node would say: where'd all the blocks go? There are a few other unlikely things that could cause blocks to stop being mined, but I wouldn't worry about it until it happens.

Interesting that both crashes coincided with google results Leading the BTC/dollar rate. 2 points != significant data.

You can watch only the address and keep the private key offline.

hopefully he will back it up if there are more bitcoins...

Pretty nice hedge.

Hmm... this article is about a mining 51% attack.
Imagine a conspiracy in which a 60% stakeholder in all existing BTC wanted to drive the market up or down... by placing buy and sell orders... Potentially buying them from himself under the guise of dummy BTC addresses. It seems it would be easy to drive the price up, but more difficult to drive it down?

Interesting indeed...
If it were to be the case that a major player possessed not the majority of the mining bandwidth, but instead, the majority of bitcoins, would it be the case that this player could arbitrarily manipulate the market or  exchange rates?
If so, what consequences does this have for the protocol, and:
Would it be feasible for any known institution to clandestinely or overtly become this player?

you have agency for civil disobedience, or to leave the country, or be complacent.

OSX is BSD-based. IIRC, iOS is actually linux...?
*edit* nope... both OSX and iOS are BSD-based... still "unix-like" though I guess.

What happens to addresses that are discarded by vanity generation? I know address space is very large, but I think GPU vanity generators could burn through some amount of them...
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:04:01
yep. This is awesome.

I think the point is that in a way, the "law" as arbitrated by the US carries no moral weight or credibility. The fact that that particular system believes someone is a menace to society should mean exactly jack to anyone actually following recent events.
The fact that that particular institution has used defamatory rhetoric towards its enemies to drum up some sort of manufactured credibility should mean even less to us at this point.

yes-- seamlessly-- with user supervision controls, e.g. dear browser, please ask me before spending 0.001 BTC on a site view.

The comments on the related articles to this episode have been mixed-- ranging from appropriate to ignorant. People do not seem to understand at large, that showing your private key is the same thing as giving the public their checking account or credit card credentials. People seem to want to paint this as a security flaw in "Bitcon" (what a cute nickname).

Ask for a bitcoin ;) --should've mentioned it sooner though... "Sure, I'll tell you about bitcoins... for a bitcoin!"

How would anyone expect to get any mining done on an android device?
