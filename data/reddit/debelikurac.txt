What do you think?
Solution 1 or solution 2?
What happened before in history?
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:40:39
Yes, like "winners" on betathome or something like that... House always wins. Damn it!
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:00:41
Dont buy, DIP is coming soon. Buy at 4500.

Trust me, i learned my lesson.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:53:24
Do not buy at hype.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:52:54
This is a reason:
Tell me, what do you think its going next?
Solution 1 or Solution 2?
Be realistic.

What about this shoulder?
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:00:03
What price for 1?
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:31:04
Its crashing.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:43:00
I will try. When price droped to 5900 before 7 days, i almost kill myself. But i didnt sell nothing. I have 2 weeks to pay rent, what will be next? PUMP to 12500 or dump to 8500?
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:37:21
I know, i am idiot. I didnt write this to beg for money or something like that, i just try to warn other people like me to not invest recklessly.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:10:47
What about this?
Ok, it will bounce back, but another DIP is coming by the end of the week. It will crash to 4000-4500.
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:31:23
Should i buy Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash?
What about this sell orders?
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:15:01
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:39:17
Should i pull out money with 33% loss or should i wait? Do you think in next 2 weeks, price will go up or down? I have 2 weeks to pay rent. I need to pay a rent at 28.02.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:48:07
I wrote ABOUT 3 months ago, i will check the correct date if you want to know, it was december, price was about 14850 or 15150, something like that.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:00:11
Bulltrap. Soon under 8k. Next week 6k again. DIP
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:39:48
Doesnt matter, cause people are here only for the money. A lot of people bought bitcoin yesterday at 10200 cause they believe they will make money, but big whales fuck them. Selloff starts now... After 2 days price will be 8000, then panic sell, 6000...
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:46:08
I didnt mean literary "tonight".
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:43:08
Yes, its back! This is not pump and dump scheme, this is not big games of whales, we all will be a milionare! Today i sold my house. I will invest 100000 dolars in bitcoin... I will be a billionare. Dude, we fix recesion in whole world, no hungry people anymore... Just invest in bitcoin, you dont need job...
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:09:55
I expect crash soon. Nothing can grow infinitely.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:59:01
Yeah, HOLD! So i can cut my losses...
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:26:00
Argumentum ad hominem.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:30:12
Going down.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:55:01
