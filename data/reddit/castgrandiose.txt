Yes, per the blockchain:

Bitflur is a scam. Lots of reports like yours and I'm adding my experience to this list. Hope these cunts go to jail.

hard to tell, did you receive anything afterwards? Even an email confirmation?

You are definitely correct as far as the "insurance" goes. I had previously leveraged the FDIC to get my money out of a bank that had frozen it without contacting me first. Banks seem to listen when the FDIC knocks on their doors.

The irony is so think.. 
You've been selling Bitcoin? Let's limit your account for 180 days and not give you access to your money! 
Fuck you PayPal, at least with banks you have some recourse through the FDIC...

Campbx is owned by Keyur Mithawala and his sister is helping him run it, there is also a support team in India. 
Funny enough, I have never had a problem with them. Campbx is very low volume, money can only come in through Money Orders via mail, the API is relatively basic. 
But if all you're looking to do is buy and maybe sell some coins, you end up paying less than localbitcoins. 
I have actually never had a bad experience with them and they seem to have steered clear of drama like gox or more recently bitstamp (hot wallet issues).

Because their entire model is shady as fuck and they have a vested interest in keeping volume up. 
I have used them myself enough times to turn gift cards which I got in LBC into BTC and applied for "VIP Status", but got turned down despite having decent volume and great feedback. Guessing they're simply not interested in "honest" business and know exactly who their other customers are...
Their reasoning: I "cancelled" a few orders right after accepting them because their site won't show you the actual shipping charges before you accept. More often that not some guy in South Asia wants a gadget shipped directly from the US but conveniently leaves out shipping charges of $50. The stupid interface won't even show you the items/wishlist before you accept it, so you're then forced to either cancel or take the additional hit.  
It's a nice concept in theory, but still full of flaws and I'm guessing a huge percentage of their proceeds is probably from crime.

i also received no answer.. i'm going to go with this is either a scam or not anywhere close to operational. 
Nothing about this site gives me the warm and fuzzies, spelling mistakes, poorly designed etc.
