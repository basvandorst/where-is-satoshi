All the "jobs 4 btc" portals so far have maybe 1 or 2 real jobs on offer, the rest being ridiculous shit like "want simple ios app, will pay $20 in btc" or "will retouch your old photos for BTC". How is your service going to be different?
Also, how exactly do you feel you're qualified to provide "Help on how to create the best CV" (quote from your site) when your ad writing skills amount to "paste two all caps paragraphs into reddit"?

It's still about 1000 times funnier than that "Boondock Saints Bitcoin People" comic that made it to the front page of a few days ago.

As always, it's probably a good idea to try a small amount first to check that (1) coinbase works for you and (2) your bank won't block the transaction in any way.

So you're asking whether you can validate that a given private key corresponds to a given public key? Of course you can do that, otherwise how could you import a private key into your wallet and send from there?

Yeah, just yesterday I saw a dozen nerdy teenagers riding the bus, complaining about how it was impossible for them to get apps for their phones...

Oh come on, traditional media writing terrible articles with misleading headlines is okay as long as it portrays bitcoin in a good light? If Bloomberg had a similar article on Ripple, using sob stories of relatable individuals as the main source of information, everyone on here would be laughing about it.

So not only are you not growing tired of that "change the world" hype, a two paragraph forum post is now enough to get you excited?

There seems to be a huge movement on this sub though that says that developing countries and those who have not had access to money transfer services before are the most important future markets for Bitcoin. Also, low tx fees are one of the main point that people advertise BTC with. I get your point, but there's a real conflict between two legitimate interests here and it would be nice if we had a better solution than higher tx fees or pruning.

Yeah I totally agree! Now everyone else go use your bitcoin so I can hoard it and become filthy rich in a few months!

This is a problem - very few people are willing to be paid in bitcoin, and the job offers for bitcoin that I have seen are mostly ridiculously low in terms of salary.
And as long as wages, utilities and suppliers all have to be paid in bitcoin, the only part of the BTC revenue you can _keep_ in BTC is the profits/salary you pay yourself as an owner. Now factor in the number of businesses for which BTC revenue is more than a few percent. So in the end, the number of businesses who don't immediately convert everything is vanishingly small.

People giving mtgox the benefit of doubt multiple times is what made the goxcrash so big. Just saying.
