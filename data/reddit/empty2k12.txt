This tool is in no way meant to replace a full node when accepting transactions! It is meant for the consumers that are seeing blocks go by without getting a confirmations, for those that paid not enough in fees. They don't want to refresh a block explorer each block to check if the transaction has confirmed. You open the site, enter TXID and do something else. When Bitcoin Unlimited hard-forks, this tool will ne be needed anymore.

There are thousands of mempools. Each node has it's own mempool which is a temporary storage of transactions broadcasted to the network. Nodes can choose how many transactions to keep in their mempool. You are right that most nodes evict transaction that have not been confirmed after 72 hours. I have gotten the number 75k at the time of the posting from  though another site showed 30k transactions minutes after I posted the link.

For a few weeks I have been trying to convince my parents to buy in. I myself have a coin but they are still reluctant. 
I think this is due to them not properly understanding everything. 
I addition to seeing the cash flow into Bitcoin, it would be good to provide a "parent-proof" wiki with simple and not very technical explanations of terms like "Hardware Wallet", "Exchange", while also explaining things like basic wallet security, best practices and so on. 
Maybe also a little video for each of these pages for easy digestion.

It can't really be called ddosing but repeatedly requesting data from a server will use it's full capacity. Blockchain.info for example allows 10 API requests per second tops and if you manage to get over that they will IP ban you. Depending on your Internet Speed you could request data far more often than 10 times a second while using a while true. 
A simpler solution is to get the time using System.nanoTime() every execution and comparing it to the last request date. 
Something like this:
     long lastReq = 0;
     while(true) {
         if(lastReq + DELAYINNANOS &lt; System.nanoTime()) 
             YOUR REQUEST HERE
             lastReq = System.nanoTime();
         } 
     }

If you want realtime updates I suggest you look for a WebSocket Bitcoin Price API. Else a update every five to 10 minutes should be sufficient. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:30:40
That should NOT be in a while(true) loop. You are spamming (ddosing) the servers with requests! You better implement a thread that is executed every five minutes that is enough. 
Also please pay more attention on spaces: Sometimes after a comma or a plus you put a space, sometimes not.

Nodes don't activate it. Hashpower does. Around 25% of the last 1000 blocks were signalling SegWit which is not very much IMO.

To elaborate on this answer:
You might want to tumble your coins, which you can do with JoinMarket. This will mix your coins with coins from other people for a fee. That way it cannot be traced where the coins came from or where they went.
The other way is to run a JoinMarket Yield Generator:
This way you will be offering your liquidity for people wishing to mix their coins. Your coins will be mixed as a byproduct. You can earn some cents in fees by doing this but it requires your PC to be on 24/7

/Android/data/ is wrong. You don't want to access the internal storage but rather the /data/ directory of your phone. You might need to root your device to access this file.

Yeah. Nowadays a lot of people are "investing" by running a [Joinmarket Yield Generator]( Basically you are offering your coins for coinjoins and get a fee for doing so.
I am currently getting 6.5% ROI per annum for simply letting my PC run 24 hours.

You should just say there's a bug not how to produce it. 
Have you tried contacting them via social networks like Twitter. For Twitter ask them to follow you so you can DM(Direct Message) them.
