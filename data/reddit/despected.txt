I haven't been around that long in this world, but I do know that when something is overhyped and increases in price drastically ($250 to $800 in a few months?) that is more than likely won't maintain its value. I don't see BTC being used as its own currency, only as a payment method to eliminate/reduce fees. I will keep majority of my BTC incase in wrong but i'm not going to blindly follow BTC like it seems everyone else is doing.

I mean an actual graph of the price history where you can see how the market reacts realtime to scenarios, for example today we would mark the news from the CEO of Blockchain and see that there was a crash just moments after we realized it was not as big as anticipated.
EDIT: That would be a great source of information for the graph.

Bitfunder has been down for a few months, with users funds "goxed" if I may, LMB-holdings is currently not allowing shares as of February 23rd (hence the price rise, along with the grand opening of course.)

I had 4.3 BTC on my BTC-e account that I like to use to do small trades with, I decided I wanted to withdraw 2.3 BTC to my wallet, so I started the withdraw process which I have done dozens of times before. I put the address and the amount of BTC I wished to withdraw. It prompted me to enter my 2FA which I did, after that successfully went through it said to check my e-mail to confirm as usual. I checked my e-mail and there was nothing there, I go back to BTC-e and I see a remaining balance of 2 BTC (2.3 missing) with no trace. I have experienced coins not being sent right after confirming the e-mail but ive never had the e-mail not come and still take my coins. I sent in a ticket two days ago with still no response. Any ideas/similar experiences?
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:39:51
Why are you speaking in present tense? There is no business plan any longer, there is no company any longer. 
If you read the post by cryptocyprus a few months ago you would know that there were no funds to keep going after what happened with Bitfunder. You got one thing to ask Danny, and you ask a question he has personally answered many, many times.
Another classic example of the impeccable performance of the Bitcoin community.

If you were around, it wasn't $115, it was $75, the price went from $125 to $75 the day that DPR was arrested, followed by the rally.

Everyone who is on board with Bitcoin is thinking just because they have a small reserve they will become rich, this may sound odd but people have too much certainty which will more than likely boost the price even more causing a big crash. For Bitcoin to succeed as a currency or payment system its value doesn't have to be this high, just because it is being more widely adopted doesn't necessarily mean it will increase in value. I have approximately 200 BTC but I am going to be selling some soon as I truly do believe there is a huge impending crash (under $100) within the next few months. I am using this post as a point of reference, would love to hear your input.

If I had $100,000 in Bitcoin, and sent it back and forth at lets say, 3 cents per transaction, assuming 10 minutes per block. I could make up for 14,400,000 of that figure, and it would cost me around $5 to do so, and most of my day. These figures are bogus, and hold absolutely no weight in terms of how much was actually SPENT.

I ate here about a 6 months ago right after the new year with some friends. We randomly stumbled upon it then saw all of the Bitcoin accepted here stickers.
Obviously I took it upon myself to tell everyone the meal was on me and get whatever you want.
Took us about two hours before we finished because the waiter was flirting with the other waitress sitting down, had his back to us and we had to walk up for him every time because he didn't acknowledge us.
8 average poutines and 2 alright pizza's later I ask to pay with Bitcoin. I was then informed by a very knowledgeable person that they weren't currently accepting Bitcoin because the CEO has died. I explained to him I wouldn't have continued to order these average at best poutines if I was told that you did not accept Bitcoin anymore and that was the only reason we ordered so much, and that when he clearly heard several times that we were talking about Bitcoin him taking the initiative to explain to us that they didn't take it would've saved me about a hundred dollars. Not a big deal though, just not eating at this shitty joint until they get some new staff.

If a Bitcoin transaction shows up on the network instantly, however you have to wait for a confirmation before you can guarantee that the Bitcoins are yours, and the thing people are worried about is that someone will go to multiple locations with the same key and spend at the same time. Would a possible solution be that the payment terminal check the blockchain roughly 10 seconds after the payment on the incoming address to see if there have been multiple attempted payments? So if there are 10 outgoing payments on that address you simply reject the payment? I did not do any research on this and not sure if its been suggested a thousand times before. If it has, please say so and I will put my head down in shame. Thanks.

If you looked at my post on my forum account, I was attending the Toronto Bitcoin Meetups in Toronto for months.. Because I live in Toronto, because it's where I am from. 
Also my apology would be something along the lines of, I am sorry that your "friend" decided to make an investment in not only the very risky bitcoin space.. but in an even more risky investment within that risky investment, and then was surprised when it didn't work out. But instead of dealing with it like a normal person and learning from your mistakes, and that it'll be tough for the next few years but you'll eventually get over it he decided to take the coward's way out. I say this as someone who has had suicides in my own family due to financial mistakes, and I did not shed a single tear and when I think of them the only other word that comes to mind is "coward" so don't take it personally. Rule number one of investments is don't invest more than you can afford to lose, it applies the most to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin could go to zero now and it would suck but I wouldn't lose sleep over it, nevermind considering taking my own life.

If you are fortunate enough to have several android devices, you can sync your 2FA to all of them. When adding 2FA to an account, scan with all of your devices and they will all be synchronized. 
I do this with three separate devices, one on my person one in my safety deposit box.

How did you come to that conclusion from what you just read? I look at it as he put a picture of a Ferrari on his FB account, a picture that was taken two years ago that clearly isn't his. 
The first course of action someone takes when they see that picture, instead of taking 5 seconds to do a reverse image look-up or perhaps rephrase statements from "Danny has a Ferrari!" to "Danny has a picture of a Ferrari!"
My take on what his intentions were with that picture is to show that people in the Bitcoin community don't have the common sense to look into something further than what they plainly see in front of them. So every story you read every bit on information you hear you automatically classify as true, and that's how you were trolled.
There is much more to what happened than any of us know, and that's just the common sense I was talking about, and we will find out more with time.

No transaction, no e-mail. My only proof is the fact that my last trade history is a purchase for 4.3~ BTC and I have a balance of 2 BTC. This is why this is a weird situation because I always had to confirm the e-mail before the coins were sent.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:23:38
Correct me if im wrong, shouldn't it not have taken the coins until I confirmed the transaction on my e-mail?

You can post about UPS getting hacked and credit/debit information getting compromised, however these credit and debit cards are insured and if there is a fraudulent payment, you are more than likely reimbursed.
If a website that stores Bitcoins gets hacked, you lose your Bitcoins and more than likely they are gone forever.
Posting these things does not give Bitcoin credibility and not sure how it is relevant to @_date: 2014-03-01 23:56:38
NEOBEE is ran by its CEO, Danny Brewster. You are purchasing Profit Shares, not equity shares, you have zero voting rights and do not own any of the business but are entitled to the profits it generates. 100% of the profits are distributed to the shareholders, until you receive 0.0035/BTC per share, so if you bought during the IPO you will at least get 100% of your money back and a little more.
After 0.0035BTC/share is paid out, you will still get dividends but not near as much because LMB-holdings which is the parent company to NEOBEE will be taking their profits as well.
The current profit share price per NEOBEE share is 0.0055, you will almost certainly eventually get 0.0035 back of that, so your investments for future dividends is 0.002BTC depending on how you look at it.

The graph looks like the edge of a cliff, the worrying thing is that they have never seen a drop like this in the whole companies history, you can say its because of the report for their quarterly earnings but it has a large role to play in Bitcoin.
Ask yourself, if you wanted to keep other big retailers/merchants from accepting Bitcoin, what do you do? You show that it causes your stock price to crash. I think their stock price is being manipulated to scare off others from following in their footsteps. Thoughts?

Tiger direct starts accepting Bitcoin, Overstock.com starts accepting Bitcoin. The price hardly moves, might have even gone down a little. Now, what would happen if they stopped accepting Bitcoin? If Tigerdirect, or Overstock decided to stop taking Bitcoins, what kind of price changes do you think we would see? I personally predict we would see a substantial, even more than the MtGox issue. The issue with MtGox is as temporary as it gets, but having a vendor do testing with Bitcoin to see if it was a feasible and deciding to take it off, it will take Bitcoin out of its element. Id love to hear what you guys have to say.
