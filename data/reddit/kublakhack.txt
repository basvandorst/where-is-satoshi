You're not wrong, but there is definitely a reason to expect something different from coinbase. One of the key selling points of bitcoin is the speed in which it is transferred, so there is an expectation there. When you order something from Amazon, you're getting a physical product that must be shipped. When you buy an ebook however, you get it immediately.

yeah. my first buy on coinbase took 7 days I think. It is the most simple system to use in my limited experience. I bought right before it dipped down to $50 awhile back. I bought at $100. Luckily, it quickly rebounded back to $100 in about the week that it took me to finally get my bitcoin. Best of luck to  you, but there is a reason most people don't use coinbase.

I'm not sure I'm following you exactly. But you would know because they wouldn't be able to sell you bitcoins that they don't have. When you talk about a "reserve" it sounds like you're talking about issuing a paper note that represents the promise of its bitcoin equivalency at a later date. Is that what you mean?
 I'm not sure why people would go for that system. With gold, there was an advantage (size, weight, etc) to just having paper money to use in its place. I don't see why anyone would ever be convinced to take a paper note "promise" of a bitcoin when actually having the bitcoin itself would be more advantageous in every way.

Ok I understand now. Well, I assume that they would get sued and word would spread about how terrible of a business they are and then people would switch to another exchange. 
It would easily be verifiable whether or not that bitcoin is real since you could just send it to your offline wallet immediately.

Bitcoin trades work through a peer to peer system. But yes it is guaranteed that the "numbers" you receive are a bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-07-01 00:24:03
It can. Banks actually have to have the bitcoins to loan out though. The fed wouldn't be able to just pass out an unlimited number of bitcoins.

cool. Is the fee on coinbase cheaper than dwolla?
