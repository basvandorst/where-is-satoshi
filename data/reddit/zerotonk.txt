Ok, you live in a world where packaged sub-prime loan instruments are not derivatives and the Treasury didn't take over all the mortgages. 


I think you should actually look into the chain of custody of those debt instruments. The goverment actually does own the mortgages, and those securities are really just basically futures contracts. In fact there is a small group of clearing houses that takes custody of almost everything that is traded on NASDAQ and NYSE and they actually *own* just about everything on Earth, from a strictly legal perspective. It's sort of a joke, like a big paper house of cards with circular I.O.U. systems, really.

lol you seem to have no problem partaking in it. Mortgage-backed securities are what some people refer to as "derivatives", bro. And I never said leveraging is why Lehman crashed, only that the fallout from the derivative markets crashing is what took Lehman down. The derivatives markets would be the first casualties of an increase in interest rates, as mortgage lending tightens, my point stands and I feel like you are running in circles here.
As for Fannie and Freddie, the fact is that before the Treasury took over, the government didn't own 95% of all mortgages in America, and now it does. My point that the FED and the Treasury have much greater exposure to the sub-prime debt also stands. You think everyone here is an anarchist child, well, think again. Go back to your college Econ classes, all that ivory tower bullshit is useless in the real world.

The rate in question is the interbank overnight loan interest rate, actually. It's linked to the mortgage rate, and higher mortgage interest rates mean less mortgages get signed in the short-term, which means derivatives tied to those mortgages might take a 30% hit this year. It's the same housing bubble that caused the last cycle of the recession, it hasn't gone away, they just papered it over and let the government take over Fannie and Freddie, which means even more liability for the FED now. Now they are pushing sub-prime lending again, already. Government debt is still rated higher than it should be because the government literally *ran out* credit rating agencies that were downgrading it. Oh yeah and if they aggravate the inflation rate even a little bit, they will have to adjust SS retirees benefits upwards instead of defaulting on *them* also, and that's not a small part of government spending, those SS benefits.

I mean, saying that continuing to peg the CHF to the EURO would hurt exports and tourism is *one* way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it was that real capital was flowing out of Swiss banks and into those in EURO countries and if continued, it would have led to a non-negligable decline in real capital holdings for Swiss banks and society in general. It's true that becoming a citizen is tough there, but it seems not terribly difficult to get a VISA if you have any actual business there. I wish they still did the tax evasion thing, I'd be much more motivated to hold money there and spend time there if they did, lol.

This is not correct. This is the *entire* reason Lehman Bros went under, because the derivatives on mortgage securities are not leveraged 4-to-1, but more like 30-to-1. 


Also incorrect. Please try to at least check [Wikipedia article on Freddie an Fannie]( before you make your case on things like this.

Here's where we start wading into the realities of economic theory, where there may actually be conflicting motivations that change from day to day, and where making predictions on a large scale becomes a very tenuous proposition. If CHF is appreciating versus EURO/USD/CNY then it's a good place to park capital, however not a good place to do manufacturing or export anything from. Negative interest rates are just factored in as an addition corporate tax percentage essentially at that scale, which is still lower than the US corporate tax rate. I predict China's real estate market will cool down and they will repeat the Japanese "lost decade" just like America did, but it will take 30 years for them to start to recovery because of economics of scale. During that time, CNY will get weaker versus USD, but only marginally as the US government has a serious spending habit that they can't get under control and they just print currency to paper over their debts, as like an unspoken national policy now. EURO, honestly I don't have high hopes for the EURO, I don't see how it is even viable for the next 10 years, with the way the economies within it are clashing right now. CHF is a good bet as far as long-term outlook for currency markets, but nowhere near as much potential as bitcoin. Lets hope for a day when the likes of HSBC and GS and the FED don't dominate the entire global financial landscape.

Is that why a statement mocking the economic policy of QE was included by Satoshi in the genesis block? Hard currency will make it harder for nation-states to perform deficit-spending without spiking their bond yields. Bitcoin will make war more expensive and harder to finance and it will make it harder for would-be despots to print currency to enact political hedgemony. That's one of the central purposes of bitcoin, and it's no mistake or little quirky fascination of the userbase. Bitcoin by it's very nature is a thorn in the side of any "fiat" power structure.

Once a general purpose quantum computer is realized, it's unclear whether any encryption algorithm that is not quantum-enabled could ever be completely "quantum safe". ECDSA, does not rely on prime factorization of large numbers, which is an algorithm that is known to be theoretically possible to solve quickly using a qbits. Solving ECDSA hashing in reverse would still require an algorithm that would take advantage of quantum logic gates, and as of yet, such an algorithm has not been published. In that sense, ECDSA can be considered "quantum resistant".

Not true. Even Satoshi, the holder of the largest known personal stores of bitcoin, owns less than 0.1% of all the bitcoin. Doesn't matter over the long run, as long as nobody can print it, it will be a long-term meritocracy.

Yeah I hate it when all the stuff I need to buy starts costing less. I go right into "hoarding" mode, and default on my mortgage loan too.

Well from what I'm reading, Secp256k1 is already not terribly quantum-resistant, so does that really matter? Do you think the NSA really has a 2046-qbit computer capable of performing a modified Shor's algorithm, or will anytime soon? The dev cost of such a computer is likely many times bitcoin's market cap at the moment, and it's on a technological "horizon", meaning it's questionable as to whether it's actually possible. Noise in quantum systems is notoriously difficult to control and exponentially more difficult to control with the number of qbits also, so 2046 may not even be a realistically achievable number...

We're capitalists, we're not anti-bank, in principle. We're just opposed to the current, corrupt banking system.

I'm guessing blockchain is your most likely candidate of a company that was around and in common use back then and is still around now. Pin is not a normally used security tool in bitcoin, but it is used sometimes on physical hardware wallets. One thing I'm wondering is if you actually might have a wallet.dat file somewhere on your hard drive?

Many directions at once. It's a new niche industry that is going to burgeon into a full-fledged financial service industry / cash system / financial instrument. At it's core is truly a "protocol" for what is basically a new layer of the internet, a layer where financial data can be (extremely) securely transferred / notarized in a shared "immutable" public global ledger. Basically it's a new global finance system independent of any government or bank, or really any single group of humans at all. Arguably, bitcoin is a form of singularity.
If you believe [this]( "phase" chart from Barry Silbert, we are nearing a turning point where VC money and development take over after the initial bubble of excitement, but before mass adoption begins.

Hmmmm, people are saying it's centralized, which seems to be *to some degree* true, but sidechains are also decentralized. Decentralized is not completely p2p, but it's a way of *distributing* trust to a network of exchange operators, instead of having to trust just a single one. It's a good idea and I think the community should welcome it.

Did you sign up for an account at blockchain.info and send your bitcoin there? Have any old access details for a blockchain account?

London is still in the running to be the main global financial hub for bitcoin. Lets see if they fuck it up like NYC did.
