Thanks! This was very helpful! I do plan on being objective, but I appreciate the heads up.

I remember the dot com bubble. I'm 28. I spent ten years in the Army after high school.

Great idea. I was going to say that he could copy them, but why not invest with them?

I love this. I'm going to use it and claim it as my own. ;)

The idea was to show him my critical thinking skills, but maybe your right. 2 ears, 1 mouth, and all that stuff.

How does bitcoin threaten fiat currency? I don't understand the push back from governments?

I could see value to a manager who wants to increase the return on his overall portfolio. Plus, a lot of people don't want to go through the hassle of figuring out how to secure their bitcoins. This allows someone else to decide when to buy and sell and take care of the security. There may not be a "need", but I can see why people would prefer to go through someone else if they want to invest in it, but don't completely understand it.

I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm learning. It's an interview for an off-season internship. 
I'm reading everything I can get my hands on about bitcoin and hedge funds. I'm doing my best, but am in NO WAY an expert on either.

Thanks! So no charts or any of that, huh? I can find the Forbes article on the Malta fund, should I print that out?
