Depending how he bought the bitcoins, the lawyers may not argue at all.

RemindMe! 3 days "Is it over?"

Lets say tomorrow someone comes up with a perfect solution to the blocksize debate.  Nobody expected this but it's amazing.  The price will likely go way up.
In reality this won't happen, so the idea of "a positive thing not happening" holds here.  The day will be neutral in this regard.
In this case, we started at around 1000.  Hopes of ETF pushed it to 1300.  Essentially investors were willing to pay a $300 premium to gamble on approval which might yield massive returns.  It didn't happen, which is a bad thing.  That premium should no longer be reflected in the price.
You can debate the exact numbers, percentages, or external factors.  But you can't really debate that the failure of an expected good thing isn't a bad thing.

Incorrect, we lost 20% (or perhaps more).  We also expected to see a rise of 300-500 if it were approved.  So we "lost" approximately 100 in value.  In theory.

RemindMe! 58 hours "Was the price driven by ETF speculation?"

You have to admit, it's strange though. Just last week the price pushed up through previous ATH and to 1200 to everyone's amazement.  It seemed like a very high price, but it was assumed that there was hope for the ETF.  If you talked to any bitcoiner at that time, they would say the ETF is the most relevant issue.  There was hope for a massive increase if approved.
Now that hope is gone.  Yes, there are users with a lot of dollars on exchanges, but there's also people with a lot of bitcoins.  There's a very real chance that as things settle down in the next several days, that investors realize it is risky to buy at such a high price following the negative outcome.  There are *always* users with money to buy or sell, but yet we still see major movements in one direction.
It's also very possible that users thought the ETF matters, but are collectively realizing it really didn't.  Perhaps the reality is that the approval scenario would have seen a spike to 1600 and quick retrace to the low 1300s.  And it's also possible that the ETF did in fact matter, but there are other majorly bullish pressures forcing the price up.  Maybe the rally from 900 to 1300 had only a bit to do with ETF.

It's not like investors were just sitting on the sidelines idly awaiting the decision.  The event yesterday was not simply "nothing", because there was some expectation.  If there was reasonable chance of approval, and approval would have meant a moonshot - then failure to approve implies a loss (or bad thing).
You can't have it both ways.

You first statement is correct.  Bitcoin is *decentralized*.  There is no central body that controls it.
One bitcoin is currently worth about $950.  This price is not "set" by anyone, it is simply the free-market price as of right now.
Yes to use bitcoins at a store that only accepts cash or credit cards, you would first need to exchange your bitcoins for dollars.
I have not used android pay but I would presume that is google's own payment system and it probably won't work.
Bitcoin mining is running software on some hardware which attempts to solve a difficult math problem.  There are may people running advanced hardware in the world, making it very difficult for an average computer to have much chance.  To be competitive, you would need to purchase a specific piece of equipment that specializes in bitcoin mining.  This would be your investment.  There is also an electricity cost associated with running any hardware.  If you don't have access to cheap electricity you will end up spending more money on electricity than you gain from bitcoins mined.

Good advice.  It something I know already but very good to hear it again.  The thing is when I bought it was a reasonable percentage of my "portfolio", but as it's gone up its making up a bigger percent.  I probably should have sold some at 1k+ simply to rebalance.  And I still probably should sell some for the same reason now.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:33:45
Thanks.  I am being a bit hard on myself, but I managed to hold from 200-300 up until here.  I shouldn't be as upset as I am in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:42:41
Honestly, I think I would wait.  This coming from someone who would be pleased to see it pass 1k again.  
Instead set aside the money you want to spend on bitcoin right now, and PROMISE yourself that you will use it all to buy before the end of the year.  Maybe spread it out.  I am guessing there will be a couple periods where the price has gone down significantly, and bitcoin will start feeling like a terrible failure and horrible investment.  You'll be so glad you didn't buy at $800 and see over 50% of your value gone.  You will also "realize" what a horrible idea it would be to buy bitcoin at $350 (for example), throwing money into the burning fire of the crashing bitcoin.
THIS IS WHEN YOU TRUST THE PROMISE YOU MADE TO YOURSELF IN JANUARY 2017 AND BUY BITCOINS.
Every single great buying period has come when the bitcoin price is seemingly in shambles.  Wait for that moment.  If you are feeling excited about finally buying, it's too early.  Keep waiting.  Once it feels pathetic and you want to spend your Buy-Bitcoins-Piggiebank on something that actually has a chance of not going to 0, that's when you start buying up.  Do it over the course of a month or two spaced out so you don't stress about the exact entry point.
Good luck and remember patience is your best friend.

This was the idea in Jan 2014.  I remember and bought into it.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:09:07
I know.  Well I'm optimistic, but very fearful right now.

What do you think was fueling that steady incline?  China didn't just start trading overnight mid-december.  This could have influenced the price for many months prior.

Jan 7th was a good day...

$6 is a lot.  Were you sending from tons of addresses?
And the first confirmations takes around 10 minutes.
