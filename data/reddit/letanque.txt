Agreed, bitcoin is new and has a long way to go in user friendliness. If you were around when the Internet hit the scene, you remember how God awful confusing that was. When Musk (I think it was him) bought the first car online, it made the news. Most people thought that was crazy and a lot of people thought buying something on the Internet was sci-fi.
Great input though, really hit the nail on the head with some of the inadequacies existing today.

Great link, thanks for sharing! I just wrote an email this morning to some smaller fund managers this morning in response to some comments Mr. Buffett made. Most of that email applies to the comments made by Mr. Klarman. Only exception is that it appears Mr. Klarman understands bitcoin a little more than WB. 
Most people are not intellectually equipped to understand how and why bitcoin is important. And even fewer people are in a position to take the questions they have and submerge themselves into research to find the answers. 
The first 5 times you think you understand math-based currencies, your wrong and need to go through it again.
Most people in industries about to be disrupted face a crossroad that they don't even realize is there. When that happens, they can choose to let history make up their mind or to do something totally crazy, and throw everything they've learned out the window so they can appreciate the disruption for what it is.
A brand new class of assets with some entirely new attributes can be disorientating, to say the least, to someone entrenched in the finance of yesterday. Especially when viewed through the lens of today's market. Instead of an asset discovering it's price from virtually zero, with a ceiling estimated to be considerably higher than even the highest highs seen, it's interpreted as an irrationally bullish currency that draws comparison to the dollar. 
I celebrate Mr. Klarman, though, for his ability to see something with more clarity than almost anyone in his position would; shown with his comment "...currencies are only worth what recipients on any given day will exchange in goods or services, then what makes them any better than the “crypto” kind of money?”

Haha, yeah, I figured you were just joking around. Sorry about the uber-serious response. 
I mainly portray researchers as men making deals with the devil to fund projects of their own because of the book Wired for War by P.W. Singer. The book is about war machines and the world of researchers who build them. Basically, a lot of research is done by hella smart dudes that want to make a cool new sex-toy, but building a deadly vagina-gun boob-cannon fembot pays da bills! 
In the case of da nukes, research that led to those developments was not necessarily embraced by the researchers who did it. Both Einstein and Eddington were noted pacifists. More than anything, circumstances more significant than their humanitarian will led to their eventual alliance against Nazi Germany. As a result and through this, they joined their efforts (I say "their" to collectively refer to many more researchers than just Einstein and Eddington) which eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Some of those researchers, of course, were pro blow-em-up military action guys, but the really smart ones were more like pre-hippy daisy totin' pacifists. 
I guess my point here, and before, is that making the nukes was a joint effort between many brilliant minds and the gov't, but was not the reason Einstein was focused on his Theory of Relativity. Nukes were a bi-product of that research, and frankly a barbaric use of the technology. But in the face of certain destruction by the hands of the evil little Nazis, it was decided best to commit their efforts to Allied forces; no matter the cost of human lives and the cost of their own ethos. 
Check out this movie for a fun dramatized story of Einsteiny and Eddy!

When someone sends you a bitcoin, do you accept that they haven't been spent elsewhere because you trust them? 
Nope! You accept it because you trust the protocol; you trust the proof-of-work.
Think of all this mumbo jumbo about regulation as an poor substitute for the certainty of mathematics. A substitute derived from societal needs before our species understood the practical power of mathematics. Math &gt; regulation. Mathematics provides the ability to minimize the human propensity of greed. We can realize the right to know without compromising the freedom from centralization bitcoin provides. Human oversight, intervention, and centralization is our instinct because it was all we knew for a long long time. 
Besides, this is all based on a transparent blockchain. I don't know how this works, or if others are doing it, but I would think that exchanges don't need to operate so detached from the blockchain that they cannot be audited all the time, real-time. 
IMO, a perfect exchange would be self-regulated by the community through real-time transparent data.

First - that was three words but I'm sure it was a joke. Fucking is a word, AFAIK. Unless you mean to say the US is fucking people to death, in which case I don't typically use nuclear as an adjective... and it would still be a word, AFAIK.
Second - Nuclear fission and fusion research resulted in more than just bombs. Let me explain what happened leading up to the US destroying a couple of Japanese cities in the name of holy-jesus-cowboy-freedom-fries.
* Researchers need money. 
* Wars demand new more powerful weapons. 
* Researchers often sign deals with military despite their moral dilemmas, how cliché. They justify with "well, I'll just give them a couple of things and continue my work on making a vibrant glow-in-the-dark condom... right?".
* Military reviews projects, see "nuclear fission research requires billions of dollars (*yawn) for research ..blah blah blah.. mega... MEGATON EXPLOSIONS (!?!?!)". 
* Military creams their pants, ignores researchers nagging about solving the future energy crisis (and blingin jimmies). 
* Drops "Fat Man" gravity bomb (which is fancy military-speak for a big chunk of metal with really explosive shit inside that's literally dropped out of a bomber plane onto the target) over Hiroshima, obliterating helpless humans and maiming the rest.
* Researchers make sad sad, but not nearly as sad as the Japanese decimated by US ego-flex.
Summary - MutuallyAssuredDestruction was not disruptive and creative. More like destructive and predictable. Nuclear weapons are probably the least creative and poorest use of nuclear fusion and fission. 
Think of the dumbest most destructive thing you could do with math-based currencies and that's what most governments would have done with it had they thought of it first. 
Tl;Dr - Military is dumb, bitcoin is ze best bro. B)

We still don't *really* know if the leak was genuine, right? All MtGox has actually said was they are pumping the breaks.
The joint statement from Coinbase and the guys was revised to remove the insolvency part. Only Circle still has the original statement on their site. And even in that case, the wording is vague. We don't know for certain that MtGox is actually insolvent. For all we know, the insolvency part is sensationalism supported by false leaks. Maybe that's exactly what the twobit leak is. Part of a larger dump strategy to accumulate lower priced btc prior to a pump. Imagine that. 
And if you need a story in history to help you imagine it, research the Great Depression. Larger banks of the day seized the opportunity to flush out smaller banks, consolidate power, and sway regulation in their direction. Much of the how and why is still up for debate today, but the story that children are taught in grade school is glossed over and doesn't really explain what was going on at the time.

To add to that, here are some of things I've been thinking about. A lot is conjecture and mostly not fact-based. Assumptions based on clues.
* Mark K is non-confrontational. He gets punked in a youtube video by an irate pub-crawler. 
* Mark K carries himself like a 30yo-virgin-hardcore-MTG player with a hentai habit. Far from strong character
* Mark K exhibits practically no characteristics of good leaders and/or good CEO's.
* In the Reuters youtube video, his desk is messy. You could tell he tried to straighten up for the interview, but it was still messy meaning it was really bad before.
* He hired predominately women, probably because men made him feel insecure. 
* His shirt is old and collar is messed up. Poorly kept appearance, especially for an interview, especially for a CEO.
* The disorganization in addition to MtGox track history likely means the company was disorganized.
* Because of this disorganization, any "leak" in actual btc due to malleability could have been going on and they may have been blind to it.
* Being one of the largest exchanges at the time, any scammer looking to capitalize on trans malleability would be interested in MtGox.
* Smart scammer would bleed it out, for a while, small pieces at a time. Laundered, filtered, pocketed.
* Mark K could have been taken advantage of, right in his own company. He is not a man that demands respect or loyalty; he is a pushover, doormat, etc. 
* If the btc was partially missing, they would confer with experts at the btc found and elsewhere. Not saying blockchain is an expert, but that is someone they would talk to.
* Would the experts recommend to try and resolve before going public. Likely IMO, they would. They would reserve going public as last resort. 
* Mark K likely didn't plan this and is not the beneficiary of this massive f*ck up. 
* On the flip-side, maybe this is all an attempt to artificially lower the price. It's working. And it keeps going up and down as a result with each of his punt-fakes.
* If this is a pump and dump, they will come back online and all exchanges will take a temp nosedive. Which will be a buying opp for many. Won't last long.

Admitting fault is something I'm sure their lawyers have directed them not to do. Companies that run out and say I'm sorry a bunch of time are usually either:

Our minds are capable of great things but unless you consciously push them, they will always resort to the easiest answer with the least work. The more we learn about our minds, the more we find out they are like muscles and get "stronger" the more you work them. I think it's called neural plasticity or something like that.

The big problem with Greece is a long history of, basically, cooking the books prior to the eurozone. Corruption and financial irresponsibility has been part of the culture of governance for a long time. If this vote leads to Greece's departure from the eurozone, that's good for everyone involved.

Pretty overpriced IMO.  A burner is simply a phone not tied to your identity which is pretty easy to purchase now and days.  
* 1 - buy cheap phone
* 2 - activate with cash on prepaid network like Page Plus
* 3 - change your number at will
Cost: $20-$30 for phone (if that), $10-$50 every month (or 3 months with Page Plus) for service.  In the end, you could be paying as little as $10 per 3 months. 
Anonymous burners are not new, people have been doing this for as long as cell phones have been relevant.  
However, I like how you accept bitcoin; that's cool and a first AFAIK.  What network do you guys use?

I agree SN is not someone, or a group of people, that want to be found.  And, honestly, I don't think they ever will.  
I didn't set out to help find him with this design, but just to illuminate a controversial person and a facet of this space.  The mystery surrounding SN is exciting and, lately, an inspiration for my creative endeavours.  
Yeah, the I is a little off-putting.  I like to take words, break them up, alienate font structure, and combine them creating new words within them.  With this design, Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto also forms "Whois", "SHA" (as in sha256), "Hi" (as in hi, I'm here, everywhere, omnipotent, you're looking but I have already been found), "tao" which is the chinese concept signifying path showing how SN is a hidden leader. 
I dripped the I because I wanted to balance the negative space of hi - n; but it's a little too much I think.

Hey there, great questions. 
1) A good point. Like Cyprus, a large percentage of the world doesn't have internet access. However, almost everyone has cell phones. Theoretically, there may exist the ability to transfer coin via SMS. Recently, TechCrunch had an article about a team doing just that. 
Aside from SMS, there could exist other systems that could allow people to securely transfer btc, or some other math based currency, sans internet connection. I'm no proposing a solution here but I think a solution is feasible and since development in the space is so new, we cannot deny any possibility. 
The most important point is that the technology is very new. When the internet was very new, people couldn't imagine how it could change their lives. Now, of course, in hindsight it was obvious. But at the time, we didn't all see it.  I lived in the 80's, I remember underestimating it as well. When you sit there though, and imagine it, you can see how it can happen. You can see how yes, one day, this could really be how people do business.  
2) I'm not sure I know exactly what luxuries you are talking about. Do you mean the luxury of internet access? In which case, a collapsed government would not mean a collapsed network. Maybe a fragmented one, for a time, but not a collapsed one. BTC could very well skyrocket in value if it could be used as a store of value in the event of a government collapse. 
I dig bitcoin and alternative currencies as well. We live in a world with a very old banking system. The internet came along and brought a lot of possibilities but never had a native way to transfer money. Similar to how the telephone was exclusive and then eventually became a commodity; so will the internet.

Seriously though, bitcoin is growing into its value as a niche and has yet to grow from its displacement of fiat currencies.  It's an interesting time but not all analysis indicates a bubble. There has been a huge wave of European adoption along with tremendous announcements. Don't forget, the biggest exchange just announced a move to the US. The euro is shaky, Europeans are starting to adopt bitcoin.  These are monumental moments. This is not a platform, it's something very new. It's an instrument to transfer wealth.  You should be looking at adoption.
The tipping point is right, but this is not the tipping point that tells you to sell. Everyone thinks they know and is looking at this like it's a bubble; that's the surprise - it's not.

I completely agree with the "invest what you can afford to lose" thought.
You really understand a pattern when you can reverse it: "Invest in bitcoin with money that you cannot afford to lose."
Obviously, that doesn't make sense. Obviously, unless you are a fcking retard, you will not invest with money that you cannot afford to lose. I think this reaches beyond common sense into the basic concept of scarcity.  But, eh, who knows, the rarest commodity of them all seems to be common sense these days. 
However, in this particular scenario the OP is asking about ways we, the enthusiast/investor/user/whatever you want to call us, can help stabilize the price. He's not asking for investing advice.  For which, my answer is no.... duh.

A comment recently left regarding competitor currency vs replacement currency holds a lot of truth. 
Regarding cell phones, the World Bank estimates 75% of the world has access to cell phones. (reference:  Aside from cell phones, some sort of hard wallet will inevitably be built and would be something even a person without a cellphone could use. It would be something very similar to a credit card. Something even a bank could issue. Not unlike a card with some "credits" on it. This is so close, prototypes are already available, so I don't think a means of access is really a long-term issue. 
Regarding luxuries, we are approaching a time when internet will no longer be viewed as a luxury. So while it holds some truth right now, the internet will most likely be as luxurious as a land-line phone in the future. 
Also regarding luxuries, we take for granted in countries like the US how many luxuries we all require to function at a certain level in society. Transportation, communication, hygiene, residence. These are all requirements to function in society in the US at a certain level. Of course, you live how ever you like, but most people choose to interact with other people, thus practically requiring all of those luxuries. 
In summary, both near and far term, bitcoin is a competitive currency with the power to displace traditional fiat currency. No one that I know has ever seriously considered it a replacement currency for traditional fiat of any nation (barring Cyprus discussions which has become too hyped and non-fact-based, IMO). 
But will it displace currencies? Yes, it actually is slowly doing just that.

Silicon Valley bank is the most progressive bank available, other than the Internet Archive CU.  Wendy Cheung, their head of operations, sat on our panel at the discussion last month at Stanford.  
We brought them in as an incumbent, but they are hardly opposed to bitcoin related businesses.  They were just about the only bank we could contact that knew what bitcoin was, though.  LMK if you would like to get in contact with anyone there.

Totally agree, what a waste.  You can change the number without changing the phone.  Why not use the phone again?  As long as the phone doesn't tie to your real identity, it's effective.

I agree with stephwen in regards to the idea. But, I can't imagine this sort of operation could be very scale-able.
Either way, good luck.  FWIW, I think the key to success would be in forming strategic partnerships with companies.  This way companies can leverage the strengths of bitcoin so you could actually reduce the cost for the customer versus charging a fee.

**Event Description**
What if currency wasn't something that exchanged hands physically, but moved instantaneously between networks, countries, and continents? What if it wasn't regulated by a government, system of banks, or any entity at all? And, what if it was completely open source? 
This disruption of what we view as currency isn't just theory, it is already a $1.5 billion dollar movement. Leading the charge is Bitcoin. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin moved to decentralize currency in a big way by leveraging cryptography (instead of government authority) to digitally coin and transfer money. Users can choose to use the currency veiled in anonymity while steadily gaining ground as a valuable, peer-to-peer currency.
With over 11M bitcoins in circulation, the virtual currency is gaining significant traction. Thousands of companies and online retailers, and as many as 140 non-profits currently accept payment in bitcoins. The market value of a single bitcoin was as low as pennies at the outset, has risen as high as $266 and now hovers in the $100-120 range. 
The emergence of an alternative currency has had a domino effect. As more people "mine" (create) new bitcoins, more retailers and organizations scramble to adopt the infrastructure to accept this new form of payment. Non-profits have also been early adopters and virtual currencies have provided new ways to fund and extend their work. 
The spike in consumer interest has also lead to new currency exchange systems like Mt. Gox---the current most popular online exchange, and Ripple--an emerging platform that calls itself the world's first open transaction network to facilitate exchanges between all kinds of currencies, including Bitcoin. And the rise of Bitcoin has also spurred new similar virtual currencies such as Litecoin. The interest has not gone unnoticed by VC's. Andreessen Horowitz recently completed an angel round for an undisclosed amount to fund OpenCoin, the developer of Ripple. 
This fascinating area is also fraught with its own concerns. The characteristic potential anonymity of Bitcoin has led to virtually untraceable funding of illicit activities. The government, which has been slow to recognize virtual currencies, is starting to take notice considering the booming growth of this largely untaxed, unregulated currency. 
Whether you are bitcoiner yourself or are brand new to virtual currencies, join a panel of experts on June 18th 2013, to learn about the past and future potential of virtual currencies.

I'm by no way an expert, but all of the developers I know prefer Ruby on Rails and the trend, at least in the bay area, is to develop with it.  Seems to be a matter of preference.   
@_date: 2013-07-01 19:20:16
I wonder is the cease and desist issued to the Bitcoin Foundation has anything to do with the stagnation. 
I also agree that it's a return to the mean.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:50:17
There's that, of course.
Also you don't have to pay fees to convert to USD.  You'll only pay fee's to convert to USD when you go trough the banks. You could sell that amount over the counter, albeit, it would take time. But selling over the counter you could avoid any fees. You could even make a profit depending on how you structured it.

Ahh, that makes sense. I'll try to just use it then. Thanks for the info. 
I wasn't aware that that's how visa works but that makes sense.

Actually, no. Speculators are day traders. Investors buy and hold.
Investors are, by definition, long term.
Speculators are almost always short term. Speculators don't want to get "stuck in a trade", they want to be in and out.

They will be speaking next week at Stanford if anyone is interested.  Winklevoss, Ripple, Coinbase, SV Bank, Kashmir Hill.
June 18th.

Well, one thing is for sure, bitcoin is confusing to journalist.
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:59:08
I like the fact that SpiderOak is offering a discount to bitcoin users.  This is the right approach and hopefully more companies will follow their lead.  Aside from exchange exposure risk (which could be huge, but minimized with a processor like Coinbase), processing bitcoin payments is less expensive so that should theoretically translate into the price.  
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:12:46
Crazy.  Who would have thought bitcoin was a risky investment?  
You have money needed for a time-critical issue... in dollars or bitcoin... on Mt. Gox?!  For a btcthinker, you should have thought more critically about that move!
@_date: 2013-02-17 20:15:19
"...more explanation to new users is in order."
"At least my greedy bank makes me sign forms..."
You should probably stick with traditional banking, for now. 
My bicycle doesn't need training wheels, anymore. I assume responsibility of my own risk. I think the risk is quite clear for those who research. The opportunity for education is there more than it ever has. The barriers to entry are practically non-existent.

While ripple has xrp, a currency, it's more of a complement to bitcoin. It's like free pay pal without a central authority. Any currency works within it.
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:24:13
They are VC's.  If you have a good idea, they could potentially fund it.  So I don't think they qualify as "clowns".
They are doing more for the virtual currency scene than negative comments, IMO.    
FWIW, I'm not big fans of their company.  But then again, if I was looking for a few million to get an idea off the ground, I would probably be a fan, lol. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:40:04

Number 3 is misleading. The value would definitely have a cap in that scenario but would not be destroyed. People would still trade otc. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:59:59
Oh that's cool.  To be honest, I've never paid him enough attention to form a reliable opinion.  I assumed a lot about him as a reaction to his "showmanship" and people who follow his content, which I'm apparently not a very big fan of. 
It would be comforting to know that he really is intelligent and well versed in the intricacies of bitcoin.  He is a very influential personality. For instance, when btc was at &gt;$200 highs earlier this year, I was doing a bunch of deals OTC.  And during that short period among those buyers, every single one mentioned or credited Max as their ultimate reason for making the decision to buy.  These were people spending $1000 to get less than 5 btc; so he obviously knows how to connect with his audience.  That kind of power is something Max needs to have a lot of respect for. 
But when I see that he misunderstood fundamental concepts, it concerns me.  If you were in the business of disseminating information, wouldn't you go to great lengths to understand the information?  I would think preferable at an expert level.  Yet, in my eyes, he represents the expert fallacy at work.  Since he presents himself as an authority, so many folks put their faith in his information without questioning it.  His position as authority isn't even questioned; it's assumed that he must know.  So many of those buyers at &gt;$200 were very green and generally confused.  Each one communicated at least two misconceptions, if I remember correctly.  I think that further propagated my opinion of him.  
It's good to hear bitcoiners back him up though.  I sincerely hope I'm wrong!

There are a number of similar threads which you should research. Basically, "don't invest anything you are not willing to lose" is what you will hear a lot of. 
If you believe more people will continue to adopt, and you are willing to play this position long-term, then buy now. There are not a TON of places to spend them yet, so they will most likely sit around for a while. Ideally, for the investor, that will work out well.
The good thing is $500 is not a lot to invest or to lose. Since you are young, making a risky play is in your favor because you have a long time to recover. 
Really, no one **knows** where this is going so there is no clear answer. There are a lot of people who believe the exchange value will continue to rise. As more companies accept them, more value is perceived. As people continue to lose confidence in central banks, more value is perceived.

Depending on where you live, localbitcoins.com can be very fast and easy.  And you do not need any identification.  (This is a service that matches local sellers up with buyers facilitating person to person trades)
You can use bitinstant.com.  I'm not sure what kind of ID you need with them now and days. 
Every exchange will require some form of ID, AFAIK.
@_date: 2013-02-21 07:15:05
So far, I've had a few successful transactions on localbitcoins.com. I really like that listing service.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:50:41
I would get into fiction writing - you are excellent!
Lol, but seriously, if this happens to be a real story. I wouldn't exit my btc position, but I surely wouldn't be increasing it. More than half of your money is already in btc?! I am no financial adviser; I would seek a professional adviser. Dumping $300k into a new digital crypto-currency is brave, I'll give you that; but that's isn't really your play money. Be careful with that. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:08:37
I wish I knew! You can use bitspend to purchase from V2 cigs.  But I don't know any company that has native support for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:16:24
You can add funds from ach with mt gox. You can also wire transfer out I believe. 
Dwolla is pretty cheap so I guess that is a benefit. They of course have their own service which, if I used, would make transfer to them much more relevant.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:35:20
Yeah, because the federal reserve is so transparent and accessible. Oh and, of course, you can turn in your dollars for X amount of gold, duh!  It's not like anyone would just trade slips of paper! /s
What a moron. 
You would think an article from a blog called digital trends would be a little more "current".

Would you care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:56:40
Exactly avemo, you hit the nail on the head.  
Something that politicians are particularly talented with is framing.  And when you frame the discussion with "bitcoin enables criminals", often listeners stop there, influenced from then on.  
It's helpful in situations like this to do exactly what did and flip the frame around.  Sure, criminals can use bitcoin but what significance does that hold?  Criminals also use water and netflix.  The internet itself enables criminals.  The statement serves no purpose other than to distract lazy system 2 minds while manipulating opinions with fear.  
Summary, more politician fucking bullshit.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:04
right there with you but with less wife and more pornhub. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 01:29:36
Yeah, you should be able to transfer any amount with no fees but the processing will take longer.

In regards to the "If Coin succeeds, governments will get involved — for the better. "  &gt;  "Coin is ridiculously easy to destroy by accident."
This doesn't need to be the government.  Maybe it could be a company that a less savvy user could use to simplify bitcoin and make it very difficult to lose.  There would have to be a lot of trust in said company, from the user, but some people will be looking for that. 
It doesn't need to be safety for some at the cost of every user. 
Later in the article, I agree with the sentiment that bitcoin may not be the end game.  Then again, the best system isn't always the one that prevails.  And it looks like bitcoin is going to be relevant for a loooong time.  The future, indeed, it fascinating. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:31:41
If banks openly attacked, Bitcoin would be a martyr. Finally people would have something tangible to protest. That could be a fantastic thing.

Why don't people mention Disney Dollars while they are at it?  
There is a significant difference between a decentralized currency and gift cards. 
However, if Amazon decides to allow their gift cards to be transferable and then there blossoms exchanges that allow btc=&gt;amazon and vice versa and with dollars... then you have something. Even then, the problems involved with launching any new currency come to the top and Amazon coins will get axed by the government. 
Odd uninformed article, amazon coins is hardly exciting.

I think the word bitcoin and the logo need some breathing room; they seem cramped.

I wish we had more time to talk about this event and market it.  We were up against the wall with deadlines.  Phil Z was confirmed less than 2 weeks before the event! 
In any case, I hope more bitcoiners can make the event.  If you do happen to make it tomorrow, try to find myself (Frank) or Tony so that we can chat afterwards.  VLAB usually has a post-event party and I would love to invite some more bitcoiners to the party.

I'm not sure of the estimated entropy of your password idea, but it definitely is ok.  34 characters and not susceptible to a dictionary attack.  I think a 4 or 5 random word pass phrase might actually be stronger though.

Seriously, thanks for the perspective. I think the difference in mine is that I don't necessarily see a problem with a company making a profit. 
But, centralization is a problem for a number of reasons. 
Do they plan to make the gateway source code public? When the client is released, will OpenCoin still be holding (I'm confused as to the exact percentage) 40% of the xrp?

And plenty of instances in the other direction. French revolution is the first to come to mind. 
The time of the physical protest is gone, or at least has changed,  but rallying people to fight injustices is still possible. This is technology that, for the first time in our lives, has potential to completely change the landscape of politics and governments. It reacts to problems and provides real solutions. I think the world will soon get to the point where the average person will take notice of the problems, and care if it addresses the problems.

Pretty much is already happening with OTC trades. Here is an interesting interview with nanotube that discusses some of the stuff you are discussing. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:04:30
I see where you are coming from.  I don't necessarily trust them but here is the way I see it.
I'm not a dev, so please excuse the ignorance, but isn't the source available on github? Is that incomplete? 
I believe their reason for XRP is to reduce spam and cut down on people having multiple accounts; all while not requiring people to use tons of ID.
The ripple client has not been released so everything is still centralized. But they have said multiples times that that will happen soon.  The idea is for the network to be decentralized and that has been made very clear by the company.
I think it's a stretch to say they are preying on those who lack understanding. Ripple works fine without the use of XRP as currency. and just as a soon-to-be-decentralized exchange.
I think time will tell with this project.
