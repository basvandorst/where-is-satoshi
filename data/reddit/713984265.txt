Yeah, I bought around 0.50 a coin if memory serves me right. Wanted to buy some drugs, then pussied out on the transaction because well, drugs + mail. I mean, c'mon. Forgot all about them until I heard they were $300 and looked for them. Must've wiped the drive at some point.

That's why I'm not mad about the 50 BTC I had that I (probably) ended up wiping off my drive. The most I would've gotten was $15k since I only remembered I had them when I heard BTC was $300. A decent chunk of change, but I paid $20 for some, and got a bunch for free.
I checked all the harddrives laying around my mom's house, but none of them had my wallet. Shame. Pretty sure I must've wiped it at some point, but not like I actually lost money.

Are you just saying USD is a better standard in general, or a better standard to look at when you're trading your crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:14:46
When trading crypto? Don't think so. Sats is better right now. If fairx is actually a fiat &lt;&gt; any crypto exchange, that might change though.

USD when trading is pretty irrelevant unless you're cashing out. It's mostly just a helpful indicator. 
If I buy 50,000 of token X at 200 sats (would show $0.03 on binance), then sell all of it at 250 sats (would also show $0.03) I've gained 2.5 million sats. Probably about $200-250 right now. About a 15% gain.
Depends on what you're trading though I guess. If you're just trading BTC, ETH, DASH, etc you probably don't have the volume to really care about 50 sats. If you're trading high volumes, sats can make a big difference.

I think around 50. I was a part of a forum called hackforums where people gave them away for free in the premium section in exchange for reputation. Then I had however many I got from considering buying shit off silkroad.

Yeah, I bought $20 worth in 2010, don't know how many I had but I know they were &lt; $1 at the time. Also got a bunch for free on a forum where people would give them away for rep. 
I like to believe I would've sold earlier, although the earliest I would've sold was around $300 'cause that's when I remembered bitcoin existed. Booted up a few old drives, but none of them were the ones with the wallet and just gave up.
I probably could've had like... 50k, maybe more. Don't know how many I had. A lot of money, but not life changing like the 700k+ it would be worth now.

Yeah my mom keeps asking me to help her get in but I always say no. No way I want to deal with her complaining and blaming me for dips n shit.

Yeah, that's why I don't beat myself up about the 40-50 bitcoins I had. It may have been more, don't really remember. Bought a bunch for silk road but pussied out of actually buying the drugs. Definitely would've sold them for around $100, maybe less, if I hadn't reformatted.

I think the password was a randomly generated (and hashed?) string. If I don't have that anymore, would finding the wallet be useless?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:24:38
Alright. I figured there was no way I'd be able to recover them. Bummer though, did get my hopes up a little bit that it might be possible.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:59:26
Yeah, if I had to guess I'd say there's at least 30-40 bitcoins on there.
I honestly don't know if I have the hard drive. I've gone through a good number of them, but I don't throw them out, so I'd assume it's laying around somewhere at my mom's house. I definitely didn't make any backups of the bitcoin stuff, they were pretty much worthless when I had them.
If I can find the drive, and it's been reformatted, could the data be found in the windows.old folder? I usually don't wipe the old data when I reformat. Where would I need to look for it?
