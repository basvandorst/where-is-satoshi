Anyone else find it funny that you bitcoin advocates still have faith in an asset that is clearly rife with manipulation?
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:31:42
i know a lot of people on this sub look at it as "more than a quick buck" but the vast majority of stakeholders don't.
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:31:03
not even close. i made $25K on ETH due to pure luck, and as i started to learn more, realized how ridiculous it all is, and that's playing out.

thank you. i paid taxes on it this year. cashed out last year. put the money in a number of indexes.

i like actual money and not losing it, unfortunately

Terrible argument
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:33:05
i like to see how you guys react to dumps and to occasionally try to get you guys to see the light. just waiting for the day when you all collectively come to the realization that, as nice as the idea was in theory, it's never going to work out because at the end of the day, the vast majority of people interested in crypto were just hoping to turn a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:30:36
ok, you convinced me. a highly manipulated, speculative asset that is based on nothing and is 70% down from it's peak is actually a good bet. and to think, all i needed was to be insulted by someone i'll never meet or think about again in just a few hours. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:18:40
Lmao, what? That's like a black market bazaar being held up bank robber style. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:59:14
you're completely obtuse. there's no point. let's put it this way, though. blockchain is not new technology. if it was as valuable as you think, the change you're envisioning would've already happened. disruptive technologies don't take as long as bitcoin has been taking to disrupt, and disruptive technologies don't lose value as time goes by, which bitcoin has (down 70% from ATH).
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:13:26
I'm not touching anything related to crypto. Nice comment. Really shows your maturity.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:52:08
Tether triggered that hype. Then the hype died out and bitcoin crashed 70%. At that point, hundreds of millions of Tether were printed in order to prop the price up at its current level. It's starting to collapse finally. It's caught up with itself.
FYI, the whole world knows about crypto now, so there's no place left to hype it, since it's now as mainstream as it can get.
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:45:54
I'm not going to keep beating my head against a wall. Good luck and be careful.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:45:48
as of now, binance just suspended withdrawals. this scam has been known for ages. here comes the blood.
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:24:58
I made a lot of money on Ether last year, and it was a really uneducated gamble. Once I really learned the crypto space (entirely hype, propped up by tether, no actual value), I pulled out and never looked back.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:30:09
I understand what you're saying. The thing is, if Tether brings down crypto on Tether using exchanges, the whole market will collapse when people realize that the entire bull-run of 2017 was based on Tether manipulation. Sure bitcoin went up a couple percent last night. It always gets pumped and dumped in cycles like it just did over the past few days. But this scandal points to something much worse, and when it comes to a head, there will be a blood bath.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:59:34
bitcoin didn't go up, the price of bitcoin in USDT went up. have you seen the massive difference in prices across exchanges that do use USDT vs those that don't?
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:20:42
i don't even need to provide a source to prove my point (but here's one analysis, anyway  "Examining the Bitcoin cumulative distribution, the richest 30% of all Bitcoin owners own 98.3% of all Bitcoins." and that's out of 25 million total people, so that means that 7.5 million people collectively own pretty much all the bitcoin, out of 7 billion people on earth, or 0.1% of the world population owns 98.3% of all bitcoin, if you will.
most people simply aren't in bitcoin (or crypto), so by default, it's already concentrated. if it became a global currency, we'd be back to where we are with fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:23:29
You mean like what color Ferrari to get?
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:38:45
None of that matters, I'm fully aware of the issues of centralized fiat currency, but crypto is not the solution, especially when you consider that the majority of bitcoin is concentrated into a smaller number of hands than fiat is. So much for "decentralized". The other issue is as I've stated. Nobody wants crypto, they want more fiat instead. So you have a majority of the world population not interested in it.

@_date: 2018-10-15 16:41:00
i did make 1000%. here's the thing, there is nothing left to pump the price, especially at those multiples. those pumps were started by tether, and then crypto became mainstream. literally everyone was talking about it. the hype has died out, and the only pumps left in the market are coming from tether.
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:24:13
What's the bigger picture, then?
I think what you're failing to see is that the hype all happened because people through crypto was a magical tool to turn fiat into more fiat. The implication is that fiat is the only thing people ever cared about. Now that people know that they can no longer get rich since there are no suckers left, crypto will die as people have stopped pouring money into it, and the only thing propping it up is tether. For the vast majority of people who bought crypto, it was never about the technology, it was always about turning fiat into more fiat. You've proven my point yourself, and you don't even see it. You're talking about crypto as a tool to make more fiat. How can you be so blind? It's more or less a ponzi scheme at this point. The only way to make money on it is for someone else to buy it from you at a higher price. Nobody is playing hot potato anymore, and crypto's life support is tether. You're either completely delusional or a shill.

That's not how that works
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:10:18


@_date: 2018-11-24 23:15:40
That wasn't me, but I agree. See, bitcoin became a get rich quick fad when it hit mass adoption, but it never took off because people really wanted money not crypto. The whole world knows about crypto now and nowhere near enough people want it for any reason other than to get rich in fiat, which people now realize only happens if more people buy in, but there's no one left to do that since worldwide recognition has come and gone. It's essentially a dying Ponzi scheme at this point.

Yes, let this shill convince you to hold his doody
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:59:10
You're entirely wrong about that. As I've said before, it's a romantic idea, but not realistic. It already has so many problems. "Decentralized," for example, except that the vast majority of production, network maintenance, and crypto supply is still concentrated in a few hands. The technology itself has so many issues it's completely useless, and none of the upgrades are actually promising. The only use case in practice has primarily been financial fraud, or worse. The current pricing is based on epic amounts of market manipulation and FOMO. The only reason anyone is even interested in crypto (besides those who use it for crime) is to increase their net worth in dollars. Then you have an echo chamber of bag holders such as yourself on reddit and a few other forums that comprise the minority of people still delusional enough to think that this is some kind of paradigm shift, and I can assure you, if you're not one of them yourself, that the majority of the people you think share your sentiments are bots and/or axis (Russia, Korea, Arab Peninsula and Afro-Arabic) trolls.
Good luck.

0 is the support level
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:34:51
Herein lies the problem with crypto. 
You're anticipating a bright future...in dollars...so you value the dollars more...like everyone else who invests in crypto...but you're hoping years down the line that people value the crypto more so that you get more dollars for it...because you want the dollars. So if the dollars are so valuable now and tomorrow, why buy the crypto?

Unfortunately it seems like a lot of people don't share that sentiment. That would have to change.

Your benchmark for success in crypto is its value in fiat. What's that tell you?
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:02:57
the bubble already burst. it's slowly winding it's way down due to manipulation that's preventing instantaneous collapse. you won't see a return to the explosive values seen before.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:10:14
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:07:49
an exchange rate defines an asset's current value, not its inherent value. what we're witnessing now is crypto's slow decline. mainstream has come and gone, and crypto is not being widely adopted, and that's because everyone who was interested was only interested in becoming rich in their local fiat. buy in today, get more out tomorrow, but with no underlying asset. it's akin to a ponzi scheme. just look at the OP's post. he wants bitcoin today, in order to have more fiat in the future. the only way that works is if even more people buy in, until you get the point where there's no one left to buy in and drive up its value. the only other thing that could drive up its value is its utility as a currency, and that doesn't look like it's going to happen.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:18:26
I'd consider myself far less ignorant than anyone who invested in this ponzi scheme
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:25:20
No, that won't work. Too similar to cryptocurrency.
