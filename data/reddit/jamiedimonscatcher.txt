Better to be feared than ignored.

Well said. ;-)

I believe Otawa Canada has one.

Agreed. What does the victim's race have to do with raising money for him?

Your use of the word "brigading" is inaccurate; nay, it is entirely inappropriate in this context.

Did I dun' goof. Y'all gonna backtrace me?
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:43:18
I find all this hard to swallow.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:12:52
Much disrespect with this one.

Is the Multiverse infinite?

It hasn't been a great month for most everyone else too:

Oh great, a compelling reason for democratic governments to ban BitCoin.

I hate Bill Maher's smug face and a-hole demeanor so much, I picked up some more bitcoin this morning, even though i wasn't planning to get more.

"Change" suggests pennies/dimes etc. Totally agree.

The number of merchants accepting it there is growing pretty quickly on coinmap.org.

Ours is a noble pursuit.

Kicking someone when they're down? Really?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:14:39
Yes, I face-palmed as soon as I realized they hadn't contemplated sub-division of a coin. Its going to take awhile for mass understanding.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:35:15
Camel toe for Bitcoin!! Woo hoo! To da Moon!!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:52:12
Needs more cowbell.

I am also becoming a fan of your dogged fanaticism. Dream on, Big Money Man, dream on!
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:16:59
Your approach makes a lot of sense. If you lose, its no big deal. If you win, you caught the buying opportunity of the decade.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:58:13
How much you got hosed for?
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:46:03
Yep, and the markets seem to agree too. This would have crashed the price just weeks ago!

Looks like the author has since edited their error.

I'd say less. You can burn turd for heat, as they do in some developing countries.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:27:52
I, for one, welcome our new regulatory overlords.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:32:21
Meh.
