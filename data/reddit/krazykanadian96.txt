This. I get over $10k a week credit now

Maybe not $100 but I'll certainly toss some coinage their way. I owe my life to them as well when it came to RC's in college.

It was a hell of a time, let me tell you lol.

Pretty much every 2C, but definitely 2C-E the most. Went through a gram of that and the dosages were only 10-30mg at a time... A bit excessive haha

Seems to be back up for me.

What about a "Bitcoin accelerator" if a low fee is the issue? I've seen mixed reviews of people using those. Any insight? Thanks in advance.

Thank you for the info. But I still keep seeing both 3 days and 2 weeks, as to when I may be able to get my coin back. Which one is it? Haha. Sorry if I'm missing something here. Thank you for the help.
Edit: Also, how do you calculate how much you need to make your fee to get a reasonably fast transaction time? Thanks again for the help.

Thank you for the insight and the response. It is just irritating because there were several more transactions I wanted to process, but I do not want to even start them until this one clears.
Quick question: if it doesn't clear after 3 days or so, will it cancel the transaction? Is there a way to cancel it myself? This just has me stressed to the max because of the amount of assets I have in BTC.

Yeah, I don't see how an "accelerator" would do anything besides worsen the problem of delaying "low fee" or even what used to be normal fee transactions.

It's working for me now.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:59:47
Thanks, dude. Wonder what the issue is.

What was said in the email?

How would you even re-initiate a transaction? That seems foreign to me, seeing as my balance is much lower than what is required.
