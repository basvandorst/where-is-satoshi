I don't understand what you are saying.  If countries had a rational money system there wouldn't be nearly as many poor people.
Where do your taxes go?  A large portion goes to pay interest on the huge debts that have been accumulating since your great great grandparent's days.
A lot of taxes go to the rich.  A lot more than what goes to the poor.  Do you think food stamps are there to help the poor or to help wal-mart?

In what why could you possibly use the number of subscribers to r/bitcoin as the count of total active users?
I was a bitcoin user for years before I heard of reddit.  What about non english speaking people?  I must account for at least 20 of the 120k r/bitcoin subcribers.
I know about 5 times as many people that use bitcoins than use reddit.

Not unlikely at all.  We have a deranged lunatic ruler who wants a pipeline that Obama won't allow.

If you go back through Satoshi's old posts you will see that it wasn't an oversight.
But I sure am impressed by the LOT of btc that you own.

And sometimes they even cover them in [gold]( which has the baggage of slavery to go with it, and a substantially higher carbon footprint, too.

How exactly do you plan on creating bitcoins at 0 cost?  
Try buying some mining hardware and mining more bitcoins than you spent on the hardware.  Then pay for the electricity. 
You would need 16 tH of mining power to mine 1 bitcoin a day right now.

Perhaps read about [The Hunt Brothers](

Yeah but it doesn't seem to be used very much, just by the fringes of society.
Life credits seem to be where it's at in 2077.

Nascar?  UFC? 
Could you go after a more [poor and stupid]( demographic?  Because bitcoin really needs a bunch of people who can't even read to adopt it.
