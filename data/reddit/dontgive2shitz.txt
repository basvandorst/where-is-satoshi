"Why wouldn't you short an asset that you 100&amp; KNOW FOR A FACT will go down in value? Not just go down in value, but to ZERO."
Jesus, that's an unbelievably stupid question.  You obviously don't understand how any of this works.  FYI, short positions aren't the exact opposite of long positions.  Do you get that extreme volatility, regardless if the market is bullish or bearish, can wreak havoc on ANY position?    If the long term trend ultimately does lead to zero, but spikes happen along the way, then simply shorting doesn't match the expectation.  It's actually pretty stupid to take a long-term short position in such a volatile market, even if the trend does ultimately lead to zero.   You're pretty stupid because you don't seem to understand this simple point.  For your edification, here's some basic 101 shit that will answer your very stupid question: [
Smart move running away - to continue your line of reasoning would be futile, best to just leave and avoid the humiliation.
ps. thanks for not denying that you were blatantly lying about Game Stop. It was pretty obvious. xD

@_date: 2018-05-20 08:58:47
Mutual funds were never part of the conversation.  We're talking about equity positions.  You're not entitled to an opinion about game stop until you "put your money where your mouth is" and take a position.  Until then, shut the fuck up.   Toodles bitch.
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:04:35
I thought you had it there for a sec but then whoosh
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:50:26
You're the one who doesn't understand.   He's putting his money where his mouth is by keeping it as far away from bitcoin as possible.  You're saying that if I don't believe black is a good bet then I should bet on red - and that's just stupid.   If I think black is a bad bet, it doesn't mean I think red is a *good* bet.   I put my money where my mouth is by keeping it off the table completely and finding a different game.   Do you hold short positions in all of the investments that you don't believe in?  If not, doesn't that mean you don't actually believe what you say you do?   Let's take the company Game Stop for example.   Do you think that stock is a good investment?   If so, then put your money where your mouth is and buy some.   If not, then put your money where your mouth is and short it.   Either way, you MUST have a position in order to have an opinion - that's what you're saying - and that's just dumb.   I think black is a bad bet because Roulette is a stupid game.   Sorry if I don't "put my money where my mouth is" and bet on Red - but that doesn't mean I secretly believe black is a good bet.   
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:41:45
Well that's just stupid.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:49:50
You're just arguing to argue now, everything you wrote here is stupid.  Warren Buffet has always put his money where his mouth is \- the fact that you think shorting is the only way to do so just makes you look like an idiot.  He could just as easily "put his money where his mouth is" by betting on a competitor \(banks, other currencies, bcash, or anything else he finds more valuable, like APPL\).   You're also obviously lying about game stop \- we both know you don't hold a position.  If you did, your opinion definitely wouldn't be "meh".
By the way \- it was over $9400 when he called it Rat Poison.   If he'd have actually "put his money where his mouth is" and taken a short position then, he'd have made an absolute killing LMAO.
"He has the ability to bet against bitcoin, he has not yet."
I also have the ability to bet against bitcoin \-\- not just by shorting it, but also by simply not buying it, or by betting on a competitor, or by betting on something that I believe will do better.   Sorry you don't get that \- but don't feel bad, most of you people don't.

Well I guess its handy that shorting this asset is already possible then.  
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:54:08
That's only true with things that are actually finite.  Digital tokens are infinite.    It doesn't matter how many times you divide a bitcoin, every fractional piece, no matter how small, has the exact same properties as every other piece.  Pieces of an apple will be significantly different depending on whether you cut it into 5 pieces or 50,000 pieces - but it doesn't matter with bitcoin.  21 million or 21 quintillion -- every unit is exactly the same as the other no matter how you slice it.

LOL diamonds aren't a precious metal bud.  They're not even a metal.  
And diamonds aren't fungible so they don't really have a place in this conversation.  Two diamonds of the exact same size and weight might have vast differences in value because of color, quality,  clarity, etc.   Which is why they aren't treated anything like precious metals.  Nobody has ever backed a currency with diamonds,  no countries keep diamond reserves....   To be honest the fact that you brought diamonds into this conversation gives me serious doubts about your understanding of what we're even talking about lol


It doesn't matter.  When it forked you went from 21 million "rare and unique" tokens to 42 million and there is literally no difference in their properties - they're all magic digital tokens that can move money from point A to point B.

Like the orchestra on the Titanic?   They just kept on playing their happy songs, all the way to the bottom of the ocean.   Or a gambling addict who hopefully and optimistically mortgages his house to keep on playing...  It might actually do them some good if somebody attacked their optimism and did something to remind them how bad it was.    You can keep on playing that fiddle but don't be surprised when some of us look at you and think to ourselves, "what the fuck is he doing?  Fighting?? By going down with the ship!?  Well at least he's hopeful and optimistic LOL"
There are people here who, with all the hope and optimism in the world, proclaim that they'll HODL all the way to zero.   You have every right to do that, but lots of us are left scratching our heads when we try to imagine why.    I understand OP's frustration too, because the last thing you need on a sinking ship is a deck full of people relying on hope and optimism.

@_date: 2018-06-27 17:22:45
Nope you're wrong, sorry.  Digital tokens may be limited in number but each one is infinitely divisible.  You can divide a satoshi by 2 or by 200,000 - it doesn't matter because each fractional piece is identical.   Try doing that with gold.  Once you get down to a single molecule, you're done.  You can't divide any more unless you start changing the molecular structure.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:43:22
Yeah bribe one of your parents and then pray that coinbase doesnt empty their bank account or that your parents' bank doesnt forcibly close their account.   Hey OP if its this hard to buy, you should think about how you're going to sell when that time comes.  One of the factors that makes a thing a good or bad investment is liquidity - how easy it is to move in and out.   If getting in is this hard, how do you think getting out will be?
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:54:45
Back up about 10 feet bud.   That's a mirror you're looking at LOL
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:15:11
Exactly.  And look how many "rare and unique" digital tokens exist that can do exactly what bitcoin does now.    It's waaaaaaay more than 21 million.   Bitcoin won't work?  Use ethereum. Or monero.  Or litecoin.  Or bitcoin cash.   Or Doge.  They all do exactly the same thing.   
There is no alternative to gold's unique set of properties.   It can't be forked into a similar but slightly different version of itself and there is no configuration setting for how much of it can exist.  Nothing else can ever be forked to be like gold.   There is and will only ever be one version of gold.

Nobody hurt me, I'm just sharing my honest opinion.  Sorry if that bugs you.  Getting in or out has never been a problem for me either, mostly because I have no interest in ever "investing" in it - but it's not really debatable, the liquidity of bitcoin is absolutely shit, especially during big price swings.  Its great that you havent had any issues getting in or out but OP is having issues getting in as we speak.  If he has half a brain he'll give some thought to the  other side of that coin.  xD

That's funny because the volatility and instability of bitcoin's price make it unusable as both a currency and a store of value, and that fits Buffet's narrative perfectly.  Not only that, it also explains why a long-term short is playing with fire even during the 70% buttfucking you took over the last 6 months lol
Of course there's money to be made in this market (70% down since December hellllooooo) - you just have to enjoy playing Russian Roulette in order to make it.

That's right - and hey look at that, he hasn't been. Go figure.

Buffet's predictions were never about price.  He thinks it's unsafe, that it's a mirage because it ultimately has no real value and that it will end badly - none of those things have been proven false, so he's not actually wrong about anything.  Nice try though.

If anything this proves why you don't go margin short in a heavily manipulated, unregulated market - even in the midst of a 70% drop.  People asking "why won't buffet or gates put their money where their mouth is and go short??"  have their answer: Because it's a mine field.  Not buying at $12k *was* putting their money where their mouth is.

lol that's funny.   I zoomed out - still an obvious bubble &amp; crash lmao....  Maybe I should switch to the log chart too?  xD

What a stupid question.   Ever heard the term "bubble"?  Do you know what usually happens to the price of a bubbling asset before it crashes?

By that dumbass logic the housing &amp; stock markets have never bubbled &amp; crashed because they've bubbled &amp; crashed several times.   Are you by chance Albert Einstein?  Because you're obviously a genius.
