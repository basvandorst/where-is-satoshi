You severely misunderstand how this all works.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:49:36
Isn't that exactly what the futures market is supposed to do, reduce volatility in the market price?

Why would you need 1btc to set up a channel?  You set up the channel with the max funds you intend to transfer to that entity.

Only cap gains if you have held it for a year + one day right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:03:45
Is there any sense to doing both?  I am considering buying and holding a few hundred bucks a week but also dropping $300 cash into GDAX and playing the dips.  I figure worst case I turn my $300 into $310 through an hour's worth of sweaty fatigued trades and then end up holding when I invariably buy back in too high.  As long as I am disciplined enough to turn my play money into a hold I won't fuck myself right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:29
Perhaps people are buying in because they see the improvements and adoption right around the corner?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:43:07
Hey asshole, I bought at 19.6k, clearly this is my dip!  Quit taking credit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:02:42
If you are that [confident]( call your new paradigm when you see it and reposition after the crash!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:35:34
Since this past Saturday I have:  Created a coinbase account, created a GDAX account, been verified on coinbase, purchased coins via CC on coinbase, traded a little on GDAX (thank you sideways market all weekend!) with no issue.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:58:44
I know nothing, but I know it cracks me up when people decry the fact that bitcoin adoption as a mainstream currency has been slow.  It has become a tool of the underground markets, do people not understand the implications there?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:12:36
Yeah that's a transfer into your bank will take time, didn't even start processing until this morning.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:28:38
Think of the gain for the overall market, especially coinbase users.  The vast majority on that platform are noobs like me that are buying and holding.  Lower TX fees mean nothing to us until we scratch our way to a big enough position that we want to take it offline, then we create posts like this one.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:54:58
Fair enough, I know I have been fascinated seeing the things that exist in the bitcoin space due to the youth of it all.  Arbitrage opportunies of +/- $1200 during times of high volatility on different markets lasting for DAYS, due to slow transfer speeds.  Fantastic stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:06:49
Cap gains isn't going anywhere, but individual federal rates are going down.  Theoretically you should benefit anywhere from negligibly to a little bit depending on your total income.  My plan is to hold everything I am buying well past the point where they will be cap gains anyhow.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:39:19
What the shit is this?  I'm not clicking that, what kind of scam bot are you?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:16:56
I am no expert but I have heard people say that the vast majority of people that own bitcoin own substantially less than the numbers you are describing.  There may be some going all-in, but that's a terrible decision with any commodity or market at any time in history, no one can predict the future.  People tend to behave the MOST rationally out of any of their decision making when it comes to their money, so I can't figure there are that many behaving that way.  For example I am a newcomer, started playing last week at 15,800, and have already set up a plan for buys every pay period that are worthwhile but entirely insignificant towards my total budget.  I would imagine most of the newcomers are closer to that mark, which is great for the market.

For questions like that go to cryptocompare.com search for your coin (Ripple - XRP) and click "analysis".  This will show you the trading pairs and what exchanges that coin is available on, by volume.  Very useful.  It appears you can convert USD to XRP directly on binance.  Litecoin you can purchase from coinbase/GDAX or Gemini which are both US-based and insured exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:35
They lost a boatload of customer coins and had a very poor response to it, they have a great selection but their trust is low.  If you are planning on purchasing altcoins and throwing them into an offline wallet probably not too much concern, but I certainly wouldn't let them hold anything for me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:33:48
Oceanmutt was talking about converting to USD.  He is saying that the "benefit" of trying to avoid taxes by using overseas exchanges does not outweight the benefit of using US based exchanges with FDIC protection.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:10:52
My point is that Coinbase has less interest in implementing Segwit because so much of its user base is not demanding it.  I agree that it would have a major impact on the overall network if they did, being as large of an exchange as they are.  Even as a holder I want to see all good tech implemented as fast as possible because it speeds up adoption.  As a latecomer I am not in as much of a rush as you are though because any short term drop in price just allows me to strengthen my position, and any delay in increase does the same.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:06:46
Do the verification on coinbase, for some reason the system works better on that side but it will also verify your account for GDAX.  Make sure you are using the same account, both sites are owned by coinbase and their databases share users.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:40:24
Coinbase is to my knowledge the only FDIC insured exchange.  Your first $250K are insured against their loss or malfeasance.  This does NOT protect YOU from your account being broken into.  Make sure you have 2FA setup and a no-bullshit password.  If you are trying to store more than $250K PM me, I have plenty of room in my account to help you store the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:33:14
Then go ahead and subtract 35% of the margin if you bought your coins you just traded this year, or 15% as cap gains if you have held them for at least a year.  If you are in the US, anyhow.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:59:10
For me, I think about the 1200 crash.  Had you bought in at 1200 you would have been a fool for 3 years, and now a genius.  If you truly believe in the long-term goals, nothing has changed.  Buy small every week, nail the dips.  I am hoping for a correction so I can increase my position.  The only question is whether the price is about to correct from 20, or is it going to rise to 80 and correct to 30?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:14:55
It makes sense because transaction times are high and fees are high right now due to limitations in the coin technology, allowing these arbitrage opportunities to exist.  Once these problems are solved those gaps will close quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:51:14
Some of us are seeing how congested the network is and how the price is still going up and predicting that with LN around the corner and another futures market coming online today that it is going to go nuts in the next year or two.  Essentially if the problems that exist right now still are not depressing the rise in price, what's going to happen when they are solved?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:18
Thank you.  Short term capital gains are taxed at your normal income tax rate, is that correct?  Essentially it's a useful term for describing the type of income but has no impact (currently) on your taxes versus any other form of regular income?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:40:24
..?  Mt. Gox has been shut down since 2014?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:13:12
People are concerned for your security.  Consider those out there that have been in it for years, told others they had 100 coins when that wasn't more than a few grand, and now are legitimately concerned for their safety.  YMMV but would you tell people how much cash you were storing under your mattress?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:44:53
That's above my pay grade.  My gut reaction would be nothing specific to crypto because I would shit my pants if the US Congress was actually regulating a developing technology in good time.  Perhaps some general changes to trading might impact crypto trades.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:04:52
There are always people making bad financial decisions.  Research, critical thinking, and risk aversion apply to any investment.  If you are in it for the long haul the bubbles shouldn't concern you.  If you are going to ruin yourself when a price correction occurs, you are gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:53:14
There are apps where rather than storing your coins you track all of your initial buy-in prices and it shows your gains/losses over time.  Sounds like you want that + a wallet for secure storage.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:13:19
Not sure what you are talking about, GDAX charges a percentage based fee for market buys or no fee for market makers, I have bought many times over that amount of coin and not paid any fees.  Do your research.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:41:12
I mean as long as we are dreaming how about you and I just find the 1000 coins we forgot about purchasing at $.50 in 2012?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:33:59
Mine is definitely a FOMO based philosophy, that's for sure.  Either way I am buying a little bit of different coins as I can afford to, we will see what happens.  No intention to sell anything anytime soon, if for no other reason want the lower cap gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:42:38
If this follows the pattern of the last huge crash it could get there, not sure how likely that is with the interest and volume being high right now.  Anyone with a brain want to chip in?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:52:15
I am dying to understand the opportunities here.  Can we not help bring those markets together by buying coins, tranferring between exchanges, and selling?  As long as you are beating the transaction fees seems like both free money and bringing the exchange prices together.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:57:33
Do you have any experience on transfer confirmation time, specifically between GDAX, bitstamp, and/or binance?  These are the exchanges that seem most trustworthy to me.  I know I can bring coins in/out of GDAX and purchase there fee-free (plus this tends to be the highest or second highest priced exchange), need the ideal partner exchange for it.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:19:02
I would imagine it's question of whether you sell more than the amount purchased before the 1 year 1 day window, but I do not know for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:41:04
Wait a week until your limits reset or start buying on gemini as well.  Make sure you are transferring your coins to cold storage for long term holding, offline wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:55:49
The concern is that bitcoin is in a bubble of people using it as an investment rather than a currency.  ETH solves a lot of the "issues" with bitcoin that might prevent it from becoming a currency replacement long term.  The bet here is that someday bitcoin will fail as a currency and ETH will shoot up in value, just impossible to say when.  Right now I think the best play for true believers in bitcoin is to buy and hold, best play for true believers in crypto but afraid of the bitcoin volatility and price is to buy and hold as much of the competing currencies and forget about them for a long while.

So that's what someone who is actually in it for the tech sounds like.  Thanks for posting, that was a good watch.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:54
Because they are trading at different values on those exchanges.  GDAX is almost always the highest priced exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:04:33
You deal with them.  If you just cashed out $500K you likely are already above the $10k limit, but if you aren't you take out $10k and wait, hope they bump your limit, or contact them and work out a deal for raising it manually (going to be hard right now with their new user volume.)

I would assume from the desire to generate traffic.
