Banks have much more money, and much more to lose. Realistically, I can see them adopting the blockchain technology in some form or another, but I'm not sure they will actually adopt bitcoin itself.

This is actually a really good idea. The main thing keeping us from going to Mars is lack of financial incentive.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:46:21
In my opinion, it seems like too many people are treating this like an investment. Bitcoin has investment-like properties but I don't think it will ever become mainstream if people are just holding on waiting for it to go up.

They should be waiving all fees in this scenario as they are forcing people to move everything.

No, I didn't miss the point. But, suggesting that North Korea could be responsible for hacking bitcoin and then cause an economic collapse is ridiculous. 
The fact you tried to explain the original comment to me after I said "I get the point you're making" is a testament to your autism.

I never said I can do it. But I do know people who consistently can and do make money on technicals alone. And what do you think the high frequency trading algorithms are doing? You realize it was people who created those programs, right? Just because you as an individual don't know how to do it doesn't make it any less possible. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:31:58
I'm not sure I follow - could you explain this a bit more?

It actually is.

If you follow this logic all the way through, then the result is the same. You are charging more than the hashing power is worth.

I think your first point is spot on. Banning something like bitcoin would definitely give off the appearance that they felt threatened by it. Even if thats not the actual reason it were banned.

They sold for $1100 per coin and bought for $1200 per coin (rough numbers)
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:13:23
Yeah this simply isn't true and is a very common misconception. The price charts contain a ton of information and there are entire businesses built upon making money off technical readings and they do so consistently.

You're doing a fantastic job of correcting that
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:40:25
Ask yourself this - if you had bitcoin mining equipment - why would you lend its hashing power to others? The only reasonable answer is that you are charging more than the hashing is worth.

If this codes as a cash advance on your credit card then the 11% markup is just the tip of the iceberg. Its always nice to have additional methods for buying bitcoin but this is a very expensive way of purchasing them. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:05:46
I agree - I think if you take the time to understand that technicals are more or less a reflection of the market sentiment and investor psychology, it makes a lot of sense as to why certain indicators can be predictive of future price moves.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:49:03
Yep - this is why momentum trading and trend trading are historically one of the most successful strategies. The idea is basically that trying to predict tops and bottoms is nearly impossible.

Total supply does not equal all the coins in existence. That's not what supply means in economics. Supply is the amount that is available for sale at a given time. For bitcoin, this is the amount that is available on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:30:19
I don't like the market cap milestones. Its almost impossible to know how many coins are lost forever and that could effect the market cap pretty significantly.

Why don't unicorns paint their dildos mahogany? 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:44:39
We actually know that some coins are definitely lost forever. There are invalid addresses that have had coins sent to them. These can't be retrieved. There are also stories of people reformatting a hard drive because they forgot they had a bitcoin wallet on there (back when bitcoins were worth nothing). These are also lost forever but there's no good way to accurately determine how large this number is. 
I don't know of a good alternative to market cap. I just don't think market cap has much meaning for bitcoin considering we can't get a good handle on what the market cap actually is. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:55:52
Finally an answer to this age old question
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:02:48
In what world is 15% almost nothing?
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:35:30
It wouldn't make sense to include derivatives. The vast majority are hedges and really just represent a transfer of risk from one party to the other. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:22:04
Because if you use the number of mined coins, you are including all of the coins that have ever been accidentally lost. These can't be used by anyone so why would you assign them value?
Its analogous to having $1000 and lighting $100 of it on fire. You don't still have $1000 available to you.
Market cap is determined by multiplying a fixed amount by a price. But we don't really know what the fixed amount actually is because a certain number of coins have been destroyed.

Convince enough people to stop buying bitcoin in mass protest if miners don't signal for Segwit - pushing the price down and hurting the miners.

This feels like the beginning of a larger price correction downwards
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:26:30
Could be a self-fulfilling prophecy. People were noticing that the coins moved together at one point - and then that became the basis for a pattern that many traders began to follow.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:19:26
I'm interested in how you can see manipulation in a chart. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:31:52
Every time bitcoin has a significant correction, a few vocal members of this sub try to call the bottom and say things like "this is it, get in now before it rockets back up." There is usually a majority consensus that this is good advice, even if the bottom caller is $1,000 too early. These are usually the same people that claim a relative top cannot be called with any accuracy. 
My unpopular opinion is that there is more money to be made by selling relative tops and buying relative lows, and that these can be predicted with better than 50-50 accuracy.

@_date: 2016-07-04 16:12:40
It does change the market cap number if you go strictly by market cap definition. If those coins are permanently lost then applying them to the market cap makes zero sense because you're assigning value to something that effectively does not exist.
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:42:00
It makes quite a bit of difference. If they can't be recovered or used by anyone then how can they be assigned a value?
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:47:57
I'm far from an expert on SHA256 but I don't think the same principles apply. It doesn't really have anything in common with NP-completes. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:30:45
No thats not a good analogy. There is still a record of you owning that share whether you have the certificate or not. Losing the certificate does not mean we no longer know who is the rightful owner of the share.
In the case of bitcoin, ownership can be permanently lost. For all intents and purposes, these bitcoins are as good as gone. They cannot be recovered. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:24:22
If I had to make a wild guess - I think NP problems were not chosen because we still aren't sure if these problems are as difficult as they seem. There are computer scientists that are actively looking for ways to solve these problems in polynomial time, which if a method was discovered, could more or less be applied to all NP problems.

Interesting - I never knew this. I'll have to read more on the topic.
