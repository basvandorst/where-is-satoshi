Trolls mining is always a bad idea, mines are for Dwarfs everyone knows that, once the Trolls move in we will have tunnel collapses, missing pickaxes and all sorts of mayhem.  
Best call Cpt Carrot of the watch, see if he can get Detritus over there and have a chat with the Trolls.

A multicolor what, rainbow, unicorn, jersey your mom knitted?
Oh, drone? you mean multicopter, yes I see.
I'd imagine the bot will take it to the fridge, then proceed to smash it up and down on the shelf breaking it, and then leave the door open.

So... what ARE the top ten  list of dangers in the bitcoin technology.....

Thanks, 


Is a lot less scary than top 10 Dangers!

The robot will not need to physically go to a supermarket in a car....
You will just rent a supermarket one when you need it.
You want some milk, contact SuperMarket (shop) via email, web, phone, or fridge automatically.
The shop tasks one of their bots to do your order (they do this already but with wageslaves) the bot then proceeds to the dispatch area where a googledriverles has been hired,
It deposits shopping in the detachable cartons / sealed creates. Gcar drives to your location, this is when your bot saves you the task of moving, by going to the car and collecting the goods.

....and you send £16,000 (40BTC) in "only two" transactions !
Sometimes I believe people deserve what they get, I mean come on, is money that insignificant to you (OP) that you send what to me would be life changing amount, thousands upon thousands to some Bulgarian online Exchange.
As you (OP) were obviously trading with this cash, on an unregulated exchange with a very new cryptocurrency I'm assuming this is money you can afford to loose.
Personally I worry when buying .0001 amounts, and get it straight to an offline wallet. But then greed in making a killing in the "markets" is something I don't get.

not 100% sure what that it, but understand it is what all the addresses are taken from in armory...
At present I have a paperbackup of my armory wallet, thing is I want to get away from armory, its fine, but its too complicated for me to use securely.
ie, I have no idea where things are stored, or how its managing my private keys, or if I press the wrong thing I mess up and loose my coins, but most of all if I want to use armory, it involves &gt;60GB and many hours downloading - none of which is feasible on a 80GB laptop.
I just want my key pairs for my main coins, and then probably that electrum for daily usage, where loss would be manageable.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:12:44
Interesting, but I don't want all my coins in electrum, I'd prefer most of them to be offline, is that easy/secure to do with electrum
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:29:59
Seems a little silly on your part, that when dealing with money and an exchange moving funds to your bank account for the first time, that you chose to use "Instant Verification"
When there is the option to have coinbase actually deposit some test amounts to your account....
I can almost see your point about the instant verification not working as you thought it should, but you really did mess up by giving them the wrong bank details, totally your fault, posting on reddit to garner support for your error is a disservice to people who really do need reddit support.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:31:49
Well they didn't really get ripped off
They left money/coins in an exchange, that could have, and has by all accounts gone belly-up
This was always a risk, and still is a risk in all other exchanges.
Even a tiny bit of research would have resulted in knowing Bitcoin is Cash, so security and offline wallets, or at the least offweb wallets are where you keep you main funds.
If you had a lot of Cash (Bitcoin) in some online service you "should" have understood that, and you traded security for convenience so while you arer not responsible you are complicit in this outcome.
I've only spent a few hours looking at bitcoin, and I already have an offline armory wallet and a paper wallet, encrypted web backup etc. and only .0001 is ever online.
When people want convenience and are overcome with the thought of trading easily they should realise that their greed is mirrored and multiplied by the services they use.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:14:15
Is there a better site, or better way to generate a key pair offline that I should use instead of bitaddress?
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:48:04
OK, definitely going to have a look at electrum,


I did have a shufty at trezor, but that's hardware that could go wrong, and you have to have the "recovery seed" of that backed-up in case that happens - so in effect it's the same as just having the keys stored somewhere, encrypted either on paper or in a file. (and it costs) - may be slightly easier to use, but occasionally transferring a stored coin to an online wallet is probably just as easy.
thanks for the help though.

That's a little misguided, use of "true" final version, 7.1a is secure

Only if you have been brainwashed by advertising to buy one of those hardware wallets.
If you research, and do due diligence you will know an offline wallet is safe, and obviously you backup physically the seed for that. 
Offline signing of transactions. Then on to a online pc to broadcast them.
Broadcasting will obviously be you filling up you "hot" wallet (either phone, web or PC) with small amount of funds you want to spend that week.

Idea is alright, its the lame token. we already have btc.

Thankfully I'm mature enough to know that for the universal and perpetual truth it is.

I've only used it on my blue wallet, android phone. Not checked the development of it.
If I were to be convinced to make and receive small transactions, it will be with a well know fungible digital currency, not some bat token alt that on initial discovery is difficult to move and use outside brave ecosystem.
A successful implementation of Browser Advertising integration would be using the most well know and easily accessed crypto (btc) 
If lightning isn't ready, then in a couple of years when it is ready would be my guess.
The people who need you wishes of luck are the bat holders and original brave makers.

When it was £700 yes I was,
And where are we now? 4G?
With better adoption and lightning network as well as mass cheap transactions and plether of other services and on ramps.
Obvious troll is salty.

Glad I wasn't the only one that thought  "brave bat tokens" were a joke.
If this pans out with using btc, then sign me up.
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:10:17






Making assumptions about me to further validate your assumptions about the narrative of btc.
That's a whole lot of ass..
It is what it is, It's usecase is up to the individual. From value store, investment, sending money etc and yes also including smaller faster offchain tx is being developed too.
Most of your comment replies are low or negative, don't be offended if I no longer reply to you, I don't see the point.
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:12:36
Lightning off chain transactions as low as 1sat 0.00000001btc  is that micro enough for you, or is your knowledge pool full?
