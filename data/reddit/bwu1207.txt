He means eventually there will be a situation in which there are no more bitcoins being mined and all the remaining bitcoin will be either hodled or lost (mostly lost). If there’s not an active market of bitcoin being traded, there wouldn’t be liquidity leading to the value of bitcoin being unclear to the market.

So legitimate question: Since the majority of the BTC are either lost or being hodled, wouldn’t  this have a detrimental effect on the value long term? Eventually more will be lost (sending to wrong wallets, lost keys, etc.) and the scarcity will lead to more people hodling, you end up with an asset that becomes less liquid and price transparent, since the volume of trades gets lower. 
My thinking is that Bitcoin’s price can be positively impacted by the network effect but the reverse can also serve to be true if there’s simply less Bitcoin out there for people to buy/sell.

As much as I’m against the current monetary system, I really don’t find this doomsday scenario commentary quite helpful or realistic. It’s human nature to preserve self before preserving wealth, which is why I’m saying you’ll probably see a small sell-off in BTC before a major rally thereafter. I’m a BTC bull, but I don’t expect it to double in the months following a black swan event.
You don’t have to look further than a few days ago when the Dow dropped 800 points. Markets were blaring red with recession and BTC was down 5-10%. Where was the smart money rushing in to protect wealth then?

But how many have more than 6.15?

I used to come to this sub for crypto news and memes, but now it’s just packed with these fear-mongering, conspiracy theory posts that suggest the world should have ended three years ago. Makes everyone here look like a bunch of crazies stocking up on canned goods rather than actually helping bitcoin go mainstream. 
There is such thing as a world where bitcoin can thrive without a complete financial meltdown occurring.
Bitcoin also never lived through a full recession, so I’m not sure what evidence you are pointing regarding recession resistance. Like gold in 2008, I’m sure most traders will sell it during periods of turmoil because people have to eat. 
I’m a BTC bull, I just don’t think the world has to end for it to succeed.

Bitcoin will likely go down in the first year of a recession as people try to liquidate their positions to cover basic needs. Same thing happened to gold in 2008. It’s likely the years after when the fed starts its stimulus (low/negative rates, QE) that we’ll start seeing a flight to safe haven assets / BTC from devaluation of the dollar.

Like the time he said bitcoin would hit $50k by August 2019

Please educate me what means of production he plans on the gov’t controlling?

We have an incumbent president who think Bitcoin is worthless and is probably mulling a ban all on-ramps to BTC if it ever gets big enough...or we have the only candidate who’s embracing blockchain technology. Love or hate his policies, Yang is a step in the right direction for the adoption of BTC.

Production, distribution, **AND** exchange. I don’t think *modifying* one of three means can be defined as socialism. I say modifying because you can’t even call it regulating. Stop with the fear mongering.

True to some extent. Still has to be a competitive market place. If McDonalds suddenly increase the price of a burger by $30 because everyone has an extra $1000, the I’m just going to go to one of the 50 other chains that sell a burger. Then McDonald’s would either go out of business because no one wants a $30 burger or they lower their prices to market. As for money supply, that’s a different issue altogether. If you assume the revenues from new taxes and expense savings equal the cost, as his plan lays out, all else being the same, there’s no new supply.
