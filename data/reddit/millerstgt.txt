Jager should really be more forthcoming in this situation.
I feel way less comfortable now, leaving my money on Binance, after seeing how a customer is being treated that stated he didn´t get proper help from the customer support.
I never had trouble with Binance, but situations like these will pop up often in the future. And if not handled properly, people can and will lose trust.
Like the japanese saying:
*For want of a nail the shoe was lost,*
*for want of a shoe the horse was lost,*
*for want of a horse the knight was lost,*
*for want of a knight the battle was lost,*
*for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.*
*So a kingdom was lost—all for want of a nail.*
Treat this god damn mans situation more polite u/Jager_Binance
Not only for his sake, but also for Binance sake.

In Germany if you hold bitcoin for more than 12 months you can exchange it to euro tax-free.

Dude...the technology is solid. If bitcoin won´t  be a success then another crypto currency will for sure. 
It´s the blockchain principle that is so powerful. I can already see by your one comment that you have not clue what potential this holds for people in future.
But hey it´s been that way thousands of years. Stupid people won´t change. It has been that way with the electricity, telephone, and internet. Lot´s of skeptics just like yourself. And look at it now. It´s all around us.
Good luck with your ignorance in 20 years when you will be sucking dick in an alley for 0,0028 homocoin (!remindme 2037).

It´s not even hidden. There are already quantum computers which could break sha256. They are just freakishly expensive and mostly used in science for complex calculations.
Also they need to cool the cpu with -273C°.
Almost like normal computers in the 60s. So it could be that in 40 years we have quantum phones.

Why do some people believe that paying no tax for crypto would be a good thing?
Where would the money come from to maintain society?
It´s even counter productive for crypto. For every person that avoids taxation on crypto, it brings us one step closer to not making it to the main stream world.
