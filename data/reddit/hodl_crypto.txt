I imagine it will either be something like this, or a city of zion type of situation.

Transformative artwork is 100% fair use.   
Sold as a clock might be a different story. You're right about that.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:31:33
Fair use is more limited with Trademarks but it still applies. This is fair use.

That's quite the description.

Just dropping a note here to welcome critique of the artwork.  
I have been developing a visual language around my bitcoin art, using this mask to depict 'satoshi the creator' for the past couple years. Now building around this in a 'digital painting' style. 100% of the artwork is done in adobe illustrator.
@_date: 2019-07-20 02:14:00
This is good feedback. Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2019-07-28 13:14:14
If you want a photorealistic skyline I can show you where to find one
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:47:05
I know what you mean.. I have a sort of reverence for finished art works, mine included. 
This may be a confusing image for some people, if they look at it enough. The two main buildings have conflicting perspectives, there are luxury cars from today and concept flying vehicles that may never exist. Some structures have a high visibility or level of definition, and others are mixed in with plants or fading in the background. Something ominous lies behind the citadel.
Although your feedback doesn't convince me that this is an artistic failure, I'll consider it the next time I make a similar design decision. I do believe that the more tasteful the art is, the more impactful it has the potential to be. Thanks
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:39:45
Lol that sub is funny. Thanks.

@_date: 2019-07-20 02:13:20
Is it because it uses the Rolex symbol? Better to use the Bitcoin ₿ ?

Oh, ok. This actually started out as a static art piece with dials and full colored background. I have another similar one listed at [lynxartcollection.com]( for sale as artwork (I'm sure you will dislike). Some people suggested to try a clock out.
Btw, are you familiar with the XBT perpetual contract that trades on bitmex? It's a bitcoin derivative contract you can only use BTC for, that never expires. Thanks again for the feedback. Very helpful.
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:50:05
These artworks have absolutely nothing to do with the organization "anonymous". Thanks for your comment.

I encourage you to read the article this image was created to compliment:  
From 1971 to 2007, banks took complete control of the dollar, obfuscated its identity, and built an inherently unstable financial system on top of it. Eurodollars grew both in supply and sophistication. Banks stopped funding themselves with deposits; instead, they used US Treasuries as collateral to borrow book-entry dollars from each other. A bank license and US Treasuries together wielded the power to create seemingly unlimited money, obscuring money’s very definition. The dollar lost all of the identity it once had as a gold claim and became purely a banking liability, a loan to the overly-leveraged financial system. Instead of dollars, Treasuries became the most desirable global asset, not only because of the US government’s counterparty superiority, but also because Treasuries possessed omnipotent collateral powers that enabled money creation. Banks use US Treasuries, not dollars, as their risk-free asset, collateral anchor, and primary leverage vehicle.

haha I'm almost re-thinking the titles of this series because people get so hung up on this.
My intent is to explore connections between historical leaders and current events in the world today, and how bitcoin relates to both.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:17:35
I'm doing a big sticker pack with different designs, this one included in english [  
But I haven't considered doing a pack with a more limited range of stickers. Maybe it's a good idea. The thing is that shipping out small packs of stickers will be super inefficient for me. I think 20+ stickers is kind of the sweet spot where it makes it worth my while and whoever is buying it also for shipping.

@_date: 2019-11-29 01:36:28
Technically yes you are correct. Practically I'd argue it is. If someone can show me a large percentage of false information stored in the bitcoin blockchain I will deem  this narrative no longer worthy to push.. as a bitcoin propagandist (Winklevii are pushing this idea)

I won't comment on your interpretation because I like it, and there is a lot of that in there.
The guy fawkes mask, ya I started with that, then added the bitcoin symbol, removed eyelashes, stronger cheeks, etc. now I've added the color gradients and I use augmented reality to get the facial expressions right on the subject. I call this mask the "satoshi mask". You can try a satoshi mask AR filter on anything that looks like a face if you'd like here [
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:32:08
I used the title, "Anonymous Leader" for this series because I am using historical leaders as my subjects, masking them, and using nicknames.  I am exploring connections between these leaders, current events, and how bitcoin relates to both.

Checking in for creative interpretations. Let's hear them.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:40:34
Will offer a limited edition of prints but you should send the artist a tip if you do that :)  
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:44:32
I think that the article that I created this image to compliment will help answer your question. The author does a great job or breaking down the reasons for this comparison.
''From 1971 to 2007, banks took complete control of the dollar, obfuscated its identity, and built an inherently unstable financial system on top of it. Eurodollars grew both in supply and sophistication. Banks stopped funding themselves with deposits; instead, they used US Treasuries as collateral to borrow book-entry dollars from each other.

It's just one meme exerting its dominance over the other.
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:39:35
They are not, but this terminology is used in traditional finance, the academic world.  
A risk-free [asset]( has a certain future return. Treasuries (especially T-bills) are considered to be risk-free because the U.S. government backs them. Because they are so safe, the return on risk-free assets is very close to the current [interest rate](

I accept BTC at [luchopoletti.com]( for bitcoin art and merch. I receive orders paid in BTC multiple times per week or month at least. Lightning network payments also accepted.   
E-commerce stores accepting and encouraging payment with BTC is much more important focus than brick and mortar shops imo. Especially if the e-commerce shops are offering products that will push bitcoin adoption forward.. ;) [
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:31:57
Thanks, glad you like it
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:36:46
Thank you so much! It's incredibly motivating to see this sort of response to my artwork after putting my soul into it.. it almost makes me cry, to be honest. It's the most fulfilling thing I've come to know in my life, after leaving the corporate world to make artwork.
Yes, I'm Lucho and if you are interested at all in hearing my story, the Curating Crypto podcast did a really great job on this interview with me: [
After weeks of toiling over this piece - something so close to my heart - a message I want to share with the world - it's such an amazing reward to see people connect on this level with the artwork and appreciate it for exactly what I intend it to be. There is a very real investment of my time, energy, exploration of my own thoughts, and the sound money ethos that unites us all here.
Thanks so much for your patronage, and opting to purchase my art over the dip is such a profound compliment to me from a true bitcoiner.. judging from the context you provided, you've been part of this movement for likely longer than I have (late 2016).   
You should notice even further details once you receive the large-format print, specifically within the two frames with the Shiva and Brahma characters. I hope you will be delighted.   
I'll send you an email personally to transfer ownership of the certificate for the edition  of 21 on the BTC chain, and will get working on the order to ship. Thanks again for the support. The bitcoin will very likely be spent on tacos slowly over the course of the next month or two because I do actually live off BTC here in Mexico.  when possible :)
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:09:34
I make bitcoin art fulltime.. Lost half of my savings this morning. Everytime I log into that damned website the plan is to short and after closing one of those I go full retard. 
Anyways, at least I live in Mexico where everything is cheap. lol. LONG LIVE BITCOIN

@_date: 2019-10-25 12:37:06
To mess with you guys.. ha
I used a reference image of a hi-rail train to draw this one with the BTC-210000 ID and it happened to use a 3-letter prefix followed by 6 digits. I modeled mine directly on top, something I do often during my creative process.
Then I added 2 more zeros, to complete the supply number 21,000,000 and it required too much space for my taste to be legible comparable to other copy embedded in the image.
I would have removed another zero if I had to make that design decision again to make it even clearer that it wasn't an oversight. 
I guess I've just done so many designs with the supply # in it, especially my bank note designs that I'm more comfortable messing around with it.
Like serial numbers on the bank notes, I've played around with mashing up this info as B21T000C000, B01T03C09, of the standard BTC21000000
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:10:22
I contributed to this regretfully
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:53:38
Thanks for your thoughtful input on this. Valuable feedback for the artist .. :)
Perhaps this is a proper interpretation. I have considered that the fall of the central banking system and the rise of the bitcoin money system are mostly mutually exclusive; however there may well be some point where the latter's effect on the former is impossible to ignore.
  
I may run with this "creative destruction" over the chaotic destruction concept a bit in the future. If I publish anything I will look for you here. Thanks again.
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:42:17

@_date: 2019-12-07 17:19:16
I get what you're saying, although an anecdotal insight I think it's valid. Thanks for the feedback.
I make a wide range of artworks and graphic designs with different objectives, and this piece in particular isn't exactly something geared towards converting pre-coiners. It's more something I created in my own free-range of creativity to sell as a 1/1 non-fungible token via 
For something more geared towards public understanding, see:
@_date: 2019-12-09 09:19:14
Cool, thanks for your feedback.
The genesis block text is featured in the background throughout the entire animation, at first orange, it takes part in the fiat inferno (bitcoin was designed to replace fiat) and then the hidden message (a.k.a. satoshi's mission statement) comes out bolder and clearer towards the end on top of a strong network.

This is a series of bitcoin artworks where I'm using leaders in various areas through history as subjects, masking them, and exploring connections between ideas they popularized. Edward Bernays for example obviously never said to '' buy bitcoin ''.

Haha, why is it "TOO" wierd though. It's art, it should challenge your perception in some ways.
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:30:29
It's both. Also will become digital treasuries soon enough. Check this article out by a CFA and former bond market trader who now is a fulltime bitcoin researcher. [
@_date: 2019-12-27 14:45:23
Yes, if anyone is interested to see some more context behind this artwork, this piece is  in a series of similar art works focusing on historical leaders, and forcing connections between ideas they popularized or ways they impacted society during their time, and bitcoin.
The reason for the masks and nicknames is so that the artwork focuses more on exploring and communicating the ideas, and less on who the subjects are.

Good point, thanks for the feedback. Requires a more technical understanding than "the crowd" would likely ever realize but I agree that your more wordy description is a much more accurate representation.
Check the messaging out on this certificate-styled work I did with Tantra Labs (super interesting article by Nik Bhatia as well, characterizing bitcoin as digital treasuries and the risk-free asset of the internet moving forward in addition to "digital gold".
The reason I point to this example is because I think, to your point, maybe the fact that its a global denominated currency AND an entire financial system with no centralized controller. I think that implies that everyone is using the same system with the same rules personally
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:07:13
Thanks for the input. I'm selling it through a gallery now so I think I'll speak to the owner.. Just thought that "market maker" could serve that side to, as Satoshi created the currency and thus the market derived from it, since "make" is synonymous with create. I can concede maybe it was in bad taste though. Thanks again.

Good point on BYOB. I used to harp on this more in earlier designs, but the line fit the concept in this case. Probably won't use the line too much more in the future either..sparingly for sure, mostly for artwork that is intended more for the audience of current users. Ty for the feedback.
