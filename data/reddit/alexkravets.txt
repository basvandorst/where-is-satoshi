Mostly wishful thinking, clearly the option that Kremlin has to quickly confiscate all the wealth of the country by printing roubles is worth much more to THE KREMLIN than whatever economic benefits may or may not accrue to Russia the country.
The same logic applies to all governments of course, western or non-western, democratic or otherwise.  It's similar to selling oil, regardless of the nature of the regime in possession of oil from benign Norway to malevolent ISIS, they all want to cash in on it by selling it on the world market.

Thank you and there's more to come ... 
Some fun stuff 
@_date: 2017-01-12 06:51:49
Let me respond point by point.
1. You are correct, in the future reloading 1 whole bitcoin might be expensive. One can always re-sell the blank for its collectible value I suppose.
2. There is indeed a learning curve to trust Satoshium. But our main idea is to allow ease of accessibility through physical tangibility and elimination of need to understand addresses, confirmations, fractional amounts and other protocol low level details. The average dentist just wants to hodl some Bitcoin.
3. The same crypo-processor that powers billions of "chipped" credit cards can be encased in a secure housing and is highly durable as well as inexpensive.  (billions of small devices circulating in rough conditions for decades now)
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:49:03
Thanks. We are looking at a release in Q3 2017

We believe it's possible. For details, see our recently published white paper
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:24:22
Miners should continue collecting fees and block reward. But if they wish their "please append and continue building on top of me" blocks to actually NOT be discarded and built-upon by other miners, they have to produce them according to the rules. There's just no way around it. 
Validation is already at full nodes. The whole thing is predicated on zero-trust process of *eventual convergence* onto the highest cumulative difficulty chain by a full node that requests blocks from untrusted peers and validates/audits all the transactions and blocks follow the rules completely independently ... so, for example, being behind Great Firewall of China with fake blocks or histories being fed by that firewall will only slow down the convergence process until access to the real (and "heavier" ) chain is re-established by (eventually) getting blocks from the outside ...
It IS true that full nodes are not compensated (currently) for uploading gigabytes of blocks to other full nodes upon request and essentially the whole network runs on collective altruism but that has so far been sustainable precisely because as long as there is even a single altruistic node uploading blocks from the heaviest and valid chain, the system will eventually be re-seeded from it
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:57:45
Much different. Read the white paper, you'll see :-)
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:41:36
beta-wallet.trezor.io supports it now
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:49:57
Miners only get to decide the order of transactions. Should they validate any transaction invalid otherwise, the whole block will be rejected by nodes (and other miners) ... So what's the problem ?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:39:32
Let me re-iterate miners can and do what they please but that has not the slightest effect on the eventually converged upon chain being (re)seeded by the nodes. 
Highest Cumulative Difficulty VALID chain always has and always will be converged upon ... any deviation has been and will continue to be ignored ...
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:33:30
I don't believe we are talking past each other. 
If some/most miners do not reject invalid txs or blocks then such miners WILL forfeit both their block reward and fee income because no uncorrupted nodes will accept such blocks, the chain will appear to stall for a while (to existing nodes and new nodes coming online to sync after this takes place) and then some miners will still be mining valid blocks or new miners who wish to collect the rewards will appear

Running your own opensimcoin using Bitcoin technology causes more problems than it solves, because compared to Bitcoin the hashing power of your alt chain will be tiny and will therefore be easy to attack.  Many alt chains came and went this way.  Enabling "instant payment verification in Bitcoin" is an old topic discussed in many places, there is even 3rd party "payment verifiers" available.  For an example of why this is generally not an issue, I would refer you to how satoshidice.com handles it or to this paper

More recent information on the richest 500 BTC addresses is here
 
The pyramid is already less top heavy than it used to be, also all the coin movements are probably designed to anonymize coins, which is ineffective without real random coin swapping rather than as part of an elaborate conspiracy to dupe later adopters about the wealth of early adopters ... 
@_date: 2012-09-27 01:17:28
Agreed, so far coinbase looks pretty goofy despite all the big names backing it, it's got a long way to go to match blockchain.info
@_date: 2012-10-02 18:44:31
There used to be an address with 500,000+ coins at the top that was rumored to be SilkRoad savings, then it got broken down and annonymized away.  
P.S. There is no way to hide from this list as it's automatically computable from the Block Chain, on the other hand there is no easy way to know who owns these addresses.
@_date: 2012-10-13 23:10:30
Why would people care about "storing" their Bitcoins ? The Bitcoin network already does it just fine replicated in 100,000's of locations around the world ... All one needs is a way to *regenerate* one's private key given a sufficiently long and obscure passphrase ...
People, please do yourself (and Bitcoin adoption) a favor just get yourself a brain wallet as described here 
As an additional precautionary step against Alzheimer's disease or just forgetting your passphrase, print out your "raw" private key on a slip of paper and stash it away in an envelope some place safe ...
Cheers ...
P.S. Vast majority of ordinary users should abandon all attempts to run their own "nodes" i.e. don't bother installing the "official" bitcoin.org client ... instead use a "watch-only" (i.e. no private key imported) savings address at  along with a much smaller petty cash address generated by blockchain.info for you ...

When people ask me about holding Bitcoin, I tell them, unless you *REALLY* know exactly what you're doing, you're probably much better off holding it in a Xapo vault. There's just too many pitfalls for "regular civilians" and if Xapo has been audited by multiple teams and is good enough to have BIT and other 50 million+ USD equivalent accounts, it's probably good enough for your 10 coins too
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:46:03
When you enable the passphrase WITH the mnemonic seed you now have a 2-factor "bank" I say bank because it's multi-coin then multi-account in each coin. Now you CAN put your seed in the safe deposit box while keeping the passphrase inscribed in some book or with your sealed will etc ...
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:50:09
The difference is that you can actually spend from a hardware wallet, or sign transactions to claim various giveaways, not just hodl your coins cold. Sooner or later you'll have to import your key(s) from a paper wallet and that will exposure you to an insecure environment

The ironic thing is that despite the "pre-mine" label thrown around by anti-Ripple people, int the end this kind of distribution strategy IF FOLLOWED THROUGH, will end up making Ripple a 100 times more egalitarian than Bitcoin can ever be.

Having either coins or cash at the exchange just means that you have IOUs for either coins or cash respectively, which are only as good as the exchanges security as well as good will of some gov't agency not to shut down and/or confiscate its assets.  
If you are willing to hold IOUs instead of assets, then you're missing the whole point of Bitcoin: zero middleman and zero counterparty risk.

Umm... no there is absolutely zero evidence for lack of bitcoins orbiting Mars but that doesn't mean that there's a 50/50 chance that they already do ... lol

After several reinstalls on win 7, everything works and initial blockchain sync takes about 3 - 4 hours, but last 10% of the chain consistently take 75% of total sync time

Bravo ! And thank you, in this case it's a smaller insufficient-comm problem, i.e. why not add "Completed scan for similar defects" to Gavin's tweet and Release Notes. 
Crypto or not, but significant component of every currency's success is the confidence if its users, so why not take credit where it's due AND thereby increase confidence ?

Forget millibits, switch directly to Satoshis and do the switch once

Thank you, I do and I am :-)

This is more fair

For a small operation like your it would make sense to simply use BitPay especially since you don't want to adjust prices manually every time BTC sets a new high like today

Vaporware ...

In their paternalistic arrogance this "feature" will stop "them" from outlawing / fighting bitcoin, however in the long run most txs can be fully anonymized for low or no cost and hence most coins can be laundered ... so it's a temporary issue.
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:17:33
Split your coins into two addresses: petty cash and savings.
Store petty cash in a wallet on blockchain.info and access it from any phone or browser using chrome extension if possible.
Put savings into a brain wallet with an additional backup on paper or a custom dog tag to leave to your loved ones in case of your death.  Goes without saying that the private key for savings must never be entered into any online site or any computer or phone which is ever gonna be connected to the Internet.
Once every few years you can send a percentage of your savings into your petty cash address by creating an off line signed transaction and then submitting it using any decent wallet or blockchain.info

Largest percentage gains in bitcoin happened when it was illiquid too.
XRPs went from 1500 to 80 per USD now in last 8 weeks ... just saying
EDIT: It's 50 now
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:44:38
Your incentive comes from the realization that: 
1. The purchasing power of your *remaining* coins is rising faster than you're spending coins.
2. That time and life are more valuable than even bitcoins.

PSA: You'd be surprised how much has already been documented here 
No, the source hasn't been released yet, but that doesn't mean Ripple is worthless or that it's too early to consider it.
How many fervent Bitcoiners have *really* loaded Satoshi client C++ code base into their heads ?

1. Download this file AND stash it away for those future times when blockchain.info is temporarily or permanently gone (don't run it over the net) instead launch it from your local file into your local browser
2. Paste your wallet backup and passphrase to get your private keys out
3. Import your private keys into some other local or hybrid online wallet or into some exchange like MtGox
4. As a bonus download and stash away this SINGLE HTML file  to be able to create secure offline wallets or brain wallets.
5. Extra bonus, download and stash away the GitHub latest greatest version of 
I keep all that stuff in my Bitcoin folder on my Google Drive and Mega.co.nz drive

Saving XRPs for the future is a kind of use. Also, there's very active trading of all types of fiat, BTC, LTC, etc *through* XRPs

Takes a few hours of reading 
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:48:10
Correction: bitbox and crypto.st are both Mickey Mouse jobs (one's a single page the other is already offline) and kraken is stil in beta

Next level will be "millies" (1/1000 BTC) "mikies" (1/1,000,000 BTC) and "satoshis" 1/100 mikie.

Basically ALL your claims are factually incorrect, I'd rather not go into endless discussions here, should you want to refute all these claims for yourself, spending about half an hour reading through  should do it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:06:23
Arbitrage is very difficult because it takes too long to move fiat around
@_date: 2013-03-11 07:34:33
It doesn't matter if/when majors start accepting Bitcoin, there is enough store-of-value / investment demand to drive Bitcoin price another x 100.
Sooner or later (sooner) there will be Visa/MC logo debit cards with Bitcoin addresses on them.  Bitinstant will be launching one soon.

But why can't we have a balanced Bitcoin discussion ? Why must it always degenerate into a circle jerk ? Oh wait ... I know bc 90% of ppl are douchebags :-)

This is why Bitcoin sometimes sucks monkey balls, this and slow confirmation times
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:53:43
No attacker can ever take away your coins, however an attacker can disrupt Bitcoin network, a *sophisticated* attacker would need to spend AT MOST as much per day as all the miners earn at that time per day (b/c presumably they are mining at break even or better)

Bitcoin is obsolete (I wish it all the best and have some myself) but it's time to move onto the next one ... 
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:34:13
In a few years the "unwashed Bitcoinless masses of the world" will be attacking all edge parts of the Bitcoin infrastructure :-) which will of course have "bitcoin users affected" and rapidly switching to Cryptocurrency 2.0 ... can you guess if it's already out there ?
Hint: it is :-)

From a business owners perspective, one should just use a payment processor that automatically converts to USD after dynamically adjusting BTC amount to current rate

Correction: if you're not the *sole* owner of the private key it's not yours. Also, having fiat balances at any exchange means you have promises to redeem which maybe beyond their control to keep

Actually the substance of the proposal almost doesn't matter, one must simply realize that it's huge, complex and lacks both consensus in the Bitcoin community and any, let alone running, code.
TL;DR: Ivory Tower paper with close to zero chance of mattering in the real world

Capping Bitcoin price would require continued sales at the cap level, bc the Fed would presumably eventually run out of its stash since entire supply is finite, earlier buyers will start reselling above the ceiling.
tl;dr It's not possible to put a ceiling on Bitcoin, only a floor.

Backed currencies are only as strong as the weakest part of the backing, just because a currency is "backed" by gold or bitcoin doesn't mean the gov't won't stop the backing or redefine it. Argentine Peso was backed by USD, until it wasn't.

QED (sarcasm)
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:52:23
You imply that spending 24 hours to build it is a good thing ? You should delay the launch until tested or risk disaster due to early adopter problems and resulting bad publicity

Last 10% of the sync consistently takes 80 to 90 % of the total sync time. This is on a decent Alienware laptop running Win 7

Here's the elephant in the room, it's different enough NOT to be considered an alt coin, but it's an alt system: 
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:12:23
OP does have a point, Bitcoin does have certain "medieval" characteristics similar to gold in The Dark Ages.
Not to worry,  will allow all assets (not just currencies) including BTC to be issued as IOUs (no, it's not a dirty word if implemented properly).
At that point we will have "perpetual coins" (BTCs &amp; Ripples) and "credit coins" which will be all currencies, including BTC (but not XRPs !).
Credit coins will prove superb transactional means of exchange, while "perpetual coins" will serve as stores of value.
Cheers ...

Clueless wall street talking heads being excited and regurgitating all the usual FUD and myths about Bitcoin

There is no air tight proof and there never will be but multiple independent lines of evidence all seem to converge on it, including style of ripple's C++ server code already starting to leak out and original Satoshi client C++ code, also just google "Jeb McCaleb Satoshi Nakamoto" to get other people's thoughts on the subject

We will all be using ripple to trade BTCs and fiat, it's small for now, but you can get in and out through Bitstamp.net as a gateway
@_date: 2013-10-19 09:29:35
Two step plan:
1. Petty cash wallet on blockchain.info with a few coins, used from web and/or cell phones
2. Long term "untouchable" (but watchable) savings address generated one time offline as brain wallet with backups in case of premature demise.
Once every few years a transfer is made from savings to petty cash wallet ...
@_date: 2013-03-06 11:07:08
You guys are silly, here's why:
Imagine The Fed decides to buy 95% of Bitcoins in existence (i.e. from anybody who will be tempted or compelled to sell) by printing a fresh $100 billion in USD fiat.
So what ?  They will end up creating a new $100 billion monetary base i.e. bitcoin will be usable by central banks, etc but they will still be unable to maintain a CAP ON ITS PRICE.  
Why ? Because for a digital asset like bitcoin, where nobody in their right mind (except for all those coinbase and mtgox users which actually *keep* sheesh their coins there !!!) should accept a Bitcoin IOU instead of REAL Bitcoin stored comfy cozily their own brain wallets (i.e. private keys under their OWN control), and when people won't accept "paper Bitcoins" i.e. Bitcoin IOUs, the *only* way to put a ceiling on Bitcoin's price is to keep selling unlimited quantities at that price ... but wait ... that eventually leads to the erosion of the hoard and your buyers re-selling the coins at a yet higher prices ...
Bottom line: Not even the "printer mafia (central banks)" can cap the price of Bitcoin ... at least until they convince the masses to use "paper Bitcoins" i.e. just like the masses currently use "paper Silver" or "paper Gold".
Cheers ...

Did television try to replace radio ? Both are still around and doing well, same applies to Ripple and Bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-08-19 01:02:27
Never keep either coins or fiat on ANY exchange, in and out, in and out. Why have exchange coin IOUs when you can have real "physical" coins in your brain wallet ?
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:49:24
Douchebags, price in coins must remain dynamic w/ rate of exchange at all times for a while yet
@_date: 2013-03-18 05:34:05
Here's Rule 304 
@_date: 2013-08-06 01:49:49
They do :-)
@_date: 2013-02-18 09:56:19
The real advice is this: persevere through all the bullshit and accumulate them anyways ... again, if it was as easy as it should and eventually *will* be to buy coins then the price would and will be 10 or 100 times higher ... so don't complain, just stick with the program 
@_date: 2013-02-13 11:50:22

PSA: I read all the comments about Ripple in this thread and ALl but a few are completely misinformed about it. 
It's time to leave the echo chamber for a while and read up about Ripple from the source

This is by far the most secure and convenient option for all but total uber nerds
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:16:18
I could explain how you're mistaken about Ripple, but instead I would kindly ask that you go straight to the source and draw your own conclusions  ... It could take an hour or two of thorough reading around the wiki to settle it but it surely beats spending same time bouncing around this Bitcoin echo chamber :-)
Cheers ...

I have done business with it. 
TL;DR stay away from it, no customer service, no liquidity and will soon poof out of existence along with your balances.

Wouldn't we all like to know :-)  I'm treating it as vaporware that it is (they already had to "delay" the launch) until proven otherwise.

It's nice of Bitcoin devs to provide a rapid emergency fix, what would be nicer is to do a total scan of the source tree for 10+ other lurking bugs of this type where blockchain data is assumed to be well behaved ... now THAT would be an evolutionary adaptation :-)
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:44:09
Always "salt" your passphrase with some information that's completely unique to you, like your primary email address.  This rules out most precompute attacks having trillions of common phrases pre-hashed, because that giant dictionary won't have any information specific to individual users.

Send to yourself as BTC the system will show you a preview of the best possible conversion rate
@_date: 2013-05-06 03:46:47
Why not leave the bitcoin echo chamber for a while and actually try to understand Ripple ?
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:02:10
95%+ of USD/EUR/GBP money supply has originated as debt, also trillions of derivatives are additional counter-party-risk contracts on top.
Metals &amp; Bitcoin have no counter party risk.
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:59:59
No matter, it's besides the point. The whole of bitcoin economy needs a reliable real time market rate, and MtCox is not it, not yet anyways.
I'm willing to give them a benefit of the doubt and wait for that vaporware new engine they kept mumbling about... but the real problem is that they don't know how to run a market in this type of security. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:49:33

When MtCox's mickey mouse engine starts lagging and nobody can get a real time BTC/USD price, then SR and others who only use BTC for settlement while USD for denomination are still screwed.  During the crash bitcoinstore.com was frozen
