Now we just need to get Plan B to participate in an ad campaign.

The thing is there's a bit of mental gymnastics required to turn a BTC number into a mBTC which some members of the *general* public may not be up to, not to mention that the coins are currently represented as a decimal of BTC so there will be a menu cost involved in changing it in the future.

How about you silence yourself.
Panic selling is just increasing the lag of the trading sites and big hit like this will certainly damage the reputation of the BTC.

Best I can do is 0.1

The hype cycle may be avoided which entirely depends on whether bitcoin is picked up and becomes commonly used in day to day activites, the start of which we see to be happening now, although it needs to be happening on a larger scale.
I think one of the hurdles that needs to be overcome is to find an effective way to explain bitcoins and their advantages to the lay-person, and arguably more importantly, how one can use it in a **safe** and **secure** way.

Damn I wish I got into this earlier instead of sitting with my 0.1 from mining the past few days.

I agree, although it wasn't only Mtgox experiencing issues.
