Everyone notice how whenever Bcash tries to pull something, it brings the entire market down? Bcash shoots up like a rocket, but then plummets down harder. Eventually everything recovers. But I remember when BTC went from $8000 to $5500 in minutes. And Bcash went from $1200 to $2500, then crashed down hard later.

I literally lol'd at this ��

Depends on what your goal is. To make money? If you want to make money faster, there are other alt coins that may increase percentage wise faster than Bitcoin now. BUT. If you believe in the tech behind Bitcoin, you should buy Bitcoin. Depends on what your purpose is. Send me a PM if you want more info.

There are pros and cons to each coin. Not every coin is good for every application. Depends on your needs. But yes. Bitcoin is a great coin. It doesn't Excel in 100% of the areas though, I hope we can agree on that.

Oh cool! Thank you ��

Old news. But we'll see how it plays out over time. Everyone needs to make sure they pay taxes on capital gains and there is nothing to worry about.

You’ll most likely miss out on the B2X coin.

Ehh, I'm in it for both. The tech behind bitcoin is awesome. And I can't complain when the price goes up.

Oh duh ��‍♂️ I totally messed up there. Thanks for the correction!

Uh oh, there are some controversial coins on that shirt that this subreddit may not approve of ;) it's a cool looking shirt though!
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:15:39
That’s awesome! How much were the fees though?

I would say it depends on how long you want to keep it in bitcoin. If you are buying bitcoin, 1BTC = 1BTC will always be true. If you are okay with it going down 50% and possibly having to hold onto it for 2 years to ride out a major dip, then I think any time is a good time to buy. Who knows with this fork though... some are waiting till after the fork to do anything.

Roger is a fucking billionaire... 33K is nothing to him lol. I legitimately think he's using it to raise funds to spread word with his team. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:19:23
Damn you. Why didn't you tell me before you bought ;)

Buy into something if you believe in it. Do lots of research. Honestly I would wait till after this Friday, The DA could cause price swings in either direction so wait till it stables out :) BTC tends to go in an upward direction (moon) so I would say it's a safe long term investment if you can look past all the crazy ups and downs. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:39:16
Maybe it's the most popular wallet, but it's far from the best. I saw your post on /btc and I agree that BTC fees are pretty high though. Pick the coin you believe in most I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Rumor has it we never made it to the moon. It was all a conspiracy. But there is news that this new group called will be the first to touch foot on the moon.

The government always wants to make sure they get their slice of the pie. As long as they get what they want, I don't see them shutting it down. It's another thing they can tax. I could see more regulations happening in regards to crypto, but I don't see them shutting it down.  Unless it became a big enough threat to their income. Like if 10% of people used crypto currencies exclusively. Keep in mind, less than 1% of people use crypto currencies currently. Once it gets significantly higher, we may see some political outcry. Just my opinion though.

I would say the main thing is the brand name. Other coins may have better solutions to these other things, but most people have heard of Bitcoin by now.
