well i mean.....who are the people that are going to buy bitcoin at 200k?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:02:18
Then what's bitcoins advantage over other coins? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:44:34


















it's not a question of who will want to, but who will *actually* have 200k to drop on a coin?

say I buy in, then the next person buys in higher, then the next higher....at what point does the average joe stop buy and the real bucks come in?

in the future everything will be made so cheaply by robots it won't cost ANY money to get goods.

not really.....what does it cost? to pay the workers? they don't need money because they get everything for free. The materials? mine and refined for free because *their* facilities are ran autonomously by robots, for free because they get *their* materials for free too.....this is all theoretical of course. Nothing in this world will ever be free. I'm convinced there will always be a party of people that believe they deserve more than everyone else. And if they have the means, they will make it happen.

that doesn't mean anything. then humanity will just go extinct eventually in that context

i dare say it's a ponzi scheme. Those who are in on it want others to join just so they can get more people into it

Eventually bitcoin will be abandoned. I'm not making any judgements on high the value will get. I could see it hitting $200k a coin. 
But bitcoins are *only* valuable because of what people pay for it. To me this looks like a long dragged out version of Beanie Babies
