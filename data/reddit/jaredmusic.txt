Bitcoin will now crash down due to high transactionfees and long transactionstimes. This will increase now because of the crash right now.

I think it will go up at least one more year like this. Then Bitcoin will be so popular that the goverments will shut it down or an altcoin that is more effective will rise and suck all that money out of the bitcoin. 
But idk. I just pretended

No one can say what will happen. You can look at the chart of bitcoin and try to learn a bit. Drops normally ocur when Bitcoin is getting bad news.
