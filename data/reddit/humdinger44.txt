I thought this story was poorly done. Makes me wonder, if I know very little about a topic and can spot the omissions and mistakes, what facts am I missing or getting wrong from stories I know nothing about?

As I understand it, this will bring the word "Bitcoin" into more homes. It may have a secondary effect of encouraging people to grab some coins for themselves. The ETF itself is based on futures contracts, so the whole thing is a charade where no actual BTC changes hands.

In my experience, most people don't store wealth, they spend money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:02
why? The ETFs are just playing with futures contracts. No BTC changes hands.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:34
that would be great because it would make it a lot easier for traditional investors to get in bitcoin. Unfortunately I don't think thats how these ETFs are designed.

aside from some articles that say 'its coming..we're working on it' there isn't a conversation about it. Sure, futures is 'now' but unless i'm mistaken, lightning is what people should be excited about

"As indicated in the filing, the ETFs would track two recently launched futures contracts, released in the past week and a half by Cboe and, later, CME Group."

All the ETF stuff I've heard before was about funds holding futures contracts, not BTC itself.. Is this the same?
edit: it is the same, an ETF for futures contracts

I thought futures contracts on BTC were settled in USD and no BTC changed hands. How could that affect the price of the coin? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:57:56
i didn't realize that was necessary. Can that be done within an existing wallet?

If you want Bitcoin to gain wider acceptance and for the value to continue to grow, you should be using it for transactions when you can. If you are worried about the future value of your spent coin, just buy new coin to replace what you spent.

My girlfriend is about to graduate college. For fun I decided to see where her first years tuition would be today if she had used it to buy Bitcoin at the time instead of wasting that money on education. She says "I swear, if youre going to give me another Fitbit stat..."

I've been curious... How do they know that YOUR payment was made? Is the payment address given unique to just you?

When the price hits a milestone (typically an All Time High or ATH and in increments of 500 or 1000) there are people waiting to sell at that point. This supplies, or oversupplies, the demand and holds or drops the price. This is the "Sell Wall." Once demand overcomes the supply the wall is broken and the price begins to rise once more, until the next milestone.

Terrible celebrity endorsement 
Edit: Given Trump’s relationship with bankruptcy court, among other things, this is akin to zzzQuil signing Bill Cosby.

India has been combating financial crimes the past few years. IIRC, they were focused on tax avoidance schemes and black market type stuff. They even went so far as to invalidate a bunch of their own legal tender. It makes sense to me that they aren't ready to get on the bitcoin boat. I hope they see the benefits of it though.

What happens when the max number of bitcoins is created and Gary, Garth, and Glen are no longer in the mining business. Does the shear user base at that point perform the same function?

Interesting. I didn't see fees mentioned in the graphic.
How does a person find out what a p2p transaction fee will be before they initiate? Is there competition to push for lower fees?
