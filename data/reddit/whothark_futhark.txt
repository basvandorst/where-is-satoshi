But low amounts of inflation is necessary to expand the economy and keep interest rates low. The unwillingness to increase the minimum wage to keep up is a political failure not a monetary one. The wars in the middle east is as well. Both of these are specific to the US and not generalizable.

Is that so important to people that they'll abandon stable currencies?

Fair. I think that big financial institution and major investor are so risk averse that they're much more likely to start integrating blockchain into their systems rather than using a new currency. [The Bank of Canada]( is already doing that.

[CPI increase has also been pretty low over the past decade]( And it's not a measure of monetary supply

How exactly is a 2% inflation rate causing rent to increase 10% a year? 
Inflation certainly has a role in the problems your talking about. But controlled inflation, which it's been, has a lot of economic benefits and there are plenty of policy solution for falling wages and raising rents.

The dollar is the most widely used reserve currency in the world. It hasn't seen harmful inflation in forty years. And nothing even resembling the spike BTC is going through right now. It's backed up by an economic and military superpower. Why would people abandon that for a highly unstable currency backed only by mathematics that most people don't understand.

Low wages is cause by much more than inflation. I have no idea what you mean by the middle east thing.

What do you mean by financial self-sovereignty? Right now bitcoin is unstable and difficult to transact. Which doesn't seem like a good way to be independent

The Dollar?
