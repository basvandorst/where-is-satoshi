Remember this tech deals with money transfers. A bug there can cost users thousands and thousands of dollars, which would probably make BTC's perceived reliability take a huge hit.

Exactly. Plus, we're not arguing the morality of BTC. If it attracts certain crowds because of its technology, so be it. Good people can use it, bad people can use it. We can't actually demonize or praise either, in the end they're all just transactions.

Of all the stupid things OP could do in the name of BTC, a simple B symbol doesn't seem too bad.

I think the issue is it that the blockchain doesn't provide info as to why that money was transferred. If you move large amounts of money for no apparent reason, it becomes suspicious; especially if, after being questioned about it, you refuse to answer.

I thought the general consensus was that cashing out is never a good idea. When the price drops just buy more, don't sell what you already have. That's what I've understood from hanging around this sub for a while.

I feel like this is a meme by now. Bankers are the last people on Earth who should call ANYONE corrupt or crooked. It's just funny at this point.
