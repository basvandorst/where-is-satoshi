Not the dip yet, probably a couple of weeks to go.

Costly endeavour when they could wait until it's up again... Or use their cell phones ?

Nice, I obviously should look into it to undersstand it better. Thanks for the reply.

Really sorry for your loss. 
Please not that this doesn't happen when you use a Swiss trusted hyper secure third party to custody your bitcoins :)

Did you tell her that she could also take a loan on those, not necessarily cash out ;)... If BTC drops, she'd get 50% of the amount, but IF it goes up, she'd be even happier =)

[ \- Probably the best place to start - They do really cool stuff in general and I am sure, more to come ;)

Yeah, that advertisement is kind of WOW super present and you can't miss it! What you guys think about it ?

Hahaha Google is evil! Well said!

I don't know how they earn their money, but  a part comes from brokerage. Furthermore, they help many Swiss companies to accept Bitcoin payments. They install the gateway for free. So, I can't agree with you as well that buying Bitcoin at train machine, which costs 4-5% without cold storage is cheaper than Bitcoin Suisse which charges standard 1.75% brokerage fee and your assets are always kept in cold storage for free... 
You obviously don't know who you are talking about, but let me explain in details why I don't agree with you. 
First, Bitcoin Suisse are pioneers, and by pioneers, I mean PIONEERS! They started their official business in 2013. Just think about when they started the unofficial business. Probably years before that.
Secondly, since their creation, they have nearly done NO MARKETING, or really little, simply because they didn't need it, because they put client service first and provided revolutionary services to their customer through dedication, intelligence, hard work and a lot of ingenuity. 
Finally, they still offer an extensive range of revolutionary services, wether you like them or not, they are always pioneers in what they do, as time goes on. Talking here more specifically about crypto certificates, crypto ETP, state of the art automatized algorithm trading on their online platform and the latest Emaar Token issuance and payment gateway which goes exactly in the direction we all want it to go, broadening adoption by merchants.
So, you might be advocating against the ones that actually fulfill your crypto dreams... 
I mean, it's fair that they advertise what they do for greater crypto adoption and not only capitalism at best... 
You might think that I am advertising for them here as well, yes I am probably, because I use their services and have never been disappointed, always well served. So yeah, I'd rather have a solid castle who keeps my crypto safe and foster Bitcoin adoption, than playing around with ledgers, paper wallets, mnemonic phrases in my room until I loose something or my computer burns or even my cat starts playing with stuff he shouldn't... 
I pay a price for it, which I consider fair, given the outstanding service I receive. 
This is just my humble opinion and not a recommendation to use their services.

Great stuff, actions like that prove once again Bitcoin Suisse’s commitment, dedication and hard work!

No one could know, as no one ever knew and no one will never know! Try to give a good guess at what happens in the next 60 minutes, try this 500 times, or 5000 times if you do this with a group of 10, you will get around 50% correct answers. 18K is not meaningful, volume, new adresses, new nodes, utility etc... Are meaningful.
