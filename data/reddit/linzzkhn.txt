I mean, they are violating their own user agreement by canceling the multisig Vault and not allowing any user to be possible to access the private key.

What you said makes sense in a way.  I am confused about one thing though. The way coinbase isn't sharing private keys with its users makes me feel my coins are in a bank. But then why this bank isn't possible to help me recover the coins lost by accidents? If Coinbase is not like a bank, I should have my private keys, right?

Yeah, sadly it has been confirmed. But thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:34:58
Thank you.

Thank you! I contacted Coinbase customer support. Stilling waiting... Last time I email them, I waited 1 month before getting a reply. Who knows this time...
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:26:23
I am trying to talk to them. :( Thx! Useful suggestions.

Hi Justin, could you plz look into my case 320317 when you have a free time? I am in great pain of losing BTC as I accidentally sent it to my BCH Coinbase wallet.
Thank you!

@_date: 2017-12-29 06:12:42
Thank you for explaining.

Someone gets back to me today and said no. It doesn’t seem acceptable AT ALL! BTW, I wonder if Coinbase will lose track of the private keys after putting them in the cold storage. Do you happen to know about that? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:55:03
Oh, you're right. I was too anxious. I'll change it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:21:57
Hi Justin, could you look into my case  I have been waiting for a long time, but no one take my case seriously. Please provide some real help for me. 
Thank you.

Now I know. There is so much to learn in this community. After this lesson, I definitely have to pay attention. BTW, have you heard about a justin  from Coinbase who's around to help? I am asking cos another guy who met the same situation was reached by Justin. He says Justin replied to him on Coinbase Support and claimed to recover his BTC. What do you think about that? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:08:11
I see. It is truly confusing.

I think so but I don't know what they will do to us. Check my updates of the post.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:14:42
I bought it at a even higher price. Really have no idea what to do...
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:34:11
Hi Justin, I met the same problem with the poster. Could you mind check into my case, too? The case ID is 3203217. 
Thank you very much!

Justin replied to another person in the same situation saying he should be able to credit it back.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:04:43
Thank you. I must be careful in the future. Contacted Coinbase Support. Hopefully they can do something. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:19:08
Happy new year! 
Cheers!

Hi I met the same problem with you... Feel stupid I did that. I reached out to Justin abd hopefully get a reply from him. Thank you for putting this up so someone can see and help!
