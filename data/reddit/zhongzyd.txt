With luck, it's possible that one could build blocks faster than the network in a short period of time.

In the "Alice and Bob" case I replied to Philip_K_Fry. Let's assume Alice's secret chain is forked from the no.998 block of the honest chain. Could you tell me which block in Alice's secret chain is not valid?

Why the oldest block in that chain won't be valid?

This is not a 51% attack.

Yes,the new block is dependent upon the previous block. But I know the previous block, and the previous block has no business with the receive's public key, isn't it?
When I say "ahead of time", I mean secretly building my own chain. I just need my own chain longer than the honest chain. My own chain isn't necessary after some specific block. It can fork from any block of the main chain.

Yes you are right. But if she wants to double spend a lot of bitcoin, and she doesn't have any mining hardware herself. She anonymously rents hashing power from others for several weeks. I think 10% hashing power of the whole bitcoin network and several weeks is fairly enough to get such a secret chain. Not only we should scare of 51% hashing power, but also whatever hashing power that is enough to do this. And we should cautious about cloud mining which rents hashing power to people.

I have watched the video. I don't think this is a good explanation.
If Alice keeps working on a chain of blocks secretly. When she is lucky enough to get a secret block chain longer than the honest chain of 3 blocks. Let's assume the length of honest chain is 1000, and hers is 1003. In her No.1003 block, Alice redeem a output of 1000BTC to herself. And then Alice makes a transaction which sends this 1000BTC to a exchange. This transaction is accepted in the No.1001 block of the honest chain . Then Alice sells the coins in the exchange, and withdraws the money. Let's assume this withdrawal is successful when the length of the honest chain increases to 1003, and the length of Alice's secret chain increases to 1004. Then Alice send her secret chain to public. Her chain is the longest chain and will be accepted by others. She will get back the 1000BTC.
In this case, I think nothing could prevent Alice from preparing her secret chain. This case is different from the video's case. In the video's case, it is assumed that Alice has to build her secret chain after the block 1. But in fact, Alice doesn't have to do this. She can keep trying until she gets a chain longer than the honest chain of enough blocks. When she get such a chain, she can surely double spend her coins.
I am not 100% sure I am right. If you find anything wrong above, please tell me.

So you agree with me that giving pubkey to the sender shortly before transaction is useless? Although it needs a lot of time and hash power, anyway, she can preparing a chain ahead of time. And when she is successful preparing such a chain, she can double spend any coins. Right?
The point is that nothing could prevent someone from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time...
