Read more. Determine the value for yourself.     
Many of us see cryptocurrency as a gamechanger, a disruptive technology, like the internet. It's either going to be worth A LOT or nothing...       
I plan to cash out 30% at 10kUSD/BTC, 30% at 100kUSD/BTC, and after that btc will just be a way of paying for shit

gambling can't be analysed. You got lucky.    
Next time you might'nt.    
If you understand bitcoin, you should buy, then hold and use to pay for shit. Otherwise you are an ignorant speculator, like the current banking douche bags

Jeffrey Tucker may have slightly annoying mannerisms, but he's spot on about the dollar, the fed, and bitcoin.

haha. First you need a guide to Getting Money out of BTC China    
edit: see if there's a chinese bank with a US (NY) branch. You should be able to buy with coinbase and ETF/ACH in to your chinese account. Maybe HSBC or something. I do this with bangkok bank
