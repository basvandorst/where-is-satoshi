That is the plan now. Except I'm letting it ride out until the end of the year. I've already lost most of the investment so no point in cutting losses now. It'd hurt more seeing it rise again (after selling) than seeing the rest of my portfolio vanish.

haha...pretty much. It explains the "lost" bitcoins.

Had to wait 2 weeks for Coinbase to give me my Bitcoin. Once received it was already a loss. SHOULD have put a stop loss at 12.5k, but it kissed the 12.5k and reached 15-16k multiple times. Figured a pullback was normal but everything changes in retrospect. The moment I jumped in, it was negative press after negative press. Coinbase adding BCH really throttled things. Like you said, you live and you learn. I had a profit during mid-Jan due to some trading I did, should have seen that as my get out of jail free card.

You're right about the euphoria. Felt stuck once I actually received my BTC from Coinbase.
My market timing is simply sensational. I jumped into stocks/options in January and let me tell you, even though I have made some money to cover the BTC loss, February-March has been a ride...
I've witnessed (right at the exact moment- staring at the monitor:
* The Coinbase flash-crash (introduction of BCH).
* The stock market flash-crash in early Feb (liquidated everything in time and bought at a lower price)
* Nvidia's stock plummetting $30 15 mins after I bought some option calls (happened this week)
I missed when BTC broke 10k. I'm going to start 'inversing' myself like George Costanza from Seinfeld.

Haha. At this point, the bags are holding me.

Thanks. I've learned most of what I know after the 'investment' (crypto, stocks, options, etc). Weird considering I'm very cautious, analytical, and overall pretty frugal. I think other factors and FOMO on easy money contributed to me being more risk-seeking during this timeframe. 
Anyways, enjoy your weekend and thanks for the advice.

FOMO. I remember seeing it at $400-$1000 and not pulling the trigger. Then I saw the articles of the price increasing from 6k to 14k within a short period. 
I didn't want to invest in bitcoin (as you said, it went parabolic)... looked for projects I liked with potential. Found IOTA. Not only did I need bitcoin to get IOTA but I needed a binance account. 
Once the binance account was made, not only did the bitcoin price fall (due to a major management error by coinbase), but I had soured on IOTA. Their wallet and the risks that came with it was too much. 
So I became stuck with btc as it declined and other alts boomed. 
Now I hold 2 coins. Doesn't make a huge difference as the entire market is going down, but it's an easier pill to swallow when the declining number is closer to an average tech stock price than Berkshire A. So that has helped keep me sane and forget about my gamble.
New Reddit poster, but wanted to contribute since I saw a lot of negativity and frustration around here. Just do what is best for you and your situation.

Okay now. As someone else put it, "out of sight, out of mind."
Once you suffer such losses, it becomes easier to digest over time. I used to look at prices every hour. Read posts on Reddit, YouTube vids, etc. Now, I understand how people forgot about Bitcoins they had...
Too late to exit the crypto game. Want to stay at least a year. Always wanted to get Bitcoin but thought it was too expensive ($400-1k). Saw it go from 8k to 14k in like a week. FOMO hit.

If that money came from an IRA or 401k, it's already getting taxed. Sometimes you need to pull out to realize losses. Doesn't mean you leave, but you save yourself from some trouble. A simple sell and repurchase helps everyone. 
At this point, holding seems to help the whales more than anything. They had the power and responsibility to keep bitcoin afloat. Instead, they chose to pump and dump it between 16k-12k. It was the same cycle for a good month. Ruined sentiment and any possible chance for a rebound. Who hurts more? a guy who invested 5k, or a person who had millions but ruined it due to greed? Even if I got in at $20, I wouldn't want to see it drop 99%. Sounds corny but with power comes responsibility...the reason banks have remained in charge of things is because they know how to apply that power. Give gamers some millions and this is the result.

Glad others are posting about this. Better than the frustration I woke up to. Remain positive. If you don't believe, nobody else will.

Some of us have great timing.  
My personal strategy: 
find a coin(s) you like and aren't ICOs.  stick around for a year.  if things don't improve by years end,  cash out to realize losses (taxes).  buy back in to keep playing.

I don't use bitcoin. I always wanted to buy some but it seemed expensive as heck at $400 (If I remember correctly, I was in high school). I didn't know anything about satoshis and being able to buy a fraction of bitcoin. 
Anyways, at $17,460 I wasn't trying to ride the bitcoin wave, but was hoping and expecting other coins to pop. I was interested in IOTA as I liked their concept (Tangle/DAG) and future possible uses. I still do... I was supposed to transfer the bitcoin to binance (i made an account) and purchase IOTA. During my waiting period, Bitcoin's value fell and I was not able to purchase as much IOTA as I wanted. I held hoping it would climb back up to initiate the transfer. In the meantime, I read more about IOTA and the issues or risks associated with their wallets. Add on Binance being a Chinese exchange and I somewhat soured on that idea. 
Basically, I became stuck with bitcoin and holding was nothing more than a manifestation of pride/ego. I became obsessed with price checking and reading reddit posts. Eventually, I went to Poloniex and started lending BTC. Started to do a bit more research and found two coins I enjoy and feel they'll be here for the next pop. Currently, I'm "all-in" with LTC and BURST but I tend to keep up with BTC as it's the gauge for the health of the market.
Hadn't visited r/Bitcoin in a bit (pun intended), somewhat saddening that the excitement has completely subsided. That's the reason I decided to post.. to some, 1k @ 19k is a lot. To me, 5k @ $17.5k is a lot, while others may think it is just 1 paycheck. In the end, it is subjective and there are others out there (loans, mortgage, withdrew their 401k). Bagholder or not, it has only been 3 months. I'm not going to quit. Too late for that. I'll just make money elsewhere *shrugs*

I've made trades to realize losses. I lend out coins at a crap rate but I at least I gain something (brings my cost avg down). Lately, I've been thinking about buying a bit more but I will wait until i see the tide start turning. 
I would really like direct currency trades without having to use btc... however, that would have negative effects on btc. 
I don't see btc as functional currency, but rather digital gold (i know many hate this). This would cement its place in the market. Everything would be backed by bitcoin. The monetary value of bitcoin would remain high. In my eyes, it is a trailblazer that will continue to be the backbone of crypto. As bitcoin goes, crypto goes (like our current state).
Because of that ^ reasoning. I went all in on 2 coins that I believe in and allow me to breathe easily. I noticed that staring at declining values gives a completely different feeling if the amount is not $x,xxx. I have a similar feeling when trading options on stocks. So I need to stick with what I'm comfortable. One gives me the feeling that I can't afford to lose this while the other allows me to think long term.  Just me though, everyone is different.

LOL. I'm done buying calls. I have more success with puts $LFIN

It is unbelievable today. If it reaches Berkshire A status...then what?
