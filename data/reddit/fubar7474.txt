The fact that his plate says hodl and it's on a shitty Chevy makes more sense. If it was on a Lambo I would expect it to say sodl. Also, don't expect an Albertan to lavish in high end exotics. I'd expect to see the gains put towards some jacked up Dodge diesel.

Nicehash is easy. However, I don't think they do a payout under 0.01 btc. Your gtx 1070 should make roughly 0.0004 btc per day on average. After nicehack I switched to using miningpoolhub with awesomeminer and was making much better profit than before the nicehack. Can't speak to what is more profitable today but I can tell you miningpoolhub gives you options because you can be paid out in many different coins. I switched back to nicehash because I have faith in bitcoin and don't want to keep watching the alts trying to figure out which one I think will strike big next and switch my payout to it. Also, there's a sweet widget for nicehash that tells you your current profit and you can update the shit out of that all day long. Miningpoolhub doesn't update as frequently. Today is no question a good day to mine your 1070. Especially if you have warranty for a couple years. A month ago you wouldn't have made much but it's all how you look at it. With my setup I was making 0.003 a day back in the summer, then it dropped to 0.002 very quickly and I was pissed. I was only making 10 usd a day or so. What's 0.002 worth today? 25 usd or something?

What's happening kind of brings to light the real reason for hodling. Imagine you're just some scum bag middle class like we all are, with more money into this whole thing than you should have. You still run around preaching to your friends not to put more into it than you're willing to lose. Meanwhile, you have your fingers crossed that your last investment taken from your line of credit will double so that you can take out the profit and no longer have any borrowed money into the game. You get home from work after watching a stale market all day, not knowing what will happen, but hoping for the best. WHY THE HELL ISN'T THE MARKET SKY ROCKETING?!?!?! It already did, dumbass... You don't check your phone around your wife because she's been nagging at your for being addicted... Even though your initial investment into Bitcoin quadrupled. You get the kids to bed while sneaking a peak before you throw them into the bath. Bitcoin went from 20500 CND to 19000 since the last time you checked. The little one has his eyes closed and you pull your phone out... It's 18000. You fumble around trying to sell at the lowest sell, but not the highest buy -just trying to recover as much as possible. It doesn't happen. 17000. 16500. This happens in minutes. You missed your sell, it's going to 16... No. Wait. It's back to 17. Now it's at 18500. Luckily your slow, dumb ass missed what you thought was a good time to sell, because you would have lost.

I pay .04 a kw/h here. The cards were an early move before I did much research. I just knew my friend was making half decent profit. After a bit I stopped paying attention to usd and watched mbtc. I consider the cards a bit of security. And like I said, I bought a bunch with my play money when it was at 3600.

Even if they have heard of it, they're too scared to run their hardware over a couple bucks a day. Not many people realize how easy it is and that you likely aren't going to kill your card in 6 months. Evga all the way, 3 year awesome warranty. And it's not really a couple bucks a day if it goes to the moon. Like the other guy said, it sucked when he was only making . 04 a day. I'd poop my pants if I was making that much now.

How is Eth cheaper?

All these big investments coming to the crypto world... They must not be paying attention to the price. Bitcoin is done for good. Listen to the guys telling you to pack it in.

I have 4 1070s and a 1080... I bought them when I first got into it looking at it as an asset that can be sold if the worst was to happen. As I got more confident with bitcoin I started buying it.  I've been thinking about selling cards and just buying because mbtc a day is down a fair amount from when I started. I make about 1.5 mbtc a day right now and power is cheap but what I like to look at is if btc reaches 50k then my 1.5 mbtc I'm making is actually worth 75 a day.
