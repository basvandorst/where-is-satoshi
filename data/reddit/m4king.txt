Your transaction contained 64 inputs and was 18,959 bytes.
Even at low priority the fee for a transaction this large would likely be minimum 0.0018959 BTC.
Fees are calculated satoshis/byte and you had a lot of bytes due to a lot of micro inputs.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:05:43
It's the fees you owe them from your last withdrawal.

I sold &gt;50% of my Bitcoins at various intervals between $5k and $10k. All within the last few months. I couldn't believe the price had gone up that high!
Had I not sold any, the Bitcoins I sold would be worth a hell of a lot more now than what I sold them for.

Full quote:
"And if you have an opinion like I do on this as to which version of Bitcoin is the better one, lets say it does wind up that there are two chains - I'll tell you I will sell my coins on the slow expensive core chain and use the proceeds from that, if I'm even able to get my coins in a confirmation in a block to get it to an exchange - but that'll probably be really really difficult because the network fees will be so high and there will be so little hash rate on that chain - but if that were even possible to do, I would sell those coins and use the proceeds to buy more of the useful bitcoins because BU coin is going to be so much more useful because you'll actually be able to send and receive them with people, unlike the Bitcoin core coins on this congested network that will cost a fortune and take forever to move the bitcoins"

The 'Bitcoin Cash drama' is not an accurate tag. It should be 'BIP148/BIP91 Drama'
That drop was the uncertainty around BIP148 before miners started signalling BIP91. Once miners started signalling BIP91 the price recovered.
Bitcoin Cash had little to no noticable effect on the price, if anything I would attribute it to the recent Bitcoin pump - everyone with any sense is dumping their BCH for Bitcoin.

Public Service Announcement
I am of the opinion that the current “Bitcoin Unlimited" Bitcoin development team and Bitcoin.com are not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with common sense and peer reviewed code, and are in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin’s most pressing problems.
Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to block Bitcoin scaling and progress once and for all by forcing high fees and unreliable transactions in order to benefit from the booming altcoin market.
This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss scaling by opperating under the pretense of "wanting the best for bitcoin" and keeping ulterior motives hidden. After years of blocking, stalling and crashing nodes, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Unlimited or Roger Ver, but rather from the diverse group developers known as Bitcoin Core.
The following article, written by an unknown troll, is a key example of the propaganda machine employed by the altcoin pumpers at BU/Bitcoin.com:
A (Brief and Incomplete) History of Censorship in r/bitcoin, by John Blocke
As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
By ignoring to and subscribing to sub-reddit you take a stand against fake news, conspiracy and specifically the con man Roger Ver.
By running a Bitcoin Core node signalling BIP 148 (UASF) you are casting a vote against the scaling filibuster.
There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin. The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. Roger will stop at nothing to make sure these qualities are not preserved, as Bitcoin continuing to lose market share is beneficial for his altcoin portfolio.
Roger Ver and the current Bitcoin Unlimited developers are rapidly eroding thier last shred of respect with poor design choices, a failure to understand basic economic principles, ulterior motives and their vilification of Bitcoin Core developer.
I encourage all members of the Bitcoin community to make their voices heard, and to stand up for what is right.

It'll confirm, your fees are reasonable just a little below what you needed for high priority. Wait it out and you'll get confirmed.
You're actually waiting for 2 transactions to confirm because the parent tx is also unconfirmed but paying a similar fee which is also reasonable 235 sat/byte. So should be no problem if you don't mind waiting.

What wallet are you using? Because your fees (60 sat/byte) are way below the going rate (250 sat/byte) so they're pretty unlikely to confirm.
Try switching to Electrum wallet.
Anyway, the good news is I was able to accelerate your first transaction. Just waiting for a confirmation which wont be immediate but will be in the next 6 hours, then I will accelerate your second transaction also.

blockchain.info is not the best wallet as it has poor fee calculation. It seems to just send transfers with 120sat/byte fee regardless of demand. Lots of people having this problem.
Personally I use Electrum but there are lots of wallets with a better dynamic fee calculation than blockchain.info.
In the mean time just hang tight and I'll see if I can get this accelerated for you.

It's not dangerous no, the only issue is it links your reddit account to a specific transaction so if you're worried about privacy don't share it.

You're welcome, I've accelerated it and ViaBTC are going to include it in their next block.
I highly recommend using a different wallet with better fee estimation as your tx only had a 26 sat/byte fee which with the current backlog would never get confirmed normally.

Supply and demand.
Limited supply, high demand = higher prices.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:11:19
Your transaction is fine, it just has a low fee (150sat/byte) relative to the current market rate (250sat/byte).
Your transaction will confirm because the fee isn't extremely low, you just might be waiting a few days, perhaps until the weekend when there is often a lull in transactions and some of the backlog is cleared.
But I'll try to accelerate it for you and you might get lucky.
I'd also recommend switching wallets from MultiBit to Electrum.

OK I can see the transaction now and your fee is too low (60 sat/byte) which is a long way below the going rate of roughly 250 sat/byte.
Because you had a number of inputs your transaction was larger than a simple transaction and required a higher fee.
fees are measured in satoshis per byte, rather than dollars, so for some transactions $1 may be fine and others it wont be enough. See  for current fee rates.
I'll see if I can help get your transaction accelerated but because one of your outputs is only $0.06 it might not be possible (it may get ignored as 'dust'), I'll let you know

You have a chain of unconfirmed transactions. They are all paying quite a high fee of 200 sat/byte which is good. Just wait and they'll confirm.
There is just high demand today, so currently at 200sat/bytes there is a backlog.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:07:45

@_date: 2017-05-20 19:11:41
Your fee is 120sat/byte which I think is the default fee from blockchain.info
Unfortunately there is a backlog of transactions at that fee level, you might have to wait a while for a confirmation.
I will try and accelerate it for you, however, because one of your outputs is very small (0.00035125 BTC) it may not be possible due to the accelerator rejecting dust outputs. So you may just have to wait it out.

I will solve it for you and you can keep the $15.
You're right, the problem is you sent your transaction with a tiny fee relative to the market rate. As a result your transaction may never confirm. However, I will run it through an accelerator for you and, all going well, it should get confirmed. Will keep you updated.

Oh wow, you also have an Unconfirmed Parent (you're spending unconfirmed coins) which has an even lower fee. You're going to need both accelerated.
I'll see what I can do.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:41:36
Not always. Try using it at 1 second past the hour.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:59:28
You're welcome, I see ViaBTC included your transaction in block 467030. Very kind of you to offer the donation but no thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:55:12
Yes it will confirm. I'm going to push it through. Hold on.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:38:47
Looks like an exit scam

This is what went wrong at Blockchain.info
Original reward = 50/1 = 50 BTC
1st halving = 50/2 = 25 BTC
2nd halving = 50/3 = 16.6666666 BTC

Post the transaction ID please, if you don't mind.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:02:13
I have accelerated your tx, it'll be mined soon by ViaBTC on their next block.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:23:07
Hahaha, Blockchain.info calculated the block reward as 50/3!
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:52:19
Post your transaction ID if you don't mind and I might be able to help.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:39:37
It's going to work, the reason it hasn't been confirmed yet is because ViaBTC (a mining pool) have not found a block since I accelerated it.
Just be patient, it'll be in their next block I promise ;)
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:39:55
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:54:40
now confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:55:19
I use LocalBitcoins.com
I have not used coinfloor.co.uk but they have GBP denominated accounts which would save on exchange rates.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:54:20
Post the transaction ID if you don't mind and I'll try to help you get it confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:49:28
I'll help you. Your fee is too low but I'll try and get it accelerated for you.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:53:46
Post the transaction ID if you don't mind and I might be able to help you get it confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:47:46
Always UK bank transfer when buying, never had a problem as the sellers must have the correct amount of Bitcoin in their accounts and LocalBitcoins holds it in escrow.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:19:30
You're right, the fee is way to low to get confirmed in current conditions.
I'll see if I can accelerate it for you, hold on.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:32:24
OK, it's confirmed now. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:51:12
Haha, not the first time I've seen someone mistakenly call BIP91 'BIP191'.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:21:19
Remember the when Coinbase lost their customers' ETC to replay attacks after the DAO HF.
Are they at risk of being replay attacked again here with BCC? Will people be able to deposit BTC and then withdraw BTC+BCC from Coinbase, stealing the BCC they refuse to support?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:07:57
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:01:04
Acceleration succeeded, you just need to wait for the next block from ViaBTC and it will be included in that block.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:00:51
OK acceleration succeeded, it'll get mined just wait it out now.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:49:57
looks like you got confirmed with ViaBTC accelerator.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:54:51
use viabtc at 1 second past the hour. will work.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:50:08
Some mining pools have acceleration services, some free some paid.
All you have to do is paste in the transaction ID. The free service is often full though.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:51:50
It didn't get rejected, it's just not confirmed. I'll try and get it confirmed for you.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:31:53
It's confirmed. Mined by ViaBTC.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:49:40
I buy from LocalBitcoins.com
I have used Coinbase back when they had a GBP account, these days I think you'll have to convert to USD or EUR, which will cost you on the exchange rate.
Never used Kraken.
