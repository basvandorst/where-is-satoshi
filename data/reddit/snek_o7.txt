because 2k tps per **channel** sounds exciting considering we are currently limited to 3tps globally? 
I run a full node I am excited to monitor my LN channels. Users the rely solely on SPV are not Bitcoin users. They are leeches that are dependent on people like me upholding the integrity and functionality of the Bitcoin network as a decentralized, sound, uncensorable and immutable means to communicate value.
LN isn't some crazy super medicine against everything. It's the next layer of the Bitcoin protocol stack. It only offers more functionality and if there were any draw-backs I'd just not use it, end of story.

I'm sorry you wasted your time replying because what I wrote isn't up for interpretation, it's CS 101. Any specifications not written in code are abstractions and when implemented in different programming languages/ utilizing different systems are not guaranteed to behave in a similar way. In a complex and decentralized network such as Bitcoin small inconsistencies will cause large problems. [This problem already exists when upgrading the reference client.]( If you go ahead with a myriad of random implementations you are guaranteed to have a bad time. 
Also note that the complexity of distributed consensus algorithms is not comparable to TCP...

There is only one chain and simply having 51% of the hashpower in and of itself is not an "attack".
If someone with &gt;50% hashrate executed an attack as desribed above nodes wouldn't notice because they don't care. The rules of the game have not changed. They have been gamed. And the fact that they have been gamed would be noticed by the people observing the network.

Whether or not indiscriminate block size increases are a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion. And personally I'd toss a coin and go with whatever comes up rather than spend years debating the topic.
A clear majority however decided to reject the gunslinger approach and the attempt at a coup died with the only legitimate effort which was spearheaded by XT (G.A. and M.H.). Yes, their changes to the protocol were on the other side of the "political spectrum" but at least they were somewhat sound and acceptable from a development perspective. 
On the other hand, the current situation we are faced with is Ronald McDonald funding a crew of clowns, who evidently have no clue what they are doing, implementing the most hair-raising changes while disregarding all the **experience** gained from the failures devs made with core (failures which made them cautious in the first place).

A prerequisite for this is that there's a healthy measure of dezentralization amongst nodes on the network. **Only then** do incentives align for the assumption to be plausible. Bitcoin/bitcoin derives it's value from the fact that it facilitates sound money and a trustless, uncensorable, peer to peer protocol for communicating value. 
From the perspective of a single user: As long as I am able to run a full node I can personally tell that the consensus rules are being enforced. The second my client detects any malfeasance, bitcoin instantaneously loses its entire value to me. Extend this concept to all participants of the network and you can see that an attacker would have to invest millions to gain absolutely nothing. For he can, at most, double spend some coins, censor some transactions on a network that has no value to anybody anymore because it has been corrupted. The remaining "honest nodes" would therefore be fully incentivised to fork the consensus rules to circumvent the attacker.

Have you been on rbtc lately? The fork that occurred was blockstram core and thermos's fault. Clearly without the fascistoid 1MB limit there wouldn't have been a problem. And while an invalid block cost some miners 12K USD, blockstram core and thermos have cost the entire community 100,000,000,000s of USD because we are forced to pay fees to have our tx included in the blockchain! Plus without 1MB limit 1btc would be worth 10 million USD by now!

I trust the software I run. You can shove the chain with most POW right up your bottom if it doesn't produce blocks considered valid by my client. I'm pretty sure that is how the system was intended to work. I'm also pretty sure there are many others out there that share the same perspective. Which means, if anyone wants to change anything we have to agree with them or we split the network.
It's "the longest **valid** chain." POW facilitates convergence of consensus it doesn't define it.

Everyone wants BU! BU is getting a hardcore upgrade to super block efficiency in JAN and will reach 95% network in FEB 2017! SegTwit is to complex and designed to give control of BITCOIN to BLOCKSTRAM we need to increase MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to 20MB and remove BLOCKSTRAM_CORE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE. If we do this one bitcoin will be worth 100k USD by 2018!

You're over-estimating the average Joe. Never the less, I haven't seen a better video explaining Bitcoin so far. It really manages to distill the essence of what Bitcoin is and how it works.

It doesn't matter what the miners said. Miners, just like the rest of the network always have three options:
1. accept the code written to improve the protocol
2. opt for no change at all
3. split the network
So far developers of the reference client have decided that SW as SF is the best way forward. So much of the development resources available to the Bitcoin community have been dedicated to this update that you can easily say that all development resources available to the Bitcoin community have been dedicated to SW as SF.
A barrage of dissidents has decended upon the debate injecting nothing but FUD and vitriol. Convincing a few fools of some grand conspiracy theories. The **only** outcome is gridlock. There is no technical reason for blocking SW. People that oppose it will cripple any long term development of Bitcoin and we can all get used to the way things are right now, because since these fools are not willing to choose option 3., nothing will be changing anytime soon.

Who knows, I have no idea who Lombrozo is. I don't really care much either. It's the content of what is being said that matters, not who said it. And with that regard u/seeingeyepyramid pulled a classic D-K. Anyone with even hobbyist knowledge in distributed systems can tell from his response that he has no clue what he is talking about. Yet here he is lecturing the world about it. 
Now, this says nothing about Lombrozo's statements... Just that u/seeingeyepyramid is doing a banging rbtc job at refuting them.

What is high-value tx only?
Savings -&gt; On Chain
Checking -&gt; Layer 2 (eg. LN)
For example I could move 1BTC into the LN network for 14cents and then make as many micro transactions over the next  few months as I would like. 20 coffee purchases, gas up the car 4 times, pay for 20h of streaming in real time &gt;100,000 tx? etc. all those payments would actually have near 0 fees.

Well core has technical understanding and principles. At the end of the day consensus is consensus. &gt;95% amongst miners is a decent number for consensus. If the community can't get its shit together core isn't at fault. 
All the developers can do is suggest code changes and we decide whether we run them or not. I am violently opposed to the BU nut-jobs but I would love to see them get their 51%. I want to see the balls on the miner that creates the first block that gets rejected by half the network creating a gigantic mess; replay attacks et all. 
Sure the situation would look dire in the short term but the clown devs at BU could finally do what ever the **** they wanted and we could move on without the numpties. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:46:40
Because "yes" is the **very** pedantic answer. In reality the magnitude of all other factors possibly making it a 'poorer implementation of LN' can either be mitigated or they simply pale in comparison to txm.
Note: the question does not offer a specific alternative for txm fixing. If we fixed txm by hardforking the blockchain to implement the mimblewimble protocol for example... that would make a LN implementation impossible.
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:50:47
The plausible deniability that is being refered to here, comes from the fact that an Opendime can be passed on through several individuals. So no matter what nefarious deals the keys can be linked to on the blockchain if they are found on your opendime, you can say it has nothing to do with you.
The tweet is also refering to *introducing* this feature to the network. It's effecitveness ofc still depends on how many individuals actually use opendime. But it does throw a wrench into the surveilance of tx when tx start happening off chain.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:07:54
I know Bitcoin is hard to understand. But what I wrote has nothing to do with idealism. It's literally how consensus in the Bitcoin network works. 
First step to changing Bitcoin is understanding this principle.
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:03:25
fees are the price people are willing to pay in order for their tx to be confirmed. What people are willing to pay does not **directly** change with the valuation of bitcoin. If tomorrow 1 BTC were to suddenly be worth 10x as much as today why would I be inclined to pay 10x the fee?

It also fixes a miriad of other issues. LN without 70% increased tx capacity is poorer in my book. LN without linear scaling of sighash operations is poorer in my book. etc. etc.

@_date: 2016-12-20 16:37:27
I am not particularly interested in getting knowledgable about the low level implementation. So what I gave you was a high level assessment. 
An alternative fix to tx malleability will undoubtedly require adaptation for anything built on top. Granted those changes are not on the same scale and impact as a 'LN without txm fix' and even though I do not care about such implementation details omitting their existance just seemed wrong.
If you are so incredibly interested in minute technical details I'd suggest you download, compile, run, deconstruct the protocols and learn about them yourself. Otherwise what is it to you?
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:00:33
Technically yes. Practically what we are all refering to as "SegWit" is a larger package of changes of which I do not have a low level understandig. There might be other features contained within that package that currrent LN implementations require.
Programming LN on top of the SW soft fork is like creating a golden filling for a tooth. It has to be molded to fit the cavity. So while the essence remains, that tx malleability is a great pain in the butt for LN, since devs were aware of LN, SW might contain further optimizations to facilitate an optimal LN implementation. If this is the case an alternative tx malleability fix could indeed still make for a "poorer lightning network".
All this doesn't matter however because if I were a developer that spent the last 12 months coding, reviewing and testing software to fix an issue of the Bitcoin protocol I sure as hell wouldn't care to do the same 12 months of work over... in a slightly different manner, just to have it rejected again.
If we want an upgrade to the reference client, SW is the only viable peer reviewed option and it will remain the only option that was created by academics in the field who know their shit. Many will not put their trust in untested software written by second grade code monkeys. In that case we would have to wait for the network to split into two chains before we could proceed again.
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:17:54
So xt, classic etc. nutjobs noticed it's better to bribe/convince a miner to support them instead of running 500 client nodes on AWS.
BU will never reach consensus on the network. That is an inescapable fact. Best case for BU is if it actually manages to split the blockchain. I'd like to see the balls on the miner that produced the first block that gets rejected by a significant part of the network and causes a shitstorm of compatibility issues due to sloppy forking. Good riddance and good luck.

Well it doesn't seem to be working here in the long run because the community is reconciling around technical merit and code instead of political agendas.
The contrarians who were enticed by foreign parties to sow vitriol simply lack the motivation/endurance to keep going. With Ver abandoning his "My way or the highway" position, the Bitcoin community is showing that at it's core it is resilient to such attacks.

Well, the rbtc crowd was attracted by Ver standing in front of a Lambo in 2013, telling everyone they could be millionaires if they bought bitcoin. Now 3 years later Ver is telling the same people they can't be millionaires if they don't hard-fork right now! 
The people on rbtc are the ones also falling for the usual prince of Nigeria spam mails because their intellect is nonexistent and greed is their primary motivation. They don't care about what sets Bitcoin apart from Paypal or Visa. They care about exchanging bitcoin for USD when it's time to buy the yacht.

From a technical perpective SegWit is not controversial. However, the entire network has to move to activate it. Some things just take time and that's why we have a year to come to a consensus.
@_date: 2016-12-09 11:19:03


It *can* be monitored SPV style if it has a healthy distributed full node count to facilitate those SPV requests. Ideally you would run your own full node at home and connect devices reliant on SPV (such as your phone) to your own node.
If you are entirely trusting other people to verify your payments, as well as the integrity of the blockchain and the network, you have missed the point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:56:48
It's not a democracy. Right now there exists consensus. 100% of the people are running software enforcing the same rules. In order to change the rules 100% of the people have to agree to change them. So voting on something doesn't mean much if parties are not willing to split the network into more than one chain. 
Either we all move together in lockstep in the same direction, or we aren't going anywhere.
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:17:52
Don't do it. It's laughably pointless. Neither you nor the network profits from another instance of bitcoind running on AWS. Run a pruned full node at home or just resign to SPV.
You want to use the trust-less Bitcoin that was advertised? You won't get around running your own full node. 
You want to support the network? You won't get around running a full node that validates and propagates blocks/transactions (and isn't one of 400 nodes on AWS like Bitcoin Unlimited)
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:46:49
No, you are the joke. Now take your sorry ass out of here if bitching is going to be your only contribution.
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:21:28
No. You are, because you have to monitor the settlement of your payment channels on the blockchain. If you can't run a full node you can't be sure your onchain tx are legitimate which makes it even worse for time critical settlements of offchain payments. Meaning opening a payment channel is a gigantic incentive to monitor the network through your own full node. If you don't care and want to trust someone else to do all the verifying for you should just use a traditional bank.
The amount of people unwilling to educate themselves but adamant about contributing their mental diarrhea on reddit is staggering.

The contribution of bandwidth to bootstrapping new nodes pales in comparison to legitimately running a full node which contributes to the security and validity of the entire network. (understatement!)
I don't see new nodes popping up everywhere and that's not due to a lack of bandwidth. I can download 100gb within a day. But my CPU will take a week validating the chain. If you want to contribute bandwidth you can join the torrent swarm  . Or by all means go ahead and run a full node on aws if it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I'd buy bitcoin with the money I save on AWS instead :P
