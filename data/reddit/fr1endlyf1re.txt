Uhhh, no.  His teacher/mentor, Ben Graham, talked about finding companies that have more in assets than their market cap.    It used to be difficult to get all this information and there were a lot of opportunities, but this has not been a realistic investment strategy for decades.
He is a value investor and finds companies that he believes the market undervalues.  To value a company you need to understand the fundamental business.  He has significant interests in banks and credit card companies [as well as dozens of other industries] and should be considered a leading expert in any of those businesses.  You can say that he is biased because of those holdings, but to pretend that he has no idea what he is talking about is one of the most laughable things you could say.

Why is there such a long lead time for getting more servers?  Why not use AWS to explicitly avoid these issues?

My point is that the Amazon is not like the titanic, they are constantly testing 100s if not 1000s of changes so the reasoning in your original post is a little misleading.

How so?  Amazon is one of the most innovative retailers there is, if not *the* most innovative.  You seriously think that Staples is more innovative and faster moving than Amazon?

Again, I am not defending the banks or telling you to switch; however, saying that only works in Europe is wrong.

No.  Most major banks allow you to instantly transfer between accounts held at the same bank.  If you and your landlord dont have accounts at the same bank, you could send a wire for ~$25 that will be in their account within hours.  Definitely not as simple as BTC, but this case is more the fault of a shitty bank and not a shitty system

Just because they do not have a presence in the US does not mean they are outside the reach of US regulators.  Look at Pokerstars and FullTilt for similar examples.
