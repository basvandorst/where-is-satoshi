" As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."
The creator of bitcoin, whoever it may be, saw this coming from the start.  You should expect that (s)he will hold supply low for as long as possible.
Furthermore, as we saw today with Satoshi's posting, you can expect intervention to "defend" the credibility of the scheme until the big payoff can be had.  The liquidity of the market will have to increase enormously even from where it is now for that to happen, so this is a long job.
It's a classic ponzi scheme.
Does that mean it isn't a better alternative to the dollar?  Not necessarily.  The US operates a ponzi scheme too.  But anyone who invests in bitcoin should be aware of these dynamics so that you can exploit them to your own personal best interests.

Ahh, lovely Rome, where the slaves boast of their freedom while watching the circus.

There are a few reasons this seems strange but really isn't.
Large scale adoption of an idea you can model because humans are social creatures and tend to go along to get along.
The early adaptation is driven by more nuanced dynamics including the intelligence and charisma of the initiator of the idea, early adaptors, stresses on the population, and so on.
So it's hard to predict leaders but easy to predict followers.
