I haven't ignored anything from your comment.
And you haven't answered my question. What do u think about that solution? Do u think it would be possible to make eveybody (or at least the majority) agrees?

Hi nanoakron,
Then almost everybody thinks the size should be increased. Ones believe blocks must be bigger than now and others believe they should be slightly larger, because 1MB is going to be very small in the short term due to the increasing adoption and number of transactions (maybe even the ones who think of other engineering solutions know this). So my proposal consists on increasing them in an amount according to the market needs.

Hi. What if the paper wallet was in pdf? could there be any issues?
thx for answering!
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:38:22
hi. the pdf wasnt in the pc. Just a direct access in recent documents that couldnt be opened cause the file wasnt there. Just wanted to know if the os could read the file anyway while has been connected.
thank u!

Hi. I have a question about paper wallets.
If u create a paper wallet offline with an OS like win xp and much later u connect the comp again, are there any risks for that paper wallet that was created time ago?

And do u know a good multi currency wallet for android (fully open source and decentralized)?

thx! :)

Hi all. I'd like to know if there is a good multi currency wallet for android (fully open source and decentralized) since a famous one seems to have been recently compromised, and also it wasnt open source any more.
Also I've recently seen some good comments about the OS Tails (desktop), is it better than Ubuntu? Can it be run separately from the OS u already have installed?
Thx all!

I know it has segwit from 0.13.1. Just wanted to know if I had to update to another client or wait, as I've seen some options with patch, etc.
thx :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:03:14
Yes. I don't know which client has that patch and which one will be mainly chosen. So I suppose it's better to wait with the current version and see what happens, right?
And what is the OP? :)

Hi. I have a node running Bitcoin Core 0.14.0. Should I update to 0.14.2?
Is it better to do nothing for now and wait until the fork happens?
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:30:27
Hi. Do you mean 0.14.2 BIP 148 UASF? Is it the same that 0.14.2 from bitcoin.org?
Wouldn't it better to wait or could there be any issue if I keep the current version 0.14.0?

I don't think he's a pumper. But the fact that he appears on tv and mentions some coins might make them fluctuate a bit, but in the end that doesn't depend on him, it depends on the public who finally buy and/or sell.

Well, if we had said some time ago BTC was going to reach $1000, $1500, $2000 or $2569 we would have been right in all cases. $5000 is only a figure. Let's just say it will go up :)
