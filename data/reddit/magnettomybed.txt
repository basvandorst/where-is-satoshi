I wonder. Good question. In my opinion it just seems a little... off. I would rather wait until it's a little more stable for a while (+-$5 within a week)

So what does this mean to the future of bitcoin? To me it doesn't seem like the exchange rate isn't going to go back down to $40. Excuse my lack of knowledge here but, what are miners?

You've had two posts asking for bitcoin loans. Hypocrite 
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:02:33
Yes, it can be frustrating. Let me know if it gets resolved-I was thinking about buying more bitcoins after it worked so well last week. In the meantime, bitinstant works very well.
As for coinbase--I would give it a day to let the exchange rate become a bit more steady before sending incredibly angry emails. Gotta give them a break sometimes.

It also tells you when you google "Mt. Gox"

I meant that's not how coinbase works

So the price went up $20 in a day? Does anyone know WHY????
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:30:26
Yes, it works. I got the money in two days.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:38:56
This is not true
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:37:47
aye aye

Thank you. I got my bitcoins so fast with bitinstant and then fell into this trouble. The synching I could google and figure out but the reindexing scared me. Over 24 hours later- I can finally see my coins
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:04:28
It doesn't say that it is synchronizing. It says that it is reindexing blocks on disk.
 Is it going to finish synchronizing after the reindexing or did it just finish synchronizing ~3% that quickly without me noticing?

How long has this been going on? I received bitcoins from coinbase last week.

Currently it seems like bitinstant --&gt; mt. gox --&gt; btc is the best right now. 
Another option is  
It would be awesome to be able to sell products or services or BTC
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:07:51
Bitinstant is only working to Mt. Gox. So you would have to do bitinstant --&gt; Mt. Gox (USD) --&gt; trade to BTC --&gt; wallet 
Hm... coinlab. Never heard of that one. Good luck with coinbase!!!!
