You can't use a PO box as a registered office address in the UK. There are services which offer registered addresses for businesses, but they are more expensive.

So what do you think of bitcoin's currently disinflationary and ultimately deflationary nature? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:03:55
I think they're just looking at the total number of transactions, not UTXO.
UTXO creation still wouldn't give an accurate account though, because most transactions contain at least two outputs even if there is only a single destination.

I think the constitution prevents you running for more than two consecutive terms as president, but he had a break when he was prime minister, which meant that he could run again as president in 2012. He will have to have a break again after this coming term, after which he will probably be too old to run again.

If you knew anything about it, you would know that Ethereum nodes do not need to store all that data. You could delete literally every archival node on the network and it wouldn't matter. 
The reason for that is an archival node stores the full state at every block height, which is obviously redundant. You only need current state, block headers and transaction receipts, and you can calculate the full blockchain from that.
Comparing an archival node on Ethereum to a full node on Bitcoin is a false equivalency. The latter is necessary whereas the former is not.

55 minutes is the minimum. The maximum it gives is infinity (i.e. never getting confirmed). 
The estimated in blocks part is how many blocks are likely to be mined before your transaction is included in one of them. As each block is on average 10 minutes long, you can expect the minimum to be around 5 blocks (i.e. 55 minutes).

Hey man. This is remarkably generous. 
I'd like to propose the [Open Medicine Foundation]( (OMF). The OMF is an organisation that funds research into chronic complex diseases. The diseases it targets are often drastically underserved by both public and private financing, as well as being misunderstood by the public at large. 
This is something which actually strikes very close to home for me. I unfortunately suffer from very severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Many people have heard of CFS/ME, and think it is just a case of simply being tired. This misunderstanding has caused chronic underfunding and wider social stigma, which has unnecessarily prolonged suffering of patients for many years.
This depiction of the illness, however, couldn't be further from the truth. Very few chronic condition can become as severe as CFS/ME without causing death. Around 25% of people are completely bedridden. I know people who cannot speak, cannot sit up in bed, cannot chew food. These patients are left in this state for years or sometimes decades. Hooked up to feeding tubes, they are completely aware of their situation and in excruciating pain. 
Despite the possible severity of the condition, we do not know what causes it and there is no treatment. 
I am 27 years old, but I am completely bedridden. Fortunately I am not as severe as the patients mentioned above, but I am still extremely limited. I used to run 20 miles a week. I kayaked and mountain biked. I had an active work and social life. Now my legs cant even support my own weight. The last time i left the house was 6 months ago, and that was on a stretcher so i could get to a hospital appointment. Other than that, I haven't been able to leave the house for years.
I need treatment, but we don't even know why I am sick. Research funding is desperately desperately needed. I and millions of other patients globally would be extremely grateful if you were able to donate to research via the OMF.
Please feel free to ask any questions.

If you store every event (transaction receipts and block headers) then you can calculate the state derived from those events. 
It would be like recording the movements of a robot. If you know exactly what movements it took, you can say exactly where it is at any given time without having to continually record its location. In the case of Ethereum, that results in huge storage savings because you do not need to record swathes of repetitive data (e.g. you do not need to know that account x is in state y for 1000 consecutive blocks).

Price inflation is distinct from monetary inflation. Price inflation is an increase in prices, which can be driven by expansion of the base money supply, an increase in the velocity of money, or various other things like a change in the exchange rate (see the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK inflation rate). Monetary inflation specifically refers to the base money supply only.
When most people refer to inflation in mainstream usage, they are typically referring to price inflation. When people refer to inflation on they're referring to the more narrowly defined monetary inflation. 
So yes, changes in the cost of goods/services paid for in bitcoin (measured via USD), is indeed inflation/deflation.

It wasn't run on Parity. It was a smart contract issued from the Parity wallet. It was run on the EVM like every other Ethereum smart contract. You didn't even need to use Parity to make a contract call - you could call from Mist or MEW if you wanted.

No, because a pruned BTC node is not comparable to a pruned ETH node. You cannot runt the BTC network trustlessly with only pruned BTC nodes, whereas you can run the ETH network trustlessly with only pruned ETH nodes. It is a major difference. 
Full node in Bitcoin = necessary.
Archival node in Ethereum = not necessary.

Is not equal to "it has nothing to do with Parity".
Parity is a full node implementation, like Bitcoin Core. The Parity multisig wallet was a smart contract issued from inside the Parity UI. You broadcast it to the chain like every other smart contract. The smart contract did not then rely on the Parity implementation to run. That is not how smart contracts work. They run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine like every other smart contract. They do not call libraries outside the EVM. 
I started out this conversation thinking perhaps you knew something I didn't. What I realise now is that you have a fundamental lack of understanding of what Ethereum, Parity, smart contracts and the EVM actually are.

@_date: 2017-11-22 14:32:31
How? That was an error with a smart contract. Didn't have anything to do with a node DB handling as far as I am aware. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:25:02
Yes, they can do that, because one of the things that pruned nodes stores is current state. That means they have a full image of the blockchain at the most recent block height. If a contract was created 3 years ago then not touched until now, that would still appear in the current state. 
An archival node has the full state at every block height, which means you would have millions of a copies of a three year old contract. Obviously you don't need that, hence my assertion that no one really needs an archival node. 
Some contracts change over time depending on how they are built and the functions that have been called on them. You could never call a contract older than its most recent state, because it might conflict with how the contract is now which would lead to an inconsistency. 
If a developer is making historic contract calls, it would be done locally rather than on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It's not something you would/could do to influence the actual state of the Ethereum blockchain.

If we had all been relying on Bitcoin Unlimited we would have been screwed the multiple times that their client has crashed and burned if not for the network's reliance on Core.

Are you able to comment on this @_date: 2017-11-22 14:53:11
I can't think of anyone else who would want to make a historic contract call. Can you?
If someone else does need to, they can just rebuild state history using block-headers and transaction receipts. It takes some time, but I really can't think of a situation in which you would need to do it urgently.

If there weren't other implementations, you guys would find it much easier to simply force whatever changes to the network you want. The availability of other implementations means that you require a greater degree of explicit consent from users in order to pass changes.
Moreover, if there is a bug in one implementation, then another implementation can save the network from crashing and burning.

Does this not imply that the promise of decrypting the infected computer once a payment is made is bogus? Surely the address would need to be unique to each infected node, otherwise it would not be possible to know who is making the payments. 
Can anyone verify or correct this assumption?
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:43:51
When you ask someone to send coins to an address, the network does not actually need to have seen the address before. In fact, the address isn't actually a specific location at all. The sender is simply asking everyone to note on their local copy of the blockchain that only the private key that corresponds to the public key which created this address can now spend these bitcoins. 
When the owner of the private key turns up, they can sign an instruction that the network can verify only could have come from the private keys that correspond to the address associated with the Bitcoins. 
In other words, I might say "only Howard Hufflump can spend these Bitcoins I am sending him". The network needn't have ever heard of Howard Hufflump before, but they make a note of it anyway. When Howard comes along the network can check his passport to be sure it is him.

Changing the PoW algorithm will seriously affect Bitcoin's security, which is one of only two things keeping it ahead of other coins.

Either that or they believe it will be decrypted, but it actually isn't. Sometimes ransomware isn't bothered with actually giving people back their data.

So they need to signal BIP141 otherwise those blocks would be orphaned due to BIP91 activation?
That means BIP141 isn't actually getting activated? I am so confused. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:03:21
It is neither sybil-resistant nor a reliable counting methodology for reasons already stated. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:49:25
Absolute hash rate is definitely relevant to security. Changing the PoW algorithm would destroy the hash rate and open the network to a much cheaper 51% attack than is currently possible. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:59:40
I don't rate the counting methodology for Luke's page at all. Any IP address seen on the network in the last week is counted as an active node, when we know that dynamic IP addresses could count a single node many times over.
Moreover, this is obviously vulnerable to sybil manipulation. There is a reason we don't use node count as a consensus mechanism. 
Finally, I find it difficult to believe that all of those node operators have clear knowledge of SegWit. Running the Core software implementation - which has been the default full client for a long time - is not the same as explicitly consenting to Core's future roadmap. 
Edit: I also find it very strange that only 10% of Core nodes have open ports, whereas 60% of BU nodes have open ports. There is something fishy going on.

No, the they probably won't show you the QR code again once you have set everything up. You would need to print the QR code at the time you set up 2FA. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:38:08
Or you could do a two of two multisig with two different hardware wallets. Then both would have to collude for you to lose anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:07:48
Typically when I sign up to 2FA it is on a computer. I scan the QR code with my phone's camera.
2FA usually comes with an option of entering a code (e.g. 2blkmv5...) rather than scanning a barcode. If you're on your phone, you could write down that code instead of printing out the QR code.

That isn't true. Ethereum would actually need a hard fork if they wanted to retain that number.

Nothing. What would you expect me to do about an internet stranger holding a network hostage? 
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:42:58
Alright, I just started two Core nodes. I then switched off my router and turned it back on. 
Now there are four more Core nodes showing on Luke's chart.

Surely that method needs the cooperation of existing miners?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:35:16
84.7% signalling and we need only 76.7% of remaining blocks to signal SegWit to hit the 80% threshold. Things are looking pretty damn good! 
Edit: 85.4% signalling and only 74.19% of remaining blocks need to signal to lock in SegWit! I'm no mathematologist, so I can't quantify the likelihood of success, but I would say it is looking fucking likely motherfuckers!! 
Edit 2: Now 86.1% and 73.3% respectively. 60 blocks left. Getting a boner. 
Edit 3: 87.5% and 71.4%. Now fully erect. 
Edit 4: 86.8% to 68.75%. 48 blocks until the end of the period, 33 need to signal SegWit. Grab on to your fucking genitalia! 
Edit 5: 88.8% to 57%. It's fucking done. Bring on the activation period, bitches!
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:14:32
I agree, many do likely support SegWit.

They collect some of the fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:01:34
The vast bulk of the current hardware securing the network would be obsolete. It takes time to build that kind of infrastructure, so it would be impossible to start on a new hashing algorithm with the same hash rate as we had previously. 
The hash rate determines the expense of the attack. The greater the hash rate, the greater the expense. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:10:52
There is no reason to think that this poll is representative of Coinbase users. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:34:16


Technically they don't, as that chart accounts for all Core nodes without telling us which version they are running. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:28:35
Yes, I can see why you would not want to continue this discussion. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:38:09
My Parity node is 10GB and I am running it on my Macbook Air. Currently it is taking up about 5% to 15% of the CPU at any given time. It takes a couple of hours when syncing from scratch. 
Ethereum doesn't have Bitcoin's UTXO model; you do not need to keep the entire blockchain locally in order to fully validate every transaction. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:50:49
Yeah, that does not make it representative of Coinbase users. If it was sent out in an email by Coinbase, then it probably would be. As it stands, it is representative of Coinbase users who read r/bitcoin and are willing to share their details with Luke. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:54:09
Thanks for the detailed reply. 
So SegWit2X isn't actually a software implementation, it's just a combination of BIP141 plus 2MB, hence why they are now signalling BIP141? 
I am just not clear why we need BIP141 if BIP91 is already locked in. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:12:36


They explicitly refer to ETH as a currency, so I highly doubt they consider it on the table as a security. Something cannot be defined as both a currency and a security. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:02:14
Sounds kind of like you had a seizure before you could finish your sentence. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:00:00
It would, but only if the rate of churn for dynamic IPs is the same between listening and non-listening nodes. However, the behaviour that leads someone to create a listening vs non-listening node may affect the rate of IP churn of their node.
I am not saying this is definitely the case; there may be no difference whatsoever. However, a comparison between Luke's charts and coin.dance/nodes suggest that a much higher percentage of BU nodes are listening nodes. This difference in behaviour may predict other differences in behaviour - the two groups are not necessarily comparable. 
If it is true that all nodes are affected by dynamic IPs to the same degree, it still doesn't negate my other concerns. I don't find it to be reliable evidence. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:58:49
Yeah, it is MUCH higher. In fact it is a majority of the hash rate. As I said, there is no 6% attack currently occurring. What is happening right now is fundamentally different in that it is not a tyranny of the minority. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:31:17
You beautiful bastard. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:55:33
He's saying that SegWit is a blocksize increase in practice, not that you actually lift the 1mb limit.

I am. You may be responding to an edit I made, which I fat fingered on my calculator and deleted before you posted.

They describe it as a currency:
"From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016, The DAO offered and sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million Ether (“ETH”), a virtual currency used on the Ethereum Blockchain."
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:08:12
Did anyone say that?
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:38:58
It currently has around 50% of the transaction volume of Bitcoin, so clearly people are using it. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:11:23
They explicitly refer to ETH as a currency, which is mutually exclusive with securities. It cannot be both.

The pie chart doesn't account for SegWit nodes, though I now see that there is more beneath the pie chart which I had not seen before.
I still don't think it is reliable evidence.

When you say 4x faster, do you mean that it has 4x transactions per second or 4x quicker block time?

It's an odd rhetorical question given that the answer hasn't been finalised for Casper. 
It also belies his ignorance, because stake grinding can be overcome if the protocol requires multiple validators to generate the random value that determines the next validator to build a block. It's a lazy criticism.

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic. Why should we care if a lambda user runs an archival node? They can still run a fully validating pruned node. They can retain their network sovereignty without having to store data that is not relevant to them.

The point is that a cryptocurrency could create 10 billion new coins per year, but if that accounts for only 0.1% of total supply then it is trivial. If you moved Bitcoin's decimal point over 3 places it would have a supply of 21 billion, but the supply dynamics would remain identical.
