If there's any money in there, it's people from this thread tipping the public addresses... or someone went through my trash after I took the photo :-)

How do you feel about these two phrases which I hear over and over around this forum:
    1. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose
    2. Bitcoin is an experiment

Do you think about bitcoin more than you think about sex? Do you check on your cell phone while urinating? ...even though you were already just looking at it on your desktop back in the office two seconds ago? What about and @_date: 2017-02-07 03:55:36
How much do you trust Trump and his administration? There's been some indisputable non-truths coming from the White House.

Does your Muslim friend have any thoughts about the travel ban? Or about Milo's own rhetoric about how a majority of Muslims hate homosexuals and favour Sharia law? Do you have any thoughts you'd like to share about those two issues?

Thanks Adam! What are you working on lately? 
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:16:38
Adam Back is not a Bitcoin Core dev. Does Trace even really know what he is talking about?
edit: Trace also doubts Jeff's expertise because Jeff didn't email him a specific favorite git commit? I can help Trace find a commit on github if he needs the help -- he is kind of a douche bag!
Trace reminds me of my boss. Smart investor. Rich. But zero understanding of the technology. This video is cringe worthy. His podcast is too. The guests are great but I always wish I could mute Trace. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 22:48:11

Can you tell us what else is auto-filtered from Like "BU" "Bitcoin Unlimited" "Classic" "Adam Back" "SegWit" "Hard Fork" ... etc?
@_date: 2016-06-11 19:39:47
Oh god no please no. Trace is our Trump. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:40:51
Y'all got any more of those... cryptocurrencies? Oh you do? Like 100 other options with no fees and empty blocks?
Y'all got any way to, I dunno, "shift" the "shape" of my current holdings to a faster possibly more anonymous blockchain? Oh you do? 
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:52:25
Cool, sooooo... you're rich? I hope you're starting up some bitcoin companies with all that gain!

I wonder what BC.i considers "with fee only," and if that variable has evolved over the time the data for this chart was collected. I wonder what the same chart would look like if had multiple traces:
* blue line: 0.00000000 fee
* red line:   0.00005000 fee
* green line: 0.00010000 fee
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:24:00
Why do we need a fee market when the subsidy is still so high?
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:30:01
I would like Barney the Gavinsaur to tell me what BC.i considers "With Fee Only" and also if they have ever changed the value that satisfies this filter.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:03:16


That sounds like an opinion, not computer science or economics. My understanding has always been that Bitcoin was designed to be essentially free for the users for the first 630000 blocks or so, because of the subsidy.
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:46:03
You trade Bitcoin with Roger Ver directly? That's cool! I'm surprised he didn't tell you that the price won't ever go up while we're stuck at 1MB blocks though! Where is the new user demand going to come from if Bitcoin is slow and unreliable?
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:45:26


Because it's not funny, not constructive, looks like a personal attack against Roger Ver, and is otherwise stupid.
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:44:36




Miners? Merchants who accept BTC but have bills to pay in fiat? I doubt Roger Ver sells bitcoin for fiat at all!

is a very dedicated Libertarian. They don't share, they just work and compete and profit. If you don't like how he doesn't contribute to the community, don't patronize his businesses! Surely if enough people vote with their wallets the free market will convince business owners they need to support developers.

Yes just like all those Trump supporters who are so *tired* of being told what to think by the "elite intelligentsia", CSW tells them what they want to hear, that everything else is fake news.

...or is there only a single decent graphic artist in @_date: 2017-07-03 17:31:56
Agreed, amazing. A big personality cult who tells people what they want to hear and offers them an alternative to the elite intelligentsia that makes them feel stupid. It's the exact same phenomenon.

No, it's a tool for REGULAR PEOPLE to purchase drugs, launder money and finance terrorism.

What do you mean? I doubt Amir would even respond to a request like Gavin did. And BIP148 experience? How's that relate?

Isn't there an alt coin secured by a huge network of masturbation pools?
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:23:53
The problem is, there is a personality cult here, and people who are sick of being told the facts by the actual experts are looking for someone to tell them what they want to hear. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:31:35
The community was divided literally at the moment that censorship rules were enforced on r/Bitcoin. You don't see the Bitcoin stack exchange censoring topics like hard forks or alt-clients. Maybe we would have more understanding overall if these walls were torn down and we could all discuss together in one forum.
