I have unconfirmed funds of 0.76926744, what does that mean? I got my bitcoins all through one purchase at an atm. From the atm it went to Mycelium, from Mycelium it went to coinb.in. I then went to deposit some on AB. Now I can't do anything even with the confirmed coin coinb.in

is this what you're talking about? I get this with the unconfirmed transaction b8534c6b78f8b7db159ac0c77870ca69d08b0ff24bbff6118a9f176e86d02ec0

The second part of your answer is something I need to learn more about. I only use this for hansa for one vendor.

I've never had this problem before. although, I've never transferred money to AB, always hansa.

I don't understand that, please forgive my ignorance. I'm just a nervous wreck right now. I need to get this btc out right now. It says Transaction fee: 0.0001 obviously that's not enough to get my btc instantly transferred. vWhat should I set the transaction fee at for an instant transaction?
I'm sorry guy's, I. I'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off. Since I was diagnosed, shit, way before that. Btc has been my only real source of income these past couple months dealing with this sickness. FML is the only thing that's protected my job and I need that for the benefits for her and I's illnesses. I asked the water company for a break, told them the situation with the kid's and the illnesses within the household, they could give a fuck less. 
Sorry guys for rambling, I. I'm a nervous wreck trying to rectify this situation.

That's all I needed to hear. Worst case is a couple day wait?
