1MB Solution? I have Disket here larger than that. Satoshi with 32MB blocks was wrong in your opinion?
So Bitcoin is a success because of Blockstream? Satoshi and other early developers have nothing to do with it?

I watched the full video. But isn't clear what is the difference between the one time payment and subscription model in this case? If this is a subscription model, in the second month, the user still needs to make another bitcoin transaction. So, in the final, what is the difference between Blockonomics and all the others gateway?

I would like to buy one or make one. How you do it?

It is not the safest way. The wallet.dat just record the last 100 "change address", if you are using your  wallet daily and have a backup a bit old, I strongly recommend you to backup it again and move to another wallet.  
I did this mistake and lost 20 BTC. How it works? Once you made a transaction, you also receive the "change" of the transaction, as the inputs must be the same as the outputs. The thing is, this "change" go to a new address, and the Bitcoin Core wallet just save 100 of these "change address" in the backup. So if you made more than 100 transactions, you need another backup.
