You have made a number of mistakes in your judgement, so I'm going to argue.


Blatant bullshit right ahead. Can you prove this? What does the word *major* in "most major banks" mean, precisely?


The bullshit bingo promptly continues. Why is Bitcoin *irrelevant*? Irrelevant to *what*? If you meant finance -- I'm going to disagree once again: Bitcoin **is** relevant to finance. Strike me Jesus Christ with a lightning bolt it is. It illustrates in an interesting way how a brilliant idea (though still simple and understandable by mere mortals) can get economic value just for being brilliant and can usefully participate in real trades in the role of the value-carrying agent. It illustrates that currency design is not limited to *paper*: a mere **algorithm** can be the currency -- if it deserves trust. Bitcoin illustrates that it's the *idea* of using something commonly as a value carrier in transactions (which happen to be mutually profitable -- meet your *free market* once again -- which, ideally, does not require any trust to third-parties) that is valuable, and not the actual printed paper. It is the same idea that obeying 1 and 100 on a special- and uncopyable-enough paper is profitable to both parties so they can trade fairly. But Bitcoin highlights some "well-known" *but wrong* assumptions done in classical banking.
I hope it's enough of motivation that you could accept my opinion that Bitcoin has ecomonic value.
I *could* agree that Bitcoin is tiny, obscure, and volatile (just for the sake of continued discussion), but I can argue with that too.
The "fact" that it's tiny, for example, isn't worth a single penny: you've done here that classical *ad populum* mistake from the regular variaty logic textbook. Learn to appreciate an idea in isolation, because otherwise your reasoning is backwards: you're judging something by *its* (socio-dynamical) *time-dependant consequences*. Do you think, in retrospect, that it was a good idea to argue "I don't buy this whole *combustion car* crap, it's too tiny and insignificant" just because pretty much everybody else used horses back in the 19-th century? Your argument "bitcoin is tiny" uses exactly the same flawed [thought template](
Still, please clarify what you meant by *"Bitcoin is irrelevant"*, for our own good to make the discussion mutually productive.


These are not [facts]( these are your (arguable) subjective judgements.
For example, I believe that for many people here (including me) Bitcoin is not *difficult*. This shows that you can't exclude *the speaker* himself when evaluating the judgement "Bitcoin is difficult". Difficult *for whom*?  This, by definition, means that the statement is subjective. This means that it is not a fact.


How is this different from any conventional currency? In my country, many businesses depend on US$ (even though it's not the local government's intent), and experience just about the same sensation of financial unprotectedness. Nobody is perfectly shielded from financial risk. In current financial systems, many things can collapse in a single moment. [Huge banks]( can collapse in a weekend. [Russian ruble]( is collapsing right now (again), even though perhaps the only characteristic unifying RUR and BTC is *being a currency*. Some statements don't turn true just because governments say it is so. Currently used financial systems are not even nearly perfect, and Bitcoin is valueable in that it's being very helpful in highlighting the flaws.
Bitcoin shows exactly which bank services are essential (like accountable escrowing of trades), and which are plain bullshit replaceable by a simple algorithm. Promises of undefiability and complete risk protection, as we can all see, is an example of *plain bullshit*, since they don't (and can't in principle) work.


I'm sorry, but you're misusing the word [fact]( here again. Please don't, this is confusing and leads to unproductive discussions.


The reason they're frightened is because **they should be**, by design of bitcoin. If some body is actually seriously frightened of bitcoin -- it signifies that bitcoin works. It doesn't matter how big or tiny it is -- see above, this is ad populum. And for some reason, you seem to deny the *fact* that government currencies still *do* actually regularly collapse, exactly as a house of cards. Don't you agree that Bitcoin highlights systematic flaws in financial systems? One cannot make something work (where it won't, can't and shouldn't work that way, for a reason) just through massive propaganda that it *will* work. Nature doesn't work that way. The only way to combat this unpleasant situation is to *argue*, to discuss reasons, to engage in *free* discussions (in an ordered and constructive way off course), including discussions which criticise the government. Bitcoin *is* such a discussion.


You're contradicting yourself here. Aren't currencies normally valued *"through sheer belief alone"*? You said four paragraphs above that *"governments don't give a currency value, we do."*. Alrighty then! Are you really trying to prove contradictory ideas in different paragraphs, or I don't understand you? Please clarify if I don't.


Please, be **very** careful with this argument. It has led to wars.

The bitcoin wiki [here]( elaborates on the case. In short: with whatever-large computing power one could conduct a *double spend attack*, which isn't practical because of the cost of attack (and alternative costs of the computing power!) would likely exceed potential profit from it.
Though, currently, such an attack could also prevent the rest of the network from getting confirmations for their transactions. For this to succeed it is required that the attacker would intensionally NOT include "useful" transactions in generated blocks. I believe such a behavior could be heuristically detected by bitcoin client software, once the community notes the attack; and then, the attacker would just be isolated in their own block branch. The rest of the network could stop accepting offending blocks, and build another (shorter) block chain. 
tl;dr: yes, that could cause some mess in the network, but defense is easily possible.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:38:24
Yes, this was neat, but to calm your fear there is a [way to defend]( from the attack, without falling down to disassembling compiler binaries (*ouch*).
And GCC 3.0.4 has been checked to be safe.
I'll try to describe the Diverse Double Compiling method in a paragraph.
1.  You need a trusted compiler. Yes. But it doesn't have to be efficient and feature-rich; it can be a minimalistic C compiler like [TCC]( (76k LOC) capable just enough to correctly compile the subject compiler. It's not impossible to write such a compiler completely from scratch, and this has been done.
2. Then let's name our trusted compiler T, and the subject compiler S.
3. Essentially what has to happen is compilation of S's source repeated three times: first using S itself (and this is actually a pretty much ubiquitous procedure called compiler bootstrapping), yielding S0 binary.
4. Then we compile S's source with T, and get St executable. Even if S0 isn't infected, St certainly won't binary match with S0, because, well, different compilers generate executables differently.
5. But if we use St to again compile S's source to get S1, essentially repeating the bootstrapping procedure -- but this time with a proven trojan-free version of S -- then voila! We can finally:
6. Compare S1 and S0 binaries. They *have to* consist of bit-to-bit the same instructions, because we used supposedly the same compiler to compile both of them from the same source. If they don't match (modulo timestamps, etc) -- then S must've injected something into S0 that wasn't present in the source.
Even a single person can do this!

I appreciate the OP's sense of humor, but he gets my downvote for diminishing the actual achievements of [Open Hardware]( and Open Software movements.
As ridiculous as it sounds, but these guys do successfully follow the steps  [there are][2] completely open-source designed devices which can be used to access the internet using open-source software like Linux and Mozilla Firefox.
[2]: 
And the reason all this complexity can work together in trusted ways is because these open movements embrace... worldwide teamwork as the primary method of coping with the enormous amounts of required work. And some interesting open trust processes... but, yeah. Generally, this works.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:46:05
There is open *hardware* too. You can take an open design of a SoC and submit it to a silicon plant. They will fabricate your design and send it to you.
@_date: 2013-07-22 09:48:56
Nope, you haven't.
It'd be sufficient to isolate your external input (e.g. network controllers) from the important parts (e.g. the CPU) by intermediate translation layers (bus/interrupt/dma controllers), manufactured **on different plants**, preferably in different countries.
This way deploying a successful hardware backdoor to your custom-made computer would become a measure demanding tight international cooperation (AND technology!) — which, I guess, is sorta *sufficient* level of security.

There is a counter-measure to the attack, called Diverse Double Compiling, and I described it [above](
