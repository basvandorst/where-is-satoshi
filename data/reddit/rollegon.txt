Andreas, if you have a possibility, please try to get some pictures from his trains!

Thanks! 
That rolling background-color effect is nice one!
One improvement would probably make user experience better.
Is it possible to develop a easier way to follow my own bet? For example but transaction ID as hover title into player addresses. In Bitcoin-Qt there really is no easy way to backtrack your sending address from transaction history.

His opinions are not only disturbingly in favour of US currency wars, it's more annoying that he can use his dev status to enforce them as community guidelines.
But we have come a long way from that episode. There is already growing resistance against centralization of bitcoin. Bitcoin Foundation has only limited support within community and bitcoin-qt developers doesn't have that strong "official client" status anymore.
So yes, truly global movement doesn't stop because of these petty political hidden agendas as long as we as community don't support them. Bitcoin is free to anyone, binary-based reality doesn't support carbon-based politics or borders.

Jeff Garzik at least used to have strong opinions against spreading bitcoin to Iran because of current trade sanctions. Previously in  he banned devs when they were  planning something similar as coinava.com and speaking about farsi translation for Bitcoin-Qt.
