I will never tire of this
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:01:27
looks totally legit investment [**mortgages house**]
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:59:32
I've already invested in the ICO of arterycoin, seems legit

1 chicken wing per confirmation

Sir, you are going to save me a lot of money (when I can get access to my account again)
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:35:51
What film is that from? I've forgotten
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:44:24
Superb - thankyou!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:57:17
But.... now may nodes need to agree...
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:59:45
Looking at that happy face, I think there is going to be one happy pup! Congrats on your new life partner, he/she will be an absolute joy to be with. Make sure you appreciate every moment and buy lots of toys and interesting walks (shih tzu owner here)

Even dogs are getting i on the act!
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:56:09
That's interesting  thankyou, and what is it invested on, do they say? Is there a minimum time period that you need to keep the deposit in for? or a requirement of value before withdrawing?
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:24:44
I'm using coinomi, just installing mycelium, I was hoping to use the multi currency option. Restored wallet via passphrase so will see what happens :/
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:18:07
What results are you getting from it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:06:54
I saw they were claiming 148% for 6 weeks, sounds too good to be true.. ponzi?
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:17:44
Trying to use a half decent wallet for my kit, on my old pc I used to use armory, but that's died so got myself a chromebook
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:17:25
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:30:37
Sorted it out, the app couldn't connect to the server due t the server being offline, mycelium is working fine
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:11:41
I've just created a new address and called it 'btc test'
Each time I go to refresh, it's showing as 'no connection' just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and tried a testnet coin, nothing showing yet
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:11:55
That looks superb!
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:52:50
;) It's been a pretty interesting thread, I wonder if the positive comments are simply fake?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:04:25
lol superb
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:46:43
Can we ICO Lightningcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:50:14
Yep, it's by default, it's also scary how they know - imagine how much data is held about us...
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:07:11
I can confirm, they are also merging with McDOnalds
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:00:48
lol, thanks - I'm a Brit!
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:08:49
We all speak like prince Charles, and all know the Queen :P
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:04
Only on reddit, this is acceptable
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:16:56
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:40:01
I wonder what they are doing with the currency?
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:06:46
That made me chuckle :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:19:02
My rich uncle in Africa, who is a prince, will give me Zimbabwecoins if I give him my account details!
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:31:01
You get a free toy with each coin :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:03:47
Gotcha - thankyou buddy, I've lean't something today!
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:58:03
ahh, so if I set a price that is just above or just below, that will avoid fees?
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:55:05
My dog has no balls, which makes him even ballsier than the others :S
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:37:08
If it's on the internet, it must be true ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:50:57
Corrected - thankyou :) My keyboard doesn't register certain presses for some reason
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:49:53
You crazy guy, I'll offer £1,000!
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:04
Only on reddit, this is acceptable
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:53:07
Oh that made me chuckle :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:50:35
Dumb question, what's a maker and taker eli5?
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:14:58
Any idea what they 'invest' in? I can't see what they do with the currency
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:18:27
I've done some researching on the site and it seems more towards iffy than legit, so I kept away
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:01:41
I'm in the UK, the exchange rate is awful.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:51:03
Superb - love it! Setting this as my backdrop
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:33:20
Any idea what software was used to produce that graph?
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:49:45
I owned a Rolls Royce once and did exactly that, the ride was too smooth and made me car sick, ended up getting rid of it :/
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:06:25
Awww jeesh everyone has an upvote for that
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:04:42
That made me laugh
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:35:14
Thankyou!
