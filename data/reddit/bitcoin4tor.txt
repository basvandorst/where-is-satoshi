Is it possible to pay someone to run a relay? I do not have any machines that are online 24/7. I'd prefer to pay for an automated process that someone else controls from another location so I don't have to worry about anything.

Cool, on torservers.net/donate it says "If you donate more than $50 monthly, you are entitled to get your very own Tor exit node: Contact us and we'll set up a node carrying a name of your choice, with a custom info page (if desired)!" This is similar to what I was looking for. I just want to make sure that any donated money is being spent as intended which is why I was wondering if there was a way to monitor the stats ourselves. I'll have to look more into it. Thanks.

Although this seems cool for helping the people already running relays/exit nodes, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. I want to get more nodes on the Tor network.

Thank you again very much. Tor-ramdisk is very interesting after reading about it a little.  Maybe someone could make a business out of only selling deploying/managing tor exit nodes or bitcoin full nodes if no other services exist already.

...although I would guess that by donating to the ones already running relays/exit nodes, some might be encouraged to set more up if they received enough money... I just want guarantees that more nodes will be online if I spend money. The more relays and exit nodes, the better it is for Tor and the free world.

Interesting... maybe in the future I can play with one of those but for now it's not what I'm looking for. Thanks for the info though.

Supporting oniontip is fine, it's just not exactly what I'm looking for.

So, with this, hypothetically I could pay torservers the $50/mo and could look on Atlas to see if it was deployed/running smoothly?

Thank you for that information. I just asked a question to someone else that you almost answered. Is all I need to run an exit node a VPS and the time to learn? I feel like I'm mising something.

So this helps with Tor bridges, not relays/exit nodes, right? If I could help with bridges for free, which it does say is a possibility depending on region, maybe I'll try it in the future.

Do you think $50/mo is a fair price for them to do everything? How much money could I save by if I did this myself (if I took the time to learn)? I'm guessing I'd have to pay for a VPS with enough bandwidth to support some traffic but is that it? I feel like I'm missing something. Thanks again.
