On the drive given to your parents you can try spinrite software from [GRC.com]( It costs $89 but many people have been saved after a drive has gone bad, and this software has helped them recover the data. 
It might not be a bad drive though so the software might not help. Just thought I’d mention it in case you were really desperate.

I was looking to buy a ledger and now I’m glad i didnt. I’m very unimpressed with both the ledger and trezor. For the price of these devices I expect more of a polished product. 
I wouldnt pay more than $40 a cheap flimsy plastic wallet device like those. 
The amount of problems with the ledger software was the nail in the coffin though. If it is prone to errors and I constantly have to restart it because its not responding its not worth it at all. 
Using 2 buttons for a pin code is also not optimal. 
The trezor seems decent but still overpriced and not enough support for alt coins for my taste. 
I’d rather just use an off the grid computer and install wallets on bootable flash drives while I wait for a product that is worth the price of a trezor or ledger. 
I’m glad i watched this before buying.

I added a 2nd 0 after the decimal and it still didnt work. I just sold my 1 litecoin and tried to sell .01 and i no longer get the error. So it seems .01 is the limit like others said.

Is it true there are no fees for buying/selling on gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:28:33
I also had the app say there was an update. I didn’t download it because i know not to side load apps. If its not from the app store, there is a good chance that its from a hacker/scammer. Combining that with the fact that its from china makes me extra cautious.

Is it possible to make your own version with a raspberry pi?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:49:42
Thanks for your advice. Like to know what I’m getting into before i dive head first. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:10:09
Im only planning on buying around $100 right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:33:49
I agree. There is already a bit of info in the faq but i feel it has room for improvement. The faq is good for general things, but an in depth beginners guide would be very helpful. I was unaware of all of the verification i needed to do on coinbase to link to my fiat money to purchase btc. I ended up missing out on the price being below $6000 during the attack. 
It would be nice to start a detailed “all-encompassing” bitcoin guide. 
Maybe we could all pitch in some bitcoin to pay someone knowledgeable to write this guide as I’m sure it will be very time consuming.

Keep in mind if your lastpass gets hacked then the hackers have both factors.

What am i doing wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:59:59
I dont see the difference in limit and stop. Also can i have buy and sell orders at the same time and have it buy/sell in a loop if the price is going up and down?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:23:32
Transfering from coinbase to gdax has no fees.

Forgive me if I’m ignorant (i dont fully understand the mining aspect),  they’re not making a cryptocurrency, just remolding the blockchain technology to suit their needs (such as transfers between banking institutions). Correct me if I’m wrong, My understanding is that mining is done to update the ledgers when people make transactions. If not, my only other guess is that its just some arbitrary math problem that is just a useless waste of energy to coin miners so that the market isnt just flooded with the final number of bitcoins (thats how i initially thought it worked). Since it makes no sense to me why they would have some meaningless math problem, i feel its safe to assume the former is whats going on (if not something totally different)
Back to my point, banks could put miners in atms, on their terminal pcs for the bank clerks, etc. If its really beneficial to them to utilize blockchain technology for their own purposes, I’m sure they would invest into the infrastructure.

You mentioned a buy order potentially not going through. Why does that happen? Does it happen often?
Ive read a little bit about the processing of transactions taking time depending on how big a fee you pay. Once you start the transaction, is exchange rate locked in or do do you have to see what happens when by the time the transaction is finished?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:38:59
Thanks for all of the responses. I will look into day-trading small alt coins and hodling btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:39:26
I feel you should’ve mentioned paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:58:07
Correct. Gdax is owned by coinbase. And when you transfer from gdax to another wallet its free. Just make sure if you transfer it to another exchange that you are fine with their withdrawal fees and that they dont make you jump through hoops to send to another wallet or exchange. 
For instance, binance exchange is based in south korea and requires you to validate your identity with a picture of your passport/id and who knows what else before you can move your coins to another exchange or wallet. Idk about you but i dont want to hand over that kind of info to foreign companies. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:06:23
Then whats the minimum i can sell? Because the number in the popup is wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:16:36
Is there an app for gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:22:03
Thank you for the very clear explanation. Its becoming clearer and clearer to me that day trading is not the way to go.  If an end all be all guide to cryptocurrency was compiled, your comment would have to be in the “why you shouldnt day trade” section.

Good to know
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:58:19
Ouch. Aint nobody got time for cash advance interest rates. Im not going to risk it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:14:11
Thanks. Just gotta buy a little more. 
Edit:I forgot i have litecoin i can sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:11:08
I was able to find a way to add my bank with routing/account number. It’ll just take 2-3 business days. Im just pissed my credit card still getting canceled transactions. And for some reason i cant even log into the cc website to see my balance. Hopefully it’ll dip again when i have another means to purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:07:13
If you log into gdax with your coinbase username and password it should allow you to deposit from your coinbase account without verifying anything. Did you make a separate account for gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:53:14
I meant the leaflet. You mentioned making a wallet online or in software and mentioned hardware wallets but not paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:22:51
Can you explain the whole market/limit/stop options on gdax? 
From what it sounds like, stop will sell at the top and buy back if it goes past its limit. What about when it dips? Is there a control to buy back under stop if it dips to a certain pevel?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:37:22
I’m kicking myself for not buying at $5900. One of the posts said it will be down for the week to come. I’ll buy a small amount now and wait to see if theres another downturn. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:16:26
I too am wondering about the “also” part of your question. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:31:26
The value at the time was 8008 and i wanted to sell at 7991. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:39
If you’re having problems with a corrupted hdd try [spinrite]( Its helped countless people who had hdd problems (including ones that would not boot). It does cost $89 though. If nothing else works it’s definitely worth the $89 to recover .4 btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:24:40
I just realized to make any significant profit day trading id have to have at least 1 btc.  Im just gonna hodl and try trading  litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:32:22
Fair point. I planned on just buying some btc hodling and experimenting with day-trading with a small portion and seeing how i faired. A couple people mentioned trading alt coins as there is a much smaller buy in which sounds like a good idea to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:05:48
I’m a bitcoin newbie and i wanted to buy when it was sub $5900. I setup my Coinbase account and then i was set back by verification after verification. Now its over 6k so i might wait now. But just in case for next time, is there any other delays i could face when using a credit card to purchase? I saw it said us ingredients bank account is instant.
