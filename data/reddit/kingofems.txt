How much bitcoin do you have?
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:32:42
Keeping some stocks until they explode is an investment. End result is the same. More bitcoin.

I bought three coins at the middle of the huge dip. And resold at the peak. Don’t trip.
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:43:18
Money went to other investments.

Oh look it’s headed back to 9300 where I bought all my bitcoin at. How exciting.

No but day trading stocks which has earned me more than the last bitcoin surge is an investment. If bitcoin isn’t going to earn me more bitcoin. Than I’ll use other means to get more bitcoin.

My bad. Didn’t add the proper zero. You’re right. Less than 2% is 154,000,000 people have bitcoin.

Already at around 14-15m people. Probably more. “Rest of the world” is kind of closing in.

Dang. Was going to buy my first 3 coins and was hoping for sub 7000. I’ll wait for the next fat dip.

You buy the coin and you hold onto it until you’re a millionaire.

Cash app has a larger mark up than I realized.

This is the best advice to give anyone to show them the reality of the quick buck ideology. 
“What do you mean my bitcoin bought at 9200 is only 7000. “
