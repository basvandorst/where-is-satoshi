I see. Thank you for the help!
If I had BTC to tip you with I would. Do you have a dogecoin wallet by any chance? I can tip you that.

I'm far from a hacker, but isn't this gray hat, not white hat hacking?

Makes me feel better about Bitcoin now that I know a little more. Now I just need to buy some or sell things for them.

This is probably going to sound stupid to any Bitcoin veteran but does a private key hold all of your coins or is there a private key for every coin?
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:32:01
Does this mean if I have a wallet with more than one address, I have more than one private key?

I wasn't planning on throwing money into a paper wallet, I was just curious since I keep seeing pictures about it, and never knew how it worked. Thanks again.

Okay. So...
I have a private key (x for the sake of this example).
In x, I hold, say, 4 BTC, and people can send me BTC using a wallet address I give them (for example, 14tE4n4jvRf1bTKHVjwpXnjnWmAHz4d3cZ, an address I just created), which will add to my balance. 
However, if someone steals my private key, they can use it to enter into any program that will allow them and they suddenly have my BTC to spend how they want to.
 
So a paper wallet has a QR which displays a wallet address on the inside, and hidden on the same paper wallet is a private key, which if scanned can go into a wallet, and display the balance of that account, and allow you to spend the funds within.
Is this correct?

I figured that but wasn't sure. Where is the password written? Do you access it through a regular wallet program like Bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:11:52
How do you keep this part hidden? By folding, I'd assume, correct?

Amazon was pretty big in Brazil... It seems to be shrinking in size over there though

I'll try again in a bit once I get my work done.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:43:32
I can do something like that. Would you want it to say the same thing?

Here's a pretty simple take that came out way better than when I imagined: 
Here is one with a black center B:

Note: The white big logo one has a problem with the edges. When I fix it I will post a link in this thread.
If you want any other resolutions let me know.

I actually saw them at CoinDL. Are you selling them there? 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:06:33
This wasn't here the last time I looked. Sorry. Glad I received this information.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:56:45
Yep. One second. I'll even resize it for facebook :).

You made those? I actually saw the Matrix looking one earlier today and said "that's really cool."
