Wait, what aspect of " Wall Street" will be rendered useless by bitcoin? Bond offerings, IPOs, lending, brokerage, M&amp;A advisory, the buy side - currency doesn't matter in any of these functions and those skill sets will remain valuable even if bitcoin becomes a relevant currency. As far as Wall Street is concerned, remittance is a backwater and no one gives two shits about it.

Who said it was the most efficient? Obviously, mesh networks are more efficient for sending packets to my neighbor, but that doesn't mean its practical to develop a mesh network that will enable me to transmit large amounts of data to the guy the next town over, and definitely not to anyone across an ocean. Also, there is a great difference between decentralized routing being theoretically possible, and the actual owners of the infrastructure (and their governments) from actually allowing you to do it.
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:06:12
I think we've lost touch with what we're talking about. Go back to the top of this conversation tree. Can routing be decentralized? Yes, of course. But the top post refers to an 'internet' without central authorities, which IMHO, is impossible because the owners of the physical infrastructure will not allow it.

No, insurance companies insure against things they can't control, like earthquakes and fires and car accidents. The FDIC is very different because the very existence of deposit insurance removes the incentive to go make a run on deposits which makes it less likely that deposit insurance will be necessary.
Everyone knows that financial matters are "non-gaussian", and that's why the FDIC has established a track record of doing exceptional things in the midst of a panic, like raising the account maximums or having its total explicit guarantees increased by congress.


This is just BS. Like, in 2008, there was a once-in-a-century run on basically every type of financial asset, and despite a truly fucked political situation in congress, the Treasury, Fed, and FDIC, broke the panic without even getting close to putting up the sort of dollars that they could have. This is just the pure chicken little, goldbug, zerohedge banking conspiracy BS that people have been peddling for 100 years.

@_date: 2014-12-04 00:25:57


Uh, no. What you've described is a special case of the sunk cost fallacy. Sunk cost fallacy simply relates to the fact that you must consider the ROI of each incremental investment on a standalone basis. 
If you think the fair value of bitcoin is greater than the price and the gap presents an attractive risk adjusted return*, then you should make the investment. It doesn't matter that you happened to invest at $800 in the past -- the decision to invest today at $400 (or whatever) should be made independently. That is the spirit of the sunk cost fallacy.


Meaningless. If you invested at $800, doubling down at $400 and closing out at $600 doesn't magically mean that you made money when you invested at $800. 


What? No, clearly that is not what my argument implies. What my argument implies is that you should only buy on days when then expected return of your investment that day is &gt;0.
*of course, this is in the limit of an asset being a small portion of your overall portfolio. It becomes slightly complicated as the position grows, because the risk to your overall portfolio increases as it becomes concentrated.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:50:50


No, that's stupid semantics. Investing means putting up capital in expectation of a financial return. Some may argue that "investing" is long term and "trading" is short term, but there's no reason that an investment must go long on an asset. In any event, why would it make a difference for your argument?


I work at a large hedge fund where I get paid multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to "invest". If I didn't know what I was doing, then I'd be managing to trick some very smart people who think otherwise.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:02:13
Sure, if rates went really negative. Banks work by charging a spread between what the rates at which they borrow and lend. At the unit level, spread is the only thing they care about. Now, as interest rates go lower, cost to borrow for end consumers at constant spread go lower as well, so people are more likely to borrow and banks love that. This is how central banks heat up and cool off the economy.

Visa has a vast database of fraudulent behavior that has been mined over several decades. Obviously, your transaction raised red flags, even with the additional layer of verification.

We don't look at illiquid, $7b asset classes because that's a waste of time and would be really crowded if they weren't.
