Actually, you would need a "plausible deniability".
The app is pin-protected and stores several wallets, each one has its own pin.
If you type pin as "4035" you get a wallet with just a fraction of XBT
If you type pin as "4239" you get the real wallet, with the larger sum
This way, you won't get "revenge stabbed" by the disappointed  thief

Forget the wallet installation. As others have said, they'll keep watching their phones and not you.
Plus, it's guaranteed that a non-negligible part of the audience will have a problem during the installation, and you'd have people saying "hey, it doesn't work for me".
I think that it would be much more simple and effective if you did a transfer, that will keep the discourse in your hands, and while doing these transfers you could stress the points you want to.
Depending on the infrastructure you have, you could send from mobile to mobile, or from a web-wallet to mobile, and vice-versa
As you are focusing on AML, it would be terrific if you could setup a skype video call with someone else, possibly abroad and in a really far-away and/or sketchy country. Have them hold their mobile in front of their webcam, scan their QR and send them money. If it's someone you trust, do it NOT with a few bucks, but (for example) a reasonably large amount.
I think that (for example) starting your presentation by having $500 instantly and irrevocably sent to India (Bielorussia? Nigeria? Uruguay?) will impress everyone. I think the main point you have to stress is that this sort of transfers are terribly problematic for AML, but also terribly convenient for most of the good guy in the world (cheap, instant, avoiding dictatorships, potentially anonymous). So, they ARE going to happen. 
(of course, your counterparty must be trusted enough that you get your money back later)
Then, show an on-line purchase (not on a darkweb site :-) 
As for other topics...
The "distributed public ledger" will definitely have to be well explained.
The potentially anonymous but at the same time potentially public is also important. With proper implementation, you can buy your viagra anonymously, when you need, but at the same time you can show to the world that you are paying someone and have it publicly recorded on the blockchain.
best luck!

Because this is just not going to happen.
The card operator is highly centralized and regulated, and in your scenario it functions as an interface to a de-centralized and un-regulated system. This becomes a AML/KYC risk for them. Why bother with this? They'll just dumb you.
Exactly like it's happening with all the threads "Coinbase rejected my transaction / Coinbase locked my account".
In Coinbase's case, money is coming from your bank account, so it's already somehow "kosher-ed" by the bank's AML/KYC procedure. Nevertheless, they'll often cause trouble.
The system you are imagining is the exact counterpart of Coinbase, and it will suffer the same problems, except bigger. Because here the money laundering risks are bigger: for all they know, I could be a SilkRoad seller trying to cash in my profits, and they have no way to check this.

I really like the idea, but .... how could the recipient  sign the first half of the transaction when there aren't UTXOs to spend yet?
@_date: 2014-12-26 09:16:00
The "Confirmation" name is a bit mis-leading.
An "Un-confirmed" transaction does not mean "maybe he sent the money, maybe he didn't". The money HAS BEEN SENT.
What COULD possibly happen is that the customer sends THE SAME money to someone else trying to scam you. In this case, there would be two transactions spending the same money around the network: the first one being confirmed takes precedence, and the other one gets discarded. That's what is called a "double spend".
 
Unless the amount is significant, it's not practical to do this, as it takes a certain effort to do, and you be rather confident that once the transaction is sent, it' will confirm. More sophisticated systems watch the network to check if there are two transactions attempting to spend the same money, and will alert about a "double spend attempt" 
It's a bit like a check: you are sure the payment has been made, you could possibly have the scammer spend the same money giving another check to someone else. (Actually, checks are FAR worse, as you can write check for money you don't have at all, and this is not possible with XBT)
Finally, the scammer cannot be 100% certain which one of the transactions goes through, so he might end paying you anyway. That's not a good model for scammers.
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:13:58
It's not bad, as the fact of having your own domain gives a non-standard environment. A typical malware, even with a keylogger, would have problems with that, as it would not be able to follow an automatic procedure to rob you.
A non-standard attack is very feasible, on the other hand. A keylogger could easily steal most of your info.
AND NEVER use the blockchain info wallet on the same phone you use for 2FA! 
On the other hand, it's a form of "security through obscurity", aka it's more complex that really difficoult. Many different parts are involved, and this creates many different points of attack. e.g.


do you really trust this password manager? is it open source?


what system does it run on? could it e hacked? is it open to inspect by your hosting provider? are you just trusting them?
It could crash tomorrow. Do you have a backup? Are you just trusting your provider? 


that's the "Meh" part of your security. You are really trusting these guys, aren't you?
Unless you are trading, you shouldn't store them there.


That's not  your problem.  The problem is NOT that want them accessible 24/7, it's that you want them accessible within SECONDS instead of MINUTES
If you were storing cash, it would be like saying "I want them accessible in seconds, therefore I won't put them in a safe, because opening  the safe takes a minute. I'll just keep them in my wallet"
There are  amounts that are ok to keep in a wallet, others that should be kept  in a safe. 
I too have a blockchain.info with 2FA, that's my wallet. My safe in an offline PC with Electrum, and a paper backup of the seed &amp; keys

This is unrelated to mining.
While the blockchain dos not contain the IP generating a transaction, non-standard nodes can store the IP they receive the transaction from. Probably it won't be the IP that actually created the transaction, but you can get close enough by listening to many many peers.
Blockchan.info lists here  the nodes they conect to. Currently the number is  about 100, but I have seen as much as 1400, i.e. a significant portion of the network.
Already with this little info, the can list things like this:
 ( Transactions that were relayed first by the ip 46.4.121.100 )
Setup 100 VPS around the world, put bitcoin nodes on them and commect to 1000 peers from each VPS. You get a very good idea to the IPs generating transactions. 
I'm pretty sure they are doing this already, it's simple, VERY effective and no privacy  problem

3) The "Banc de Bitcoin" logo is un-readable in the two smaller banners.

I don't see why you are considering buying BTCs through a friend..
It will add problems (how do you transfer the money to him? Have you considered all the fiscal and legal ramifications on large money transfers? ) 
It will add risks (you probably trust him a lot, so I won't cover that, but what if he dies? goes bankrupt? divorces ? ) 
If your money is in the UK, than it's already linked to your name. The bank knows this, the tax people know this, your accountant knows this etc. Moving money under a third-party's name is a bit shady, and when you do shady things with those large amounts of money the banks freak out.
Transferring money to the exchange is a delicate moment. Banks are known to stop transfers, close accounts etc. because of large transfers to known accounts. Imagine this happens to your friend when he makes the transfer, and he is asked questions about that money. 


He CAN'T pass all the due diligence, because the "due diligence" includes being asked "where does this money come from?" What do you think the bank will do when he tells them "the money is not mine, it's of a friend".... 
Transferring money on behalf of someone else???? That's shady as fuck, and expressely forbidden under AML laws.
I would do the following: 
- Open 5 accounts under your name at 5 different banks
- transfer to each bank abt 20.000 each
- transfer the money to the exchanges in smaller chunks (like, 5000 at a time), once a month
Re-reading your comments, I can add: UNLESS he hasn't yet paid for your business, and then he still has the money, and then he can say "the money is mine". ...

It depends on the time/skills at hand, but for your (relatively simple) needs I think the easiest (and not very solid way) is to:
1) create a content type "prisoner-page" with a text field to contain address, called for example  btcaddress
(enhancement: check that bitcoin address is a legal address)
2) create a custom template for the field. Basically, get the file called  /modules/field/theme/field.tpl.php , copy into your theme folder and rename it as field--field-btcaddress.tpl.php
Empty Drupal's cache
Now the field should be displayed by the custom (but un-modified so far) template.
more info  and 
Note: this will format the field when displayed in a page eg node/123456 . If you want to format the field in a view, the process is a bit different
3) Edit the template to display QR code instead of text, for example by using 
You should call it  somehow like this:
    $backColor = 0xFFFF00;
    $foreColor = 0xFF00FF;
    QRcode::png("bitcoin:".$address."?amount=".$amount, false, "L", 8, 0, false, $backColor, $foreColor);
let me know if you need further help
congrats in your project, but how are you going to protect yourself from scammers?
EDIT: a cleaner way, but a bit more code-oriented, would be to create a "bitcoin address" field type. See  and this tutorial

I think you could consider another option: have a paid App, and publish the the source code as a reference but NOT opensourcing it, while mantaining your copyright over it.
99% of the people will prefer just paying you that setting up the coding environment etc. to recompile.
There will be competitors partially stealing your code, but they'd have to make it illegally, and would not be able to say "free  version of onlyIknow's Bitcoin App".

All the Bitcoin network has at the moment 4.000.000 GH/s computing power.
And all the network together manages to solve a block in about 10 minutes.
Supposed you had a nice miner like [this one]( a 2.000 GH/s miner.
Your power would be 1/2.000 of the network. To solve a block you'd therefore need  2.000 times a much.
This means you would need about 14 days to solve it.
And the next difficulty adjustment would be after 2.016 blocks, that is about 75 years..

And that's just noticeable in the bitcoin world.
What would your father say to you next time (because it will sure happen) the price goes down 60-70% ?
What stress would that cause to your relationship?
Just to be on the safe side, I would:
- NEVER show them a log chart: people aren't used to reading them, they almost look "always up" charts, which we know isn't true
- highlight the speculative nature of many players in the BTC market
- FORBID them to keep BTC on their computers, unless they are  properly hardened, custom computers
- FORBID them to keep BTC in exchanges

During  a a few months and I'd randomly send 100.000 transactions with amounts between 0.1 and 1 bitcoins to the top 50.000 addresses. 
That would cost me around 25k bitcoins.  Who cares? Taint analisys, fuck yourself.
Meanwhile, I'd send about as many to be tumbled.
OR,  I'd have a tumbler coded. A free one. Every time someone tumbles their BTCs, a bit of mine get mixed with. OR I'd have a satoshidice looklalike that pays INSANELY, and use it as a tumbler.
After the tumbling, I'd collect again BTCs in many addresses, with small amounts (max 100 BTC).
When the dust caused by the random sending and the tumbling settles, these small addresses would be virtually un-traceable to the original ones.

Low fees aren't a good thing for banks. They CHARGE fees, and fees is what keeps them alive. 
They COULD adopt a blockchain-like mechanism, but there isn't a direct advantage for them.
Banks have the SWIFT network ( is an interesting read) that is a centralised network to communicate transactions.
It's true that, being centralized, it suffers from all sorts of the weaknesses that centralized stuff has (see the wiki page: they were forced by the states to cut Iran off SWIFT, there are huge privacy issues, the US even seized money that was being transferred between two EU entities...)
 
But that's a price banks WANT to pay. They have HUGE benefits form governments, by the way! Why should they jeopardize them with a tool that goes in the direction of being less controllable?
And anyway, If funds get seized, it's YOUR funds, not their. If your payments are slow it's YOUR problem, not theirs. If privacy is broken, it's YOUR data, not theirs.
Perhaps yes, abandoning SWIFT in favour of a blockchain would lower the fees. But YOU are paying the fees, not them!
TLDR: the advantages of a decentralized network aren't that palatable for banks.

One of the oldest coins ever made (so old they didn't even think to put anything on the back side of the coin), traded for bitcoins ... that really leaves me speechless.

The first verification of a transaction occurs when its included in a newly-mined block, NOT when it's transferred to "plain" nodes.
So no, your plan would not work.
The transaction is spread into the network pretty fast (a few seconds) and it's unverified. It then queues patiently until a miner finds a block AND decides to include your transaction.
Further verifications occur when OTHER blocks are mined after the one it was included. This adds security to the verification because the majority of the net should decide to "dispose" all those mined blocks (and do a fork of the blockchain)

Well, yes, that's what 1991's HTTP was (HTTP 0.9) 
See its specs here: 
At that point, there was 1 server and 1 browser on 1 operating system, so its specs could indeed be kept simple. 
But for the system to gain a wider acceptance across a larger base (of browsers, of OSes, and in the long run of users) we had to get to [HTTP 1.0]( in 1996, whose specs amount to 60 pages.
But its complexity or simpleness was not my point. On the contrary, my point was that HTTP, exactly like Bitcoin, was "a rather simple (therefore feasible) solution to a problem that had been around for a while without any convincing idea."
There, were other "things" before HTTP, just like there were other e-cash systems before XBT. And exactly as HTTP was seminal in the development of the usage on Internet between common people, Bitcoin protocol will be seminal in the not-so far away future.

it is theorically possible to fork the blockchain, manually patching it so that those coins belong to a known address.
Then, it would be to the miners to decide which version of the blockchain they could propagate: the one that destroys several hundreds thousand BTCs (thus making the other BTCs more valuable) or the one that revives those BTCs  
To put it simple, if you can convince the majority of miners, ANYTHING can be written in the blockchain.

The closest yoy can get to what you want:
Alice wants 1 BTC from Bob
Bob says "I'll pay you from address 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T"
Alice gives Bob a message "This is a payment from Bob to Alice !!! 101 LOL !!!"
Bob signs the message with the private key of address 1Jw.... and returns the address to Alice:
    -----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    This is a payment from Bob to Alice !!! 101 LOL !!!
    -----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----
    1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T

    -----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Alice verifies that the message is correctly signed, and gives an Ok to Bob
Bob sends the money
This can guarantee TO ALICE (but not necessarily to third parties) that the money is in effects coming from Bob, or from anyone acting on behalf of Bob.

Not an hypothetical question, a very serious one.
Another very simple technique would be to knowingly insert a "bug" in the random number generator, so that when the wallet generates a new address it's not a really random one  but one of a much smaller set.
This would make it quite easy to find the private key by brute force. 
An hypothetical case, instead of randomly selecting on of the  80.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 possible addresses, the program could select an address of a smaller set, for example 1.000.000.000.000 addresses.
The developer could then (rather) easily find the private key to all those addresses and get all the XBT
The only solutions are:
1) trust. Only use a wallet you really trust. This somehow goes against the "trustless" nature of bitcoin, but it can be done for not too large sums
2) open source. Only use open source wallets, where other coders can give a look at the internal working of the wallet and check it for odd behaviours.

HTTP stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", strictly speaking it doesn't "do" anything, as it's just a protocol i.e. a set of rules, specifically a set of rules two programs use for exchanging text (hypertext). 
In this case, one program is the Web server, and the other program is your browser.


Because there weren't any browsers :-)
They first decided what the HTTP protocol was, THEN they could write the first web servers and web browsers. 
HTTP is the protocol that stands behind the web, i.e. what makes it so that servers and browsers are able to talk. 
They invented in order to be able to see pages of text in a browser like this one: 
Over the years we have seen that the same  HTTP protocol was good to do gazillions of other stuff: watch videos, online games, MMORPG, instant messaging... practically EVERYTHING you are doing online (apart email, email was older and does not run on HTTP). 
Perhaps one day we'll stop using web pages at all, but we'll be using HTTP for other things!
In the same way, the Bitcoin Protocol (more specifically the blockchain) will change the next years. Perhaps Bitcoin will die sometimes, but the blockchain is there to stay.

I would use a Pi for off-line storage, with transactions signed via USB stick, and a Trezor-like device for online transactions.
Think it like this:
1) mobile app == your wallet (very easy to transact, only day-to-day cash, if you lose it's not a drama). 1000 transactions per month
2) trezor == your checking account  (more difficoult to transact, can access larger amounts). 10 transactions per month 
3) cold storage == your savings/investment (cumbersome to do transactions, does not matter) 1 transaction per month
And anyway, I'd use an old notebook rather than a Pi for cold storage.

Exactly the same problem applied to the first banknotes.
They  worked out that money behaves differently from other goods in an important way:
If I trade a cow of mine with two pigs of yours, and later it turns out you stole those pigs, those pigs aren't mine, I wasn't REALLY given them. It's called "[Nemo dat quod non habet]( (Nobody gives what he does not have)" doctrine.
If I trade the same cow for a banknote of yours, and later it turns out you stole those banknotes, those banknotes ARE mine. Legally speaking money is an exception to the "Nemo dat" doctrine
There is a landmark Scottish  case of 1749 (Crawfurd v. The Royal Bank) about this. Here you can find an interesting commentary to this case applied to Bitcoin, when Coinvalidation was thinking of doing EXACTLY what you are talking about (a commercial service mantaining alist of "clean" bitcoin):

There is ample consensus that this is not viable or legitimate with "ordinary" money (i.e. fiat currencies)
There was a landmark case in Scotland in XVIII Century (Crawfurd v. The Royal Bank, well contextualized [here]( ) 
This guy had two large banknotes stolen, BUT he had written down their numbers. He later  advertised that those two banknotes were stolen, and one of the notes turned up in possession of the Royal Bank.
it was determined that:


i.e. just the public knowledge that a certain bill has a criminal history does not make it less valuable, otherwise it would bo too easy to stop the functioning of money.
This applies very well to XBT and the public history in the blockchain. 
Of cource, IN PRACTICE it might very well happen that somewhere some judge says that this does not apply to Bitcoin because terrorists / paedphiles / libertarian scum.

FIRST THING, do not connect that laptop to the Internet.
THEN, do a backup of your wallet.dat file on a thumbdrive
Only then, run the bitcoin program, and use the dumpprivkey command to extract the private key from that wallet. The exact procedure will vary from the version of your software.
I'd suggest you to post again once you have the version of the bitcoin software you are running
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:14:11
yes, this is very important
if you import a private key in electrum, that private key is NOT restoreable via the seeds. 
Electrum says it quite clearly when you import keys, but frankly that is a bit scary. 
You might import a key, and how are you going to remember after a year that a single one of your addresses is not restoreable with seeds?
I think that electrum should rather NOT have an "import key" function.

1) The algorithms used by Bitcoin are very well known and rather standard. 
If they are flawed, it's because something inside them is flawed, and then a LOT of stuff would be flawed (things like https is broken too). 
There have been cases in the past where minor flaws emerged, and they were addressed without large disruptions in the system.
2) Other currencies. VERY VARIED OPINIONS THERE, of course. 
Surely in other cryptocoins (the so-called altcoins) there is a bit of "I want to be the smaller brother of Satoshi (and btw get a small fortune too)". On the other hand, they might have a marginal use (as an alternative to Bitcoin), like VISA and Mastercard, so to speak.
None of them seem to me superior (technically) to Bitcoin, IMHO, and the developers are usually far weaker.
A very important issue is pre-mining, an operation where a single entity mines all or part of the available "coins" for itself. This gives advantages to the entity, be it money (if the coin succeeds) or anyway control.
In case of Ripple, that's particularly bad, as 100% of Ripples are pre-mined by Ripple, they are giving some of them for free to start the circulation. Apart from many disadvantages that pre-mining gives (chances of inflation, centralized control over the currency etc.) I think it's particularly silly thing to do because of its PR effects. Nothing will stop the detractors from saying "You printed all these Monopoly money for yourself and now you want us to accept them as good"
It's like a fiat currency, but with trust placed on a company. I am an italian, and I don't particularly trust the US Gov., but I certainly trust their company less than Uncle Sam :-)

Yes, UNLESS you use the function "import private key" (e.g. you have a paper wallet and import its key in Electrum). In this case the address coming from the paper wallet is NOT restored with seeds (and you would lose those imported BTCs)
The correct procedure is to import the key somewhere else (maybe in another wallet) and then send the BTCs to one of your electrum addresses.
In this  case the  address  that was on the paper wallet is emptied, the BTCs go to an address that was already in electrum and the "restore from seed works"

this is my favourite analogy:
I pick up a grain of sand from any beach in the world, and throw it away. 
without knowing, you pick up a grain of sand and by chance the first grain you pick is the same grain!
then, I go on another beach in another country, and pick another grain
without knowing, you go there and pick up AGAIN on the first try you pick the same grain!
and then we do the same trick FOR THE THIRD TIME! IN A ROW!
that's (very very roughly)  how hard that is
grains of sand in the world: 7.5 * 10^18 
number of Bitcoin addresses = 2^160 = 10^48 
10^18^3 = 10^54,  that for this very approximate example I consider equivalent to 10^48

idea 1)
if you build an hardware wallet, integrate NFC in it.
You have an NFC card in your physical (leather) wallet, and any time you pay, you have to put the h/w wallet near to the leather wallet to authorize.
This would  work only up to a certain (programmable) amount, over that amount you'll need the NFC card and a PIN (or a PIN and a super-PIN in case you lose your NFC card)
idea 2)
a bidirectional wallet that allows to spend and receive BTCs as easily as possible.

you can do a paper wallet AND a brain wallet at the same time
for example, select an apropriate passphrase
NOT something like a phrase ("I am the super geek"), not even like some random words ("magnum flacon pignut reader vedaic") but somethink more complex like "h2DrsG hqaxfaj MzJSrTp 8ZVXCq d8Nn6HPw 5b8Jfk"
That's not a brainwallet in the meaning that it's easy to remember, but at least it's easier to type than a private key 
Then, use that string as a passphrase in bitaddress.org (as, always download it etc etc) 
Click on view, and youll' have an address like 1G8c6HZwQgv8D4fEZgnxveikNm9qbzNNkQ, a private key like 5KCSjA65qmmNHDnwfnGU9sVFiLmGBwz28SV5PPTzwpTnQUV1nrz and two QR codes.
that part can be printed, and it's a paper wallet. It does not have the fancy graphics, but it works.
One day, you can get your BTCs in both ways: scanning the private key QR or typing your passphrase in a program that supports it
and yes, by "offline" one usually means that the private key must be offline. Addresse etc. can be (and actually always is) online

you are talkig out of your ass..
the nice long number you quotes is 2^256-1, so what you are telling is that a 128-bit number is in the middle range of a 256-bit number 
Also: "rarely go out of bounds" Here we agree. a 128-bit number will rarely go out of bounds of a 256-bit number
plus, if there are 2^160 addresses, having a 2^256 seed would be useless

definitely possible, but not in the blockchain, and not according to the protocol.
your IP could be in theory stored by the first peers that get the transaction from you. Your clients connects to some "peers" , and when you send a transaction they are the ones that could store your IP.
 The fact is, you connect to very few nodes (like 20-100), and the total number of nodes is somewhere around 200.000 (   )
So, even if I was to try and use my Bitcojn-QT to setup a malicious node to capure IPs, I would only get a small fraction of the traffic to snoop on.
This does not mean it cannot be done: larger nodes can be setup that connect to MUCH more that 20-100  nodes, and not necessarily with evil intentions
blockchain.info, for example, is currently connected to 1400+ nodes: 
that's almost 1% of the network
In that list you have all the IPs of those nodes, some of them look like residential IPs, so POSSIBLY ordinary people with their clients
I will be masking some numbers here in order to make all this  less searchable, but try and follow me:
In that list, search for  83.191.64. You will see an IP starting with those digits, appearing to be a residential IP from sweden (c83-191-64-XXX.cust.tele2.se)
If you click on that IP you get to a page listing all the transactions that were relayed first by that IP. 
This does not necessarily mean that they were ORIGINATED from that IP, but just that they that IP was pretty close to the origin of those transactions.
Then, snooping a bit more, follow the list and look fortwo  LARGE transactions, over 4k BTC, search for 4,4 in the page
You can see that they have been done on nov 26th around 19:00 for quite similar amounts. It seems to me that at that IP there is a lucky bastard diw over 4k coins that is spending a bitcoin here and there, and what we see are change transactions.
So that IP was TWICE close to the source of that nice chunk of money. We start suspecting it's them.
 
Of cource, the picture isn't THAT clear, but consider we have done  all this with ZERO resources. 
Build a large enough network of large enough nodes, and you are able to collect a reasonable fraction of the network's transactions. Get 5% of the traffic, analyze it properly, and you get a good hint of originating IPs
So, I think it can be done, and therefore I am convinced that NSA is already doing that. 
sleep well!

bitcoin-qt starts with 100 addresses, so (for example) if you have BTC in an address you have 99 free ones.
One of theunused would get the change. So, vevn it you didn't backup the wallet afer the send, you'd be ok.
If you use all the 100 addresses, other ones are created, and yes, you'd need to backup the wallet again

Because this is like currencies work.
In the case of dollars, those "people" are the US gov. 
In the case of Bitcoin, it's other people.
In both case, abusing their power would "break the system", rendering the currency less valuable.
If the Us gov. devaules dollar (and this has happened before) what do they lose? Well, the US economy goes bad etc. etc.
Similarly, if the miners devalue Bitcoin, this would make their business model useless. They are making money, after all. And with massive adoption, miners will also earn transcation fees, i.e. the will have benefits from the success of Bitcoin.
In both cases, breaking the currency  is against their interest, that's simple.
And, generally, it is argued that the "distributed" nature of Bitcoin introduces a form of reciprocal control between miners.
This is not feasible with the dollar, as the gov. can decide on its own how many dollars should be printed.

Truecrypt: 
* open source (therefore can be checked) 
* multiplatform (Win Mac linux)
* free


it it's like 1NgTyRuxMAvH6fiXpdzjSLp8JisLX5yHaF (starts with 1) that's the address
private keys are like 5KSgPitpJ5QWAork7bbGo5GpHaoKfG9rx887ovWd4u6GYNaNZpV (longer and start with 5)
you generally don't see them looking at your wallet (they wouldn't be that private, would them?) but most wallet programs have a function to export them to a text file

can't pinpoint the hack, but must be something similar




How did you switch accounts? did you logout from hist wallet, and then login to yours? can you remember?
 




No, this must have been the "fake" wallet, not yours. these watch only accounts are the account used to show up a fake balance.


How the hell does this guy know your address?
I suspect it's part of the scam




perhaps this is the bait. your  session (??)  is now compromised and he'll be able to intercept your session (??)


exploited. Can't get the details, but it seems an exploit to me, perhaps of a blockchain vulnerability.

copying a prevous comment of mine:
let's assume that in the far future, there are 10 billion people using bitcoin
let's assume that all of them generate 10 new addresses per second, 24hrs a day
let's assume that this goes on for a million years.
think about hat: 10 billion people, generating 10 addresses per second for a million years ...
In that moment, if you were generate a new address, your chances of picking an already-used address would be of one in 24 millons of millions of millions millions
i.e. it would still be very very very very unlikley to happen.

a paper wallet is for long-term storage.
also: pay attention: if you spend SOME of the money that is in the paper wallet, probably the paper wallet will be empty, and the rest of your BTCs will be in another address
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:52:36
I see, we understood OP in two different ways
That's what I understood:
buys  @ 1150:
spends (e.g.) $1150,  has 1BTC
sells 
spends 1 BTC @ 850, has $850
buys 
spends $850, has now 0.894 BTC
Only when BTC goes back to 1285, his 0.894 BC will be equal to the $1150 he originally paid

does it actually says "vendors"?
elsewhere it's translated " financial institutions and payment institutions"...
I guess its a generic term, but is it a generic term that would include shops, restaurantes etc?

what seems to be the consensus, is that the value can be from 0 to a gazillion.
more specifically, it will probably be zero OR a gazillion, because if it hasn't become mainstream in 5 years it probably never will.
What is a gazillion?
Here I am just getting numbers outside of my ass, but my un-educated guess is somewhere between 10.000 and 100.000

actually, it's far less than that
imagine this story: 
I pick up a grain of sand, and throw it away. 
without knowing, you pick up a grain of sand and by chance IT'S the same grain!
then, I go on another beach in another country, and pick another grain,
without knowing, you go there and pick up AGAIN the same grain!
and then we do the same trick FOR THE THIRD TIME! IN A ROW!
that's (very very roughly)  how hard that is
grains of sand in the world: 7.5 * 10^18 
number of Bitcoin addresses = 2^160 = 10^48 
10^18^3 = 10^54,  that for this very approximate example I consider equivalent to 10^48

that's the basic idea of Bitcoin: a public ledger, shared between thousands of computers.
if it weren't public, it would have to be in a single, closed computer. Then it wouldn't be Bitcoin, it would be paypal. ie. it would be centralised, not de-centralised, and the "owner" of that computer could always take your maney away.
being shared and distributed, no-one can freeze your BTCs
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:55:05
yes, this is the simplest. Send ALL the total amount to a new address that you create on Multibit. 
All the old addresses will be emptied, wether they have been imported or not

Isit a coin, or is it a data storage?
The two things have quite opposite goals
Plus, one could easily use one function to DOS the other one.
I store a death threat to Obama on Facebook, and Facebook decides it's not worth it, it removes my post.
If it's in data coin, what can be done?
 
There are MANY countries where publishing certain information is illegal. For example, a joke on Muhammad would make the Datacoin illegal in several muslim countries 
It's enoght that someone stores in Datacoin the following:
1) Jokes on Muhammad
2) Criticism on Chinese Communist Party
3) Nazi propaganda
4) the SSN of some guys
and every node in Datacoin can have legal problem (if not death threats) in the majority of the world

exactly, that's the purpose of a brain wallet
a passphrase is just a an easy-to-read form of the private key
the address can be derived from the private key
for example, take a VERY simple passphrase as "perfume invisible"
type it into bitaddress.org
perfume invisible becomes private key "5KE681WheoXEDqgyJnMXH6cfMhahXTFYvcSxQ4CNeQk6nVKFQTL" and the corresponding address is 182ucd4PHDyTfn1NFCRBgYguodQhzDBnX4
as you can see:
that address once contained 0.01 BTC
as you know the private key (5KE681WheoXEDqgyJnMXH6cfMhahXTFYvcSxQ4CNeQk6nVKFQTL) if you can spend any amount that one day is deposited into that address
