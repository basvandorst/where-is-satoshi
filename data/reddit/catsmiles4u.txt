Calm down dude he’s exaggerating a tiny bit but he’s still right the symbol above won’t catch on it needs to be more simple and more easily distinguishable from the $

Yea and remember they pay pennies on the dollar for these fines compared to their profits on shady shit. It’s insulting to the tax payer but banks bought off the government with all that extra cash! Bankers need to adopt the former google phrase don’t be evil!

The more people that buy bitcoin the better. Right now it’s not a legitimate currency the price moves too quickly and xfers would be far to slow if the world at large all began using it. For these reasons businesses do not accept bitcoin atm
We are not ready for mainstream adoption as a currency yet. For now the more investors the better imo.

I don’t like it it’s a bit too similar with $ I think too many normies would be confused. Make it something more unique imo

I wouldn’t call it a centralized scam but bit coin is safer for sure. Greater risk greater rewards right. Just invest what you can afford to lose I guess. I believe in eth myself and see a bright future. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:50:08
That would be a mistake. remember bitcoin isn’t block chain. Bit coin only addresses block chain as a currency. Try to imagine the other areas of life that can b affected by block chain. 
If your selective and careful , the real moon shot exists in alts. That being said 95% are scams and even the non scams will most likely not succeed but it’s a gamble I’m willing to take. Eth would be my biggest one!

@_date: 2019-02-08 15:40:30
Your wrong because the technology is question is not bit coin it’s block chain in general. Even if bit coin does fail it would be no different than Netscape navigator going out of biz in the early dot come days. Block chain technology will 100% be here and change the world in 10 years. Might not be bit coin to be fair but people gotta stop confusing bit coin with block chain. Bit coin is just one example of block chain tech put to good use. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:23:43
Your assuming those crypto’s themselves are not scams and marketing hype. If what they say is true it’s great don’t get me wrong but when these companies promise you the moon and more  it makes me wonder....  if what you say is true your gonna make a killing on those coins. If not they will go to zero. It’s the same as owning any shit coin right, they promise a lot but can they actually come thru ?? 
Good example of this is cardano. Promises promises but yet irl it’s just vapourware and big talkin
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:49:38
Eth is the only one I’m actually confident in because it’s got so many dapps and developers and big companies interested. Anything under that to me a shot in the dark. 
I love btc but I’m not a maximalist for one main reason. Privacy. I don’t think people want their funds on a public ledger for everyone to view whenever they want. Especially not those doing well. Talk about putting a target on your back right, all they gotta do is home invade you and take your Trezor once they know your sitting on 1500 btc. I worry it will be replaced by something more innovative and less reliant on centralized mining figures...

@_date: 2019-02-10 00:36:39
Yes this is true and very possible. Bit coin is only the currency of block chain atm. Many competitors but no one even nearly close. Even if eth somehow over took btc it wouldn’t be used as a currency. Xrp just makes me wanna vom lol
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:58:30
Telling friends and family about crypto is lose lose. When it’s going up they will fomo buy and subtly blame you later cuz they never sold. When it’s down and out (like now) crypto is dead and a giant scam so they will wait for 30k to fomo buy and get rekt again haha. I been there guys, I no longer mention it unless they ask me directly for my thoughts.

Yes but your arguing to dump the alts because new alts are promising to end all the other alts lol it’s a catch 22
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:42:56
It’s common sense dude any technology that’s threatening to change the world will take time for people to accept. It will have its ups and down. If your bullish on blockchain tech then this bear markets doesn’t phase you. There’s zero danger of me dumping my btc bags bro. That’s his point

Lol root stock was just another ico making huge promises you know that right ? 
Yes they had a private pre sale. 
Yea it requires its own token. 
So when the alt coin killer is itself an alt coin I can’t help but mega super ultra eye roll
edit oh and one more thing. The ultra centralized root stock foundation takes 20% cut from all transactions for “processing fees” hmmmm no other legit coin does that.  Smells like a scam to me sir. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:41:25
This sounds like a cynical former moon boy whose bags are in the dumps and therefore crypto is a scam and cannot possibly recover lol.

It’s easy to interpret what he’s saying as btc is valuable because people SEE it as stable and he compared it to gold. The price of gold is extremely stable compared to btc.

They made a statement that the rest would be sold at private auction and no it doesn’t effect price.  private auctions normally sell well below market price as one person has to step in and buy the entire lot usually. It doesn’t effect price unless the buyer turns around and dumps it all on the open market at a staggering loss which isn’t gonna happen. 
If your worried about coins hitting the market maybe worry about satoshis 1m btc stored away. Imagine he sold!

Well maybe your right but I don’t think it’s as big a deal as some suspect. No ones gonna market sell 160k btc it would be at 1 cent by tomorrow.

Aren’t they selling the rest at private auction ? Aka not on the open market.

They played a part but this is just a regular market cycle imo. See the Wall Street cheat sheet it’s playing out exactly. I think we’re in accumulating stage now although some would argue still capitulation.
