Other posts were field tests. This is the launch. Minor changes made since. Beyond this I'll be using sponsored ads, so don't worry xxx

Think of it like /b/ ... nobody wants that smell hanging around forever.
Plus users may be wanting to fish for coin, when enough has been spent on the site a worker process splits up the coin into some "Gold Blocks".
You may spend 0.01 btc and end up with 2 btc back...
The pricing is entirely linear, and perhaps that is a mistake. 
I wanted to channel money from serious advertisers towards casual users.
That was the idea, anyway.

This is not "spam", if this post is to be removed (again) I'd appreciate a response from a mod subsequently. It was hardly even given a chance before being taken off the subreddit.
This project, the result of a single developer working away in the background of full-time work for the last 9 months or so, intends to provide a fun method for people to advertise their services, additionally it pays money towards charity... and back to lucky users...
Constructive criticism welcome.

It doesn't matter if it fails. I've learned a lot in making it, has been a hobby project.
The intention is to give back also, so I'm not sure how this qualifies as spam to be honest.

It's a little more advanced than the examples you have given...

The motivation behind this is to take an old and tired idea and breathe life into it... adding some inspiration from the ideologies surrounding Bitcoin.
I also built just about every aspect of this by hand. It is a one man operation. I didn't feel I could/should ask too much so block expiration allows for people to spend accordingly.
The Million Dollar Homepage was a success because of traffic, if people see high clickthrough rates then it has value for advertisers.
They might not want to pay beyond the lifetime of the hype any media coverage might generate.

Thanks dbug.
This /is/ an innovation to some extent. I would say, but I'm biased.
Rebrand is definitely an option.
I wanted this to end up as the bastard child if you crossed "The Million Dollar Homepage" and 4chan's /b/ ...
I've posted on bitcointalk so if anyone wants to continue discussion there...

Open to comments, criticism and suggestions.
I want to create a space for people to have fun, post random things or advertise their own enterprises.
Also want to bring about more awareness of the charitable applications of Bitcoin, the site sends out money to charities when the reserve balance exceeds a threshold.
Current charities are:
Sean's Outpost - 1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd
IndySci.org - 1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd
Bitcoin 100 - 1BTC1oo1J3MEt5SFj74ZBcF2Mk97Aah4ac
Once a payout has been made it will be visible from the link in the about panel.
Blocks appear in real-time, as do updates to click/view and  stats. Payment processing also pops up notifications when money is received and confirmations are made.
When blocks are purchased we also take a slice of the funds and place them as hidden "gold blocks" which may be won by anyone who hits them. Once enough of them are on the grid it should be possible to earn by playing on the edges, the hope is that this is a fun element of the site.
Spent the last 9 months or so working on this as a solo/hobby project, and am very open to making modifications as suggested by the community.
