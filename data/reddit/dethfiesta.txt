Basically -- people cashing out of a speculative bubble to sell their BTC to the next guy.  Just like I did.  I created my first wallet in January 2010 but didn't own any BTC until summer of 2013.

Gimme the high-level overview.  Also -- is Dixon heavily invested in BTC?  Is he a disinterested expert observer?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:51:36
None of that answers my question at all. 


What system?  Bitcoin does not operate in the same monetary space.  Nobody wants to do business in a deflationary currency for two reasons:
1) A Credit system denominated in a deflationary currency will not work.  GO ahead and show me where I can borrow some BTC.
2) Nobody wants to spend a deflationary currency because it is not rational to do so.  THis is why commerce denominated in BTC is pathetically tiny compared to the USD value of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:04


Cool.  So where do I sign up for a loan in BTC?


Wrong.  Read Graber's "Debt: The First 5000 years." And of course, even Gold Coins are FIAT -- given that their value is specified by the King and not by PM content.


*Excessive* credit?  What does *excessive* mean?


So, when prices were lower, there was less debt?  Debt is directly relatd to prices?  THat's cool -- demonstrate that relationship and go ahead and collect your Nobel Prize.
Go ahead and look at the 70s -- Massive inflation, household debt as percentage of GDB remained largely unchanged.


So where are people investing BTC right now?  Because all I see is people SELLING BTC to buy USD and then invest that.  "Investment" in BTC just means buying the speculative token and holding on to it, to sell it later at a profit denominated in USD.


Gee?  Why would people hoard money during a financial crisis?  LOLOLOLOL.  Do you really think the ONLY variable in play on that chart is the amount of money circulating?

What evidence can you cite that the lack of a credit market in BTC is due to lack of adoption?  You didnt nake an argument, just a claim.
Gold isnt deflationary, it is inflationary.  The total amount of available gold increases every year by a few percent.  I grew up in Gold Mining country.  I know people actively digging Gold out of the Earth right now.
Tuition has increased with the decrease in state and federal spending per student.  Loans are created to make up this shortfall.  You have the causality exactly backward here.  Real estate was a better argument for you.


LOL.  Nope.
Money hoarding in a crisis was predicted by Keynes -- the tragedy of thrift.  And yes, bad Keynesianism (giving all the money to banks) is bad economics.  But the response to the crisis did work to some degree, though it could've been better managed of course.


No, because the economy has revitalized and spending has increased.

Well, if the government can't get your BTC they can still make you financially responsible for the amount of BTC you owe.  I think, as the article points out, that because there is a VERY strong incentive for any actor to tell the government who they sent the BTC in question to then they will enjoy a high success rate in clawing back any BTC that are owed due to a blanket lien some time far back in the ownership chain for those coins.

If that's true, then it isn't a coin, it is a speculative token.

Yes, but credit cards are just another way to pay with Dollars.  Dollars are government IOUs which they redeem by discharging your tax obligation with them.
This article is 100% correct.  No government would ever be insane enough to allow people to pay their taxes in anything not denominated in the state's currency.  Indeed, the universal tax obligation denominated in USD is precisely what drives the continued acceptance of USD in the US economy.  Taxes drive money because they create demand for that particular unit of account.

Thanks friend, and I understand your caution.  A word of advice that I am sure others have also given you:  diversify beyond silver and gold, keep at least some savings in USD.  Precious metals have crashed in the past and they will do so again.  Of course, if there is economic turmoil then the value of silver gold will certainly increase.  I also keep some precious metals, but more as an investment than as insurance as you seem to be doing.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:27:29
Simply not true.
There is an unending supply of US Dollars -- they are created out of thin air, at will, by the US Government.  Now, if too many are created, then inflation occurs (and no, printing a single dollar does not lower the value of all others in a soft money system).  
But what is too many dollars? Simply more than there are good and services (plus desire to save) to be chased by those dollars.  This means that the only limits to Government deficit spending are real limts: the amount of goods and services being produced by the economy.
The debt could be paid off tomorrow: it is denominated in US dollars, and the government can summon as many dollars it likes at any time.  The holders of US debt DONT WANT IT PAID OFF, because US Debt comes in the form of interest-bearing securities.  US Debt is PURCHASED AS AN INVESTMENT by others.  The real question is, why does the government auction debt at all?  It certainly does not need to issue treasuries to raise money -- it already has an unlimited supply for money.
 And thank you for pointing out that the link was bad (it worked for me).  [Here is the source for the image I tried to link] (  I am referring to the red, blue, and green chart.  What this image shows is the balance for each sector of the US Economy over the last 60 or so years.  You can see clearly that the rate at which private sector dollar-denominated wealth grows is equal and opposite to the government balance at the same period.  Because the US Govt is the source of all dollars (as USD's sole issuer) and because the US Government spends all dollars into existence, the private sector balance can only increase if there is a trade surplus or a government deficit.  When the government budget is balanced, private sector wealth declines because we have a trade deficit.  When the government budget is positive (more revenue than spending) private sector wealth in the US DECLINES.  This is historical fact.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:23:05
Well, no.  
1) The history of money does not play out like you say.  See "Debt: The First 5000 Years"
2) QE isn't actually money printing.  It creates zero net financial assets.  I think you are just parroting what you've heard the media and other people say.
3) Hyperinflation?  Not likely.  Cato institute (a hard-right Think Tank) did a study of the world's known instances of hyperinflation, like 48 of them or so.  They found that none, NONE, occurred purely through money printing.  There must always be a demand shock, like there was in the Weimar Republic and in Zimbabwe.  I've been hearing libertarians scream about hyperinflation for more than 20 years now.  It hasn't happened.  It ain't gonna happen.
4) Interest payments on the debt would be a total non-issue if Congress didn't have the idiotic debt ceiling.  You see, the US Government and all governments that use a sovereign, fiat currency, are not revenue constrained.  What's more, government deficit spending is THE ONLY SOURCE of net new dollars.  This means that, as has been demonstrated, the size of the budget deficit is THE EXACT SAME SIZE as the growth in private-sector wealth over the same period.

Ah, this old chestnut.  The Bitcoin whitepaper makes it clear: it's simply about removing the need for trust from currency transactions, the decentralized network is simply an efficient and effective way of achieving that end.  You've mistaken the means for the end, as so many continue to do.  I think this is because it was libertarian and anarchist circles that first saw the potential of these currencies so most folks were introduced to the topic from within this milieu.

@_date: 2014-04-07 20:34:14
1) You didn't.  This is a gap in your analysis.  A BTC-denominated credit market will most certainly be a high-interest credit market.  This is a major impediment to the creation of any kind of crypto credit market since it makes that market less competitive than fiat credit (where interest rates are typically much lower).
2) Lol.  Simply not true.  When Bitcoin rises in value vs. fiat, it makes a huge difference.  When Bitcoin rises in value vs. fiat, it also rises in value vs. goods and services.  In a magical world where all banking is done in BTC (and is hence all full-reserve) an increase in the value of BTC means an increase in the value of your debt-burden.  Having income in BTC doesn't help, it's part of the problem in such a situation.  Say you provide goods or services in exchange for BTC, if BTC rises in value you will be being paid less BTC (since each BTC is worth more of your goods/services) for the same work/items and yet your debt burden is the same.  Yeah, a smaller amount of income isn't a problem for paying your rent or feeding yourself, since that BTC buys more, but it is a big problem for servicing your BTC debts.  So, in a deflationary BTC-denominated credit market, anyone who took on debt in BTC is going to have a bad time.  Debt denominated in a deflating currency is a nightmare regardless of whether it is fiat or crypto.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:44:39
I've had a chance to read this (mercifully) brief paper.  Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
I think the data here is useful in many contexts, but probably not so for BTC.  As the authors state: 
"This study simply characterizes the relation in the raw data between deflation and output growth, with no attempt to control for anything, like the type of monetary regime or the extent to which the deflation was anticipated."
BTC is an interesting case -- since it is not a national currency, it is something that people can hoard indefinitely, as they will use their (inflating) national currencies to purchase necessities while their (deflating) BTC sit unused. 
Furthermore, the authors state "Here we have made no attempt to distinguish anticipated from unanticipated deflations, while theory, of course, makes a sharp distinction."  Deflation is not only predicted in the BTC economy, it is mandated by the code itself (which, I think, points to BTC as being the MOST centralized currency ever, with one man setting all the rules for BTC long ago).
I wish the authors had gone into the differences that the theory predicts between anticipated and un-anticipated deflation.
One thing more -- deflation is a two-way street.  Deflation causes hoarding, but hoarding can also cause deflation, which muddies the analytical waters a bit.  This paper is looking at instances of Deflation inducing depression, but depression can also cause deflation.
All in all, this was an interesting read, but I don't think it is too germane to the discussion at hand.

I'm cool with bit-barons -- it has a negative connotation, like the Robber barons of old.  It also has an air of aristocracy about it, which is fitting.  Almost everyone who is wealthy in bitcoin is sitting on un-earned wealth, just like the fiat-currency rentiers.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:33:44
Yes, the network effect certainly makes BTC more valuable, but I think you are stretching the definition of "earned income" -- if spending a few BTC constitues "work" that has "earned" a fabulous increase in wealth, then what do you call wages from actual labor, "well-earned income" perhaps?

Nothing detrimental about price increases unless that price increase is permanent and ongoing.  When it is permanent and ongoing, hoarding is the most rational thing to do.  Hoarding reduces liquidity and reduces sales. Reduced liquidity and sales means a crappy economy.
When did I propose fractional reserve banking in BTC?  You are right, the credit market for BTC would be full-reserve.  And you can have a credit system without fractional reserve banking, except that that won't happen in BTC since no one will be dumb enough to borrow.

Rich people don't let wealth pour through their fingers.  If anything, the wealthy are often the most rational with their finances.
If the BTC wealthy had a steady income of new BTC that exceeded their spending, I agree that they would spend it lavishly.  But the vast majority of Bitcoin Barons became bit-wealthy in the early days when getting new BTC was relatively easy.
Thanks for your input, but I had already considered your position and I don't think it solves the deflation/hoarding problem in the BTC economy.

Yeah, hyperinflation sucks.  Why are we even discussing this?
If Bitcoin is supposed to blossom into a fiat-replacing currency, there would need to be a credit system.  If someone wants to start a BTC-denominated business, wouldn't they at some point need a BTC loan?  You'd have to be insane to borrow BTC right now.
Can you please address hoarding and deflation?  That's where this discussion started.

No, I mean in terms of the colloquial use of the term "earned."  I'm saying that BitCoin barons is an excellent name because it connotes aristocratic, unearned wealth.  I think that many folks, myself included, cannot claim (with a straight face) to have "earned" their BTC wealth.

This was interesting as a discussion of the possibilities for BTC to disrupt existing payment systems markets, but ultimately the author failed to rebut the Atlantic.
The Atlantic described it as the Segway of *currencies*, but this author is entirely focused on BTC as a *technology platform*.  The Atlantic made excellent points in regards to the deflationary bias and hoarding in the BTC ecosystem, and these points make a good case for considering BTC a soon-be-failed *currency*.  Nowhere, anywhere in the entire article, does this author discuss the viability of BTC as a *currency*.

Ahh yes, I see what you are saying, quite true.
That being said, Bitcoin is also a fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:24
I also do not think it has a strong future as a widespread currency.  I think it will continue to be used in pockets, but that is all.
This is an extremely unpopular opinion on this subreddit, but I stick to it:  The "feature" that most BTC users think makes it awesome is actually its Achilles heel -- the low rate of inflation.
Once more new goods and services are available to purchase in BTC than there are new BTC coming into existence (or, to put it differently, once the ratio of Goods and Services denomiated in BTC to new BTC entering circulation gets too large) then deflation starts to kick in.  BTC prices must head lower in order to make any sales, and this means that the purchasing power is continuously increasing.  This incentivizes sellers to no longer sell for BTC and also encourages hoarding behavior among BTC users.  A currency that no one is willing to spend (due to its increasing value) doesn't have alot of future as a currency.
BTC, on the other hand, is an excellent speculative vehicle.  Make some money while you can.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:46:02
Fiat currency came first:  tally sticks, debts and credits on clay tablets, etc.  The idea that fiat replaced commodity money (and that both replaced barter) is false -- they have been swinging back and forth for millenia. True barter economies have never been found to exist anywhere in the history of the world, except between strangers and enemies.  See [this book] ( for all the details you could ever want on the historical evolution of money.
I'm not sure that you can claim with any kind of accuracy at all that gold has gotten more and more valuable over the millenia.  How do you determine this?  Gold was perfectly useless and had zero value in many cultures over the millenia. 
The 19th century growth spurt had little to do with the monetary system -- it had more to do with the fact that the US multiplied in size and population.  Hoarding was not an issue for the population during any point during the gold standard, since the govt was already hoarding the vast majority of available gold, so arguing that 19th century growth disproves that hoarding is a problem simply doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:26:47
I don't think I agree entirely.  If you look at the data, government spending as a fraction of GDP was growing consistently well before the end of the gold standard.  [See here] (
Yes, inflation is a kind of "stealth tax" but it is really the cost of a functioning economy.  And besides, inflation wasn't any better under the gold standard either [See here] (
I would greatly prefer to see an inflationary economy than a deflationary one.  Bitcoin, in my humble opinion, is doomed by its deflationary bias.  It can never succeed as a currency because it will continue to increase in value, making hoarding BTC the only sensible move.  If everyone hoards their BTC, the BTC economy never takes hold, and people flee the currency once they realized it is doomed by deflation.
This is Keynes' "paradox of thrift" in action. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:45:28
Interesting.  Can you explain further?
Seems to me that imputing "desires" to an economy is a difficult thing: a economy does not have monolithic desires, so who does the "deeming worthy enough" ? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:56:09
Bitcoin has a powerful deflationary bias, meaning that BTC users have a powerful hoarding incentive.  This means that sales in BTC will always be disappointing, since people generally do not buy anything in BTC today when they could buy more of it tomorrow with the same amount of BTC.
I've said it before and I'll say it again -- deflation is a huge problem for bitcoin, and yes, it is a worse problem than inflation.
If bitcoin had any appreciable amount of inflation  then people would actually be spending it.  If people were spending large volumes of BTC at existing merchants, new merchants would pile in to the BTC economy.
As it stands, each new merchant that enters the BTC economy only makes the deflation problem worse (additional goods chasing the same amount of BTC).  I fail to see how BTC escapes this cycle.  Someone enlighten me.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:19:39
You have always been able to escape from Fiat.  Where I live, I exchange fiat currency for groceries, guitars, real estate, etc.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:26:54
Are you crazy?
I live in Gold mining country (NV).  My father and brother are gold miners, and my hometown is a gold-mining boom town that has boomed and busted twice in my lifetime.  Gold has experienced ENORMOUS price swings throughout it's history.  Speaking like it has experienced a long, steady increase in value is just plain false.  
And actually, people WERE hoarding gold during times when that asset was appreciating.  I did it myself, so did everyone in my family.  My folks continue to hoard their gold. I got out of precious metals years ago and made quite a nice return.
Gold standards and gold-fixed exchange rates have collapsed time and time again throughout history.  The hard-money folks like to talk about how every fiat currency that ever existed has failed, but you can say the same for every currency that has fixed it's value to gold.  
But ultimately, your analogy just doesn't hold.  Comparing an asset-backed currency's backing asset to BTC doesn't make much sense.  BTC has no backing asset, it is not a backing asset itself.
How bout this:  I'll gladly sell you all of my BTC for your USD on the day I decide that the deflationary deflection point is upon us.  If I'm right, I'll make some money.  If you're right, you'll make some money.  Sound good?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:21:34
"On the international market..."
But not in the US.  Hence, with the price of gold not rising there was not enough hoarding to impact anything.  But, the analogy between hoarding 19th century gold and hoarding BTC today doesn't hold anyway, so the point is moot....but you can see that I was right on this particular point.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:07:18
So what is it?  Is AU a currency or merely an asset-backing a currency?  You choose different definitions depending on the context and this makes your analogy weak.
People didn't hoard gold in the 19th century America because it had a fixed price (duh).  That's basically the opposite of BTC, but you claim a solid analogy.  Weird.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:00:39
Dude.  I already told you:  it had no impact.  The price of gold was fixed as a way to back the currency, no?
People didn't hoard much gold in the 19th century, because it wasn't a deflating currency.  Had the dollar been deflating during that time, you would see hoarding behavior.
Calling gold a currency when no one was using it as a currency, just as the backing to a currency, is fallacious.

@_date: 2013-11-20 19:28:27
But, widespread adoption is the problem -- the rate at which adoption increases will always surpass the rate of new coins, meaning that deflation will be a permanent issue.
I don't understand what you mean when you say "should eventually be priced in a way that is much more stable." Given that deflation is a permanent feature of the expanding BTC economy, pricing will always be moving (on average) in an upward direction.  Meaning that hoarding behavior will always be the norm for BTC users.
We see this happening today, bitcoinshop.us has [stated publicly] ( that they saw sales decline by 20% in the past week -- and this is in the middle of a growing BTC ecosystem!  What kind of economy sees declining sales amidst a boom in adoption? One plagued by deflation.
And you certainly won't need to worry about debt traps in the deflation-plagued BTC economy - anyone dumb enough to go into BTC-denomiated debt in a deflating economy probably isn't smart enough to even be using BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:19:59


Hoarding is based on future expectations.  If prices in BTC are falling (deflation) why buy something today when you can get more of it tomorrow?  
And because people are not now, and are not likely in the future, to purchase their necessities with BTC, I find it unlikely that grocery and rent payments will keep the BTC economy humming along.
You are exactly right about interest rates.  People's desire to take a loan at interest in a deflating currency will be extremely muted.  You'd probably be better off taking a load in USD and converting the funds into BTC.  Except in corner cases, I do not see there being any significant credit market in BTC.
On the whole, I think we agree on fundamentals but disagree on the degree to which deflation is a problem (which you pointed out in your first reply).
For me, it all boils down to this: we've already mined about 57% of all possible BTC, but I think it is fair to say that the amount of goods and services available for purchase in BTC is, perhaps, .00001% of total possible goods for sale.  This means that the future growth of users is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the possibility of future BTC in existence.  Deflation in BTC will only get -- can only get -- more extreme.
Nice chatting with you.

You guys are crazy.  Keynes was a towering genius.

“Keynes’s intellect was the sharpest and clearest that I have ever known. When I argued with him, I felt that I took my life in my hands, and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool. I was sometimes inclined to feel that so much cleverness must be incompatible with depth, but I do not think that this feeling was justified.”

OK, I get what you are saying -- that the risk of investing early in a speculative enterprise justifies the profits made from that speculation.  That's what everyone else has been telling me too.  But the amount of risk, for many of us, was incredibly small.
What I am saying is this -- the BTC that I mined back in 2009 that were only worth pennies are now worth thousands of dollars.  I wasn't risking anything except the electrical costs and opportunity costs of not using my video card for certain periods of time.
All told, my "risky" investment of maybe about $5 reaped profits orders of magnitude greater than any other "investment" available today.  I work for a living, so this money, to me, feels greatly "unearned."

I'm not saying that people will flee BTC because of deflation directly, just the opposite!  People hoard a deflating currency.  I'm saying that Bitcoin has no future as a currency because hoarding is the default, rational behavior of BTC users, and an economy that lacks sales, isn't any kind of functioning, growing economy.

Yes, but there was never, with either USD or gold,a time when you can say that "this currency will continue to increase in value as long as new users adopt the currency."  You CAN make that statement with BTC.  Analogy crumbles.

The "paradox of thrift" is an economy-wide concept, can you explain how you see it functioning in the tech sector?
We are way past the "early adoption" phase of BTC.  More than 50% of all BTC that will ever exist already exist and are in the hands of users.  As more people get excited by BTC and want to use it, the number of people and goods and services chasing BTC increases, but the number of new BTC available to them gets increasingly smaller.  This drives a permanently increasing price -- BTC will never find a "true value" as long as new users are entering the BTC economy.
A person may have all the Bitcoin in the world, but that DOES NOT mean they will spend it.  Because, of course, everyone who has gold and BTC also has USD, which they spend freely, while hoarding their deflating assets.
You can absolutely hoard BTC forever, since every single BTC user on earth is already fully-invested in some other currency.

Very few people will make purchases online with BTC while they are deflating. They will always be deflating.
This is also true of travel, real estate and luxury goods, as well as mainstream retail.

@_date: 2013-12-04 17:55:32
No, your summary of my position is flat wrong.  I am saying that vendors will be glad to accept it, but that no one wants to spend any BTC today since they will be worth more tomorrow.  In an economy of a deflating currency, sales will be lackluster relative to the size of the economy.  Any vendor selling things for BTC today better also be accepting other currencies, since they won't be making many sales in BTC.
Remember: merchants hate offering discounts.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:17:27
Yes, I'm aware of the benefits of bitcoin, and they are substantial.  However, none of these advantages solve the issue of deflation and the hoarding it induces.
It isn't hard to see -- as the rate of new BTC creation slows, the actual adoption of BTC is increasing at the same time.  This is a recipe for a spiking price, and when prices are spiking, no one who is rational will spend their BTC.  An economy without spending isn't really an economy at all.

@_date: 2013-11-13 16:12:46
Yes, I think you are absolutely right, but that's precisely when the spectre of deflation starts haunting Bitcoin.
The number of goods and services for sale in bitcoin will increase at a fast pace, while the creation of new Bitcoin will move slower and slower.  This will cause prices denominated in bitcoin to fall (deflation) encouraging hoarding behavior among bitcoin owners and discouraging sellers from selling for bitcoin.  
I think the fate of Bitcoin is an enormous spike in users and value, followed by a slow and steady death by deflation-induced heading for the exit. Anyone who manages to sell their holdings to a bigger fool at this point will have done well.

This is an extremely common attitude, and it is rational from the perspective of the individual (you).  However, hoarding your BTC helps to hasten the inevitable death of bitcoin through deflation.
What we are seeing is straight outta Keynes -- the "paradox of thrift."
Everyone wants to save their bitcoin since they are rising in value.  Everyone saving means no one is spending.  No one spending BTC means vendors that accept BTC will reconsider their choice to accept BTC.  No vendors accepting BTC means that BTC as a currency reverses its trend of wider adoption.  Dwindling adoption means an eventual crash in BTC prices, meaning all the savers lose the value they were trying to protect.

Ha!  Yeah, you may be right, but "use value" and "inherent value" are related -- people use them nearly interchangeably, which. But I would dispute that Bitcoin is valuable simply because it is comprised of non-random strings of bits, which most certainly does exist elsewhere -- there are now dozens of alternative cryptocurrencies.
The value that Bitcoin has comes from it's story, the romantic narrative of a scrappy, young currency sticking a thumb in the eye of the big man.  This is a seductive idea, and lots of people will make lots of money speculating in this, but I don't think Bitcoin has a serious future as currency except in the dark pockets of the world.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:53:38
I was responding to the previous commenter.
Speculation and spending are at odds: speculation depends on a "buy and hold until the price is right then sell" mentality, this means that the majority of the world's BTC are sitting unused in wallets while their owners watch the value of their wallet increase.  People who actually want to use the currency are impacted by this:  hoarding a currency that is increasing in demand reduces the amount available for trade, increasing its price.  Increasing BTC value induces hoarding, which induces higher BTC value (as long as new people are demanding BTC), which induces hoarding, which induces higher BTC price.  This vicious circle continues until a mass realization occurs -- BTC is mostly useful as a speculative asset, not as a currency.
Let's imagine for a moment that it is the year 2040.  The last BTC ever to be produced has entered into circulation.  BTC is popular and enjoys world-wide use.  What happens next?  The world economy continues to grow, and yet the same number of BTC still exist.  Obviously, the value of BTC rises.  It will continue to rise, since there will always be an increasing # of users (population growth) chasing a fixed number of BTC.  At this point, hoarding is the most rational move (just as today).  The worldwide economy in BTC crashes, as BTC-denominated merchants find that even though their BTC-denominated prices continue to fall, sales are still disappointing.  At some point, people realize that a permanently-deflating currency cannot be used in any meaningful way as a currency, since no one wants to fork something over that is increasing in value.
TL;DR: deflation is built into BTC.  Deflation causes the price of BTC to rise.  Rising prices incentivizes hoarding behavior, which reduces sales.  An economy without adequate sales is not an economy which will survive.

And just because barter occurred, which it did, doesn't mean that there were ever any barter-based economies.  There were not.
And yes, the Chinese invented paper money, but much earlier than that, in Babylon and elsewhere, money was fiat -- it was merely entries on a clay tablet or a mark on a stick.
Fiat currency and commodity money existed side by side in antiquity.  Anthropologists and historians have known this for more than a century, economists tend to stick to Adam Smith's fairy tale of barter coming first, then commodity money, then fiat.
New supplies are not the only explanation for dips in gold price.  If you assume that the value of asset-backed currency is related to supply (the amount of gold available), then you must admit that demand can also influence price.  Gold price fluctuation has alot to do with demand.
