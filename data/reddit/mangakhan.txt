Only BTC from legal activities accepted.

Nope. It's a 300% increase :-p

This is the most interesting outcome of the test for me!

I fully support your move. Nevertheless I think the main obstacle is that most users are behind a local network (your router) and have no idea on how to forward port 8333. Have this issue solved and you will see many more nodes popping up.

Why not switch direction of color codes -&gt; higher values tend to be in red, smaller values in green. So in case you intended to send a small amout to someone but chose millibits instead of microbits your number would appear screaming red instead of green (or something like that).
Also, if you shift by just one decimal point, the difference in appearance is very small.

I think it's the other way round.
In a Pyramid Scheme you only get your investment back, if you can convince enough people on the next level to do the same, which obviously fails at a certain point and leaves most people short on their investments. With this approach you can only gain more. If you are at the last level, you will only get less than those successfully spreading the word. No one is loosing money. The intension I have in mind is to increase reach.
If you refer to it spreading exponentially up the a certain point, then I totally agree:-)

I like your idea.
How about this? Send some more bitcoins to those new fans if they can prove they sent some of it to another new fan. This way they have an incentive to spread the word even more.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:01:00
That's the spirit!

If I was OP, I wouldn't change my mind;-)

I don't find any information on "one button to bitcoin". Can you explain for us what that concept refers to? Do you mean acquisition of BTC or payments?
I second your take on developers. In reality they try to write the perfect and most elegant code, which is important when it comes to security but certainly is not ideal if there is something to promote. The goal is to find a good compromise between the two extremes.

10 shares = 1 BTC
Does that change your sentiment?
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:19:21
Thanks for the insight!

Trying to think out of the box: What if HE is/worked for an organisation like a central bank that wants to secure a big chunk of a future reserve currency if national currencies are going down the drain?

The alert system was put in place as an ultimate mean of communication in a there-is-no-other-way situation. If I remember correctly it was implemented after there was an unsuspected hard fork and is not intended as just another communication channel. Ideally you never want to use it at all. So I guess unless hell breaks loose one will stick with other communication channels.

Plot twist: they already did, now holding 1.000.000+ in BTC :-p
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:51:23
Plot twist - they go out of business

I believe it will be confused with the dollar sign in real life hand writing and hence make things worse.

The bounty is high enough yet nobody has claimed any so far.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:51:42
I see your point, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:19:06
Isn't that an attack vector after all? Some malicious software could count on lazy people not adjusting their signalling to gain a certain percentage of (unintended) support? The question would be if you would be able to distribute your malicious software to enough miners before they realize it?

I guess this is due to fraud attempts. They only pay the party they know most about.

I heard you can *always* buy Bitcoins for 10 bucks, no matter the price :-)

I tinkered with [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](
Download the HTML page locally and make sure you are offline (always suspect it to call home). Keep a copy of the HTML page at any party - you want the very same version for reconstruction of the secret.
Create a secret message with either instructions on how to gain access to your coins (passwords, keys, locations etc.) or anything else. Split your secret into e.g. 3 of 5. This will ensure you will need a minimum of 3 share to reconstruct the secret.
Send two to your loved one (or 1 for your spouse and 1 for someone else), keep two for yourself. The fifth you can send per email via Google Inactive Account Manager. Alternatively you can add it to your will or make it public otherwise.
If you die the Incactive Account Manager will send your mail to your spouse after a set time of inactivity has passed. She will now have the reqired minimum of 3 shares that she can use to decrypt your secret. If someone at Google decides to read your mail he will not be able to read your message. If you want to check for yourself, you can use you two shares plus the one still sitting at you Inactive Account Manager.
Note: If you print the shares, your printer might keep a record of all of them. Also viruses, malware etc. might logging it. If you send it per email you will face the same issue if someone is able to access you mail account. You may use dedicated USB sticks for storage.
Tell your spouse what to expect, then practise every step - pretend to be dead.

21! = 51090942171709440000
I think more along the lines of 21.000.000 ;-)

2 weeks is the target @ 1 block per 10 minutes: 6 blocks/hour x 24 hours/day x 14 days = 2016 blocks.
I'd say 2 weeks may be arbitrary, but 2016 blocks is not.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:46:44
Yes. Check Venezuela - passed the million mark already ;-)

I'd love to see a chart BTC vs. &lt;trade volume in any currency&gt;
This should give you something interesting like a straight line from lower left to upper right. Fluctuations in BTC valuation and trade volume would then turn it into a loopy line.
Anyone here with data? ;-)
**Edit:** Tried it myself (see below)
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:43:46
Thanks Max, but this is not quite what I had in mind. I gave it a try based on LocalBitcoin data for USD. Here is what it looks like: 
**Edit:** Updated version with description here: 
Please note that this is a scatter graph - this may look fuzzy at first glance, but a real breakout (both price and volume) would show up as a move to the top right corner.
