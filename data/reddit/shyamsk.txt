Erm, could someone like copy that bar code and then use that to steal money from that girl (or any user for that matter)? How is it secured (besides having the kid needing to unlock her phone/watch ofc)? 
I did recently (yesterday in fact) see a YT video that stated that China was "cashless" and ahead of the times. Mostly WeChat or AliPay services as far as the video went. So I'm pretty much uniformed about it.

True, but I was only curious about the safety of the bar code here. The case being sorta similar to shoulder surfing I think, wherein an attacker (I guess you could call 'em that) would lift your password by looking over your shoulder as you typed it.

Well yes. Although if they were stealing their unlocked device, rather than just the bar code, they could steal a lot more using it. I'd guess the barcode alone would give access to either that girl's allowance account or maybe their parents account O.O

Ah I see. Makes sense, but could something like how steam keys disappear happen? As in someone take a photo, scan the bar code and steal the money before she has the chance to make her purchase. Is that possible? Or is the bar code also tied to the seller? If its tied to the seller it would be safer, but it would also be a problem if they don't have what the girl wants to buy.

Yup. They'd probably have to do something like that, but a thief would not hang onto the phone (if they are smart), deplete all resources and discard at the earliest.

So that's how you may also acquire a ring. Interesting.
