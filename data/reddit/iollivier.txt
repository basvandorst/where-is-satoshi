IMO you are wrong. Bitcoin was created to be the best internet payment and transfer method.
Utilising decentralised, free-from-institutions-control, safe, trusted and fast tech.
The future of financial world.
What we have now is Hodl walled garden with true-believers waiting for further value-pump up.
While financial speculants play games with a huge capital. 
No .. this is not what was its main definition.
Yes its ment to be spent on whatever owner wants ( coffee, porn, book .. ) as long as its inside the network.
Waiting for solution is one thing but don’t tell me this is what it ment to be what we have now

Still .. it does not even have to increase against USD ever .. all it needs is to have value against what you can do / have via direct transaction .. in the future where internet currency is a main drive for economy .. then it will be worth millions in old currency .. only then
