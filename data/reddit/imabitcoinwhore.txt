And what about him hiring a hit man to kill an employee? And don’t tell me you believe that he was framed. And then what about offering bribes to his arresting officers to let him go?
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:41:28
Like I said, impossible to tell
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:40:13
If you looked it up, then you already know the answer to your question.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:28:00
That will never happen. If it were that easy then everyone would do it and thus drive up the difficulty, making it only profitable again for the super efficient mining warehouses
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:46:06
Happened on litecoin. So although litecoin isn't bitcoin, I wouldn't say its unlikely.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:52:16
Very quickly meaning within minutes/hours. Sorry I assumed you would look up that widely available information.
I know I don't have to say this, but again this information should not be interpreted as saying anything about what bitcoin will/won't do.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:43:49
It happened when litecoin locked in segwit. Price went way down. A case of "buy the rumor sell the news"
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:09:51
Of course. Nobody with further than a high school education would imply causation to segwit. There are too many factors at play. Good thing I didn't do anything of the sort.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:50:24
How quick did it happen on litecoin? Or are you asking me to predict when it would happen on bitcoin?
It happened very quickly following litecoin lock-in, but of course it is impossible to tell when/if it will happen on bitcoin.
I'm not trying to say bitcoin price will plummet, only saying that assuming it has nowhere to go but up is naive.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:27:41
You're living up to your username
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:21:42
the entire crypto market has risen during the same timeframe. There are other bigger gainers that haven't had news like segwit. The market isn't always rational. That's why you can't assume bitcoin will go up because it's getting segwit
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:57:58
I am also waiting for this. Happened in litecoin, might happen here also
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:41:37
I prefer to think about it like he has already passed the finish line in first, but he is waiting for the legless competition to also cross and thus "end" the race.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:19:40
Yes I am.... I mean... Whoever that guy is sure is lucky!
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:42:25
But why am I being so anal about a random post about an analogy of usain bolt to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:10:39
Couldn't agree more. Ver might have been a decent guy in 2009, but the influence/money he has has corrupted him. Same can be said of many of the other faces we associate with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:20:14
Oh wow thank you! I just found out how to do it, and was about to buy some bcash in order to do it.  I can send some btc to you though in exchange? Just post your wallet
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:00:01
Sorry, but your heart is in VTach
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:47:31
Lol and what about bitshares makes you think it is a scam?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:47:22
Ok, I hate ver as much as the next guy, but this poster is a bad look. Has too much of an "ad hominum" feel to it. Let the tech speak for itself.
And if you're going to make a poster that smears someone, at least make sure it is grammatically correct.  There are multiple spelling/grammar errors in this graphic.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:56:31
Bitshares is a perfectly good option, and in many ways much better. Just needs more people to dive in and increase liquidity.  It is not too bad for the main cryptos, but no where near bittrex/polo for altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:38:35
Thank you so much! I haven't been waiting long, but definitely longer than normal.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:32:29
If we’re gonna get technical, bitcoin is inflationary by 4% this year, so this is a result of speculative investments in bitcoin, not due to the currency deflating.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:30:08
Awesome. I'll send you $10 or so.  For future reference, how do I know if it has been boosted already or not?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:37:59
Oh ok. So theres no way to see it in blockchain.info or anything?
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:32:30
When will this be available for iOS? And in the meantime what wallets support uasf currently?
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:25:53
Great point.  Would it be such a bad thing if we kept jumping from coin to coin until we found one that stuck though? Just spitballing I don't expect that to happen.
@_date: 2017-04-28 21:49:05
I second localbitcoins. I've been buying and selling there for a while now and have never been scammed yet(fingers crossed)
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:04:47
Bitcoin is great. I agree. I just hate to see it get stalled because the wrong people control all the hashpower.  I guess there will be the select few no matter which currency you deal with.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:50:43
This is just what I've been thinking lately as well.  The only difference is the infrastructure that is currently set up for bitcoin. Litecoin is becoming more and more attractive as this argument drags on with BTC. At 8-10 dollars, its hard to argue with putting a good chunk of my bitcoin in it.
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:36:54
The truth is that most of the people here will sell at some point. Everyone says "to the moon", but its all relative on what your moon is.  If you can sell your bitcoin to get your kid a college education, thats enough for some people.  Its easy to say you will never sell, but theres a point where that becomes impractical, and you need to spend the coins you did so well to hodl this whole time.
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:04:58
When will this be available in the states?
@_date: 2017-04-22 17:11:00
Local bitcoins is definitely not a scam. I buy and sell there all the time. If you want you can pm me and I'll tell you the people I have used and gotten smooth transactions from.
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:35:01
How many litecoins would you have if you held them all?
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:09:40
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:22:50
Sorry but what is BTM? And I have found people locally that will sell to me at market rate, but just not in the volume I'm looking for. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:38:02
I'm not an expert as far as the actual code or technical aspects of bitcoin go, but I am an expert at being a fan of bitcoin and knowing how to convince the layperson to use it. If your target audience is an average joe, then I'm your man.  PM me if interested.
@_date: 2017-04-22 17:12:37
Also if you live close to Houston Texas I'd gladly meet up with you if you want.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:04:31
Lol. My first thought too
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:44:03
That is why Bitcoin exists. No matter how hard they try, bitcoin cannot be killed. Yes it may be harder and may need to go underground, but bitcoin offers a way to escape these types of regimes.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:00:32
What did you just call me?
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:55:41
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:27:42
Go to Bitshares. Every transaction only costs about $0.01. And theres no withdrawal limits, worry about them freezing accounts etc....
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:01:04
Really? Huh I've never heard that. Why is that?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:09:17
Thanks! I'll watch that
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:16:52
I shouldn't have upvoted this...
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:37:17
There are plenty of other threads here. Feel free to look at others if this one has offended you.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:36:52
Ah i see. Actually a pretty cool idea. I would pay a pretty penny for the genesis block. Satoshi you reading this?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:58:06
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:11:26
You're about 5 years late to get any 50btc block rewards and 1 year too late to get any 25btc block rewards.
Only 12.5btc per block now. I suppose you could contact a pool for this but I'm not sure how likely it is to happen.
Just curious but why do you want this? Seems like a strange request tbh
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:01:57
Margin orders?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:55:34
Never compared it to bitcoin, just thought there might be some people here that know more about it than I do
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:56:04
Yeah thats my thinking as well...
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:40:34
So in your opinion, has it topped out? Would you short it? I am definitely not going to take your word as law, but I was considering this option already.
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:39:23
Id try coinbase wire transfers. You can do same day transfers and there's no limit. Fee should only be around $30-$40 tops
