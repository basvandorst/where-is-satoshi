The biggest initial market for LN might not be retail payments but micropayments in a 21.co-like API marketplace. Currently, 21.co allows micropayments for APIs through payment channels where you have to create a channel between payer and payee, or through an off-chain, centralized account balance where you have to trust that 21.co won't run off with your money. I imagine once an implementation of LN works on mainnet so that people can start using it, 21.co would add support for that mechanism. That means that you could sell API calls for micropayments without having to have a prior relationship with the purchaser. It also gives 21.co an income stream as a payment hub without having to trust that they won't run off with your money.

So compile your own client that relays/mines transactions with more than 40 bytes of data in an OP_RETURN transaction. You just need to change the IsStandard() checks.

No, side chains will still be block chains and so confirmation will always be necessary. Yes, it'll be possible to have shorter block times, but 10 second block times are unrealistic, especially if you want to scale.

I think initial, intelligent regulation is a good thing. There's a lot of potential in Bitcoin that's only begun to be realized, and regulated companies taking part will help drive adoption and give the price a boost.
As time goes on and developers create new ways to create safer, more sustainable and decentralized markets that route around regulation, it will become more and more difficult to enforce regulatory mandates not just in money transfer and capital/derivative markets but in communication and generic trade as well. Entire new markets will be created completely out of reach of the regulators, and they'll be so efficient that people and companies will have to shift from the legacy markets to be able to compete and survive.

Then, use NAT on your router to redirect all outbound connections on port 8333 to your internal bitcoind server. Remember not to store any coins on said server.

I've always liked replace-by-fee. It's the easiest way to implement transaction replacement. Setting version numbers in inputs is all well and good, but there's no way to enforce that a higher version of an input marks the transaction that actually gets put in a block as long as that version is final. That means for consensus sake, nLockTime should be used (earlier nLockTime = newer version of transaction, can be mined first based on consensus rules) and for incentive sake, replace-by-fee should be used (higher fee = newer version of transaction, incentive for miners to mine that version).

Not all sellers invested more than they can lose.
When bitcoins were around $5, I gave one a piece to several friends and family members and told them "hold on to this, it'll be worth more in a few years!" Yesterday, one of them had to cash that out to pay bills, but she invested nothing.
Most of them actually lost their bitcoins, which annoys me because I could now fund a vacation with what they've lost. I even taught them to back up their coins and they deleted or never made the backups.

@_date: 2014-03-06 14:54:20
The large data in the middle is the 160-bit double hash of the public key which can spend this output (in base58, it would be the address).
It expects the stack to have had the signature and then the public key pushed onto it when redeemed.
The OP_DUP duplicates the top item on the stack, meaning the public key.
The OP_HASH160 hashes the top of the stack, meaning the duplicated public key.
The data (address) then gets pushed onto the stack.
Then, the top two stack items are popped off the stack and checked for equality (is the hash of the provided public key the same as the address?).  If they're equal, the script continues. Otherwise, it fails.
Then, the remaining two stack items (public key and then signature) are popped off the stack and the signature is checked against the public key for the transaction. If the signature is valid, 1 (true) is pushed to the stack; otherwise, 0 (false) is. Then the script ends, and it succeeds or fails based on whether a true value is at the top of the stack.
I may have misremembered a few details here and there, so check this page for further info:

Coinbase tries not to BURDEN the Bitcoin network, and thereby saves on fees. Off chain transactions still add value to the Bitcoin economy and therefore network. The catch is that when a web wallet stores your coins for off chain transactions, that's no longer trustless. There are alternative architectures for off chain transactions with minimal to no trust involved, but that development is just starting.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:22:27
Are you paying them in Bitcoins or dollars? I imagine they would prefer either over pesos...

Because malleability applies to unconfirmed transactions only. Once they run out of confirmed outputs, their system may be designed to wait until more are confirmed in order to avoid having chains of transactions getting replaced.

You can accept amounts down to a 100 millionth of a bitcoin (nicknamed a satoshi after Satoshi Nakamoto).
Both Coinbase and BitPay will let you immediately exchange the bitcoins you receive to USD at around a 1% fee (actually less in most scenarios). You have the option of keeping a percentage of Bitcoin revenue as bitcoins, in which case you also avoid the fee.
ETA: please consider also giving publishers the option to receive bitcoins as a payout method. Companies like Balanced, which works with Coinbase, allow marketplaces to do both as far as I know.

No, my own work with two phase commit shows a way to have decentralized networks of payment channels. There's more centralization than pure P2P, of course, but it can still be done trustlessly and with very little centralization as long as you accept the cost (which is also high in pure P2P).
My proof of concept, last year, before Peter's patch, was already written with the assumption that replace by fee would be a reality in the future.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:28:24
I don't know about everything else (though I did just spend a lot of time reading the GitHub thread about getutxos), but I personally have no problem with replace by fee. I've expected it to occur since 2012, when I was trying to write unit tests that would re-enable transaction replacement. There's nothing holding miners back from replacing by fee, they have every ~~advantage~~ incentive to do it, and it's a useful mechanism for transaction replacement for advanced contract uses like Mike's own micropayment channels.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:05:38
There has to be a means to get bitcoins into the hands of people, and trustworthy exchanges are useful until the Bitcoin economy is big enough to not need to exchange out. Then people can just work for bitcoins.

You're talking about a hard fork to enable essentially a one off transfer which doesn't follow the rules of the network. If somehow almost everyone agrees to it, sure, it might be possible.

Interesting, I'd like to see it, and I'm glad you're compensating for storage. I've got my own alternative idea I'm working on that stores metadata/other info in a DHT and timestamps using the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:31:59
My work doesn't use a separate blockchain.  It will use the Bitcoin blockchain for payment settlement and aggregate timestamping.  It's not simply "bitcoin-inspired," it uses Bitcoin as currency, payment system, and timestamping facility.
For example, let's say I publish a new commit.  I would include in the commit a reference to my public key ('nym' type pseudonymous identity).  I'd then sign the hash of that commit with the private key associated with the nym, and have the signed hash timestamped by the blockchain (not absolutely necessary for pure source control, but useful for calculating the reputation of both my nym and the particular commit).
To retrieve the commit from the DHT that holds the actual code, I use Bitcoin micropayments over a payment channel to pay a neighboring node to retrieve that data for me.  This obviously requires a blockchain for establishing and settling the micropayment channels.  The payments are incentives for DHT nodes to store and retrieve/send data to clients.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:45:39
I'm really excited about this. I've got several use cases for new contract types, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Combined with the fact that nonfinal transactions aren't standard, decrementing nLockTime for new versions of transactions actually obviates the need to do replace by fee. I do increment the fee at the same time, but actual replacement in the memory pool isn't necessary at this point.

This guy gets it. Online services are the perfect candidate for keeping part of their revenue in Bitcoin because their marginal cost is very low.

I've read over these and criticism and I'm thinking it would be worthwhile to experiment with (a) side chain(s) that has a CoinWitness-capable verifier in it, to hopefully eventually merge into Bitcoin Core. That wouldn't immediately fix the security model for side chains, but if I'm right, it would both permit side chains based on proof-of-something-other-than-partial-hash-collision and let us test the verifier for a few years before merging into Core. As long as it gets into Core before the block subsidy gets low enough to tempt miners to steal coins from side chains.

@_date: 2014-04-13 14:25:47
I'm not very knowledgeable about ZKP, but I'm working to get myself more up to speed. This means that the below could be wrong or even so wrong it's meaningless. If so, please correct me if possible.
A set of opcodes capable of verifying ZK-SNARK proofs can be used to enforce the rules of the side chain when unsuspending coins in Bitcoin proper, right? This includes not just PoW chains but any manner of chain, including proof-of-stake with any rules, proof of storage, etc. It also means that the only thing miners can do is block the unsuspend transactions, not create fake ones.
A side chain, if made sufficiently secure in the medium term, can be a great place to test this feature before adding it to Core in order to fully secure side chains and expand their ability to use something other than proof of stake. In the meantime, a sufficiently secure side chain with a ZK-SNARK verifying opcode set can serve as a gateway to such chains. Chains relying on something other than proof of work to secure them wouldn't even need to be merge mined then.
Again, I might be talking out of my butt here as my understanding of cryptography so far ends at 70s tech - hash, symmetric, and asymmetric algorithms. I don't yet fully understand ZKP. But I'd love to know if maybe I'm on the right track.

If 72 transactions costs the entire network 1 cent, let's do some more math.
Imagine you want Internet of Things devices to be able to pay one another 10 times a day. Imagine you have only 7.2 billion of them (about one per person in the world - the actual number is already much higher and growing fast, which is great because I'd like to live in a future where machines do far more work than humans). That's 72 billion transactions per day, which costs the entire network (not just the miners, who are actually making money off processing these transactions) $10 million per day, or $1562.50/node/day.
What's more, each of those transactions takes on average 10 minutes for a single confirmation; if you run a service that supports these IoT devices (let's say it processes a camera image to detect faces), you either risk nonpayment for each one of the transactions by returning the results immediately or the camera image doesn't get processed for about 10 minutes * number of confirmations you want.
Let me be clear: at this scale, even Lightning would need larger Bitcoin blocks to be able to deal with opening and closing channels. But Lightning must exist for these types of applications to even be viable, much less scale. The demand for block space won't go away because Lightning exists.
If you want to say "well, you should use Coinbase or 21.co micropayments for things like this," that's already a layer 2 solution on top of Bitcoin, but it's centralized and as far from trustless as things get. And what happens when 21.co or Coinbase go out of business or pivot (as has actually happened with Mt. Gox or Circle) and stop providing the mechanism for these payments, possibly running with your money? Everyone has to *at least* manually change their payment API endpoints, if not change the payment API altogether when it's not standardized, and possibly faces a direct monetary loss as well.

Some posters below appear to have misconceptions about the technology described in this paper. I knew about this paper in early September, so I've had a bit longer to digest.
**Is this trustless?** Yes. Current LN design uses two-party, trustless payment channels. The paper expands the design into multi-party, trustless payment channels. These are easier to rebalance between any parties in the group without having to hit the blockchain, saving additional fees and blockchain space. This is useful for any community - not just pair of people - to essentially have its own multi-party channel. It also improves privacy.
**Does this require any changes to Bitcoin?** No, it uses essentially the same building blocks as Lightning Network, just builds them in a slightly different arrangement in multi-layer contract. It does require changes to the Lightning Network specification, but that will come after mainnet release of current Lightning implementations. It can be added in a modular way later as the Lightning protocol specification contains hooks for expanding its capabilities. Current focus is to get the current spec implemented on mainnet, safely and as quickly as possible.
**What happens when nodes drop out?** If temporary, you can work around that until they come back - you just can't rebalance channels with them. If permanent, the entire multi-party channel state goes to the blockchain and gets broken up into off-blockchain sub-channels involving either smaller groups or individual pairs of nodes. Any sub-channels that the leaving party was part of can get settled on-chain; the rest can continue operating off-chain. There are cheaper possible ways to "drop out," either similar to off-chain channel rebalancing, or with only one transaction going to the blockchain. Adding a new party also requires an on-chain transaction.
**Are "groups of nodes" centralized?** Not necessarily; this could be a group like your neighbors or a niche community that got together and decided to create a multi-party channel through which you can all pay each other and connect to other channels, similar to the existing LN.
**Is this a sidechain?** No. This supports no features not already supported by LN, other than additional scalability/privacy.
**Does this delay Lightning Network?** No, the current implementations of the current version of LN are almost ready for mainnet. There are [interop test results]( and Lightning Labs has a pretty cool [GUI application]( out that works on testnet.

Much agreement, and so much of the trolling is dishonest.


Eventually, yes! It would make reliability way better in the future. Imagine if a node's diret channel(s) to the next hop is (are) exhausted, but there's an indirect route that isn't. That node could forward the payment indirectly by prepending hops to the path. This isn't implemented or even in the spec right now, but there's been discussion about it.




In channel factories, if you're a part of that "subnet," you're one of the required signatures on any state changes at the top and any sub-channels you're party to. If you're sending to a destination in a channel factory "subnet," it's the same level of trust minimization as sending it to a recipient that's only connected via two-party payment channels. The [paper]( is amazing, well worth a read, and explains the original LN concept very well, too. The diagrams alone are worth your eyeballs' time.
In terms of actual routing, channel factories wouldn't really have "default gateways." Each node participating in a channel factory would have sub-channels to multiple other nodes inside that channel factory and would likely also be participating in other two-party or multi-party channels. This would increase liquidity greatly inside the channel factory and make it easier to rebalance within it, reduce the number of and the distance between graph nodes (which will then actually be collections of independent LN nodes), and allow LN nodes to route through their multi-party channel neighbors just like through currently-implemented two-party channels.


FQTSS is a neat analogy, though not exactly the same. LN is more like two-phase commit for a chain of payment channels. Like an SQL transaction where you do the processing first and then commit it atomically on success or roll it back to the original state on failure, but distributed and with money.


There's a [mailing list]( and there's a good place to participate in the [specification]( process.


This is already the case for some parts of the LN specification, though not as much work has been done on formal routing algorithm analysis for LN yet. As usage grows, I imagine so will analysis and research. We're still in a very naive phase, but it's mostly "good enough" for now.


It actually uses relative block height (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY). This means that after a unilateral channel close, the contract allows the other party a set number of blocks (ideally scaled with the amount of money in the channel) to publish a transaction that disputes the state represented by the channel close and punishes the original closer.


@_date: 2018-03-15 20:05:52
In theory, yes.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:18:14
All payments are source-routed so each node can use whatever path selection algorithm it wants; it's not in the spec for that reason.
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:11:24
Yes. This isn't a compete and perfect solution yet. Watchtowers (outsourced channel monitoring) will eventually be a piece of the whole solution.
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:43:04




I retract my troll comment. I dismissed you as a troll because you were demanding changes to the spec on Reddit without having the full background of why it is the way it is, and the mention of zero-conf payments as an equivalent payment method (its trust requirements and security guarantees are VASTLY different). I jumped to judgement too soon. My apologies.




That's neat! What exactly forced the change?


The reason we have a hop limit is that each message has a constant number of slots (the hop limit) for encrypted routing information, some of which are just padding. This prevents a forwarding node from learning which hop it is along the route. Changing that would let routing nodes reduce the set of possible payees, which could help deanonymize payments. There may be workarounds for this that could go into the next spec revision or be implemented by way of feature flags, but not until we know we need it.


A longer path is MORE likely to have congestion issues than a shorter path. There are a few things working in our favor:
* Edge growth is rate limited by block size and limited to the UTXO set
* Agents don't just follow topology, they create it as well
* ‎Rebalancing channels is possible (but also requires path finding)
* Paths are specified node to node, which means nodes can eventually have the freedom to forward to a neighbor by way of an indirect but less congested path the forwarding node chooses itself
* The topology is likely to be amenable to a 20-hop maximum, as 20 hops can describe paths between billions of nodes with an average number of edges for each node being only 3
* The topology is likely to be a fairly well connected mesh at the center (forwarding nodes that are always up) and many (mobile, transient) nodes at the edge connected to only 1-3 forwarding nodes
* Like Internet routing, we expect to eventually pay more attention to summarized information about neighborhoods/subnetworks, so each node will not always have a global view; this will become a huge boon when channel factories (multiparty channels) are implemented
* ‎Channel factories will enable far shorter routes by allowing far greater connectivity between well-connected groups with opaque internal routing
* We are planning on implementing routing hints from the payee and eventually rendezvous points as well (for payee anonymity)


This is definitely a tradeoff. As I mentioned before, in a f2f network like this, we don't expect everyone to always even have a full global view, especially after private subnetworks represented by channel factories are implemented.






If a node along the path can't forward a payment for any reason, it can (and is, like every other node on the path back to the payer, incentivized to) roll the payment back to the hop before it. The payer can then retry with another path. Because of revocation enforcing settlement of only the latest state, the same payment hash can be reused without previous payment attempts being settled incorrectly. The money used for a payment is locked until that payment is forwarded along the entire path or rolled back, so there's no liquidity issue preventing rollback along the same path.


This is true, but demanding spec changes without being aware of what's going on with both standard and implementations isn't useful. If you're interested in helping us improve the routing and topology of the network, join the discussion! There are obviously many interesting problems to solve in this space.


I hope some of what I've mentioned above reduces your anxiety about the completeness guarantee. It may be that we do end up needing unbounded path length, but again, that can be implemented using feature flags without haphazard changes to the main specification.


An HTLC is a hash+time locked contract. The hash lock enables the atomic payment along a multi-hop path, and the time lock enables you to get your money back from non-cooperative peers.


Fair point.




Thanks! We're both exhausted and elated, but coffee helps. :)
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:00:12
Channel updates are not sent out with each payment; there are also several somewhat low-hanging optimizations we are planning for balancing channels to maximize availability/liquidity. We do not require a completeness guarantee; payments may fail sometimes (and these failures can be used as a signal that a new payment channel would be useful to make the graph better connected), and payment retries are possible. In addition, AMP will improve liquidity. All this means that the completeness guarantee is not required.

It's because I have a longstanding policy of not feeding trolls. This will be my last response to you, but I was initially trying to be nice despite the fact that I knew you were just concern trolling.
If you want to have an "academic discussion," you have to have an actual understanding of what you're discussing. You are not so much asking questions as trying to muddy the water by insisting routing is too hard to solve in a system like LN.
Your lack of understanding is apparent when you make suggestions like removing the hop limit (this is like big blocks for routing because it greatly increases path search space for no marginal benefit as well as making it easier to deanonymize payments), and ignoring the trust and security tradeoffs of accepting zero-confirmation transactions. You haven't read very much of the spec or code as you obviously don't understand rollback and retry behavior. You haven't commented on the spec or mailing list or any other actual peer review forum, but you're ready to declare HUGE PROBLEMS and URGENTLY REQUIRED CHANGES on Reddit. You haven't even read the white paper or you'd know I did some of the precursor work on HTLC-like constructs as far back as 2013, which was cited in it, which is how I ended up at Lightning Labs and got my flair.

Or option 4: split your coins on the two chains. When the chain splits and the network with it, send your coins to one address on one chain and another on the other chain (you should control both addresses). Repeat until your coins are in different outputs you control on different chains. Then transact as you wish on the chains separately; run a Lightning node on the UASF chain or whatever you want without risking the miners stealing your coins on the other chain.

It's more accurate to call it a F2F network than a P2P network. Payment channels (see Mike Hearn's work) are established between intermediaries. Consumers and merchants establish similar payment channels to/from intermediaries. The intermediaries pass on payments and collect fees. Anyone with capital and connectivity can become an intermediary, so probably many merchants will be their own intermediaries. Hopefully that's clear without going into the tech part too much?

Good question about the index sizes. The first thing to consider is that almost no one will need the full index on their mobile device; the only filters you're likely to need are filters for blocks that are relevant to you. For example, when you create a new wallet, it's pointless to scan blocks before the creation of that wallet because you know there won't be any transactions to any addresses in the wallet from before it was created. So you can start with 0 filters downloaded and still be up to date. Full nodes that support this BIP will need to store all of the filters, but it's still a small percentage of the total block data that they already store.
The second thing to consider is that the data contains a lot of noise. For example, for much of the lifetime of Bitcoin mainnet, blocks weren't full; this drives down both the median and mean block size and therefore also filter size. The same with testnet, though the fraction of empty blocks on testnet is WAY higher. please correct me if I'm wrong, but the first testnet data set mentioned is pre-segwit and the second post-segwit; the best indicators to look at are the MAXIMUM filter sizes as the mean and median are skewed due to such a large proportion of nearly empty blocks. However, keep in mind that there are deliberately manipulated vis-a-vis block size, tx size, and tx count testnet blocks (created by himself) and these would be very expensive and thus unlikely on mainnet; these blocks could have very large filters.

I would suggest learning as much as possible before jumping in. If you're single AND have play money, throwing some and seeing if it sticks is one thing. I tried that with options trading in my early 20s and lost a couple thousand dollars. Since you're married, you owe it to your wife, who's your financial partner, to know exactly what you're proposing before you try to convince her to buy something. When you yourself fully understand WHY Bitcoin has a lot of upside, and you understand what the potential downside is, THEN tell your wife why you want to buy, your full investment plan, etc. Answer any questions she asks and if you don't know the answers, look them up.

That becomes a tradeoff as to how much you're willing to spend to record transactions on the blockchain vs how quickly you need the channels settled and closed. The pub will need some capital float in order to be able to manage doing it this way for extended periods. In the short term, when this is first being deployed, the additional capital requirements would actually increase demand for bitcoins and drive a boom in exchange rate.
There are all sorts of tradeoffs, caveats and optimizations that are possible. I haven't had a chance to code most of them yet.

If there's enough hash power to actually make SegWit activate on the BIP-148 fork, Lightning Network nodes will be able to run on it, generating a lot of economic activity without having to use exchanges etc. The chain will have a lot of utility compared to the legacy chain, even without as many interfaces to the legacy financial system. A malleability fix enabling smart contracts, trust-minimized off chain transactions, and atomic cross-chain trades with Litecoin (which DOES have interfaces to the legacy financial system) will add a lot of value.

Yes, but without decentralized payment infrastructure, peer to peer networks have been forced to barter (BitTorrent barters bandwidth, for example). This causes efficiency issues, partially because of asymmetry (I might have cheaper download than upload bandwidth but lots of processing power and cheap electricity).

Yes. When Bitcoin's total M0 value is 100 or 1000 times what it is now, the value (in terms of purchasing power, not necessarily exchange rate) should move much more smoothly. It will make it easier to price things in terms of Bitcoin, at least for short term transactions. Salaries may have to be deflation indexed, but many people will probably be paid per project.


Yes, we'd start to think that way in many countries. The prices would emerge and stabilize as supply chain loops close in the Bitcoin economy. There would be a constant downward price pressure on goods and services as the Bitcoin economy grows, which would eventually collapse competing inflationary currencies.

There's not much content. How does their new currency system work, since they seem to have a central bank that administers "debt-free" money? The article is vague on details and analysis, and heavy on what seems like racist propaganda. From my news searches, it looks like Hungary has indeed paid off its IMF loan about 2 weeks ago, but I see no confirmation of "Instead, the Hungarian government has assumed sovereignty over its own currency and now issues money debt free, as it is needed." In fact, the central bank appears to be setting interest rates, which only make sense with credit money. The only difference is that the debt is owed to local rather than international bankers. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, either.

ETA: If there were one, I could see my stepkids using it to earn coins to spend at GameStop via gift card (or CVS for candy).

Hey, this is great! Another business here in RVA accepting Bitcoin! I just emailed Richmond BizSense to let them know as they're working on an article about local businesses and Bitcoin.

I just buy coins on Coinbase with every paycheck and spend them, mostly using Gyft but I'd like to start buying some online services as well in the near future.

Do you recommend Replicant? Or something else?
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:49:40
Just an example. There's TorPM too.

I believe eGifter has Home Depot gift cards they sell for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:04:10
Don't store the gift cards. I buy them on my phone while in the store and spend them immediately. CVS and Wal-Mart both have diapers, as do some Kmart stores.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:51:42
Check out BitPremier. It's a site to buy and sell high ticket items for Bitcoin, including art, realty, cars, yachts, etc.
@_date: 2013-08-27 18:49:13
Always seemed reasonable to me. Maybe eGifter will be cheaper for a while because of Coinbase's free processing for the first $1M.

Right, most people would pick the grocery store to connect to with a payment channel.
The payment channel is on the chain as a 2 of 2 output. There are three of them: one between the pub and me, one between the pub and distributor, and one between distributor and convenience store.
When the output is redeemed, the channel is closed.  Until it is, payments can go over the channel by updating the redemption transaction amounts.
For example, let's say I lock in 1 BTC into the channel. Then I create a redeeming transaction that sends .9 back to me and .1 to the pub. The redemption isn't complete because the pub hasn't signed it. I've paid my tab for tonight but I can come back tomorrow and sign a new version, with .2 to the pub and .8 back to me, and have another dinner and pint. When I ask the pub to close the channel, it signs the most recent/advantageous version and publishes it, redeeming the contract output to both of us and closing the channel.

Want! But wow, expensive!

I'd like to get better at communicating this, so let me try again.
I spend a lot of time and money at a local merchant, say my neighborhood pub. I set up a payment channel with the pub, which is just a 2 of 2 on-chain output from which I can sign over incrementally more money as I spend it.
The pub has a relationship with the local alcohol distributor and sets up a similar payment channel. The distributor also sells beer to my local convenience store so they have another similar payment channel.
Now I'm next door at the convenience store buying some bread and milk. I send money to the pub, telling it to pass that money to the convenience store via the alcohol distributor. The pub and the distributor each charge a few cents to do so and the convenience store gets the money and gives me my groceries.
The transaction is instant because the payment channels are already confirmed on the blockchain, and these are just incremental updates to the transaction that will redeem the contract output.  With additional technical tricks, I'm able to make it so that payment channels are reversible (or, less efficiently, bidirectional). Using a different technical trick, I can also make it so that the pub can't redeem my additional payment until the convenience store gets its payment and/or I get my groceries, and the pub can do the same to the distributor. This creates a built in escrow feature.
Edit: I just realized I may have a drinking problem. Most people would probably establish their primary payment channel with the grocery store, not the pub.

My brother is getting married this weekend and I'm doing the same. Fortunately, I introduced him to Bitcoin almost 2 years ago so he knows what it is.

Networks like Seed Savers Exchange would be good too.

Gyft is helping consumers win against breakage arbitrage in the gift card market AND taking a chunk of the remaining breakage away from the corporate overlords. Better still, some of their profits are reinvested in the Bitcoin economy as Gyft develops better features and also because the founder is a BitAngels VC.

This is full of so much racist fail, I can't help but laugh. Debt-free money is all well and good, though it sounds like this is still arbitrarily inflatable fiat money. But are the Nazi references necessary? And what does the author's genetic lineage have to do with his qualifications as a writer? As his rant shows, not much.

Coinbase has the advantages that they support sitewide off-chain transactions, reducing fees and confirmation time for customers choosing that method of payment. They also offer 0% USD conversion for the first $1M per merchant, and make it easy for new-to-Bitcoin customers in the US to buy coins.

There's Sears, Kmart, CVS, etc.
@_date: 2013-07-29 02:23:33
Yeah, I'm not going to use Coinbase as a spending wallet any more either. They're still great for purchasing coins on a regular basis. I'm definitely going to keep using Gyft though.
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:14:44
I'd take the mining mention out of the video while still mentioning that a limited number of coins can exist (ETA: recommend that people who want coins could get them by selling goods and services). I'd also explain "coins" so that it's obvious you can have fractional ones, so people who see the current exchange rates don't freak out. I'd mention some quotes from famous people (the ones on SecondMarket's BIT page are good - Bill Gates and Al Gore). Lastly, I'd mention additional merchants - you can now buy almost anything in the US via Gyft or eGifter.

I thought it was (never used it) but apparently not, and it's down now. I thought it worked by running a hidden service and using its address as your IM address, so you connect directly to peers you chat with. I was wrong on that one, but I'll check out the system you mentioned.

A 7-10% discount for Bitcoin payments is awesome, and better than the 1-5% I'd expect. That said, you may want to realign the discounts so that you don't save a smaller percentage on larger purchases. In most cases, that would be incentive to break purchases up, which can lead to support headaches and blockchain spam.

Assuming the NSA sees all your cleartext traffic and you're not sending transactions over Tor, it would be able to tell that you're running bitcoin software and what transactions originate from your machine.


Yes, if the NSA sees that a tx message came from your node that wasn't sent to it by another node first.
Edit: But only if you're sending money. Not if you're just receiving it over a cleartext connection (unless you use a narrow Bloom filter in SPV mode).


You can run the Bitcoin daemon over Tor, which is supposed to defeat the issues above.

I imagine like the exchanges in Europe moved over to the Euro. Not sure how it happened. I'd worry more about derivatives denominated in inflationary currencies than equities.

Great, in depth article! One thing about altcoins... A lot of newbies who believe the ship has sailed on Bitcoin buy into altcoins instead. The newbies also tend to panic more readily and dump their coins. I'd bet that this has the effect of smoothing out the movement of Bitcoin in two ways: keeping it insulated from the more ignorant panicky newbies and forcing them to buy bitcoins initially to trade in and out of the altcoins.

This is true. In my prototype, each change in the direction of a payment channel requires an earlier lock time. The lock time decrement step will need to be larger to give participants time to get their transactions mined if they aren't standard.

Please put your business on coinmap.org so it's easier to find. It also plays into a local Bitcoin resource I'm thinking about creating.

If you're trying to hide income from the IRS, cash is just as easy as Bitcoin, depending on your business. If you're reporting income as you are legally required to, you would also need to report your Bitcoin earnings.

It has attracted over $200,000 in "investments." The idea, to me, seems implausible but the marketing of 100:1 return has parted many "just in case" investors with a small fraction of their money.

When you can track your gift cards on your phone, you're more likely to use up all the stored value on them. It reduces breakage for the retailer, which then makes less money betting that gift card holders won't claim all they're owed on the card.

It means signatures won't be checked prior to the last checkpoint. The rest of the checks remain the same. I believe no alternate history would be accepted prior to the last checkpoint, either, which limits the extent of damage which can be done by a 51% attacker in terms of rewriting history.
ETA: there have been discussions about changing the checkpoint system so you could configure checkpoints without changing the source code and recompiling as a further defense against potential 51% attacks.
