Let's get Segway activated, I have heard enough of BU and do not support it. The latest video from Johnny portrayed how Segwit soft fork makes way more sense and Roger needs to leave his emotions at the door.

I just ordered one wrote an email few days ago asking them to lower the price. Everyone should thank me.  Trezor has some competition now!

I just go on the sub and see a bunch of people with small ideas and small minds. Seriously rbtc  is a joke.

Reading this made me even more sure on why I wish Segwit activates. I am not doing this for monetary gains only.  I see BTC as a way of helping nations and taking away power from idiots and trolls like AdrianXT.

Thank you thymos for standing up and keeping btc safe from hijackers.

I have a keepkey and a trezor. What security option is missing in the keepkey? I like both hardware wallets trezor has been around for many years and has been a trusted cold storage. Keepkey is new so it will take some time, however the seed recovery option is better than the trezor. Keepkey uses rotating cipher recovery method because of the large screen. Keepkey is now 100 dollars so both options are good.

I swear when they make a movie on BTC in a couple of years it will be extremely entertaining. I mean there is something every week, this is better than the Super Bowl.

I sold 10 percent to show miners that the market does not want a hard fork. A little price to pay for Segwit. Hopefully it activates

Funny I tried to donate and don't see any option for bitcoin donation.

I been on r/btc and it's full of bitter people. I come here to get news on BTC. Not politics on the dam block size debate. I have been lurking far too long and quiet but now I am  tired of vers henchmans flooding posts with transaction delay.

Altcoin pumpers should have bought btc now they are angry complaining and whining about confirmation time. Been buying for over 3 years never had a problem.

Been using coinbase for years never an issue. Wanted to say thanks.

It will be a never ending cycle of weak hands coming in not understanding btc. When a new threat comes they sell and btc is in the news on how it failed. I want btc to have a slow and honest growth, tired of the manipulators.
