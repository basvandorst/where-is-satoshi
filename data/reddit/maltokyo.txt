Same for me for my remaining ones
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:36:50
Don’t sell. Just buy
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:50:00
If bitcoin isn’t considered legal tender then buying with bitcoin is like barter isn’t it? So how could they enforce this?
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:30:26
Completely centralized. No different from the rest of fiat payment processors.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:54:49
How on earth do you know that? If you sell now it will go to 20k ;) prices will fall and rise. Just look at the average prices over last ten years.
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:29:26
In what sense?
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:39:04
You buy from other people who already have them and want to sell them. On exchanges (middleman) or on bisq (decentralized trading tool). Price is determined by what people want to sell for and what people are prepared to pay. Like most markets (except the fiat money market)
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:37:29
Yes but they built on second layer. So that’s third layer

Use Shamir Secret Sharing:
Basically you split your seed up into n parts and share those parts with n friends or family. You decide how many of those n parts are needed to put them back together (eg 6 of 10 parts). Once you die, if 6 of your friends are still alive and still have their parts, they can collaborate, put the parts together and regenerate your seed.
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:26:52
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:49:53
That’s why you need to choose your friends wisely ;)

Is there a TL;DR? I listened for 10min. Quite a lot of fluff and I gave up. What’s the key messages he gives (asking anyone who actually listened to all)
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:37:43
Hm. The whole point of the decentralized part of crypto is to avoid dealing with banks. No need for banks! But I guess, anything for adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:45:55
This is just the govt trying to tax bitcoin as best they can. Let’s see.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:44:17
Hehe. Yeah. Well maybe she needs a bank. I’ll PM you the btc payment address of my “bank” and you can ask her to make her deposits there ��
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:55:21
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:58:52
yes, clarifies, thanks!!
@_date: 2019-08-16 09:43:26
I tried c-lightning and LND. LND was easier to use for sure, and you can backup your channels. I couldn’t work out how to do that on c-lightning, which was more for developers in my view. After trialling both I’d choose LND again any day.. at this stage of the game.
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:50:35
Nope. Swiss banks report all to Swiss tax authorities and even share with other countries now!
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:41:58
How is it equally worthless? It’s neutral, decentralized by design, public domain, open source, completely transparent, permissionless, peer to peer, and that always follows the same rules for any person or device that uses it. Can you explain how fiat “wins” or comes in equal here? The only thing fiat has going for it is a hundred year head start.
@_date: 2019-08-04 05:35:38
And you’re answer is? I was asking honestly. At least he answered.
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:28:01
Source? If you think the tax office can’t see your transactions if and when they need to, you have some delusions.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:59:38
Some people may appreciate it, man, even if you don't, that's ok for me.

@_date: 2019-10-15 17:17:14
Well I wasn’t commenting on bitcoin hackability at all. The point is that fiat is liable to be hacked. But it’s ok. Government will just print some more. And, yes the customers of banks will absolutely pay for this (upgrading software and atm systems worldwide).
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:36:44
There is no Swiss banking secret anymore. All KYC now. And by licensing these firms, the terms of license will defiantly be KYC and reporting all transactions.

It’s a risk to store all your cash under the bed. I’d say it’s more risky giving your coins to a company, than keeping the keys to those coins safe yourself. Engrave the keys in metal, and store them in your wine cellar, or whatever. For less risky than giving them to centralized players. But that’s just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:17:18
If people need “firms” to manage their btc, aren’t they misunderstanding one of the key sales points of bitcoin? Or maybe this is a temp step, needed for adoption?
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:49:11
In the hope that it would help him to actually catch someone else..
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:39:44
Indeed. Anything can happen. Let’s see where we go to.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:16:30
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:04:41
Because they are criminals and drug dealers? ��
Edit: I thought it’s obviously sarcasm.. but seems others didn’t see it
@_date: 2019-08-31 07:42:30
Inform us then! What’s your view?
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:05:31
Which is a big issue.. lnd auto backs up channel state whenever there is a change. So pretty solid stuff compared to c-lightning
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:34:28
Open this in incognito: 
Then just click the “x” to close the big ad asking you to join (agree with you that it’s stupid). 
I could read. Or is it another article you talk about?
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:22:16
If not the customers, then who pays for banks operations and issue resolution? ;) just let me know.
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:45:15
But I never claimed that it doesn’t have any advantages.
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:48:11
They can trust who they like ��. That’s not my thing to judge. I’m just saying that they may be missing the “decentralized” (don’t need banks) part of bitcoin, and being deceived by these banks who are going to take a cut from them.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:31:33
Yes. With decentralisation comes responsibility to be your own “bank”. When was bitcoin “hacked” again? Could you share with us?
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:35:37
Doesn’t look like “good rates”. Spread is huge.
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:21:40
Exactly. They can claim tax fraud any time they have doubts.
@_date: 2019-10-16 09:25:11
You said it all with, fiat = “all fake anyway”
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:27:25
People got frustrated and gave up on internet as it was a pain in the ass too. Until it wasn’t..
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:03:17
Again.. enlighten us! You can’t say someone else “failed” with their view, then not share yours
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:10:08
Thanks. That’s very helpful! Appreciated.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:43:34
Somebody’s not getting the point ��
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:46:05
Thanks for the help. The error messages in the app didn’t help at all. Crazy. I’ll try to send it a bit more. Suggested amount?
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:32:10
I sent 3800 satoshis to it, and now they are stuck.  Says balance 3800 satoshis balance then it says "0% on Lightning".  How to get those on lightning?  I just wanted to try it, glad I didn't send a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:15:20
its been two days now..
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:45:25
Ahh ok. Damn.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:02:28
They have to work out operations, backup, compliance etc. But yes. 6 months is too long. Maybe they can only start in 4 months from now?
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:12:02
So that means no. I guess. I'm in EU. Not even sure why I'm reading these
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:19:10
Fees work out relatively high on bisq. When they come down to below normal exchange levels then it will be a killer app I think.
@_date: 2019-12-13 11:40:07
If they require a phone number then it's not really kyc free. But I suppose you could make a "mistake"
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:59:00
This was my question too and why I came here.
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:08:56
Really cool! Where does it get the price from, you could add a few % to it to cover your costs and make a small amount yourself. Or you could be purchasing btc from an exchange in the background, for a few % less than the price people pay you. This would be a great product!!
@_date: 2019-09-14 09:51:44
You misspelled “Germans”
@_date: 2019-09-16 06:43:50
That doesn’t look like drugs ;)
