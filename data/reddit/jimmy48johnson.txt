SMS is very unsafe. Google, for example, is phasing out SMS as a 2-factor authentication method. I think that if you rely on SMS to circumvent censorship you're going to have bad time.

That's down from yesterday's prediction of $100k.

Because a big chunk of the world is on holidays and the traditional markets are closed. There will be huge movements on December 27. I'm guessing down, since the overall mood has turned a bit pessimistic last couple of days.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:14
LN makes it actually usable. I think the bull run we see now is partly driven by expectations of LN and partly by network effect. More people simply know about Bitcoin now than 5 years ago. Lots more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:38:55
...that would kill the market.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:02
And we're going down again!

Middle men can be businesses. See for example VISA/MC/AMEX which takes 1-3% per transaction using their issued cards. And no, VISA/MC/AMEX do not end up with all the money (even though their business is profitable.)

All these sudden steps are manipulations by sharks. Look at the trade volume for Diamond. It suddenly goes from nothing to huge amounts (between 0.5 and 1 million USD per minute) and then down to nothing again.

You are right. It's unusable. But lots of people are working to fix that.

If the market believed in $20k USD by end of 2018, current price would be about $20k USD.

That's why there are lots of really poor and unmaintained buildings at really nice locations in many Chinese large cities. The owner of the building doesn't want to take this risk.

I assume this is just a way to negotiate a better deal with VISA. This makes VISA look extremely bad and the higher ups will be desperate to fix it.

I've never seen a dirtier data center. Or can this even be called a data center? More like warehouse.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:31:21
I'm not sure about that. I don't think they'll have mass produced units until 1-2 months from now.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:21:55
Someone is shorting lots of BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:37:02
Manipulated. Someone is keeping it at around 6800 USD.

tl;dr double spending

They definitely don't accept Bitcoin. I'd be surprised if the shop keeper even knows what Bitcoin is. Welcome to SE Asia.

That's because whoever manufactured your equipment was mining with it themselves for 9 months, until it was more profitable sell it to the next sucker.

It's spelled like that is most languages.

Big sharks working now. And they seem to have total control. They can peg BTC price to whatever level they want.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:43:45
Last friday it was 7x year over year. 2 weeks before that it was 8x year over year...
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:30:46
Unless it's all controlled by one guy... which happens to be the case.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:28:25
One can argue that they are making an even larger loss if they don't sell Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-03-06 12:26:46
This is because average is going down. Not BTC going significantly up.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:19:58
So the prediction has been wrong for 255 days straight?
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:03:33
That will protect it against high level attacks, but not low level attacks like sending 1000 Gbps of UDP packets data to the machine's switch port.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:06:41
That same model predicts BTC at $25000 right now.

You can get equally cheap coins. China doesn't set BTC price. The market does. Right now the market thinks the value is lower than it was last week.

Not at all like Manhattan or a financial district. It's thousands of 2-3 story office buildings, stretched all the way from south SF to San Jose. It's like huge suburb. Commercial areas mixed with residential areas. Look and feel is the same as the rest of western US basically. Not nice. Not pretty. Not efficient.
