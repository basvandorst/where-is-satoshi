I am afraid to drag down your effort, but this is very premature. Even if most people on this board aren't willing to accept it, custody is pretty much impossible for average people that are not computer literate.
Give it a few years until we have a scaffolding that works for the developing world.

They actually do. But they usually have assets &gt; liabilities (yes even at huge debt levels) and those assets can be compelled to continue servicing the debt.

Working on it. Expect full compliance.

Bitcoin is poised to experience the same multi tier system.
The Travel Rule  states that financial institutions, including virtual currency  exchanges, pass specific customer information to the next financial institution.

I am asking myself this question regularly but have not come up with a good answer, which probably speaks for Bitcoin.
One possibility I consider is that we won't need money, Bitcoin or Fiat, anymore. If you think about it, we only need a medium of exchange to solve what economists call the "*double coincidence of wants*" -  that both parties to a transaction have to agree to sell and buy each commodity.
I can imagine a future that is fully tokenized, even your labor will have a tradable token. If we have an efficient decentralized market place to price all those billions of tokens we wouldn't need money at all any more. The stock market is a miniature version of this already, however, you can't exchange IBM shares for Google shares easily.

 Why should governments (other than USG) accept USD?

You could hash it into the Blockchain. This way, you will be forever in this block, even for your grand grand children.
Which also reminds me about the absurdity of the ETH Crowed that claim Non-Archiving nodes are just as good as any Full-Node. - All those bloat-chain projects essentially have no history.

Bitcoin ought to survive long-term, if it doesn't it will not be clear that any successor will survive either.
\- As long as people can run nodes it is comparable easy to insure that bitcoin will indeed survive. In order to shut it down, somebody has to literally break into my home and compel me to switch it off. This is really powerful.
\- Through the SegWit part Bitcoin can in theory be scaled infinitely, however, it's really really hard from an engineering perspective. So it may actually take 10 more years until reliable tracks are laid on the second layer.

300k is actually not so much because the payoff would we much higher as well.
It's disconcerting. I hope we can already lay out a plan (and build consensus) of how we deal with the inevitable once it strikes.

A bank could use an Elements Side-Chain.  Banks could issues credit (i.e. make a loan) similar to how lightning works. The Bank-Bitcoin would probably trade at a discount that would reflect the credit-risk of the loan and the counterparty risk of the bank.

Don't forget that those structures are not made to retain the history. - I think the core of an interstellar transaction system such as Bitcoin should be simple and certainly retain all history for everybody forever (not just proofs).
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:22:23
Perhaps. Something like Byteball would be one of the first Side-Chain experiments I would be willing to stake my Bitcoin in.

Thank you for the article. That is spot on. Blockchains are just a very power full tool. But in the end, only the people matter.
\- I wish somebody with more knowledge of constitutional law would start looking into Bitcoin.

People need to believe into the idea. While they could do that before, coordinating them without a blockchain would have been pretty hard.

Bitcoin is a  **single**\-**issue** **religion** (sound money) that is instantiated through a new technology (blockchain).
