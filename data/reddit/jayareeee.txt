We don't have to try, it's pretty obvious from your incoherent rambling.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:32:13
Doesn't bitcoin cash more closely resemble the bitcoin of 4-5 years ago though?  (Segwit is a much larger deviation from the original protocols...)
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:23:45
I've never paid over 30 cents on ethereum even during the kitty craze.  Are you counting complex smart contract gas usage or day to day regular transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:01:55
That's what I mean, it's not a trademark, so anybody can run a twitter account with the same name.  Anybody can fork it and name it after it.  It's public domain and open source.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:07:08
No it's not, JSON REST APIs look nothing like TCP/IP, and I don't think it's a fair comparison (I also write low level TCP/IP code as well as blockchain code, you're comparing apples to oranges.)
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:05:51
I think you're mistaken, even the LN develoipers themselves said the blocksize has to be raised anyway to support the LN scaling...
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:23:54
This guy spams every sub for what it's worth, it's best to block him and move on really.  Absolute garbage.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:21:16
I legit can't tell if this guy has a mental problem or if this level of trolling is intentional.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:34:02
Bitcoin from 4-5 years ago just needed the blocksize code that Satoshi Nakamoto posted in the forums in 2010:
Even Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream, head of bitcoin) said this in 2015:
Segwit failed, and they knew the fix the entire time and still have yet to do it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:22:48
Isn't that true of other coins too?
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:34:10
It's going to cost you around that much just to move it anywhere.  $20 worth of bitcoin is effectively useless now.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:54:51
Isn't bitcoin open source?  Isn't it impossible for someone to "own" bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:52:55
It is that too, do you think bitcoin is better than alts in that context?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:26:18
I've used bitcoin for 8 years, I've mined it for 7 years, I've been developing blockchain code for a few years now also because it's a passion of mine.  I personally believe the bitcoin cash development teams are more reputable from an engineering standpoint in comparison to Luke Jr et al.  I consider myself a part of both communities and that's my take on the situation after years of witnessing it all.  I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:10:42
The problem is that other coins/chains will have second layers **without crippling and artificially limiting the first layer**.  That's what we're all talking about here.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:38:37
Between the top 3 regulated exchanges in the US, all of them have a lot of ETH liquidity too, so I bypass bitcoin entirely and go straight from ETH to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:47:27
Yes they do, sometimes even smaller:
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:44:15
I would say based on this it's an extremely different landscape than last year.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:22:07
You're using the same talking points that I've seen for 12 months now, but riddle me this, why did Adam Back himself say the increase the blocksize to BCH-levels in 2015?
You are being conned and manipulated into thinking these blocksizes are bad.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:20:58
I dunno, I've been trading shitcoins on small exchanges on ETH/ pairings, and I'm *still* getting reasonable liquidity.  I really don't think bitcoin shines in that department anymore.  I had to stop using bitcoin about 8 months ago, moved to ETH to transfer value to/from exchanges.. so it's kind of as good as dead to me other than staring at what I have left.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:54:24
I'm nice to people who aren't spreading misinformation like yourself.  You do more harm than anything, thankfully it appears 95% of people see how incoherent you are.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:11:49
That's actually impressive that you can create keypairs at 3000/sec.  I ran some tests on ECDSA signing and I'm maxing out at 80-100/sec  on a skylake 6700k CPU.  That's in javascript via chrome/firefox, but still.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:42:25
I'm a blockchain software engineer for years now you retard, I'm pretty sure I have a better grasp than your drunken medium rants.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:44:25
That's not how open source works... For example a fork of Ubuntu with XFCE is called Xubuntu, because of that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:06:26
I've been on reddit on different accounts for 10 years now (oldest account).  Where did I say that blocksize upgrades are the ONLY scaling method?  They are part of a suite of ideas and tools to allow the network to grow, everyone knows this.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:30:47
I'm on the developer mailing list for it, can you tell me how the developers are less reputable?  Their unit tests alone look very high quality (on the last DAA update) and upon further research I think they're pretty high quality from what I can see.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:03:24
I really, really hope this happens.  I got my start in programming on basic CPUs/instruction sets, I know we can make this happen if we crowdsource it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:47:56
Lol I've posted him actual links with proof all day today and he ignores them.  He just continues ranting at himself with random gifs without researching anything for himself.  He's probably a few steps away from kidnapping someone and torturing them in his basement.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:19:17
Pretty sure that guy is legit autistic.  Vague gif responses for every single comment with nothing of substance except incoherent ranting?  Dude's got problems.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:19:28
You're right in the fact that bitcoin cash is not bitcoin, but it more closely resembles the bitcoin from 4-8 years ago at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:08
I'm an ethereum developer, so I use the real ethereum (not classic) for my work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:53
1 CME contract will be 5 BTC at $25 per tick.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:50:16
I only know of IOTA's security and wallet problems... what are their plans for scaling?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:46:07
The whitepaper and all code are also written by one guy, so it hasn't really be audited or widely adopted in any way yet.  Curious to see if the dev/user community picks up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:46:13
That won't need to happen, Ethereum devs just increased the blocksize recently because they believe in practical interim scaling solutions while working on longer term plans.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:30
You should watch the Ethereum devcon talks that just came out, they do have quite a lot of scaling plans in motion already.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:52:02
Why not use a currently-working bitcoin chain with larger blocks that doesn't have this artificial limitation?  No need to wait around when we have the network available already?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:25
There are a lot of people who, for 8 years, have used bitcoin as a currency and they're not happy with what has happened to it later this year.  Doesn't make it an attack, just sucks for those who wanted a usable cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:06
The real raiden isn't actually on the mainnet yet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:59:26
Yes, like microraiden is already on the mainnet, and they intend on implementing sharding as well.  Raiden+sharding combined should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:34:03
No, just people on reddit have to have a ton of alts because this sub (like many others) bans people for asking basic legitimate questions sometimes.  Gotta have a stash of 10+ just to have any ability to discuss anything anymore, it's getting bad on this site.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:00:05
It's a shame anybody could call out each of your points as false, and back it up with sources, but they'd be banned for doing so here.
