From what I gather from this incoherent ramble, is that OP is an idiot and should go back to school or better yet castrate or off himself.  Talking about ''elites'' and ''cabals'' in a ~200 bill market is fucking nutter territory. It's peanuts numbnuts, go back to flipping your fucking burgers..

No bitcoin is absolute shit and solves no problem. FFS why is it so hard to get a hold of. You still need the traditional banking system, but you get to pay extra for the privilege of holding something that can go to zero tomorrow and has no real use. Awesome..

Who is ''we'' ? Is BTC the only asset you own ? Or are you one of the ones that actually believed you would get a Lambo ? BTC was always a high risk potentially high reward gamble. The bubble popped, only ones ''fucked'' are the ones who have no business being in any speculative asset in the first place..
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:21:01
1-2K level would be a reasonable entry point. It's probably going to zombie around sideways for a few years around that range. Another bubble will form eventually and the HODLers will be taken to the cleaners again lol.

If the SEC regulates this market bitcoin will loose all the little fundamental value it ever had. It's supposed to be unregulated, that's the whole point. It's supposed to be digital cash essentially. It has no legitimate use beyond that. BTC will go down to reflect it's real value. Darknet markets, money laundering etc. It literally has no use outside these venues.

HODLers remind of the goldbugs. Simple minded folk who treat an investment/trade as it were a religion. You should never be married to any trade, in any asset.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:06:02
Lol you know how common this is ? You have CFD, futures for everything. That's how it works. Why the hell would I want ''real'' bitcoin if I can trade on more trusted exchanges, short and even get leverage if I want to ? The thing is, most people are in it for a quick buck, and little else.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:40:39
Thinking crypto will have wide spread adoption is the same as thinking gold will be once again used as currency. Bitcoin is deflationary and as such horrible as a currency. Also, why would any government/central bank allow a competing currency on it's soil ? Controlling the money monopoly is literally one of the most important pillars of government power. All they have to do is declare bitcoin illegal and that's all she wrote. You can forget about any widespread adoption then.

Again you are talking about cryptocurrency. Currency being the key word here. There is no need for a cryptocurrency in any other capacity than crime or crisis. What can bitcoin do for my company that a regular currency and banking system can not do more efficiently ?

Lol why ? Fuck them. If you are really this stupid, you deserve no sympathy. Look at this sub. ''MOON'' ''HODL'' and shit like that. These are degenerate gamblers. I will laugh my ass off, if this puts people on the street..
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:51:18
But blockchain has nothing to do with the value of bitcoin, or bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is just one application for blockchain technology. Bitcoin only has real value for shady dealings and it's really hard to determine how big that market is. Plus other cryptos can be used for that as well. Although understandably this is where size matters. Decentralisation in itself is pretty much irrelevant as long as the transaction continue to happen. I really can't see an investment thesis for bitcoin other than for example a crisis currency or illegal business currency. IMO the litmus test for bitcoin will be the next bigger recession. When money moves out of assets, will it also move out of bitcoin ? Or in to bitcoin like gold. That's the real test. Markets are moving into bubble territory, so right now it's impossible to say if the current price is justified or is it just froth. Since it's use cases are so limited, I suspect the latter.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:36:13
Why not ? Outside of the criminal world, bitcoin is essentially useless ? Why would it not fizzle out like a million useless products before it ?

Did you even read my post ? 
What country would benefit from bitcoin ? Give up your legal tender and in exchange get what ? Zero control over your money supply and a deflationary currency. Wow what a good deal. 
If the US makes exchanges illegal for example, that would be enough to kill bitcoin. Reasons are many, darknet, pedophilia, terrorism etc. So much bad shit is being done with bitcoin, it would be no problem to find an excuse.

The word ''delusional'' is right. You act like bitcoin is the only game in town. It's not. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:02:29
Why would it be blocked by my bank if I'm doing nothing illegal ? Why would I be worried about monetary policy ? Especially now that central banks are starting to tighten. Currencies are boring, barely move at all, bitcoins are penny stock level volatile compared to currencies. Why am I here ? Speculation and trying to understand what people need bitcoin for today. What's the point of holding on to something that is supposedly a currency ? You are not supposed to want to hold on to currency, why are people doing it ? Why are people thinking a deflationary currency is a good thing ? Why are people thinking governments and central banks would give up power over currency ? 
And I can't find good answers to these questions. It's either HODLMOONLAMBO type animal noises  (the burger flipping community I assume) and starry eyed libertarian idealism. I'm trying to find out how much of crypto is actually used for intended purpose and how much of the market is speculative money.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:09:32
Why jesper ? We are past peak hype it seems. For something that has no real use and is owned only for the sake of speculation by the overwhelming majority, i would say 2000-3000 is generous, if the bottom falls out.
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:00:31
We are seeing lower highs, every time it bounces off that support. There seems to be little appetite for it around the 10K region. Right now, looking at the chart. I don't feel FOMO at all. Looks like I have all the time in the world. Seeing as the hype buyers have been loosing money for some time now, you gotta wonder when their patience runs out.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:42:46
Because this sub consist of mostly low education degenerate gamblers, working low wages jobs. It's literally all they have to hope for a better life. Search Youtube. You will find plenty of stories of people who've gone bust. Delivery drivers, construction workers etc. ''Investing'' in bitcoin, because ''they don't trust the banksters''. The irony is that the ''banksters'' can do their bankstering here unhindered. It's literally a free buffet to predatory minded finance specialists.

Testing 6500ish for resistance. If it breaks trough 6000, it will probably end up somewhere between 2000-3000. 6000 is such a psychological level, that if broken, it will be a complete free fall. Might be a good time to look for shorts around 6500.

I would think of buying somewhere between 1000-2000$. Before that, no way. There is still too much hope here. We need to start seeing news of people loosing their houses, loosing families, suicides etc. Then it will be attractive, because people have short memories and there is a fool born every minute.

I was just thinking about it. If a lot of people are really way over their heads in crypto. There will be suicides, people loosing everything, just media overall filled with sob stories. Could show bitcoin as a cautionary tale and put dark clouds over cryptos for a while. 
If that happens, sub 1000$ sounds reasonable.

@_date: 2018-11-19 17:30:22
Yup, the overall market is the litmus test for BTC. If equities go down, then bitcoin, if it truly is digital gold, should go up. If BTC goes down with the market, this whole BTC bubble was just desperate late cycle yield seeking. I've always thought it was the latter..

Gold was parabolic in 2012, what on earth would make you buy then ? It's like buying bitcoin at 18K. You never buy into parabolic markets, unless it's a quick trade.

@_date: 2018-11-19 10:20:26

What fundamentals ? Fundamentally bitcoin is worthless. What are you talking about ?
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:40:28
Not me! Said it was a bubble then and am saying it now. As did anyone who had actual experience in any market. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:15:58


It was not. Lower highs every time it bounced, the chart overall looks like a classical bubble, plus it's fundamentally funny money. It was obvious, not unlikely. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:01:48
Yeah and how many market participants use it for that reason ? Less than 1% ? I bet drug trade usage is many times that. It's a bitch to use and I can do the same thing with other cryptos and services. Your use case does not justify the current valuation imo.

How the hell did you manage to loose money in gold ? It went pretty much straight up after the 2008 crash. If you got in 2005ish, you made good money. 2005 it was pretty obvious we were in a bubble. Construction sites had literal bums getting great pay. If you could push a wheelbarrow, you had a job.
