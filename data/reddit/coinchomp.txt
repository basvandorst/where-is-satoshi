Summary: I used Coinbase's backup payment mechanism to purchase a large amount of bitcoin (usd $13k) with credit. Paying off half of the credit-card debt using gold &amp; silver.

He's polarizing. After a few interactions you'll pretty much know whether you love or hate the guy.

Second this. Follow  -- never a dull moment. He's a modest dude, but scary-smart and really knows his shit. Plus he don't give a F.

Fair enough lol.

There's no wrong way to buy a money printer.

How do you figure? The way I see it -- if my miner ships within a month from now 3 Terrahashes gets me around 0.75 BTC per day. Since I paid around 15 BTC for the miner I'll break even (in bitcoin) in around 3 weeks. Even if it took me 2 months to break even, I'm still good. My estimated ROI over the course of 1 year is positive.

Sheeshh. I just checked the mining calc and your number was not far off... Damned difficulty. Stop rising so I can mine you.

Right. Although there is the possibility that KnC will over-deliver on Hashrate -- but unfortunately that's just conjecture at this stage. So I can only assume that I'll be getting 3 TH/s. So based on this assumption I'm either making a trivial profit (1~2 coins), breaking even, or worse. (Yawn)

bitcoinwisdom has had some chart strangeness in recent days. Not actual trading I think.

+1 for using 'bits' -- my preferred way to refer to the satoshi unit. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:55:23
or better yet -- just go right to satoshis (and as I've seen others smartly propose, start calling satoshis 'bits')
