I was always unclear about one aspect of how p2p pools worked, but I think this actually clears it up for me. My impression of p2p at first was that you set up a node, connected your mining software to it, and that was it. But then I started looking into it a bit more and found all this talk about fees, which seemed to contradict the whole idea (I mean, who would the fee go to if nobody is in charge of the pool?) But from what you wrote I gather that there would be no fees if I set up a node myself, but there might be if I connected to a public p2p node run by someone else. But the only reason I'd want to connect to a public node is because I thought it was somehow too hard to set up a p2p node myself, right?

I will never stop blocking ads. As far as I'm concerned, all advertising is a form of mental assault, or at the very least it's an attempt to control my thoughts against my will. I also have a huge problem filtering out background noise in any form, which includes banner ads flickering in my peripheral vision. I'm apparently incapable of developing "banner blindness." So I block ads almost obsessively. 
But there's a larger issue at work here, too. Most "content" on the internet is nothing but an amusing distraction. It's stuff I look at to kill time, to fuck off at work, to amuse myself when I have nothing better to do. It may be your bread and butter, but it's just mental junk food for me. And if it went away tomorrow I'd probably just be slightly better off for having one less distraction. 
With that said, good content, delivered conveniently and at the right price, IS something I'm willing to pay for. Netflix is the obvious example - I'll happily pay for that, but I won't pay for cable. And given my hatred of ads, I'll always pay for an ad-free version of an app for my phone or tablet. I'll also donate to the very rare site or cause or whatever that I truly feel is exceptional. 
So-called "content creators" have got to come to terms with the reality of today's media market: supply far outstrips demand and your product is worth a tiny fraction of what it once was.

That's a very informative blog, but I hate that I have to enable JavaScript due to its theme.

When I first found out about ASIC rigs I thought they were money printers, but then I actually did some reading and learned about this pesky thing called "difficulty" and my dreams came crashing down. Heh... I did still place an order with BFL, but I got into bitcoin mining as a hobby and if I never make a profit doing it, so be it. At least my current GPU hardware has other uses.

Everyone always recommends this, but I've looked at it and it doesn't seem straightforward at all, plus people are asking for astronomically high prices.
So are there any traditional exchanges that even work in the US any more? I remember those halcyon days of, oh, March of this year, when I thought I could just get a verified account on MtGox and be on my merry way! HA!! Right.
All the bitcoins I've ever acquired have been through mining or have been tiny amounts given to me.

Upvoting for "stainless *steal*", intentional or not.

It really wasn't that much different than it is now.

That was my thought, too. I paid for a Little Single in dollars, before the price doubling. I'm pretty much betting on the dollars-to-BTC ratio going up significantly at some point in the future.

I was under the impression that anyone from any Commonwealth country could live in any other Commonwealth country for as long as they like. So Canada, the UK, and Australia would all be interchangeable, essentially. Am I wrong?

Because it's new and they're conservative (not politically, although that might also be true, but in general). One of the cornerstones of conservative thought is fear of new ideas, especially those with the potential to upset the status quo.

Same here! I'm unnaturally excited about this! I'll be ordering tonight when I get home.
@_date: 2013-09-16 14:40:30
Yeah, totally! I wish I could give that post more than just one upvote.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:21:27
Ordered my Little Single on March 18th 2013, got it on October 31st. Yeah, I don't think I'll be ordering from them again.

I tried mining just to see how it works. I'll probably never reach ROI on the few hundred bucks I spent on GPU hardware, but I mined just enough before the massive difficulty spike to get a handful of Block Erupters and stay in the game, at least at a hobbyist level.

"ATM machine." So that would be an automatic teller machine machine, right?
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:20:52
Well, that's why I asked! Thanks!

No need to get all butthurt. Like I said, I wasn't talking about political conservatism.
