 Bro.. It takes seconds to convert bitcoin to cash.. What service are u using???
I don't think you've actually bought or sold bitcoins.. Because 1 it doesn't take much time to transfer BTC from a wallet to another.. Secondly, settling transactions requires internet but sending BTC doesn't.. Which is how offline cold storage works and paper wallets exist. 
I see the argument you're trying to make.. But try using BTC it first.
As a currency it's problematic since not many merchants use it. That stability will come when it's more stable. The dollar has lost it's value tremendously since the US went off the gold standard in the 1970s. So.. now oil makes it stable along with it being trusted by the world over. The same attribute we give the dollar we can instill within BTC.
I agree it's not like the dollar. But in terms of manipulation, banks manipulate fiat currency more than BTC.
+1, though for expressing your views.. You typed a lot

Well, with all do respect..
Ive got several small businesses.
- That's good. I do respect that. 
Bitcoin is nothing more than an easily traded stock
- it's not stock since the regulators in the US and other markets won't allow people to trade it like typical stock.
At most it's just tracked. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has really only launched a bitcoin price index (NYXBT).
So... Overall the SEC has made it hard for companies to put out IPO's without being fined. Etc...
...being manipulated by people
- What? It's a blockchain backed digital currency?? Nobody has ever cracked that! It's impossible to manipulate bitcoins. 
Now let me say, wallets have been comprised, exchanges hacked, and yes even software like bitcoin related apps. But not the bitcoin ledger. 
... and is terrible as a currency at present time.
Well... That's just your opinion. It's terrible because people haven't trusted it and don't know enough about it. And hear a lot of misconstrued information on what BTC is and isn't. It's like the kid in highschool who gets a bad rap not so much because he's bad, but the gang he hangs out with does so much mischievous activity. That his reputation (blockchain) gets a bad rap.
 I'm not saying BTC isn't risky.. all I'm saying is it's trustworthy. The blockchain anyway. That's why financial powers that be are so adverse to it. They don't know jack about how it works. So, like a baby that doesn't like spinach.. It just spits it out.
