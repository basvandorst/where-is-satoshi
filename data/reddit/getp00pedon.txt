I'm all for bitcoin taking over but what says anyone in italy buys bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:58:59
Man, this might really set BTC back. Although, maybe for the better. It could be another reminder to not trust centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:55:23
Yes, and when the IRS comes looking for the source of that money you deposited and you don't have proof where it came from you are fucked...You can't just say I saved it from mowing lawn for 20 years. You need concrete proof or they will hit you with tax evasion and all sort of stuff. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:47:51
how are they jailing people that are trying to leave the country? is it illegal for citizens to leave croatia?
@_date: 2016-08-19 04:00:02
ah yeah, that would be cool. currently you need wait a least 24 hours to receive amazon payment to your bank account. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 02:19:37
there is not much work left on there worth the pay unless you have private quals or masters but I'm sure many people that wait on amazon payments would rather use bitcoin if it meant faster payment. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:27:15
not to mention it's essentially illegal to have money under you mattress. If you ever want to spend it the IRS will give you hell and probably get you for evading taxes unless you have perfect records of where every dollar came from. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:40:01
they have very high fees. that's all i can say.
@_date: 2016-08-19 02:45:09
also we have no idea if satoshi is only one person
@_date: 2016-08-21 14:57:11
really? i thought everyone here knew he was crazy bath salt man.
@_date: 2016-08-19 04:11:37
is mturk allowing this?
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:07:24
lol try depositing 100k in a bank without proof of where it came from and see what happens...money is guilty until proven innocent
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:20:57
@_date: 2016-08-19 12:32:14
ah ok. I understand now. Well, good luck. I I would give it a try.
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:33:06
Satoshi  obviously had a great vision into what bitcoin was capable of. I'm sure he thought about the possible value of his coins in the future and governments possible dislike of him.
@_date: 2016-09-05 04:22:48
maybe their legal department thought that could be considered aiding  someone to commit an illegal act.
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:38:14
maybe she would be more down with first name craig middle name wright?
@_date: 2016-07-29 22:55:22
can we please not let the  people at r/btc take over. it's just constant doom and gloom, fud ect. I honestly like the censorship that happens here. it keeps their bs away.
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:29:41
he is also a top poster in @_date: 2016-07-12 14:50:59
our entire system is corrupt. :(
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:03:54
Oh it's that guy again. I watched enough to hear his voice and turned it off. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 19:30:10
did you send your bitcoins to anyone that might use them for something illegal? 
@_date: 2016-07-17 19:45:52
if he sold his coins to someone they might have used them on a gambling site or something...who knows how far coinbase is tracking
@_date: 2016-07-30 05:37:29
they had 100g and the legal limit is 60g. not really that big of a deal.
i'm not a fan of ver but I don't think selling fun sticks is wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:04:37
really? but you quoted an article from a us author mainly about shootings in the us. that is what I was speaking on because you can't understand the article. sorry :( do a little research on ssri drugs...I'm tired of feeding you baby.
lol oh no you are a machinist now. oh lordy this troll gets better and better. maybe you can make a spoon to feed yourself with in the machine shop?
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:46:41
You totally missed the whole point of the article. They have been trying to link types of weapons in common to killings. aka"assault weapons". He his trying to say they might need to link they types of drugs they are taking.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:39:54
The article is a US article so federal firearms bans... Obviously the current restictions in germany did nothing to prevent. They are also taking about tighter restrictions in germany as well. If he did not get the gun off the darknet he could have bought a katana and actually killed more people. 
What do I propose? No gun control. Less ssri's prescribed for depression...They do more harm than good. also Someone can make a gun in like 2 hours from parts from home depot.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:31:07
"Every Mass Shooting Shares One Thing In Common &amp; It’s NOT Weapons" 
Are you taking srri drugs? or are you delusional? or both? Your first post that I replied to was a quote from an article written in the us by a us author. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:16:08
I agree it is bullshit. but... Who knows how coinbase and our government looks at. If you ordered from an online shop coinbase can probably tell that because it would be processed through bitpay or something of the like. If you take coins out of coinbase and send them directly to someone who sends them to a gambling site it might trigger alerts. people have been getting their accounts closed...
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:56:51
I would just download a wallet.  I don't trust others with my money.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:00:59
9mm handguns would be under their ban as well unless it shot like 1 round and had no clip.

@_date: 2016-07-24 19:51:28
ban all metal!
what's sad is if they were allowed pistols they could have defended themselves...
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:25:39
lol that's what the lizard people want you to think
@_date: 2016-07-15 17:04:37
so you are saying I should buy bitcoins?
