Isn't one of the selling points of bitcoin that you can avoid the fees of the banking system? If you are paying a premium, you aren't benefitting from that advantage. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:26:31
Despite it being completely irrelevant to what I said, I will play along with your analogy...
I'm not discussing an antiquated, forgotten technology, though. I'm talking about the state of banking *today*. What you are essentially saying is that I should throw my iPhone 5s into the nearest lake because the iPhone 9 is *gonna be awesome*.
The future of crypto-currency and its impact on financial transactions is indeed exciting, but that doesn't mean that the current system is a jack booted storm trooper.

I agree with everything you said, but...
Where the hell do you people bank, anyway? I get $20 worth of ATM fees refunded each month and my deposits are instantaneous. I can take a picture with my phone of a check and have the money in my account that same day! Hell, my bank actually credits my direct deposits as soon as they are pending (sometimes 3-4 days before they are actually deposited). Someone even stole my check card number (I still don't know how) and bought $500 worth of Walmart gift cards. I called the bank and they immediately verified my identity, recorded an affidavit of me stating it was fraud, and refunded my money IMMEDIATELY! They've financed two cars and a home for me at below the market rate. If you use the banking system responsibly, there is no reason that it has to be your enemy.

I do not think that Dorian is the man behind Bitcoin, but I do agree with her assertion that 1700 words from different contexts is not enough to properly analyse the authorship of the whitepaper.

Oh, the irony
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:27:42
Because the supply (sellers) is willing to offload at lower prices and the demand (buyers) is not sufficient enough to drive prices higher. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:05:01
You will find that any negative bitcoin news is met with hostility and derision here. There is some great information here, but just accept that almost all involved have a strong bias, both ideologically and financially.

This isn't an attempt to be a breaking story. It's a look at where we are, six months after the arrest. That's sort of covered in the first paragraph.

He could still use a signature and deny that he is Dorian, even if he is.

I think it's simplistic to blame an article when the price has been in a downtrend for so long (relatively, of course).
I love the fact that all of these supposed free market, libertarian bitcoin holders are so certain that bitcoin is undervalued and that every priced drop is a conspiracy.

Apple is the most profitable business in the history of the world. They have never made a product catering to the third world and never will. This is a completely specious argument.

I want you to sit down and *really* think about what you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:27:27
And that won't prove anything, either. If Satoshi wants to deny he is Dorian, whether it is true or not, a PGP key won't stop it.

Binge drinker/spender here. Leave your ATM card at home. In fact, leave all your cards at home, minus ID. Nothing more embarrassing than trying to pay for a bottle of champagne at a strip club with a Safeway Shopper card.

I don't think it can be argued that there are many users who are far more ideological than economically knowledgeable.

This subreddit is honestly not the best place to learn about Bitcoin, to be completely honest. Most of the participants are either driven by ideology and/or financial interest, so they are not the most objective bunch. There are, however, many, many rational redditors who will share insightful perspectives. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:26:06
Because almost all merchants who accept bitcoin are instantly converting to fiat, which drives prices down further.

All of this is irrelevant. Using a PGP key isn't some sort of truth serum. If Satoshi wanted to deny that he is Dorian, whether true or not, the usage of the key doesn't matter.

Yes, we would know whether that comment was legit. It would change nothing about the Dorian story, though.

I wish there was a middle ground, to be honest. BTC centric sites tend to be overtly glowing and optimistic due to their financial and/or ideological position. Independent news sources typically don't know enough about BTC to make an informed assessment. Either side of the coin is biased.

Paypal averages 9 million per day, so that would mean that Bitcoin is doing about 0.73% of that number.
edit: And this number is probably significantly skewed, as the blockchain will not account for people moving their own coins from one wallet to another. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:00:35
This is the question that Bitcoin still cannot answer. All the rest is fundamentalist garbage. 
It seems you are approaching Bitcoin the right way. Not enough people are clear on what Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin is not.

Everyone here seems convinced Krugman is either a liar, ignorant about Bitcoin, or both. There is a possibility that he is informed and still doesn't think it's a great idea. The self-righteousness of many Bitcoin adopters, who have made it as much about ideology as technology, is counterproductive to their own means and they don't even see it.

Awesome prices... until you factor in shipping. I am also a youth coach. Wanted to order some new training bibs, which came to $29.99. Great deal, but the cheapest shipping option was an additional $40. Went from great deal to an awful one. I can get 12 of an almost identical product on Amazon (with shipping) for less than half.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:22:17
You're missing the point. The cost per transaction is a fraction of a percent compared to btc. Also, if someone steals my identity and makes credit card charges fraudulently, I am compensated by my company (I had a card number stolen and someone made $3500 in charges, which my company refunded to me in 24 hours). The decentrailzed nature of btc makes that impossible.

I was just commenting that you have to consider the cost of those safety nets when talking about credit card operating costs. The amounts that Visa spends daily is almost irrelevant, as they are doing much more than simply processing payment.

The fact is that no amount of education or market study can predict this market. Hell, we can't create prediction models for markets that are a hundred years old with more data points by a factor of millions. This is all unknown territory.
I'm glad that I have maintained my interest in Bitcoin as merely that, an interest. The money I have spent was not so much in interest of investment or ideology, but in hopes of participating in this clever little experiment.
