Never used one. What is the cost of the transaction?
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:57:56
I could have gotten more creative but for someone to post such an outlandish question i thought it would be the simplest. Curious what's your suggestion?
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:42:23
I would suggest taking the amount of what a mortgage would be and using that to buy Bitcoin using dca. That way you retain the property in the event that things go south in your finances. If they do you can cash out your Bitcoin as an emergency backup. All the while retaining paid for house.

Well obviously he has the means to pay the mortgage if he's asking. Duh. Then again he may be doing a balloon that would really be fucked. Poa gives one the right to control just ask any trust manager.

Home equity. Same as mortgage.  House as collateral. I’m done. Go piss piss up rope
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:24:44
Obviously, you misunderstood my suggestion. I would not touch the house therefore no financial institution would be involved. Like i indicated figure out the payment on a 300k mortgage and invest that much in btc monthly. I assumed poa came with rights of ownership. If so he would be able to implement a mortgage. Your turn financial wizard.

Dumbass he stated he was asking about getting a mortgage to buy Bitcoin. What is your  problem. I'm done. Go find another argument. From reading other post i see your looking. I'm not your guy.

So you keep a USD wallet on GDAX and use that as your funding account. Do you trade back and forth from BTC to USD.  If so are you saying there is no fee?

At this rate we could see it by morning.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:33:34
Had an issue yesterday with GDAX where my debit card was billed and transaction cancelled. Having trouble reaching them at the moment and website says issue was Visa's fault should be corrected automatically. Hmmm.
Edit: Issue corrected.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:43:06
I just bought in on coinbase per GDAX price was 11,120 coin issued a 11,175 per the index price has not even reach that.  WTF.

Thanks.  Let's hope the ride is good. its definitely going to be an experience.
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:09:35
ok  please don't call me stupid but what is the calculation for determining purchase price using amount invested USD and no. of satoshi received.  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:31:26
how do you guys keep track of the bitcoin price on purchases. Say you purchase a bitcoin for a dollar amount and get the bitcoin amount how do you track the price at the time of purchase for dollar cost averaging.. I'm using coinbase and transferring to GDAX. don't see anyway to keep an index.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:09:24
What's the general consensus.  Will there be a dip later this evening?
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:18:34
Thanks.  Just installed the blockfolio and its pretty cool.  How do you track your transaction fees when using blockfolio as they are not included in the transaction value.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:49:08
No it takes a few days.  The cheapest and quickest way is ACH wire.  Supposedly you can do a bank purchase from your checking account and buy immediately but you wont get your BTC until the transfer clears. not sure what price you will get as I did a debit card purchase and the BTC value was 55 higher that what the exchange showed.  If you try it to buy BTC just do a small amount to start with.

Don't look back tomorrow is another day.  We all f-ed up. I'm 60 and have pissed away three fortunes.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:27:44
You can deposit money in the USD account on coinbase and transfer it to the exchange.  I just didn't have any there at the time. You can buy on coinbase and probably get an inflated price like I did but it will take a few days for the money to clear and get your BTC. Supposedly you would get the purchase price but like in my case it would probably be a a higher cost.  I'm learning. Just glad it wasn't a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:42:02
Thanks.  That probably what I am going to do.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:40:24
That my intentions for the time being.  I'm not young so I'm hoping it does something good in about five years.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:21:14
I take that as sound advice. Glad to know someone who is connected. Thanks. LOL
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:41:01
Great advice. Thanks.
