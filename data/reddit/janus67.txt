Came for my Bitcoin and SC2 strats
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:19:01
Been that way for a while. I stopped watching prices in 2014/2015 when I got out of mining. I keep a loose idea on it now, but I don't worry about it or my other coins as I'm not depending on them.

I just finished reading this this morning. Thank you for taking the time to write that up, it was written in a very easy to understand way that hadn't been explained to me before (and I've been following BTC, off and on, since 2012/13)

While super misleading, bitcoin is super unusable for any sort of smaller transactions. I had originally setup autopayment/exchange on my miner, if I left it at .001btc to be paid out I would receive nothing (if it would complete at all) because of how high fees are. So I increased the payout to .005btc (should take a few weeks to get there with my single gpu multi-mining), but I will still loose 20%(ish) of the value (at current rates) when it comes time to exchange/transfer to my wallet. That's ridiculous. Once this one pays out I'll switch to get paid out in LTC as the fees are significantly lower and if I want to exchange for BTC later I can do that.

I think bitcoin cash will begin at coinbase on January 1 (or at least soon after that?)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:30
Does that mean that if I were to try to send some value of BTC to another address but only pay 1sat for the fee the money will forever be stuck as an unconfirmed transaction? Or can I recall it and have the money come back or edit the fee in the blockchain to make sure it goes through?

I think the problem right now is that segwit is/will be optional, and LN requires segwit. So until pretty much everyone sets up a segwit address/wallet and all of the exchanges use it (coinbase, etc) then it is mostly a non-starter in my opinion. I personally think it would be better if it was just required or setup at the same time as a wallet so it would be automatic. I imagine the majority of people that own at least some Bitcoin do not know what segwit is or how to utilize it. (Keeping in mind that this sub, while popular, is small in the grand scheme of things, and I bet that there's a non-insignificant proportion of those that even sub to this subreddit that dont know what it is.

Litecoin has been sitting around $300 and up over 100% still in a week

Very cool to finally see one in cbus!

They used to, but apparently they fall down

What's the difference between a mouse mat, mouse pad, and mousepad? All 3 are listed on the products listing, may want to clean that up :)

You can see that on various resale locations (various subs here and forums elsewhere). The main benefit (as well as a con depending on the integrity of the buyer and seller) is the buyer protections which there are none in a basic btc transaction.

Sold my 02 Accord last year with 75 on it. Got it handed down with 15 on it in 08/09, and worked from home most days. Sold it and a BTC and bought a Tesla

If you bought apple at $8 a share pre iPhone you'd be up there too if sold at the peak

To pay for things that don't take Bitcoin? Tesla doesn't take btc, so if I want to buy a car I need to exchange for usd.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:54:03
Yep, I would like to replace my almost 20 year old car and fortunately I've held btc (and some alts) since 2013 so while I missed out on ath I can sell some to take profits and enjoy the investment
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:44:14
I'm in a similar situation. The only 'money' that I have put into any of my crypto was mining. Then basically forgot about it for a couple years after it dropped off a good deal then.
I'm definitely not selling everything I have, but I have used some of what I've earned to buy things that I didn't need to use my salary for, which is nice.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:49:22
I'm still up, overall, but had planned to sell some for a car down payment, which is slowly decreasing
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:14
yep dropping fast now

Coffee isn't bad for you, only when you add all of the sugar and cream and junk to it.

If I did that is be out in a month after selling the rest of mine to pay electric bills. I'm holding my last one and change. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:02:59
My dollar that I earn can buy significantly more than a btc that I would trade/buy/mine.
I can't make a mortgage payment, buy groceries, or pay for my insurance or other bills with BTC like I can with my pay checks.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:08:59
That shows even further volatility
@_date: 2018-07-21 17:04:15
Tesla only takes wire/ach transfer and personal/cashier check. 
I paid for some of my new car with btc (and a couple alts) but had to do it the old fashioned way of sell/transfer

The vast majority of mining any coins, and especially bitcoin is not profitable unless power is 100% covered. And even then any return on investment can be months to years out (banking on price of the currency to stay or rise as well as difficulty not increasing too high)
Tldr: you missed the boat by 3+ years
