This is becoming a huge usability problem!!! Mainstream users will not understand or want to care about the number of 'unspent outputs' their transfer is made up of. If they have to care about it because it affects the fees so much, then we are screwed!

 I have an IG account, but somehow I completely failed to find GBP priced. Thanks

Never tried it. I'll create an account and see how the rates are.

Looking at coinfloor, their exchange is about £1 spread, then 0.38% taker fee, it then costs £5 to fund your account, and my bank charges more than £20 to do the international transfer.
Buying £10,000 of BTC would have the total cost of 1%. If you did smaller amounts the fee would be much higher.

They want proof of address and photo ID. Could someone tell me roughly the GBP price of BTC before I go through the verification?

Thanks I've signed up and you correct. Comes in just under 1% with payment via Debit Card. Shame the weekly limit is £200. I am hoping my request to get a highly limit gets accepted.

By my calculations that is about a 0.6% cost. Which might not be good for other investments. But for trying to buy BTC with GBP's from a UK bank account, it is not terrible.

Also who is going to buy $20 of groceries and pay $4 tx fee (the current fee my wallet suggests).

The four exchanges seem to be: 
* Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange Co. Ltd (Approved for bitcoin)
* Bit Arg Exchange Tokyo Co. Ltd (Approved for bitcoin)
* FTT Corporation (Approved for bitcoin)
* Xtheta Corporation (Approved for bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, ripple, litecoin, ethereum classic, NEM, monacoin, and counterparty tokens)
I am assuming this is Xtheta's site - 
 but pretty shocking the login form is not HTTPS (secured)!!!!!
