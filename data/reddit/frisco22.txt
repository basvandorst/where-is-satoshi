No, p = 2^256 - 2^224 + 2^192 + 2^96 - 1

Bitcoin uses **secp256k1** not **p-256**. Different curves with different properties. 
p-256 `y^2 = x^3-3x+41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291 `
secp256k1 `y2 = x3 + 7`

You can do it, with slightly different security considerations. 
Make a private key, send Bitcoin to its address, sign a transaction spending it to the final destination which is `nLockTime`'d for a future date, destroy the private key once the first transaction has confirmed. 
This works, but you need to trust that the person doing it has only signed one transaction during the window and actually successfully destroyed the key. A significant number of confirmations is extremely desirable to prevent malleability problems, and in the future CLTV does away with these problems entirely.
You can do slightly more complex systems with a multisignature script that requires just a single person of the group to have properly handled their keys to make the system safe (say, a 5-of-5). Even if 4-of-5 collude to spend it before the time intended with the `nLockTime` they are thwarted by the 5th not having signed.

Why throw away the little quantum resistance we have with poor practise? Might as well use what we have got.

Re-using addresses breaks Bitcoins existing quantum resistance, you shouldn't ever be doing that anyway. If you've designed systems around it, now is the time to go back and undo the damage.

Lamport signatures are quantum resistant. We don't use this today because they are enormous (16,000 bytes) compared with ECDSA (65 bytes), and because re-use of them exposes your private key. If the need for them becomes apparent they can be soft forked in Bitcoin in very short order.

No ECDSA curve is. Bitcoin itself is partly QC resistant due to use of blinded public keys.

Better tell people loudly not to do it then, and berate wallets which support it. Exchanges can do their part and refuse to make withdrawals to one address twice, good wallets like Bread already *hide* used addresses from their users and have window for re-use to happen in that form.
