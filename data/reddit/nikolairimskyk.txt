I've been very pleased. Today marks my 7th transaction. First one took about 12 hours, as they had to call me to verify; the rest have taken less than 30 minutes. Bought 60mBTC yesterday and today. Prices are a bit higher than Bitstamp, but worth it considering the speed at which transactions have been happening. Hopefully they stay around forever, as it's been nice to be able to pick up a quick little bit of BTC when the prices are dipping.

I'm applying the federal and provincial tax rate of 13% for each sale (New Brunswick, Canada, HST rate). I'm not sure if capital gains will apply, but I'm keeping careful records just in case.
I was surprised that they shut me down so quickly. I was more than happy to oblige to their original request to not offer bitcoins with PayPal purchases, but they changed their mind it seems. 2 days to get an affidavit notarized, over the weekend, isn't a lot of time.

I agree. This is completely true and understandable. The amount of chargebacks were most likely high in comparison to other e-commerce sites. The time committed to investigate these was costing them money. I can see this as a reason for them to not want to do business with me. But I was more than willing to change my business model to satisfy their terms (which I should have understood more fully than I thought I did prior to this fiasco). I just wished for a tad bit more time to come back into compliance. Of course, even after becoming compliant, there must be a cost involved for them to ensure I remained compliant. I would probably have my service flagged, which would just create added work load for their staff. They chose the simplest solution and I don't fault them for it. I'm just sending out a warning to others to make sure this doesn't happen to them.

Buy one get one free.... Or should it be, buy two and get them each at half price?

I shall. Did not know such subreddit existed.

Just a few hundred USD. Money would come in, and I'd send it back out for advertising and other business stuff. Fortunately all my business expenses also had my cc on file for backup, so there was no interruption of service. Frustrated that I can't use PayPal for purchasing now, though.

I do ship to the US, free shipping applies to my American neighbors as well. :)

I think this is probably the reason. Here is the affidavit they wanted me to sign notarize:


will comply with PayPal's policy regarding the use of PayPal Accounts to
operate an e-currency exchange business. I understand that PayPal may not
be used to operate a currency exchange, bureau de change or check cashing
business, including the sales of bitcoins **or the free offer of bitcoins
with purchase**. I further affirm that any further detected violation of the
policy may result in the immediate closure of, or restriction to access to
the account.
I bolded the area that specifically applied to my business model.
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:53:31
I think it's set up to choose currency based on IP. I ship almost everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:52:06
Not sure. I believe it's part if the Big Commerce software. I have USD set as the default currency. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:50:00
This is most likely the case and in my correspondence with PayPal, I was more than happy to cease this business model, in order to continue to use their service. I just feel I wasn't given the chance.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:36:09
Nope. I can withdrawal it in six months lol
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:40:58
I very well could be drawing the wrong conclusion. They did mention that they considered me a Money Services Business, which I am neither licensed to operate nor registered for with the Canadian government. It could have something to do with FINCEN.
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:20:06
My friend mentioned Stripe to me. It's on my to do list. I think integration might be difficult, as I didn't notice them in the Big Commerce list of providers. I really need to learn more coding. Perhaps once my sales volume increases I can find somebody that knows what they're doing, but I'm being pretty stingy right now. I'm spending most of my money on marketing and product stock. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:36:25
I wish I had of talked with a lawyer ahead of time. I can definitely understand their stance, but not giving me time to rectify my business model is what I'm upset with. 2 days, over the weekend to find a notary in a small city, while working midnight shifts at my primary occupation... seems like it was just easier for them to sever ties, than to monitor my future compliance.
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:35:47
I think I'm just going full bitcoin. I'll cater to the people using what I believe is the future of currency. But for anybody else thinking of using this method of marketing, your way sounds much better :)

I'll edit my post so that everyone can see it, as I'm getting a lot of requests for it. I hadn't expected such response from this post.
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:43:01
I checked with Moneris, who operates a hosted solution for Canadians. They would not allow me to use their services and BitPay/Coinbase on the same domain. I would have to use .net/.org or a different domain name all together, separate from the site where I would accept payments through Moneris.
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:45:16
It's been insane. I honestly never expected such response from my little rant against PayPal. Now I have to get more products to list on my site. Thankfully, Big Commerce got rid of their bandwidth limits, because I've had 10 fold increase in traffic in less than 12 hours since I made the original post.

I make sure that the price of the item always has enough profit margin to ensure I can meet my tax obligations, shipping costs and room to offer percentage discounts (10% off, etc.).

The best thing to do, if you don't trust a website, is to wait until it either fizzles out, or has a large enough customer base, with reviews, etc. I only started the website in April, so I don't have a lot of customers (and getting them to leave reviews is like pulling teeth). 
I can set up as many currencies as I wish, but I only bill in bitcoins. The currency conversion is done via either BitPay or Coinbase and I believe they are both different.
I'm not sure how the Big Commerce system determines which currency to display to a visitor. I chose USD as the default, assuming that it would show USD to every visitor. I have noticed that it automatically selected Canadian $ when I visit my site. So I'm just assuming it is done via IP.
As far as shipping goes, I don't ship to countries that have sanctions against them or that Canadians are not permitted to export products to (IE. North Korea).
But as with any website, if you're not comfortable buying from them, protect yourself. Research the company. If they new and you're not comfortable buying from them, see if they sell through other outlets, such as eBay, Amazon. 
Since my PayPal account has been shut down, I'm trying to figure out how to go about using my eBay store (btcfever) to accept bitcoins.
But with bitcoins, the problem still remains that once you send that transaction, as far as I know, it's impossible to get the transaction reversed.
So you have a very valid point. It is going to take me some time to establish a positive reputation and I've invested in this business because I believe that there is a future for bitcoins. I'm hoping that I can get my foot in the door early enough so that as bitcoins become more popular, my reputation as a legitimate e-commerce website will already be positive.
I don't know if this answers your question, but in my "day job" as an Air Traffic Operations Specialist with Nav Canada, I'm required to maintain a security clearance. If I jeopardize that by scamming people, my employer, Nav Canada/Transport Canada/CSIS/RCMP and whomever else is involved in constantly doing my background checks - they'll find out, and that job is more lucrative than this business. I can't afford to lose that job, nor would I want to, as I absolutely love it. This website is something that I'm doing both for fun and for a potential income stream.
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:21:12
Thank you.
I agree. I wouldn't be hurt if people didn't want to purchase from my site for a while longer; at least until people start reviewing. It's a side business for me, so I'm only investing what I'm willing to lose, should the business never achieve a large volume of transactions.
I think that we really need to ensure integrity in the bitcoin community. I've lost bitcoins and I've never been one to be scammed, and it hurt more realizing that I had been scammed than it did to lose the tiny amount of BTC.
But for people making larger purchases, especially through a young website, with no reviews or history, I believe that erring on the side of caution is the way to go.
If I run this business well and people receive what they order, properly and quickly, I know that in time, I will have established a good reputation. Until then, I'm not offended if people want to wait before making any purchases from me. :)

I didn't have a lot of business to begin with. So far, just from today, I've exceeded my PayPal sales. I didn't expect this post to get as much attention as it did. Most of my posts usually just get a few upvotes and a couple comments then die out.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:45:05
I'll hunt down some products. What brands are you interested in? How elaborate of a speaker system (2 speakers, 5.1 surround sound, etc)?
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:17:14
I don't know how they would handle cash rebates, which is effectively how I see it, but when I first started, I spoke with them about my business model and the girl I spoke with sounded excited. She even commented on how popular Bitcoins were. I felt stabbed in the back when a month later they did a 180. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:45:28
I was getting decent PayPal sales, so I felt kinda let down. But even now, my bitcoin sales have picked up. 
Unfortunately, my shopping cart service, Big Commerce, has no immediate plans to implement BitPay into their payment providers list, so I'm left either sending an invoice through BitPay (little time consuming) or hoping people click the BitPay/Coinbase Buy with Bitcoin buttons in the product description. 
I'm not adept enough at programming to figure out the various API integration, so I'll stick with my little JavaScript codes until I decide the investment in having somebody program something outweighs the workload of invoicing :)

**This was the first email I received on May 25, 2013;**
















































**Two days later I received this:**




























































**When I called**, there was no "appeal process". It was simply the agent on the phone repeatedly saying that they were not interested in doing business with me.

I've only had the site up for a month, so I hadn't made a lot of sales. Although I did make more sales via PayPal than through BitPay.
But now my income has increased. The fees for bitcoin sales are lower. Customers that don't have bitcoins that checkout via coinbase net me an affiliate commission when they buy 1 BTC (0.10 BTC commission).
Plus I cash out the bitcoins when the market value climbs, further increasing profit. I don't have to worry about chargebacks and losing the bitcoins that I already gave (it was stupid on my part to give the bitcoins so quickly). And after this post surprisingly took off, I've gained a few more customers.
I'm just hoping that people can learn from my mistakes. Don't rush into a business like this.
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:15:07
I edited my original post in reply to this.
This transaction was most likely the flag that PayPal needed to investigate my account. I had not intended to publish the page (I had it hidden on the Big Commerce site) and I did not realize that it was accessible. I've since completely removed it, as it was written in anger.
There were five cases (that's a lot I'm assuming) over the course of the last month were users would make a purchase. I'd send the bitcoins and they'd file a dispute through PayPal claiming the purchase was unauthorized. I only lost about 0.50 BTC from these transactions, but PayPal must have gotten frustrated from all the chargebacks.
To be honest, I can see from PayPal's point of view how this could be a risk for them, but I'm just as happy accepting bitcoins as a sole payment method. I won't have to worry about chargebacks and I can still honor my refund policy with more control.
