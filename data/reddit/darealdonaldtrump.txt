Bitcoin isnt the only crypto... others have/are performing far better.

There is a reason why I never invested in oil..... but i don't see your point.
Are you saying that oil is a bad investment, because I agree with that.

Who says we are. Anything can be a genius investment.... as long as you time it right, or hold long enough.
in the 1600, investing in tulips would've made you tons of money.....if you got it, and out at the right times. Doesn't mean they are any good of an investment.
Same with beanie babies..... sure if you hold them long enough, you may be able to sell them for more than you bought them for.

perhaps he has a hardware wallet, or a paper wallet, or has his in some other sort of cold storage..
Maybe he does have his wallet on his computer/phone. maybe he has 2FA. perhaps he has his wallet secured, with the seed kept safe somewhere.
He doesn't have to have his wallet open and useable like many people

Don't forget about the bail-ins
Where banks took their customers money in order to stay open.

You're right. Everyone should hold their bitcoin.
This way, no one will have access, and mass adoption would halt. The money flew into bitcoin would stop and people would stop wanting to get something that they can't get.

Did you not read this part... its inferring that his phone is also his bank.

Isnt what everyone wants is for it to not be an investment? Don't people want it to be a currency?
You don't invest in dollar bills (well, you can, but currency investing is fairly risky as well).

Smart investments can still lose money. Just less likely.
I use cryptocurrencies, but I don't invest in them. I was just simply making that original comment because the post came off as 'you can't lose with bitcoin'.

If everyone held, the price wouldn't change, because no one can buy.
People need to buy and sell. If you horde something like this, more people wont be able to start using it. 
The more people that use Bitcoin is partly what causes the price to increase.
Do you think the price would've increased like this if the same couple thousand people that used it from the very start were still the only ones using it?

Woah, where is this level headed thinking coming from.

It has also lost people thousands upon thousands of dollars

I had one in mind... well a couple, but I got so lost in all of the periods and commas, that I forgot my own name.

Throwing away your money does not mean the garbage man robbed you

Im just a nobody, but idk about that. The physical coin would be shit, but he isnt going to create more coins and magically add them to his wallet.
There have been coins produced several years ago. Im pretty sure they had several bitcoin worth per physical coin.
The problem is, if he makes them for me, he will have access to my private keys. Basically the ability to reach into my wallet and take out cash when ever he feels.
Another thing is, bitcoin can be split up.... what, a million times?

I generally find lower prices looking at airlines websites.
