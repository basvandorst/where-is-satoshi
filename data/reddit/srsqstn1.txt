Bitcoin is an experiment. People brave enough to buy tokens it produces are aware of the risks. What kind of experiment would bitcoin be if it didn't actually experiment, learn from its mistakes and evolve until it is ready for the big load of handling the entire world's transactions as bitcoin activists claim it will?
The only thing that embarrasses me is that everyone is so obsessed with money around here they forget to do these tests years ago when it should have been done.

You could be right or it could just be another anonymous activist wanting to send a public message. Either way, there is no way to control what others do and that kind of manipulation is always going to be possible in bitcoin because of how bitcoin works.
In my opinion, the more dangerous thing here is suggesting others not participate in a useful (politically and technologically) stress test just because youre afraid someone might make some money off of it (or lose some money off of it). Its good to speculate on peoples intentions and be skeptical, but youre effectively telling people to not participate on a whim.

Good job guys. The amount of pussies in this thread claiming ethical objections makes me sick. Bitcoin is advertised as an experimental project by its core developers and as beautiful an experiment it is, it's still just that. What good is an experiment if we don't actually learn?

The real tests have only begun. Let's hold off our conclusions until later.

Absolutely, and along those lines how constructive has Satoshi been lately?

Except that it's the mining mechanism used in one of the most interesting and unique currency experiments the world has ever known. Not a success huh? 


My bad, I thought you were saying what Adam did wasn't vital to Bitcoin's success. Instead, you're just comparing your god Satoshi to mere mortals and claiming he cannot be wrong. Carry on with your hero worship (the very thing that caused our societies to crumble in the first place and seek out a decentralized, hero-less tool like Bitcoin).

Without Adam's technology, bitcoin would not work as it does today.
edit: downvotes, really?

The rich and powerful of the world don't get rich and powerful by letting people know what their game plan is. They look into everything in its infancy and watch closely until the likelihood of it succeeding outweighs the likelihood of it losing them more than they can afford to lose. Of course most anyone with an understanding of history and economics would come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is the future after a week of studying it, and that just happens to be the primary focus of the world's elite.

If it's so easy to fuck up bitcoin, bitcoin has no future. That's more serious than a few "inconvenienced bystanders" and we need to insure it has a future by stress testing. This notion that we shouldn't touch anything because people might lose money is what causes altcoins to exist in the first place.
