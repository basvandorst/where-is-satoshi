Currency is a nessecity is our society and since fiat has already built a global mechanism to ensure our daily existence, then no I am not concerned because we need something in place. Also, saying that another system is bad doesn’t mean that bitcoin energy drain is OK. We shouldn’t be adding a new currency if its impact on the environment is making the already delicate environmental situation worse. 
Is that even true? Does one currency utilize the same massive amounts of energy as bitcoin mining?
