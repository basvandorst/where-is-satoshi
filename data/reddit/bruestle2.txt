Unfortunately the IRS has made no recommendations or stances on how Bitcoin is taxed. Is it forex trading, capital gains, something new? Nobody knows how to properly pay the IRS. The 2013 tax year is long done. Millions of people have already had their tax returns accepted.

That is probably accurate. That Platinum rating is actually what got me to buy it. I do a bunch of litecoin mining.

I'm not sure why the IRS has not said a word about how Bitcoins will be taxed (if at all). Bitcoins got extremely popular in 2013. Early filing has already started and regular starts in four days. They completely missed the mark for the 2013 tax year.

P2P isn't about free stuff for pirates. It is about being extremely resilient to all forms of attack, both political and technical. A "ban" wouldn't prevent money from transmitting from one address to another, which is all that is required. From a technical standpoint, any entity which would have the strength to hurt Bitcoin on a technical level is highly incentivized to assist it instead. In addition, with the [network exponentially harder to attack every day]( an entity would have to dump a very, very large sum of effort into attacking it.
On top of this, the US government wouldn't be able to ban the Bitcoin protocol explicitly. The ability to spend money is [protected as free speech]( and [bitcoins are considered money]( If this decision was reversed and the use of Bitcoin was explicit made illegal in the US, the government would have an extremely uphill battle when the topic is brought before SCOTUS.
