they dont have anything to sell. some of the highest earners in the country are prostitutes that service shippers who dock on venesualean ports, paying just a few bucks for a night is acceptable because dollars are valued so highly in the county

my friend has the same hash rate and he is getting .50$ per day. but regardless. i would like to know how to at least restore my computer to its previous ability to work
@_date: 2012-06-01 01:29:09
its 27mhash/sec 
i understand it is slow but it still allows it to run
the computer in my room is dinky, it melted from playing LOL and  now it freezes up when i try to play even the smallest flash games
so right now its basically zero (im not sure what it is or how to find out)
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:57:20
navy federal, i called them and they said i need to speak with bitfinix and find out who their intermediary bank in the USA is
@_date: 2012-03-28 04:07:19
ok honest opinions. at what price should i buy in? i just put 50$ on dwolla and i dont know if i should wait a week/month or buy immediatly
@_date: 2012-03-30 06:43:56
secretly download and run miners on your friends computers. free money
edit: i didnt actually do this. please remain calm
@_date: 2012-04-09 00:41:38
right now i dont pay for electricity. once i buy a new computer im going to get a 300$ graphics card and do this for real. but now im just figuring it out
@_date: 2012-04-01 23:30:20
you can still mine bitcoin. i started mining 20 days ago and i have .36 bitcoin. what you may have read is that mining is no longer profitable. as in the electricity of running your computer costs more then the bitcoin you make (probably true)
@_date: 2012-05-31 01:25:39
hey does this happen if i use my debit card as well? is it all electric transactions?
@_date: 2012-04-01 23:43:55
i think it actually took exactly a week. 
@_date: 2012-05-31 00:21:37
from what i have heard is we need to focus less on what the exchange rate is and more of what we want for our bitcoin. the point is not making USD by trading back and forth but creating a competing currency that is self sustaining and plausible 
but yes it is leveling out quite nicely. i have 95$ and i am waiting to buy in, looks like im going to wait a long time before it drops below 5$ again
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:24:15
can changetip do it?
i allready have an account and i just linked it with my navy federal
@_date: 2012-03-14 15:08:53
ok this is what i was looking for thankyou.
@_date: 2012-06-10 14:12:18
who keeps sending you .01 btc??? are you mining this?
or do you have a tip jar set up somewhere

 he sent me this. as if it explains anything. and he says he is getting the same speed as me now. he reinstalled it
@_date: 2012-04-09 00:45:05
thanks. but i am getting a new computer soon. so ill just wait until then
but i will actually save this, so i know what to get
lol its out of stock/ended,
 but yea i can find another
@_date: 2012-04-19 00:11:48
is that why the price on mt.gox jumped? i have been away a week and i just checked to see that it jumped .20$
@_date: 2012-05-31 23:35:54

i set my fee to zero and it still lets me send coins. is there a reason why i shouldn't do this? where do the fees go?
im just using the standard wallet
@_date: 2012-05-31 23:29:54
and i have seen the list for what cards work and at what speed and hash/sec.
i just dont understand why certain cards dont work at all
@_date: 2012-04-07 21:45:24
i ran a windows update and now its at 30 mega hashes. i dont understand why it stopped or why its suddenly running faster. but whatever. (thanks btw)
@_date: 2012-04-19 00:10:42
i think the problem in this specific instance is that they are trying to stop you from leaving the market
@_date: 2012-06-01 01:30:25
i guess i dodged a bullet here thanks to you.
@_date: 2012-04-03 09:47:19
yes, ill edit that sorry. i had been awake for over 80 hours straight, you should have seen the essay i wrote. it was fucking hilarious 
@_date: 2012-04-07 21:02:12
it doesnt give me an error. but on the drop down menu for devices it no longer shows my graphics card just the cpu. but i think i know what to do now, I found this in the help faq
Q: I installed OpenCL, but my GPU isn't showing up. Only my CPU is shown. What is the problem?
A: A couple people experienced this issue and were able to resolve it by installing a different driver version.
in other news my friend said he his computer overheated and died

@_date: 2012-04-01 23:28:13
umm. if you make a dwolla account you dont have to pay the 50$ fee for Mt.gox..
and if you are going to buy from Mt.gox i suggest you hurry because they have a sale going on (decreased fee from .6% to .3%)
if you are buying a large amount. otherwise it really doesnt matter
@_date: 2012-06-01 01:32:44
realllllly small chance
@_date: 2012-06-12 02:22:16
that sounds made up. 
@_date: 2012-06-10 14:20:56
i logged onto mt.gox and found that 3 mins earlier someone had a pay order and bought bitcoin will all my money. i quickly sold it back to dollars and changed my pass. i feel like 5 minutes later all my money would have been gone

well its fool proof for insurance against your computer catching on fire, but i think it would increase the chances of you getting robbed a little bit (small but a possibility)

@_date: 2015-09-13 14:42:18
it is but your going about this the wrong way, make a new account called "first global credit" and actually start with some honesty like 
hey i made a website where you can actually buy stocks with bitcoin come check it out and im here if you want to ask any questions
because the way you are promoting now is really phony and off putting, I have been a redditor for 4 years trust me.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:26:17
reddit says there is one comment but there are no comments, this means whoever has commented has been shadow banned and needs to check themselves
