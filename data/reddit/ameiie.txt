duh, because cash can be printed and the finance system lives on, that was actually ONE of the main reasons for cash to replace Gold and others.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:10:13
Both of you are actually stating a very solid point that counts as a major bonus for bitcoin, one of the main reasons it was supported and encouraged for so long.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:07:47
not right now, no.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:40:35
I mean no offence, but the one who should read and strengthen their knowledge about bitcoin is you sir.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:13:10
Because you view this from a wrong prospective.
Bitcoin is compared to Gold, not to cash, the theft of bitcoin should be compared to the theft of Gold and not to the theft of cash. both are very bad and result into permanent loss in many situations in which they can't be replaced, However Gold has theoretically evolved into a monetary system that boosts economies and in which the inconveniences can be greatly reduced, while Bitcoin currently remains very vulnerable and a target to many inevitable events that would gradually destroy it, like people losing their wallets for eternity, or people dying with their wallets, or cases of kidnapping or terrorism and such.

Once we have proofs of that, the digital currency would already decline out of public realization.
We're actually just assuming and making predictions here, knowing better the bitcoin future would allow us to make better investments.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:42:09
True, Hardware Wallets and Cold Storage are slightly inconvenient but very neat ideas against the hacking problem that I stated, I would love to see them implemented in an easily adoptable way that could save the currency.
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:52:57
Dollars and Euros.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:29:42
Actually the wrong one is you sir, lol, that's like saying that a piece of Gold that falls into the deep ocean is not gone, only because it still exists somewhere.
@_date: 2016-08-30 19:37:15
Huh, when or where did i say that hacks have to do with the blockchain?
Let me simplify my statement for your brain, Bitcoin is vulnerable, it's hackable, that's why it's going to fail, it's gonna be replaced by another and better blockchain-based currency sooner or later.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:25:31
There are actually a few theoretical ways which I refuse to disclose in such a public topic, however, I want you to realize that; even when assumed that I can't bypass a cheap Multisignaturing trick, there are way better hackers out there with many secret exploits.
We both currently should just sit and watch the evolution of Bitfinex's case, it's slightly amusing.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:36:34
You are right in many ways, but in my opinion,  the convenience does actually play a massive role and you can't simply just ignore it and move on without it, there must be a way to make it publicly usable without difficulties and inconveniences.
The blockchain technology is very revolutionary and impressive, so whether Bitcoin finally dies someday or not, we can potentially create a way better online currency than Bitcoin and which will be more convenient.
@_date: 2016-08-30 19:05:25
I did not bring it up, I just politely answered your initial question in the most resumable way possible (by my english level).
You seem to be addressing me as if I'm in favor of cash, I'm not, I actually lean toward digital currencies, toward a better blockchain implementation than Bitcoin because it is insecure and thus doomed to fail in the long run. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:51:58
I did not say replaced, I said printed, you're the one being cute.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:59:38
Give me an os­cil­lo­scope and I will show you.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:30:31
Hi, it's true what you say, but by hacking I simply referred to the theft of wallets, I don't think the blockchain can be hacked anytime soon, and as good as I know, the quantum computing technology would actually fall in favor of blockchain technologies, there are many ways in which it can be implemented to further strengthen their security.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:36:57
I think you are attacking me about something we all agree about, I wouldn't have hopped into this whole bitcoin revolution and invest in it if not all those potential benefits it offers, and you just pointed one.
All I did was stating a sad reason on why bitcoin is doomed to fail.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:24:26
You are talking about very basic things that everyone knows, and in some way destroying your own argument in favor of my statement.
What you said only means that when your bitcoin is stolen, there should technically be no way to restore it but only to track it for a while, it would be owned by the hackers without consequences.
Your argument hints to another big problem actually, like how many people die everyday and leave their wealth without any announced heritance plan. It's known how the law easily deal with that type of problems in the current monetary system, but with Bitcoin, it mostly means that those bitcoins are gone forever.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:53:37
True but that was an explosion of convertibility issues and it's irrelevant to our original hacking topic.
It does however compliment the bitcoin or online currencies in general (also real Gold).
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:13:10
2) Not very convincing because I believe it should become mondatory for it to become effective, because fair users may rely on online banks but thieves and hackers and such will just transfer the stolen bitcoins to private uncontrollable wallets.
4) Basing on the knowledge I have about bitcoin I believe you are wrong, the mining reward is decreased continuously by the system regardless of the amount of miners in the network, so new taxes will be implemented to keep transactions going and you can confirm that by googling.
5) I already mentioned that the 5th point is not very worrying due to inability to control p2p currencies, but you are partially correct.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:13:24
I can understand your worries about average users reading such posts and not committing into bitcoins, considering that the bitcoin price is based on their beliefs that it is perfect and worth committing into.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:20:26
Okay thank you for participation sir, Have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:50:56
1) Yes exactly, thanks, that's a difference between bitcoin and real currency, if a thief steals your real money you have the chance of recovering it, and even if you do not recover it, the government/federals are able to inflate money to balance the supply. 
3) You are wrong. 
4) You are also wrong, I did not say mining is not profitable, I said it will be unprofitable, because the rewards for mining are continuously being halvened.
5) I don't even know how to start debunking that claim, it's a lot harder to launder or evade taxes with real currency than with cryptocurrencies.
Your mood is okay you kind of made me giggle with your way of typing c:
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:24:49
Yes Sir it is indeed positive but at the same time very negative, if you for example lose an amount of bitcoins, the law won't be able to help you recovering it, no one will be able to.
If circle.com gets hacked somehow and bitcoins stolen, they won't be recoverable.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:59:03
I made this post as a cryptocurrency supporter and an expresser of concerns about bitcoins.
But funny how I can cast the same logic upon you Sir as I can also say the same about your comment hahah, the day will move on and people who want to interact with this post will do interact, and ones who are bothered by it can just ignore it :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:36:50
I fully agree with 98% of what you have nicely said Sir, but the factor that will determine Bitcoin success on the long run is the mass adoption, which will be extremely hard to achieve with those cons that everyone will become aware of sooner or later.
I may be wrong but it's why I find it a necessity to require mondatory third party managers (like banks) that manage private keys and can take over wallets under a smart agreed-on laws (like universal bitcoin-owners poll). 
Hopefully the newborn Circle.com may achieve the first part.
 
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:28:14
There was absolutely no need for you to be impolite Sir.
