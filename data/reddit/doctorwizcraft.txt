I would like to delete my priv key from bitcoin.com wallet can anyone help me with that?
I know longer trust them

You would have to go through a transaction process, just like sending bitcoin to another person.
It will cost u a 4 dollar fee.
I think its because Coinbase controls your private keys

I am also 15, and I just started a cryptocurrency club in my school to spread the idea of bitcoin.

The calculator accounts for electricity costs

So I am 16 and when I go to school I just leave it on and when I am sleeping I leave it on. And I have been using nicehash with a gtx 970 graphics card and have made about 0.025 btc in total. Call me spoiled lol but my parents paid for the electricity.

Yep I have ledger nano s.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:11:59
I agree with that I just wont tell anyone who I actually know irl that I have 0.1 btc. Besides I have all my crypto in cold storage
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:13:08
Yep I just used nicehash, with my 970 gtx graphics card. I didnt pay for my electricity had someone else to do it. But just plug in ur graphics card in the nicehash caculator and u will see how much profit you can make. All these days profitability is down.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:14:54
Just download nicehash and boot it up on ur computer
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:10:33
I like ur thinking but I was thinking that I am one out of 210 million people who will ever have the chance to have 0.1 btc.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:52:46
u need to have a graphics card to effectively mine 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:24:19
they only "bought" me the mined bitcoins which were 0.025. The rest I got by either swing trading or getting money from work.
