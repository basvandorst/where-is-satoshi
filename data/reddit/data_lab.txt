Gold derives its value from its physical properties. That's a fact. The same properties that made it good for storing value also make it good for use in electronics. It doesn't rust. That's actually rare in a metal.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:30:48
Ok...so right now gold is still very valuable for electronics. Do you want me to put "for the time being*" in my statement?

Ya it's possible, wouldn't be a bad thing either. I don't believe btc will ever become a good SoV either though, if we are now saying it's more of a SoV than a currency. It can't be both, and it's been trying to be a currency for a while now.

How is decentralization useful for those things? We already have all those things without btc.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:12:23
Well ya because copper is orders of magnitude cheaper.

Gold absolutely has intrinsic value. It's the least reactive metal in the world, and is a good conductor. Compare the most corrosive resistant electrical conductor to btc...you think they have the same intrinsic value??
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:58:41
Well it's vastly superior to copper since copper does rust, so no. It's valuable as jewelry for the same reason, it doesn't rust so can be transferred basically an infinite amount of times.
I don't see what's silly about it, it's valuable because of it's natural properties.

Who uses gold as money tho?
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:18:28
Just like saying gold has no intrinsic value is also dumb. It has both intrinsic value and artificial value.

When did it change from 1 sat to 1/1000 sat?
Fiat currency does need to be inflationary most of the time. Right now inflation is the sign of a healthy economy, this is a fact of economics today. You might disagree with the field of economics, but this is how every economy is run today.
An economy suffers when people are less inclined to spend, this has not been disproven in macroeconomics. I'm talking about economic cycles not btc cycles. We already see that people don't really spend btc, the whole mantra here is hodl. That is the opposite of fiat, and the reason it cannot replace fiat. People hodl because they think it'll be worth more the next day, which will always be true with a deflationary "currency".

Gold has certain properties that make it valuable. It wasn't randomly chosen over silver, bronze, copper, etc. It's the BEST non corrosive metal conductor. That's a fact. You think they use gold in smartphones and laptops for the fun of it? Or because they want to spend extra money?
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:32:34
Yes I know btc is divisible up to 1/1000,000, it's still capped. 100 years ago would anyone have guessed the global economy would be in the Trillions?
Well whether it's good or not is debatable, I personally think we should be less indebted and less consumer oriented, but our entire economy runs on debt and growth, i.e. there needs to be more money in circulation next year than this year. I don't see how that gels with a deflationary capped currency.
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:52:33
I think you misunderstand "intrinsic value". Gold has value in its own because it's the MOST non reactive metal and is a good electrical conductor. Think about what having a non corrosive conductor means in the modern world and tell me that intrinsic value is similar to btc.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:17:42
No copper is not more corrosion resistant than gold. Google

Which takes more energy per transaction Bitcoin or Visa/MC?
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:52:06
Why because of the ROI in that timeframe? 
What makes btc a good MoE? It has a capped supply, what happens when more is needed? 
How do you lend out capital with btc? It's naturally deflationary, meaning it will gain value in itself, imagine what the interest rate would have to be to make it worthwhile. And is that even possible with a capped supply of btc?
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:41:41
Yes the most corrosive resistant electrical conductor is silly. So useless
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:10:53
Probably an important one no?
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:11:47
Who uses gold as money today? Most people use plastic and Visa/MC are 100,000x more energy efficient than btc.
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:16:47
They use it as a reserve asset, like anyone else buying gold. Not as a currency
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:57:29
Lol gold fan boy? Neither is more useful you puttz they are useful in different situations.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:14:40
Then why is gold used instead of carbon nanotubes?
