I was able to preform search and load the website with no lag here on the east coast in US.

As always I'm trying to get my friends and family to use Bitcoin. One time my cousin found tickets online craigslist and the seller wanted to use BTC. I told her that there is no chance of getting her BTC back if he was a scammer and never sent the tickets. Would my answer have been the same if I know about your site?

The hitman stuff is just propaganda. Read into the case.

This click of a mouse happened after they already had control of DPR's account. Lynn Ulbricht talks in depth in this interview.

Obligatory freeross.org.
The story of the trial as told by Ross' mother is heartbreaking and a true example of how corrupt and an injustice it is to see Ross in prison for the rest of his life.  They are going through appeals now.

Ross was never charged with ordering hits, if they could have charged him they would have. Though that didn't stop the prosecution from bringing this up in front of the jury. 
Take a listen to Ross' mom yourself, hear what she has to say. Then tell me if you really think this is even close to just.

Ross was never charged with hiring hits. If they could have charged him they would have, regardless, he is already rotting in a cage the rest of his life. Quit spreading misinformation.

Isn't that still attempted murder though? There is a reason he wasn't convicted, it's because there is no way to prove he sent those messages, agents already had access to his account by that time and those are the same agents that stole millions worth of bitcoin. 
By you continuing to speak as though Ross ordering a hit as fact only further degrades him and his appeal through this case. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:12:39
That makes no sense. Why would a murder prosecution not be prosecuted? There was no body, no evidence, no victim, no case. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:29:50
Hear what his mom has to say. 
Edit: Also worth the read.

This looks like it's going to be great! Do you have a link to the books pdf?

Nothing brotha. Not on an exchange so you are solid. Hodl strong.

Here is a picture of the posting. What do you think?

Maybe I could offer to be a middle man? Not quite sure how that works. Plus if she is wanting to buy the tickets today, wont she have to way a few days for her bank to verify the transaction from usd to btc?
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:10:40
still sure its a scam? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:09:17
Hmm big Casey fan. Fun to speculate!

I'd be curious about the conversion rate. I'm sure your $220 has more purchasing power when used in their store vs cashing out. Otherwise give it a month of randomly checking the charts to make your decision. You've got time to play with and I'd use that to your advantage.

I'm in the process of reading the book now *downloaded it ;) 
Thanks for the well reasoned response. I'll form my own opinion as well just wanted to share. 
If you haven't heard Ross' mom speak I highly recommend!

This is an email i got from Ross' mom. 
You may have heard that a book about Ross has come out called American Kingpin. The author, Nick Bilton, asked me to participate in the project but I was warned away by a trusted advisor who said, considering those involved, it would be a regurgitation of the government's narrative.
 
Sure enough, he was right.
 
Bilton bases his story of murder-for-hire as if it's fact. Yet these allegations were never proven, prosecuted or even charged at trial and no murders occurred. Former Federal Judge Nancy Gertner joined Ross' appeal saying it is wrong to use uncharged crimes against a person. Yet Nick Bilton has no compunction in doing this.
 
Nick Bilton says Ross is dangerous. yet all his convictions were non-violent and he has no record of hurting anyone. No victims came forward at trial to claim that Ross had harmed them in any way. Rather, Ross is widely known as peaceful and compassionate. You can read what 100 people who actually know him have to say.
 
Ross cannot defend himself or his reputation against this media onslaught. He is helpless to stop the feeding frenzy; sensationalizing, fictionalizing and profiting from his life. He's just trying to survive each day, living in a cell, hoping that the appellate courts care more about the truth than the media does.
 
Please help us counteract this by commenting on articles about the book and sharing/liking our posts on social media. The facts speak for themselves. Bottom line: it has never been proven that Ross was involved in murder-for-hire. Even the government didn't have the confidence to charge him with this at trial. This is enough to discredit this book. You can read more and watch a short video on my blog.
 
Thank you!
Lyn Ulbricht﻿
