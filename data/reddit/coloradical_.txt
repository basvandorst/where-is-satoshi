Thanks for taking the time to explain that to me I really appreciate it. So I kind of blew that as it turns out. Would you think that there is any hope of the transactions going through?

Would you mind explaining what you mean by that and how exactly that would happen?
It is like my transactions got lumped into the same transaction somehow. I sent a small test transaction which is the one you linked, then sent the larger amount (the one I linked) and those are somehow binded now?

Thanks man, did you use viabtc?

For sure thanks for the info. Fortunately I'm not in any rush to move these coins so it's pretty much whatever. I'm hoping the transaction accelerator will work for me in the next couple of days if not I'll explore some different options. Thanks for explaining that all to me.

How did you get blacklisted?
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:45:46
Yes yes. r/dogecoin doesn't hate Apple as much as you guys though

So are you these guys dumping btc for cash on coinbase? How can you move this much every month? Is there some Chinese exchange that will do this?

Well shit
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:46:57
Very cool!
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:40:02
Yep prettt sure its a scam. Should of done research beforehand
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:40:34
I thought someone might say that haha. I actually just cleaned it didn't pay much attention to the outside frame though :)

For the record if anybody is wondering account recovery for me only took two business days. Not bad
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:54:09
In theory you don't necessarily need a real person to look at it though? Seems like the process is fairly automated

Thanks guys!
