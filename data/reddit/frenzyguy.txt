Yeah LN is cool and all, but we need a solution now, not in 6 month, open the block size, then implement LN, not talkijg about increasing it to 32 mb, but 4 or 8 mb would be enough for now, while we wait for the never ending story of LN.

Problem is not bitcoin cash, he literally insulted him, saying he is a bcash cheerleaders and the only one following him are bcash suckers.... That went little too far.

Anything good have downsides, questionning which have a negative impact is a good part of the process but expressing joy over something that might be revolutionary is not bad in itself. Tread carefully, sell high, buy low, play the game.

If I was going to spread every revolutionary thing, the list would be really long.
Like it or not, lots of people started to use the web with the facebook ascension, we had many other way to communicate (remember msn messenger, aol, caramail). I amnot saying facebook is good or bad, but information (and desinformation) never moved as fast as today! This is a double edged sword.
Yes crypto-currencies can be something revolutionary, it could also be just a modern trend.
But people out of the crypto sphere still doubt the project is viable, people still don't trust the system, and it is still not easy enough for grandma to send btc/ltc/eth/iot to anyone! Most people investing actually even have a hard time understanding the blockchain tech.
And I am. Not saying amazon revolutionized everything for everyone, It revolutionized the retail market. Every other day a shop close because they cannot compete with giants like amazon. The crypto world is not just for the small investors, it's for everyone that believe in the project!
I am in and I invest because I want to see these multiple project grow and flourish into a  new economic system that is dynamic and powerfull.

We are living an VER right now! The Virtual Economic Revolution.
Amazon, changed and is still changing how retail works.
Facebook changed how we interact
Now crypto will change how we invest, how we spend, how we live.
What a time to be alive!

I bought a 20th of btc and about 4 ltc. I just hope both of these coin survive togheter and end up being the big expense crypto (bitcoin) and the everydays life crypto (ltc).  In ten years from now I hope to pay everything with crypto.
