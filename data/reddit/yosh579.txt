I like how people think segwit/lightning is a long term scaling solution.

I'm trying to talk about bitcoin tech, not passively aggressively beat around the bush with blanket statements. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:02:59
don't buy bitcoins. bitcoins will be irrelevant in 2 years
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:28:19
Typical BTC response. Nothing regarding the tech, just pump that ponzi at all cost!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:31:54
No it would be a temporary fix to an existing problem. How long are those confirmation times in the meantime again? When is LN going to be usable in the slightest? 
But keep playing the politics game, 3 years and nearly 3 splits later, you were looking at a very orchestrated hijack of a transfer of value from A to B. Holla at cha boy Luke. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:05:25
weird that's how I feel about Bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:41:09
Kettle meet pot. You don't gotta act pretentious if you don't know what you're talking about bud. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:53:20
plasma. anything on chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:21:44
because BCH is the real Bitcoin :). 
I don't own any bitcoin or bitcoin cash btw. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:35:10
Yes, core. Not users.... selective reading? You act as if that's a direct insult to you lol. 
So nothing? Thought so. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:17:02
yeah you guys definitely need to educate them on how bitcoin is a glorified ponzi scheme as of today. Really hurting all these newcomers. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:02:02
that's bitcoin for ya. dinosaur blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:00:54
implying segwit scales long term LOL. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:07:33
You're thinking of Plasma, not state channels. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:19:08
Because bitcoin is a ponzi scheme without the sound technology to scale. It will probably never get said technology due to the retards at core. Bitcoin is trying to transform into something that isn't a transfer of value from A to B and will fail miserably. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:30:26
I try to limit the naive to investing in blatant scams. 
First mover advantage doesn't mean it has ANY use cases lol. 
Irrational market won't be irrational forever. We're seeing that first hand with BCH :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:06
same. 0 use cases = 0 value. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:03:58
which is state channels...... which is off chain scaling...... which is meh. State channels aren't even out yet and they're old news. What else you got? Lightning won't scale to billions of users. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:25:18
spreading awareness to the sheep. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:26:46
Segwit/Lightning aren't feasible real scaling lmao. Off chain stuff is meh. What else do those retards got? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:12:16
Glorified ponzi scheme at this point. You're better off investing in BCH. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:34:45
No one can choose all four today** 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:32:17
Superior form of gold. lmfao. 
Who told you that, Tuur, or Tone?
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:35:11
Cocaine is a helluva drug. Buckle up for that flip in November baby. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:07:04
Definitely tone ;).
You should stop listening to those guys man, they're actually pretty stupid. They're gonna get you burned one day from your blind following. 
Bitcoin is actually the scam. Crazy to see so many people invested into a coin that's going to be irrelevant in the next year or two. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:22:09
You should start developing your own thoughts buddy. Not regurgitate the thoughts of other dumb people.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:14:40
I prob got into bitcoin and sold it all before you even got in lol. 
Seems like you just discovered crypto/bitcoin though. I can tell because your breath smells like tone vays dick.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:18:29
Wow first "original" comment I've seen from you. 
But strides, real proud of ya bud. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:43:48
Don't be the greatest fool when the sinking ship that is bitcoin splits again in November. Don't be the last one holding the greatest scam that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:29:03
You guys are just now picking up on this? I thought it was bad a year or two ago but I'm surprised y'all stuck around this long. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:03:50
My source says btc will be irrelevant by 2018. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:05:48
Lol you're high bro. Bitcoin is failing to meet market demand and another is stepping in to fulfill those demands. Ethereum would be a redundant platform if bitcoin were able to scale, but it's unable to get anything done.
The uasf for segwit is a last chance type effort for bitcoin future in crypto. But just remember hash power is law ;).
