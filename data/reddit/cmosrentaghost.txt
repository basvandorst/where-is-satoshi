Interesting overview of Blockchain tech projects. Though he listed OpenBazaar as a blockchain marketplace when actually it's P2P (he did mention this however).
He missed an opportunity to talk about BlockMarket, the only blockchain-based marketplace out there, and one that that exists today in a near-complete beta state. Currently awaiting a new wallet UI before public launch. Although Blockmarket is built on the Syscoin blockchain, it will accept bitcoin via SuperNet integration.
Here's a comparison article and chart looking at the various decentralised marketplace offerings in development --

Syscoin's Blockmarket - a blockchain based marketplace (not auction style listings though) will be up and running very soon. The dev team are working on a new UI to access the features currently only available through the QT wallet console. It will accept SuperNet coins and Bitcoin. Worth keeping an eye on ... here's the latest news blog --

Finally a balanced view. Nice one Alex Hern. "Bitcoin’s story is bigger than Satoshi Nakamoto, and it’s certainly bigger than Craig Wright."
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:06:06
Open Bazaar isn't anonymous though. And Shadow Market won't be out anytime soon, if at all. Syscoin's blockchain-based Blockmarket will offer anonymity and should be out in the next couple of months. I'd be looking there if I wanted an anonymous online marketplace that can't be taken down (and will also accept Bitcoin + all SuperNet member coins ;)

So you're 'decently knowledgeable about the scene' but you had to ask if a widely known Bitcoin purchasing app will allow you to send bitcoins? You thought you'd just buy them and leave them on your phone?

Reading through this tread it's almost like you're trying NOT to buy bitcoins...
Buying bitcoins is pretty straightforward for the vast majority of people in a position to do so. If you're too young to have a bank account perhaps ask an adult to help out?

Well yeah .. If the FBI/NSA are monitoring their comms and have remote access to their systems they're out of luck, but it's not up to Bitcoin to solve that problem for them. That's like saying my encrypted email is broken because that guy standing behind me in the library could see what I wrote.

@_date: 2017-06-06 11:49:56
Thanks - yeah just trying to unravel my buys/trades over the years and how best to calculate profit. Maybe it just needs a best guess. The coins I bought for $300 are going to return more profit than the coins I bought at $800. Do I use the $800 coins in my profit calculations to minimise profit?? I guess I could take an average.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:48:32
Yeah it's how to calculate that profit after years of buying btc and trading altcoins. I'm only selling a small portion of coins so which purchased coins do I include when I calculate profit? I've bought at many different price levels. It feels like a rats nest of buys/trades that needs unraveling by someone other than me... Also does trading invoke income tax?? Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:06:16
I think if it's a straight bitcoin transaction (ie no conversion to fiat takes place) then there's nothing to tax
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:58:38
Ah that sounds good. I'm a bit of a tax noob so the 'best effort to be honest' approach didn't occur to me. Excellent advice - thanks very much.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:47:51
Only theft if you don't use any of the services it pays for. If you're fully self-sufficient then fair play to you. I live in a place with roads,  hospitals, schools etc so I don't mind paying tax, particularly when I acquired a large sum money through investing and trading a small sum. Thanks for the link.
