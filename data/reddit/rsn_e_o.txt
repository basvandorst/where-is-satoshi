Hi fellow dutchy, what i also wonder is, bitcoin isn’t controlled by the government or banks so isn’t it incredibly hard to seize bitcoin especially from individuals? Foremost bitcoin is very anonymous and secondly you can just memorize your private key, say you lost it and no one will ever be able to get to your bitcoin.
Yes if something get’s raided and there’s bitcoins stored found locally or the info to get to it but otherwise i don’t see how it’s done.
Or is it people that have wallets on some app/website from a company and the gov just tells the company to hand it over?

Correct me if i’m wrong but aren’t both the same? 
More of one currency being created = inflation and inflation = more money has been created? The only difference with bitcoin is that the amount of money created get’s smaller every year till it completely stops (at 21m bitcoins) as where governments can keep printing any amount they like?
Edit: i’m guessing more of one currency being created doesn’t necessarily result in inflation if more people use and adopt the currency, drive it’s value up and have deflation as a result even though more of the currency was made?

The website kinda looks sketchy. Only contact info shows a random email address.
