You mean Nyancoin. No wait... Coinye...wait Cagecoin...

Youre referring to holding them as an investment rather than using them as currency..
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:52:59
Once again youre not treating it as currency but as an asset youve invested in. This isnt about what to hold but what to USE
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:57:46
That's a shame, but there's no reason for you to believe otherwise. Bitcoin is by far the safebet so i do not blame you

Kind of like the website this is linking to.

Does Hazard ever make claims with any proper evidence?
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:52:38
Yes true. What im saying is despite volitilaty, bitcoin is established. I lobe doge but it hasn't even been 3 months. We have no idea what the future holds for us. For some people that is too much risk for their money.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:00:33
I disagree. Hazard has always been more about bias opinion that provides nothing and lacks any substance whatsoever. The man just wants you to BELIEVE he knows what he's doing, so you'll give him some of your coin.

Thank you for your meaningful contribution :)

"Uncovered". Thats some good spin! Have you considered a job in politics?
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:56:51
Thank you.
Don't forget to report him, of course. Probably does nothing, but still sick of his shit.
Not sure if this is frowned upon in but
+50 doge verify
Thanks for posting this.

I did not say that I do not want them to use it or that I feel they should be banned. I am merely putting forward that I am still suspicious of them after all their hijinks back in the day. One positive move won't make me instantly switch sides on this.
I love that they're adopting it, but as far as Im aware theyre still a shitty company.

That was bad news to me as im still jaded about Zynga, but I dont know what theyre like nowadays
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:56:18
Youre both terrible
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:00:08
This is exactly what I meant. You worded it much better than I.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:57:26
You might have better luck bringing this up at r/CryptoCurrency, a lot of people here instantly downvote altcoin related posts.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:39:45
How far away is the hearing? Can someone do a "x hours from this comment" thing for me? I'd like to find a way to watch it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:51:49
Yes but im not going to spend ALL my money just because I have it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:39:35
I only have 0.6 coins, but I'm looking forward to buying things like a keychain and card from bit-card. Its not much, but the idea of buying things with btc thrills me.
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:40:41
Keychain :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:03:47
I have never bought art before, but I might just do that today. Bookmarking this so I can see it when I get home.
Good on you for supporting the currency, hopefully we can support you in return!

What you don't see is that the blogger answered with a "Deal With It" gif, which is kind of funny.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:00:15
It's unconfirmed. I'm glad I'm not the only one waiting I guess. I didn't think transferring a small amount would take this long but I guess I can wait.
