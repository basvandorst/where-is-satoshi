So who in your opinion should make sure that all taxes are paid, no sanctions violated, no crypto money is laundered if not the banks?

What is Bitcoin Suisse? And what are they trying to sell?

I work for Swiss bank servicing emerging markets and about 90% of my time I spend filtering out bad apples. Especially in emerging markets there is still a lot of money from questionable origin (that’s why we call them developing countries). 
So far I haven’t heard a single thing from any of you crypto fan boys how you envisage compliance with basic OECD rules to fight money laundering or tax evasion on the block chain.  
Here’s a simple task that needs to be solved: Within the crypto space - How do you prevent some corrupt official from Belarus who is stealing a lot of money from the school budget from funneling that money to London to buy a fancy house? 
But most probably your answer will be downvote and a “no you’re corrupt”.

Right.... so you’re s saying that the world isn’t actually complicated but instead  is super straight forward and the apparent complexity is just a conspiracy by the man to keep you down. 
This is exactly the mindset that gets retards like Trump in power.

Yeah that was the argument the Swiss banks used to defend the privacy of their clients... but that was last century.

But you totally do because you have a phd in macro economics right? 


Bitcoin volatility is like 10x the volatility of the USD.  Wtf labour value are you securing with Bitcoin?

Why default if you can just lower interest rates to zero or below?

Even if there ever is no fiat anymore. There will still be banks

So what’s so great about no KYC? Somehow tax avoidance and money laundering is generally considered a big no no but the moment you do it with crypto you’re instantly some robin hood freedom fighter sticking it to the man.

Yes if there is was an elite group in power you might be correct. But what if there were just 7 bio individuals acting independently, some rational some less rational? And this across 192 countries with different, oftentimes conflicting laws? What type of financial system would be the result in such a scenario?
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:59:30
Yes... actually I’m surprised they are still here

Not quite... no company will sell you anything for your bitcoins except for some hip pizza places and you need to pay ridiculous commissions (such as7%) to exchange your crypto.

AML and tax avoidance measures are being pushed primarily by G20 and OECD... or is your country leaving these organizations too?

You sure used a lot of words to say „No you‘re corrupt“


That‘s cool... I think I start to slowly understand what you’re saying: Bear with me... you‘re saying
1. we all stop paying taxes 
2. the sewage system stops working 
3. your house starts to  smell like poo
4. Then here‘s the part I don‘t fully understand and need you to brake it down for me... like ELI5 - please be very specific
5. We live in a society without middlemen and banks and governments and our houses don‘t smell like poo

People who complain about anti money laundering policies of banks are usually the same people who complain when banks fail to enforce anti money laundering policies
