the math is never on your side.
I  notice with interest that just-dice.com
 allows you to "be  the bank"  and invest  money,  with the house odds  of 1% /  etc  return
 one poignant memory sticks with me -  first time entering a  pub,  and having to go through people playing video  slot machines,  lifeless  looks  on their face. 
 someone  breaks down  and realizes they've spent their family food budget.
don't gamble money you wouldn't throw away,  set on fire,  or give to your own worst enemy :/

 guys, this is astro surfing, 101.
 no way is  the url  legitimate,  nor the company. 
 if you're going to throw money away,  I'd appreciate  it  instead :p

 how fast is  mining on mobile phones?

 exactly.

 interesting  bot,  clever idea

I  think the best bet is to tell people to remove java  as much  as  possible,  regardless of the browser being the attack vector..  
Joe user may know how to install software,  where as configuring it,  ensuring  java  is not enabled in the browser,  etc is harder for them..  
 it's a bit if a scorched earth policy,  but that's the breaks,  especially when you have DHS  saying to remove java etc

 there is a bot  auto  posting  bot  advertising that url,  so I'd assume it's malicious /  fraudulent in some way.

occam's razor  suggests  they are  not  legitimate  due to their spam  behavior

 then you may wish to edit the original post indicating that.  two fake users.  promoting the site :/
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:35:57
they're upvoting  their own posts..  perhaps to bury my  original  post

I  was thinking that you might be able to solve it based on incrementing  based on frequency,  but then I  realized  it would be possible/faster  to just regenerate your identifiers  (  assuming  public/ private  identifiers,  etc) so your cost is minimal again 
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:06:30
 considering they're engaging on spam  and probably other unsavory tactics,  I'd strongly recommend you stay away and not support  such  companies
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:47:50
 that could be amusing  game  of whack a  mole.  next  up,  administrator,  support, tech support, etc

is there any benefit to creating a bitcointalk  website account and posting to that thread?

 when I was younger and  naive,  the group I  was with wanted to sit down and discuss some course work stuff,  and have some drinks.
There was a place up the road  we went to. The area was  not cheap  to live in
 The other time I went to a really bad place was crown casino ( friends were at some bar )  in  Melbourne.  same soul less  loss on their faces after  walking through  heaps of slot machines  areas.

 fair enough,  thanks for the detailed answer

 what about PayPal when the people pay bitcoins  to themselves,  funded by their credit card?   credit card issuer can then issue a charge back ( even though it's against their tos )
I  guess PayPal could work around that by requiring payment by bank amount debiting ..
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:26:51
 good, do you realise how suss  they  are and how suspicious this behavior is?
@_date: 2013-07-11 07:02:22
sounds like a astro  turfing,  especially if you report back it was successful :/

primecoin  looks interesting  from a  math point of view.
