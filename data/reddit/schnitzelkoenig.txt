Yeah, that's not even remotely realistic. Unfortunately for everyone having lost bitcoins today :/

Haha :)
Edit: I'm still giggling about this joke.

OMG, that's now! This year! :D Finally

How long was it possible?

That makes Google actually even more appealing. There is for when I want to get showered with hate...

I just saw for the first time that Gwen Stefani and that Gavin dude are sitting in the background.

That chart isn't even labeled!

But wouldn't such a mechanism have some kind of timer? Wouldn't make sense to steal everything immediately.

I feel like a god damn bad ass because I did absolutely NOTHING!

Oh my... D:
I do the same

Because Buddhism has no god, right? So no centralization. Just worshippers that aim to "get" Bitcoin after which they become Bitcoin.

I think the fall of MtGox changed a lot as it was artificially raising the price. We're back on the normal development I hope and I assume whether bitcoin will be "worth a lot of nothing" will be decided much later.

Nothing in that makes any sense...

You're making a lot of assumptions. Imagine the 5 most influential countries making their own cryptocurrencies, too. Bitcoin would be fucked. Not because everyone is giving up "sticking it to the man", but because it would probably be a billion times more accessible and easier to use. And that's exactly the reason why bitcoin is galaxies away from being mainstream: It's just too obscure and hard to buy/sell/use for the average person that even struggles with excel.
