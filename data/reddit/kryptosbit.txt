You would be surprised how much they help, yea but news good or bad doesn't come out all all the time just once awhile the but for the most part indicators do help they do not predict future trades but tell you what has already happen,  gives you the big picture of the market

That does not affect BTc exchanges there they are not regulated 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:16:43
If you are going to start trading I suggest learning your basic indicators,  is a good website for beginners. And one more thing start off by doing spot trading like on coinbase exchange and bitstamp, do not start off with margin or leverage I have seen so many new people get rekt trading futures or on margin, start with baby steps. 
Good Luck &amp; play the market smart.

China launched another round of capital controls, the Central Bank has suspended a number of foreign banks in foreign exchange-related services, and how it will affect the local Bitcoin Bitcoin transactions and the overall market?
 The Chinese government wants to stop the ongoing major and devaluation related capital outflows. Just a few months ago, the government reduced the amount of credit card withdrawals.
 In addition to the obvious reasons for monetary inflation, China after its recent entry into the global IMF reserve currency club, the need to improve the liquidity of the yuan, which means issuing more money. Those who do not want to see their wealth devaluation smart and investors can find a safe haven in the precious metals, real estate and other hard assets bitcoin.
 In recent months, China's bitcoin exchanges do see the influx of new customers. With the tightening of capital controls another round of Bitcoin prices rose in November from October, though related, but that does not mean the two are directly dependent. From the price development of these days, the new series of control and did not affect the price or trading volume. Of course, this is also partly due to holiday reasons.
 Huobi company's operations and international marketing manager Astrid Tao told reporters,
 "Despite the current Huobi provide Bitcoin Bitcoin trading the yuan and the dollar, Bitcoin trading volume is still small compared to other markets, we believe that the new foreign exchange policy impact is limited."
 China's largest Bitcoin exchanges has been previously announced, capital controls have no meaningful impact on their business.
 However, in the long run there will be more and more people will be Bitcoin value as a means of investment. Investment channels in China is very limited, and real estate and commodity markets do not see signs of improvement. Exchange controls will help a lot of capital seeking investment, and we believe bitcoin will be a good choice.
 According to the company's CEO BTCC Nicholls yuan to say, China's foreign exchange controls had no significant effect on the number of Bitcoin Bitcoin transaction price and the crowd, a kind of view is that when there are big things happen or will happen when it will affect the bitcoin The price, for example, in the spring of 2013 when the financial crisis occurred in Cyprus, some people think of Cyprus's credit rating downgrade will lead to the collapse of the euro, or at least one of the eurozone crisis. And based on the speculation of the crisis to promote the Bitcoin prices.
 He believes that the recent currency control adjustment does not affect the price or trading Bitcoin.
 "Capital controls have been in China for a long time, they have considered the Bitcoin market. The People's Bank from time to time to modify the capital controls. These are minor adjustments, no significant impact on bit-currency transactions."
