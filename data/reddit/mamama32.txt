I have over half a million dollars in the market and I would never put more than 1k in bitcoin. It's pure speculation. The only real invention of value in bitcoin is the distributed ledger.

Bitcoin is pure speculation. LOL at calling it an investment. You're speculating that it has some intrinsic value.
