I don't have any beef with it. Advocate: ": a person who argues for or supports a cause or policy"   
I don't smoke so I don't have a horse in the race. I don't believe it should be illegal but I'm not out there sponsoring the cause.

I think every man or woman should have the ability to make that choice for themselves. I see it as being no different a vice than cigarettes or alcohol.
