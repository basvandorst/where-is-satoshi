Hey, thanks. I have never been tipped before.... That was very nice/cool of you.
I checked out the site this morning, and it looks a lot better! As per what Anarchir said, there are plenty of subreddits out there to help you too!
Otherwise, I am at work, so I can't look through it too much, the only other thing I noticed so far was on the bottom- "About Us" links to the Privacy page.  That would probably be a quick fix though.
That being said, keep it up and good luck!

Go to is not the place for this.

Shh! Don't breath on the graph, it might tumble!

I like the idea. The site needs a bit of cleanup. Off hand, the username and password aren't centered, so it looks weird. Maybe as time goes on, put up an FAQ, help, about us, etc etc. Make the site feel a bit more inviting. 
Also just noticed in the title, "stuff" isn't capitalized, but Coin is. Maybe make it StuffCoin instead of stuffCoin?
Otherwise, once you think it is good to go, don't forget to promote it! Many more Bitcoin forums than here!

I don't believe you. I think we are on the far left, just outside of the circle, trailing up to the bubble. Jeez...

You can buy Reddit gold and support Reddit if you like.

Coinbase is supposedly backed up with deposits and withdraws. If you verified that way, it may take a bit longer. I did the instant access and it was... instant. When I did verify my card through the deposit method, it only took a day or so to go through.

OP could do like every payday buy 14 dollars worth or whatever amount. Avoid many fees that way.

Most banks in the US only process transactions on business days. Banks that are open on weekends perform all of their transfers on the next business day. 
Source: I worked at TCF, and many customers had questions about weekend banking.
Hope this helps!

Took another look. I saw the About Us page. May have missed it before. Another part of the cleanup is make sure everything is standardized. StuffCoin is capitalized differently through out the site. It is easy to overlook. I suggest having a paper with how you want it laid out.
The About Us looks a little rough. But again, some additional cleanup wouldn't hurt. 
Finally, this is a bit out of my realm, but with asking for some information, you may want to look into getting https and an SSL certificate. Especially if someone is sending you info. I know this adds to the cost of a site, but some people may be turned down by not having it.
I believe you want signup should be sign up. 
Maybe section off parts of the site. Put username and password in their own 'box' so to speak. Just to break up the site more.
Likewise, on the bid screen, a box around the time left stuff, and quantity info. Then maybe another around the description. This just helps break up the site in my opinion. 
I am going to bed now, but if you want me to take a look at it again, send me a pm, I do not mind helping at all. I am by no means a website designer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. But I am glad to help and hope this gave you some ideas!
