I'm not selling however if I was offered I'd buy them a new coin and send the rest to Africa/Philippine start up as a donation. All you people concerned with immediate profit and not with the furthering of this technology should be ashamed

I always tip out 5$ a piece I only have offered the 10$ to start them off in the Bitcoin world from this point on whomever took the deal I will only tip 5$ In bitcoin no cash option and anyone  who has not had the deal it will still be offered
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:12:36
Yep done and done I walked them through everything and did not have them back it up to their email. I also gave them the option for a paper wallet yet none took me up on the offer yet
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:56:02
Indeed point taken and will keep that in mind when the next opportunity arises

@_date: 2015-04-22 19:32:49
Thanks and I hope they would understand that my goal is to only tip in Bitcoin to them from now on and it gives them a chance to save a little instead of taking that 5$ and immediately spend it on a pack of smokes. And I felt a little incentive is key for the initial push 
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:28:54
Yes it will be for them 5$ in bits or nothing at all from now on but anyone new will get the same original offer

Thanks!!! 
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:01:52
Thanks and will do at least give to the kitchen but I'll see if I can set up the "sting" as well 
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:14:28
No need it's not that kinda place trust me as long as is all adds up at the end of the day 
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:21:50
Indeed and it's my right to tip what I want and it wont devalue it because after I gave something that otherwise would just remain with me.  I went out and purchased back what I tipped plus a little so In fact it only increased its value for if they accepted the cash I would not have purchased more
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:12:12
Thanks for the morality boost I'm also a Lsu student and a divorcee and a son and some times even a dick ;) but mainly I think I'm a nice guy who sees some evil in the world and would like to help change it however I can.  
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:46:24
I like Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:57:21
Well not sure why your scared but ok thx for your opinion 
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:31:16
Yes indeed 
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:45:14
Indeed and thanks!!
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:47:33
I used blockchain and offered them a paper wallet in the future if they just wanted to hold them instead of spend
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:21:20
Haha we are always accepting applications 
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:08:25
False if I give my business the money for the product I will not get fired if anything it's like I'm purchasing bits from the customer and then they pay with the cash that I just gave them. But nice try and if you knew anything about my place of business you would know what it takes to actually get fired especially for me having been there for 13 years 
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:06:31
I'd do it on my own if people offered but I'm not one to overcharge 
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:12:36
You should come see how I pour a drink :) 
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:08:19
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:51:34
 You're looking at it the wrong way consider instead that I just gave them a present which in this case is Bitcoin. You can't feel tricked and getting something for free it's free
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:30:34
I use coinbase to purchase but I don't like to use an exchange for my wallet service 
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:20:59
...I hear ya I bet he hasn't heard about the two dirty DEA agents either lol. I'm a bartender too and I've already turned most of my kitchen staff onto it as well as a few customers just keep the fight alive. Have a $1 on me  @_date: 2015-04-22 18:48:21
Hmmmm maybe but if you knew him you would understand a little more
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:53:06
I'll gladly accept your Kruggerand send it this way ;)
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:28:03
Thanks!! I really appreciate that 
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:02:03
Alright will do :D Cheers!! and thank you
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:00:25
No we don't but if I'm working and someone wants to I'll gladly accept the Bits myself and reimburse my employer in fiat 
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:04:37
Correct but as I said in my post I'm not obligated to give anything so I'm sure they will be thankful for whatever I give not sure what luck has to do with it
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:39:43
As someone who works for tips I've come to learn any tip is better than no tip 
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:46:46
Thank you sir much obliged
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:37:23
I'm in Baton Rouge at a family owned place called Georges 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:20:43
My pleasure. Heres to bringing new faces into the future cheers
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:19:33
Yeah that's the only problem with it down here you can only spend it online even though I rarely do it would be nice to have the option to go someplace physical. I've never been to the food truck either and been to lunacafe once and purchased a cup, but we seriously need more merchants. Sigh patients I guess
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:36:28
I've already tried to approach my boss with the option of at least accepting but he's an old stubborn southern man 
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:13:10
Ok give me a minute and I'll edit this with the addresses 
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:02:52
Yes thanks for asking I was lucky enough to have an old high school friend of mine to move in with 
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:26:42
And furthermore on this devaluation of bitcoin  misconception. It would only devalue it if I gave somebody $10 worth of bitcoin for five dollars in exchange when tipping is involved it does not apply
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:54:49
Hahaha so true and wow that's an excellent idea 
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:13:56
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:30:47
It's been rolling since 2009 ;) but unfortunately for me I didn't know about until  March 2013
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:20:09
He wouldn't use PayPal or even know what that is the only reason he knows what Bitcoin is because when the price went high and he knew I had some which wasn't much. He doesn't even like using CC and wish he was only a cash business 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:56:07
Ill do my best but if you know anything about a stubborn Southern man set in his ways I mean we still get hand written checks but I know one of my managers is interested in investing 
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:48:45
This made my night literally had a solid 5 minute laugh... And fellow commenters he didn't say he hoped for anyone to OD yet only if they make the same mistake twice and let's be honest if we witness anyone doing the same mistake twice we all look at them as how shall I say an f'ing idiot lay off him it was a great rant  and this was the first time anything like this happened right? ;) 
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:11:35
I'm very much against the email entering I'm new to Bitcoin and I believe just entering an address was way more convenient I'm never going to go through the hoops for xapo to pay out.  
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:43:34
Indeed it is
