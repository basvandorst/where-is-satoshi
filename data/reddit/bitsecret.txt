This info is false.  I contacted Gyft after not finding any info on their website about the extra $50 over $100.
Edit...found it.  Their customer chat support are unknowledgeable.  Thanks for the link!

This is the initial entry of institutional investors. This is when the Harvard, Yale, and MIT size investors are getting their first real exposure and getting their feet wet. Once they get outsized returns in this fund they will begin investing in the second and third fund offerings.
Right now they are playing with low basis points of their portfolios but they will soon realized crypto is its own asset class. I'll leave the rest to your imagination.

We clearly need to post more so the price will rise.

Half of the half. It's the quartering.

Why?  Bitcoin's price has a function of supply and demand.  I welcome all buyers.

We're up 10% from the bottom. That's a run in traditional markets. Calling bear and bull markets can only be confirmed in hindsight. If we went up another 10% this month and another 10% next month that would confirm the bear market ended back at 3200. Neither one of us can say we are right or wrong today. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:12:12
3200 to 3600 is a reversal. A small one but it still fits by definition. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:38:46
Who says we're still in a bear market. Bear markets go down, not sideways.

Bearwhale occurred when it was $300, That should put things in perspective. Doesn't feel that long ago. And we're up 20x since then.

This is the biggest news I've heard in the Bitcoin space! A GP moving from one of the top VCs so early in his career to focus on an emerging market such as Bitcoin. That is passion!

We have enough to pay off our mortgage and yet she still supports my dream. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:19:55
I had this conversation with my wife the other day as we talked about when to sell.  I explained that holding BTC represents my dreams.  As long as I hold Bitcoin I can dream about living a life beyond what we live today.  Once I sell our Bitcoins, my "dreams" are dead.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:57:18
I stopped buying when I couldn't lower my cost basis of $385. Now I'm trading alts to increase my BTC hodlings further dropping my cost basis. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:28:42
I didn't want it to stop

If you pay your balance in full each month, it will be the same as them giving you free crypto. I make a ton off of credit card reward points. It would be the same, but with crypto rewards.
