Never mind then. I was trying to gently bring you around to my original point via some success stories (I'm just not up to date enough to have any readily available)
Your criticism of my example is valid, but it has nothing to do with the point I was making, which is that behaviors change when you solve a problem for someone, not when you enlighten their intellect. For a Vietnamese fisherman as well as a lawyer in Chicago, this is true. If people want bitcoin to succeed, they need to solve someone's problem with it better than existing methods. If you had some success stories, this would most certainly be the case, by definition.

Academics pursue topics out of intellectual interest, not advocacy. 
Furthermore, if you think about my post, you'll find I am providing advice on how bitcoin can succeed, not advocating for its failure. 
Edit: your username just made me laugh very loudly in a crowded elevator!

What else is there between holding money and giving money?

I'd love to hear about examples of everyday folks in these communities finding success in bitcoin that exceeds the utility of the existing financial system, to the point of displacement -- that would be truly exciting. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any.

Not true.
You know what the sound of the Semantic Web dying in the 2000s was? A bunch of researchers publishing papers that said, "The technology is here, we just need to educate users how to use it!"
You know what the sound of the Semantic Web coming back to life in the 2010s was? Total silence. Because when you search Google for a movie actor and get a list of co-starring actor pictures, you don't care that it's a graph of knowledge behind the scenes that served it to you.
My gist: Success comes from solving problems, not appealing to ideals. People are interested in money and transacting money, not about distributed currencies. Make a stable currency that enables me to pay a coffee vendor as I can right now with my cell phone (it takes about 1.5 seconds) and I'll *maybe* be interested. Maybe because I can already do that. So you have to do better.
You have to compete by offering something that helps my life. Not appealing to my technical education.
