Luckily there are now alternatives that make it even easier to obtain bitcoin. I have $800 in limbo since they don't respond to their support queries. No answer since November 17th from them.

Thank you Rosie. You seem to be the only one that gets things done in a timely manner over there.

Can only turn a blind eye for so long....

I meant that for people in general based on what you wrote above. Not specifically at you since I could tell you don't use them lol.

I mean I was expecting that to be the case eventually as those who hold power will try everything to maintain it. But as soon as we KYC anywhere the IRS has our info IMO.  Coinbase has my money in limbo and my guess is they credited to some other person's account and are probably making me wait while they recover it.

I can understand that. As a customer I need results not excuses. 4 Business days is far too long for what was supposed to be a same day wire.  Either way once I contacted via reddit my issue has been solved.

I only ever use the to purchase bitcoin and never store them there. But even with purchasing and moving money there they have horrific customer service and constant glitches. I've read many reports and it hadn't affected me until now. Guess their issues are systemic and will eventually bring them down.

Would be a big blow but they are making money from their exchange volume and payment processing I think. Otherwise, doesn't look good for them with all the "issues"

First of all, I've been investing a long time and that's besides the point. The problem is that wire transfers are archaic methods and can easily result in a headache. This is nowhere near panic, but it is my money and they have been irresponsive for over 3-4 days like a shady operation would be, further harming confidence in their capabilities.
Wire transfers are supposed to be **SAME-DAY** not 3-5 business days like an ACH smart ass. I have plenty of other BTC and no where did I say I was trying to get in at a specific price, although this has cost some opportunities to add at better prices during dips. I also expect it to potentially drop before heading higher.  
So if you had money you sent to a non-bank in limbo with the company non-responsive and you wouldn't be pissed? Hard to believe that nonsense.

Fix means the specific rate they "fix" for that period when exchanged for USD. It can be both appreciation or devaluation. You have to look at what it was last time. The higher the amount the more it got devalued. The lower means it strengthened but both are a "fix".

Algos going to algo aka sell on news or negative comments. Rinse and repeat. It gets bought up.

were you running Windows OS?
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:03:35
No one serious about crypto or security will ever use Windows again especially with the literal NSA backdoors. You are essentially sharing your wallets and private keys with them, Microsoft snd whoever exploits the Win7-10 backdoors.

Completely naive and ignorant statements. One thing is to be patriotic, the other is to understand nothing of how central banks dominate counties with their policies. This is all about control.
