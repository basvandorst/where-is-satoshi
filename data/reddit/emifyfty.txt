Thank you for answering !
I think i wasn't clear enough in my explanations. My topic is imposed by my teacher wich is " The Bitcoin : Operation and prospects ".
And i was trying to see for the propects part,maybe what was the impact on the economy since 2009. Doing a little econometrics to observe for instance if their was an impact on banking transactions and on a more global scale the payments sector since the bictoin was created.
I would galdly accept your offer that would help me a lot i think !

Thank you for your answer !
That's a really interesting video and way to see things i'm looking into it. What do you presonally think could be the social impact of the Bitcoin ?

You think so ?
I know that money landering existed way before the Bitcoin, especially through real estate etc.. Do you mean dark markets on the web, do you have any source ?
I am sure it helped a lot and make it easier for dealers. But i wouldn't be so sure about the existence of it. Except if you have some conclusive evidences.

Thank you for your answer !
I ws thinking the same about the cryptography not too much details. My first intent was to focus about the Bitcoin as the replacement of the current banking system, so i think that's what i might further develop. I wanted to do an econometrical study about the impact of the bitcoin on the banking system in terms of payments system and transaction. Did it really affect them or not ? In order to do that i need some statistics or maybe if it was done before a study on that matter. Do you know any about that ?
Still your blog is really interesting and your thesis is really complete about security and the network in itself. thank you again for your help !
