CCN just published: How to Get Your Girlfriend Interested in Cryptocurrency. For anyone who has a hard time relating to people who don't know what they're talking about half of the time. Here it is.

I'm an ENTP - through and through. I'm also a human.

Yes, I realize it's inaccurate. The article is just kind of fun. Like when pop media outlets publish Game of Thrones Characters' MBTIs, but for crypto. It's just entertainment.

His name comes up a lot in discussions about crypto.

Also, it seems like you know a lot about this, so please weigh in on any of the others if you have opinions. I'm going through and still looking for people who fit ESFJ, ESFP, INFJ, ISFJ and ISFP. For now, I have added Nick Szabo as ISTJ; Naval Ravikant as INTP; Craig Wright as ESTP; Charlie Lee as ESTJ; and CZ as ENTJ

I've taken the Myers-Briggs test multiple times, and the free version from 16personalities.com, it always comes up ENTP. I have extroverted intuition (Ne) - bursts of energy followed by periods of reclusion. I'm quick-witted, and I LOVE to debate (but I hate to argue) - intellectual sparring is my favorite activity. I love batting around ideas with people (especially people who I trust). Then, I love to reverse the debate and see if I can win from the complete opposite perspective. I love metaphors and use them constantly, and I quickly bounce from project to project. 
Then, I have introverted thinking (Ti) - I zone out of conversations to reflect in my head, and then quickly zone back in, usually before the person I'm talking with even notices. I don't care about making "small" decisions at all, and I'm very good at altering perspective. 
Then, extroverted feeling - Fe - I'm super warm, welcoming, and empathetic (or most people think I am at least). My mood varies dramatically based on the moods of the people around me. 
Finally, introverted sensing - Si - I have an unbelievable memory. It would shock you. I can often tell you what page number a quote was on, or at the very least what color or artwork the cover of a book is. My memory of conversations is even better than of read info. And, in certain instances, I do value and respect convention and tradition. For instance, I love holidays, and I understand why marriage is a thing. 
I'm also very shy and introverted for an extrovert. Another ENTP characteristic. I'm charming, people warm up to me quickly. 
I'm not completely stuck on it though. I suppose I could be something else. Why do you say no humans are ENTPs yet? I'm just curious, where does that come from?
