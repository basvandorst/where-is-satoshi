Had forgotten about firstbits.  Thank you.

You might be mistaken I'm afraid.
@_date: 2012-09-25 21:52:49
Thank you.
@_date: 2012-09-25 21:53:03
Indeed. Thanks.

Thank you. I look forward to using it day to day.

Ha! No, just a Fresno Fair ticket and anything else I can think of.

Now that's wasting cpu cycles :)

Thank you.

Yes, see my edit.

Thank you all.  I stayed up way too late last night learning about bitcoin theory and implementation (was late to work this morning, damn giddiness.)  I realize now that finding hashes does solve the real world problem of verifying bitcoin transactions.
Perhaps this current Bitcoin excitement will not only bring about a transformation in how we keep and spend the fruits of our labor, but also encourage more interest into cooperative humanitarian computational pursuits.

Thank you.  This is exactly what I should have searched for.

Where do we mine for them?

Firstly, I've been there.  Take the time to read the faqs  on the right side of this subreddit, and really think about the protocol paper.  It is pure elegance.
For my personal benefit of gaining practice explaining them, here goes:
1.  What's produced? A chained block of verified transactions that hashes to a value below the current difficulty.
2.  Who benefits from this?  Everyone involved.  The people exchanging bitcoins are assured that their transactions are valid.  The person who mined the block (found a random nonce that resulted in a low hash) is rewarded with 50 newly generated bitcoins.
3.  What makes this work?  The combined effort of everyone properly following the protocol.
4.  People just agree they have value?  Yes. Especially because they cannot be counterfeited, devalued, or controlled.
5.  Hackers making billions of bitcoins:  The beauty of the enforced work aspect.  A hacker could modify the protocol on his local client to say give themselves a billion bitcoins with small difficulty, but no other node on the network would accept the transaction as valid, because it deviates from the protocol.  Only if the hacker had more than 50% of the total hashing power (and we're in the TeraHash per second realm now) could they even temporarily give themselves any fraudulent bitcoins.
6.  The strength of Bitcoins has little to do with the open source nature of the client. It's all in the accepted protocol and the current strength of the public key cryptography and difficulty in finding hashes.
To those on whose shoulders I stand, please let me know if I am incorrect with any of my points.
