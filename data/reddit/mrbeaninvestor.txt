He said "ban".  What he meant was: regulate and tax as much as possible.

you can transfer them straight over.  GDAX is a trading platform linked to CoinBase.  On GDAX, click the deposit button on the left and then select CoinBase account as your source.

Bank wire on gdax says credited to account on same day if submitted by 1:00 PT.  $10 fee.
Bank account xfer is 4 business days processing time.  No fee.

Same problem here.  I can trade what is already in GDAX, but can't add deposit from fiat bank account

Or just report it and not have to worry if it’s going to come back to bite you

Because the fed uses inflation as a hidden tax.  Easy way for them to transfer money from the have-nots to the fat cats.

Big bad tax man will always get what he thinks he is due.

While this sucks, it isn't unexpected.  There was no way that the IRS wasn't going to come after gains.
Part of the problem has been so many people blatantly advocating tax evasion.  I think it's ridiculous to be hit with such a high % tax on crypto gains, as much as anyone, but flat out LOL'ing on public forums such as reddit that governments will never be able to know how much you've traded and telling people that they'll never get caught so just quit worrying about it was begging the IRS for this kind of action.

Read through this subreddit.  This question has been asked 100's of times.

Sure-as long as it reaches$10k. 
How do you know it’s going to, though? 
If you KNEW it, why would you only buy $1,000? Why not as much as you can get your hands on?
Don’t speculate in crypto. Just send me a couple hundred bucks. You’re just going to lose it anyways on the path you’re contemplating.

Of course you can ask a question. 
People can’t respond how they feel like responding or what?
