Unfortunately their docs don't explain the inner workings of the program and not how you cna access their various classes through python.

What exactly does this do exactly?
Seems like all it's good for is sending rx

I mean Bitcoin was useful for quite a number of years, but it was basically designed to be a payment system. And frankly with more and more adoption causing continual TX delays, and high TX fees.
The bitcoin community can't even agree on, yet work together to come up with a reasonable solution. 
I mean maybe I'm missing someting but I see aboslute NO useful purpose for BTC. It's anonymity features are quite easy to track, it offers a payment system that in it's current state is broken unless you're lucky to have enough money and pay high TX fees.
There are so many more altcoins that do what bitcoin does, but even better and more. Yet anytime I hear people explain the greatness of BTC I've yet to hear anything that doesnt have the word "decetranlized, revolutionary, etc.."
Maybe I'm missing something and if I am I would love to be enlightened however I see putting anymore more into BTC at this point a bad idea (again maybe I'm just missing something that's causing to me feel like this).
I turned a quarter of my BTC, cashed out another  1/4 to pay some bills, and distributed the remaining 1/2 (1/4) into other alts.

IT WORKED!! It just took quite a bit of time, and I'm used to it be instantaneous!
Thanks Mandrik0!!!

Yea I'm not going to use it often, was just curious to see if it worked.
So you did get a payment?
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:26:07
Anyone have any experience with this happening, and what did you do?

Yea I agree Bitcoin is heading into new uncharted territory especially with the news that came from Coinlab not too long ago (not even a week.)
You are right so we will get fairly positive opinions, but I mean a $2 price increase in 1441 minutes is pretty astounding. (Im basing this on the past two months or so.) 
I remember February 2nd it was $22.40 at one point in the day for a single btc. $14 price increase, with $2 of that being from not even a day is pretty fucking crazy.

Yea I looked into it some more and it seems sketch.
I did a whois, and they protected their whois searches.
@_date: 2013-10-13 05:03:45
Google doesn't even have a listing for them.. Definitely shady

Hey, earlier tonight I came across this website ( and they seem to have some pretty cheap machines, for insane hash rates.
Example, for $340 ($240 machine, $100 shipping) you can get a miner capable of pulling 90Ghash/s.
This seems to good to be true, so I'm just wondering if anyone else has heard of them?
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:38:36
Super interesting to watch, wonder what's causing the massive change in prices, looks like order volumes are going up.
