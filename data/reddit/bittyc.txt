THIS!  Don't be fooled by the fancy charts and terms, this isn't too far off from simply drawing a line through the 2017 price and extrapolating into 2018.

What other completely different address generator (that allows user input) are you aware of that I could use as another reference point?  I've read through your comment history and you (and many others) only mention bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com, which as you mentioned share the exact same crypto code.

Ah, excellent!  I wasn't aware that feature existed.  Now even though it does, couldn't the site be maliciously hacked to deterministically generate a predictable key based on the input?  So to boil it down to a very simple example, if my input was "4", then the code would find the closest multiple of 5, then use that as the actual input to generate the address.  Then a hacker could go back and regenerate all addresses using an input of a multiple of 5 and steal those bitcoins.  I find this highly unlikely, but how can I convince myself that this is a non-issue?
While I'm SUPER paranoid, I think I can live with this as long as I follow the precautions listed below.  Is there anything else I could do to put my paranoia to rest?
1. Download bitaddress.org AND bitcoinpaperwallet.com directly from GitHub
2. Verify sha256sum of the latest release (and historical releases for extra paranoia factor)
3. Verify results of user-defined inputs between bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com
4. Run everything offline

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert.
My understanding is that at the time of the fork, anyone who owns BTC will also own an equivalent BCH on the other side of the fork.  The BCH will have an identical public address and private key so that no action is needed by the BTC owner to also obtain the BCH.  That being said, if you don't actually control the private key (which is the case on most if not all exchanges), you can be in trouble if the exchange does not support BCH.  Coinbase has not rolled out any plans to support BCH and controls ALL of its users BCH, which is why I moved to a non-exchange storage option.  
Another caveat that I'm worried about, given that the BCH is controlled using the same private key, I have read (but have not confirmed) that your BCH transactions can reveal your private keys that can then be used on the BTC chain (or the other way around where your BTC transactions can reveal your private keys, that can then be used on the BCH chain.  I think this would require an unscrupulous 3rd party that submits your transaction and not an actual problem with the fork, but again, I'm not an expert on the fork.

I can't tell if BCH is going to amount to anything, so at this point I'm just holding by BCH and BTC.  I was tempted to sell my BCH right away and realize those free dollars, but they're only free dollars if BCH ends up failing (which I have no idea if it will or not).  The fact that BCH hasn't completely crashed today (at least so far) indicates there's at least some interest in seeing it through.  Should be an interesting next few weeks.

I want to keep my bets active on both horses, so I'm not selling, but also settling the transactions safely when selling one or the other I'm very nervous about and am just going to hold both.  I think it's way to early to decide what version of Bitcoin will survive.

This may be obvious, but if you bought a bitcoin before the fork, you now have +$300 of value if you sell your BTC and BTH, so basically for one bitcoin pre-fork, it's worth over $3,000.

This isn’t quite OP was talking about but I always wondered if a blockchain (or really any digital information storage) could be created to track 1 to 1 of physical items like designer purses or shoes so you know they’re legit.  Haven’t been able to figure this out on my own. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:13:55
This is a genuine question I’m not trying to be a dick: how can you connect the physical to Bitcoin while not allowing duplication.  If input the same keys on two coins, whoever spends it first wins. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:23:45
Mine just went through almost 12 hours in. Good luck.

If the transactions are delayed past the fork, a lot of people are going to be out their rightful bitcoin cash. I hope bitcoin cash fails, but if it doesn't that's egg (or more egg) on Coinbase's face.

What made Bitcoin click for me was learning how an offline generated address can still hold Bitcoin and the hashing relationship between the public and private key.  If you understand that and the basics of the ledger, I think that's a good place to start if the white paper is too dense. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:15:17
Yeah, there should be some videos out there about how paper wallets work and how they can store value.  Other things you can look up is how anyone can own bitcoin since it's digital (the key is one way encryption).  I think looking up those topics should get you going on how bitcoin can be sent and stored to addresses that are generated offline.  If you have any questions feel free to post a comment.

Today already sucks.  I submitted a transaction to move the rest of my BTC out of Coinbase 6 hours ago and the transaction has not gone through yet.  If it doesn't before the switch 8/1, I will not be a happy camper. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:44:40
Not trying to be a dick, but when you say "withdrawal", do you mean transferring BTC out of Coinbase, or withdrawing dollars to your bank account?  I tried moving my coins to a different address 6 hours ago and am still waiting.

I've been waiting to buy the dip since $1,500.  FML.

The total market cap of Bitcoin is still very small.  Aiming for the stars.
