Can't agree more. First discovered Bitcoin during the Apiril 2013 surge. I found the open source decentralized p2p nature very intriguing but it wasn't until about 2 months of digging deeper until the implications of the mining process finally sunk in. More mining power makes the network stronger. Stronger network attracts more users. More users raises bitcoin price. Higher bitcoin price incentivizes more mining power. In just a little over four years the number of users has gone from 1 to ~1,500,000. Even with so few users the price is already ~$500 and is considered a serious threat by govts around the world. We haven't even hit critical mass of users yet... When this baby hits 88mph your gonna see some serious shit...

You are still vulnerable to coercion if you keep your Bitcoin private keys with a third party like Slump, Coinbase, MtGox, etc.
YOU CAN GENERATE AND KEEP YOUR BITCOIN PRIVATE KEYS COMPLETELY OFFLINE. 
If you use Bitcoin to its full potential it is absolutely voilence/coercion proof.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:30:50
OP is right. Bitcoin is the first form of wealth that is practically immune to coercion of any kind. With USD or any fiat they can seize your funds through the banks or just inflate the money supply to silently tax an entire population. Getting someone to turn over their Bitcoins has to be done voluntarily by the owner of the private keys. Perhaps if you could torture someone into giving up their keys but that is orders of magnitude more overt than taxation/inflation. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:58:18
The market cap of bitcoin is still very low for a global currency. The question is will the distribution of wealth change as it grows to represent a larger and larger economy. Large holders will want to lock in profits by cashing out or invest in other assets at various stages so things will change before bitcoin grows up.  Also, BTC is always better than fiat because no central authority controls the money supply. With bitcoin you know exactly what the total supply will be and the rate at which it will be created.

@_date: 2014-06-06 01:50:04
Think of it this way... If Bitcoin became the standard global currency then owning 21 BTC would be equivalent of owning 1 millionth of all the money in circulation in the entire world. To put that in perspective just the US economy alone has an estimated $1.23 trillion USD in circulation so owning 1 millionth of the US economy would equate to $1.23 million.
Now how much money is currently in circulation in the entire world? A lot more than $1.23 trillion worth. Maybe someone else knows.
Take with a grain of salt though. World economy is gonna go through massive changes if we actually complete a global switch to limited currency...

Wow... This is getting out of hand. Almost every block capped. Unconfirmed transactions have shot up to &gt; 25,000. We really need a block size limit increase!
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:29:32
I understand and generally agree with what you're saying about 0-fee transactions. However, this is not relevant to the current problematic state of Bitcoin. Right now there is an ever growing pool of unconfirmed transactions and a significant amount of them are not spam but include reasonable fees. Even if the current spike in transactions is only temporary we will be consistently at these levels in 2-6 months at current growth. 
Miners are still in a subsidy phase, benefiting from an inflation of the supply currently worth ~$10870 per ~10min block. The current 1mb limit means the cost of a node is a couple dimes per day. The cost increase to nodes for doubling the blocksize limit is very low compared to the cost of letting the entire transaction capacity of the network grind to a halt. Maybe someday SegWit, [thin blocks]( or lightning network will reduce the need for blocksize limit increases. Until those features are reasonably vetted it makes sense to go with the low cost and low risk option of raising the block size limit.

Litecoin (and probably other crypto currencies) will be very useful in the future. The max quantity of litecoin is 4 times greater than the 21 million cap of bitcoin which will be attractive those dealing with inexpensive products. As bitcoin becomes more and more valuable it will be easier to do day-to-day transactions like buy a hamburger for a couple litecoin than for 0.000015 btc. Also the difficulty to complete transaction blocks is set so there is an average solve time of 2.5 mins (vs 10 mins on bitcoin. That means a much shorter wait time to have have your transaction added to the block chain and ready to be spent again. For things like selling a car you'd probably still ask for btc because the network is more trusted and secure. Not to mention that it will be best to diversify our risk and not overly trust one particular hashing algorithm.

I was having the hardest time convincing my sister about bitcoin. She didn't want to hear anything about some "new money" and wont let me even finish a sentence. 
After watching our dear friend James D'Angelo's video about deflation ( Somewhere around the "mother earth hates inflation" part a massive lightbulb went off inside my head (my sister is a hardcore environmentalist).
Here's the short version of our ensuing 2 hour convo: In an inflationary economy everyone knows their dollars will be worth less next year. This encourages the consumer to rush out and spend it while they can. It encourages business to  buy up as much stock as possible because next year the same money wont buy as much. Also, a $5 profit margin will also not be worth as much next year either so they have to figure out ways to make the product cheaper and cheaper year after year to keep up with inflation. Quality of product goes down over time. 
At this point she explodes with fervor about how she has been trying to lobby agricultural companies who have been jacking up cows full of hormones, force feeding them and rushing them to the slaughter house as fast as possible. How they are trying to make more profits at the expense of all of our health. It was hard to keep up with her mile-a-minute examples of waste and consumerism in every type of business.
Then I told her that bitcoin works the OPPOSITE. A DEFLATIONARY economy where every year you can bet your money will be worth more. This encourages everyone to save. It encourages businesses to not waste because they want to spend the least amount of money possible today (since it will be worth more tomorrow). Businesses will also be encouraged to make high quality and long lasting products that will appeal to customers strongly enough that they will part with their precious bitcoins instead of saving them. Soon enough you see the light bulb goes off in my sisters head. She screams "Inflation is why I can't get these people to change their ways! It's all because of the money printing!"
A couple days later she is now a bitcoin expert and one of the craziest and most passionate bitcoin evangelists I know...

It took more than a month to bring friends and family up to speed on bitcoin. As Erik Voorhees points out, the hardest part is that most people haven't ever paused to think about what really makes something "money". Took a lot of convincing to finally get them to start looking deeper for themselves but persistence pays off. Waded through cries of ponzi, tulips and bubbles by talking about the differences between the properties of bitcoin/fiat/gold, the potential impact of removing all barriers to complex financial services, and the resiliency of p2p cryptography especially in the case of BitTorrent. I couldn't get my environmentalist sister to hear a word about bitcoin until we went over what kind of impact deflationary economics can have on waste and inefficiency. 
Now my entire family and all close friends are well invested into bitcoin.  My girlfriend's devout Christian parents went from calling bitcoin the mark of the beast to dropping $10k after a few convos. Just called up my folks tonight to try and curb any fear they had over the recent price drop but it turned out that they weren't even phased... In fact, my dad was anxious about a bitstamp wire xfer getting through quick enough to grab a batch of cheap coins.

We'll be moving past fossil fuels and even nuclear energy soon. From dark matter research and experiments like the Casimir effect we learned that a vacuum is not an empty void like we once thought. There are already nearly a hundred patents out now for capacitors and other devices that utilize this zero point field to generate free energy.

Intrinsic value is subjective. A sweatshirt has no intrinsic value if your frying under the desert sun but lots if your freezing in the snow. All the emails and Facebook messages we send each other have no value if we're hungry but its easy to see what value global instant communication has brought us. Bitcoin's value comes from the protocol itself. It is a tool that gives us way to store money and transact globally in a cryptographically protected deflationary system that can not be altered or manipulated by any one entity. When you live in a world where central banks have a monopoly on money printing and capital controls I'd say Bitcoin has tremendous value. Now if your in the wilderness and need something to help you start a fire then i suppose USD would have more intrinsic value to you :)

I agree milli and micro denominations will be used but Litecoin and other currencies do have advantages. Blocks are added much faster to the block chain with ltc. That would be useful for businesses who want very fast verification. Also only supporting one digital currency in the long run would leave us vulnerable. Best to diversify risk and not put all your trust behind one hashing algorithm or group of miners. If a change was made to the bitcoin system that introduced flaws or went against the founding principles we should have well developed options to switch to.

There are escrow protocols built into bitcoin that haven't been tapped yet. As bitcoin develops, software will be designed to take advantage of this. For example, you could tie the outputs of a transaction to the delivery status of an item. As long as both parties agree to how the software will decide the payee then you can make bitcoin fair for both buyers and sellers. Phase two of bitcoin will be the Cambrian explosion of new software that interacts with the blockchain and its conditional payment system.

Check out this useful video about mining: 
Basically bitcoins come into existence as rewards to people who dedicate their computers to power the network (miners). The more computer power you add to the bitcoin network the more coins you get. Mining is a brilliant way to give people incentive to expand and secure the network (which is what gives bitcoins value in the first place) while simultaneously ensuring that bitcoins are generated at a steady rate and distributed fairly to contributors. Originally 50 bitcoins were rewarded every 10 mins but the reward size halves roughly every 3 years. A maximum of 21 million will be generated by year 2140 (at which point the incentive will be only the transaction fees instead of new bitcoin). The source of all bitcoins is from this mining process but since 2009 they have changed hands quite a bit

It's likely that transaction fees would take care of the miners after the block rewards finally expire. By that time you can expect that the protocol will have been upgraded and changed quite a bit. The blocks themselves will probably be much much bigger in the future and the fees will add up to a good reward.
I doubt that third party platforms will out completely out compete the ownerless bitcoin network. Plus the third parties platforms will still be paying miner fees to use the network. 
We could always switch to another crypto currency but it seems much more likely that bitcoin will just adapt to meet demand.

I actually think that this is one of the most interesting things about bitcoin. Early adopters ranging from gamer college students to anarcho-capitalists to tech savvy entrepreneurs are suddenly coming upon large fortunes as the price rises. Some are not doing much other than cashing out and buying a new Tesla but others are investing back into the bitcoin ecosystem. It's fascinating to read some stories of students using bitcoin profits to clear all their debt and pursue their dreams instead of spending the next 10-15 years of their life struggling to pay back loans. I am very curious to see what projects come to fruition as wealth is transferred from those in power to young, tech savvy underdogs. 
For example, I wonder what will happen when bitcoin miners start hitting the limit on ASIC efficiency. At that point increasing profitability means finding cheaper electricity. I think bitcoin miners may end up investing heavily in renewable energy sources in the future to get an edge on the competition :)

In an inflationary economy consumers and businesses are encouraged to spend fast instead of save because their money will be worth less tomorrow when it is debased by money printing. When the printed money is unevenly distributed it effectively taxes the population and transfers the wealth to the recipient of the new money (it is given directly to the banks in most cases). When the banks receive the new free money they give more debt at high interest rates (loans and credit cards) while the debasement drives interest on savings to near zero (UK considering negative interest rates). They argue that this credit spending spree helps stimulate the economy when it really just gives everyone a huge monthly bill to pay on accrued debt while stagnating our wages. Inflationary system over time = debt, wasteful spending and ever rising prices. Deflationary system = interest on savings, careful investments and ever lowering prices. A sudden switch would be rough in the short term as rising Internet rates would collapse the hyper inflated derivatives market very quickly. Business and individuals operating outside their means via credit would have the rug pulled out from under them but switching to deflation is how we start unwinding the mess we are in.

Not only could you use the BIP38 protocol to password protect the use of your private keys you can use cold storage wallets. You can generate a new wallet/key on an offline computer and send money to that wallet address. Then the private key has never been exposed to the web. 
You can even spend from an offline wallet WITHOUT connecting it to the web. You can have it sign the transaction offline and then you can transfer the signed transaction via QR to an online phone/comp. 
Like I said. If you know what you are doing you can keep your most valuable private keys COMPLETELY OFFLINE.

Two people could bet on a baseball game, send btc to a conditional transaction, the software checks and MLB stats page after the game is over and automatically delivers the pooled btc to the winner of the bet. Really if you can write a program that will validate the conditions of any type of agreement you can think of then bitcoin can eliminate the middle man.

LTC or a similar protocol will probably be very useful right along side BTC as it gains more widespread adoption. The faster verification of new transaction blocks and larger supply will make it more attractive for the less expensive day-to-day transactions.
