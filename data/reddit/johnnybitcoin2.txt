He specifically says it will not be bitcoin when someone asks him a few tweets down. I agree, it will probably be something similar to what Ecuador is introducing.

A few tweets down someone suggests bitcoin and his response is:   no vamos a usar la moneda más inestable del mundo, pero gracias por la sugerencia 
Translation: We are not going to use the most unstable money in the world, but thanks for the suggestion

It varied, some days multiple transactions (as high as six or so, sometimes lower), other days zero. In any case it was an increase over the past. I thought it might be because of higher volume, but if so I'm surprised they didn't communicate with me, perhaps ask if I wanted/ needed a business account. They also effectively informed me only after they closed my account and my access to it, which again, even if they thought it should be a business account seems extremely harsh. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 13:20:38
Yes. On both occasions the people I brought--who knew almost nothing about btc before-hand--got excited and took photos of it all.

I cross-poisted this to BitcoinUK and a someone there said they used Barclays account on localbitcoins for a much higher volume and frequency than I used it. They called him about it, he explained and they said it was fine. Not sure what the difference between the two cases are, unless it's somewhat arbitrary/ random.

thanks, I'll give this a try.

Yes! Just sent .0062. I really think that btc can revolutionize how we interact with and fund media. Let's encourage this!!! Article about btc and media:

I have to look into flattr more, I'm not sure how compatible it is with wordpress (what I use)  but yes, this is a great platform, thanks for pointing it out. Flattr seems to solve the micro-transaction problem by lumping them out monthly, but i think bitcoin can solve it on an individual basis. Either way it's cool that multiple options exist and hopefully they build off each other. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:46:06
I have looked into this. Personally I prefer tipping over pay walls but this is also a good option which i think is great and should be supported. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:49:56
It was "up to 6" a day. Over two months I did around 100 transactions, which works out under 2 per day on average.

Coinbase says this is NOT US focused---but as far as I know .edu is for US universities. Does anyone outside the US have a .edu? In the UK we use .ac.uk
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:51:24
yes! hopefully other sites start accepting tips or otherwise use bitcoin to subvert the advertisers, lets encourage those that do. 
And thanks for the tip!

Wow, you really don't like the word "frozen." Read the letter, I do not currently have access to the account, what verb would you use to convey that? I'm not trying to be deceptive. I literally posted the entire correspondence I received from Barclays. If the same thing happens to you and the bank tells you they "might" close your account, you can keep all your funds in because you think withdrawing them will look suspicious. I withdrew my money while I knew I still could, that seems like the best idea to me rather than taking my chances. I would do the exact same thing again. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:47:04
I did that too. Opened the page with a different browser and it came up again--alternatively clearing that site from your browsing history should do the trick. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:43:54
I'm not sure why you think the bank would post a cheque for any remaining balance. The letter in no way indicates that. Instead it says they "will not not respond to any requests" after the account is closed. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:54:32
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:48:00
The last employee I spoke with BEFORE I withdrew my funds suggested my relationship with the bank might be terminated. Them closing the account was not a reaction to me making a withdrawal. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:26:21
yeah me too. oh well, easy come easy go.

I'm pretty sure the QR code is not present at the subway station but was just cropped into the photo. In NYC those subway signs hang down and are a rectangle, ie. if real that sticker would somehow just be floating on air. If you zoom in it's easier to tell it's fake. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:21:36
Yes, on Saturday I was able to. According to the letter I received on Thursday, since Monday I have no access to my funds. The title is speaking of the present situation, not the past.

It's the only one I've ever had on my (new) smartphone so i can't compare, but as a wallet it seems very good. I sell on localbitcoins and got mycelium specifically because of the trading function. As I said, this was the first time I actually sold with Mycelium, though I make fairly regular sells on lbc on comparable margin--in fact made half a dozen or so just today. So yes, volume seems very low but it is a cool feature to have regardless. Have you made any trades on it yet?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:43:46
yeah, it'd be great if more people used it. But to be fair, the majority of my transactions on lbc are cash deposits which seem to have a higher volume than local sells. I also like that lbc has a floating price for local sales. The guy contacted me this morning but couldn't meet until the late afternoon, yet the price was locked in. I'd like it to move with the market, not sure if thats possible with Mycelium.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:31:43
selling. I'm not shocked that the account was closed, what surprises me is the speed and force with which it happened. It almost seems as if their design was to seize the funds and that only did not happen because of a bit of luck and the good timing that I noticed immediately. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:32:37
Good catch, thanks. Fixed.

Hi. I'm an independent journalist and have written about Bitcoin and digital currencies for places such as [VICE]( and [The Guardian]( This month I am pitching Contributoria--which is like a kickstarter for journalism--a story about Bitcoin. As far as I know, this would be the first story they have published on Bitcoin. I need a certain amount of people to "back" the story so I can get paid and they can publish it. It's a really interesting platform, and takes less than a minute to create a free account so if you want to help me get this published, you can make an account and "back" the proposal. Thanks!
--I also wrote [this article]( for VICE a few months back. It got a lot of attention on r/bitcoin (both good and bad) so perhaps some people will remember it.

I don't see how they could ban an individual from owning bitcoin but they can certainly apply the ban to stores that would accept it. Interestingly, there are new taxes on purchases from the internet via credit cards for Ecuadorians. Not sure how they would attempt to monitor purchases made with bitcoin. 
I don't think this would affect the value of the dollar very much. It's a nation of 15 million people, with a significantly lower average income level than the US. I'm not sure what percent of USD use takes place in Ecuador but it must be very small.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:27:05
Yes, i agree. In all my ads I state that I will not sell to anyone intending to use bitcoin for anything illegal. Thus far, no one has told me they were going to but if they did I would stop the sale. Good advice. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:11:31
Quito--the capital--had it's first bitcoin meet-up recently with 20 or so people. I didn't personally meet anyone who had bitcoin and most people had never heard of it.  
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:49:57
A 60,000 member taxi union did say that they would accept it. However that information has not filtered down very well, I asked a number of taxisitas about it and a few of them knew nothing about it. I don't know when they will accept it, my guess is they will do a smaller pilot program first. In Loja, a city in the south, they will be accepting digital dollars at one of the main bus stops for municipal buses as a pilot program. Could be something similar with taxis.

Well, Ecuador would still have USD, it's just a question of if they would effectively create a parallel currency that is not tied to the amount of USD that they have. Theoretically, if they start with $100 and convert $50 to digital they still have the $100 physical dollars, but they put $50 in a vault not to be touched because it's backing the digital money. The worry is that there is no vault. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:44:36
I think that's a fair assessment. There is also a lot of speculation that the Central Bank will create digital dollars that are not backed by physical ones and effectively begin printing it's own money again. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:04:11
They have not yet said. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:01:51
In that scenario the government could artificially give it value by requiring citizens to have and use it, say to pay for state electricity bills, permits, taxes, etc. That would essentially mean it was creating it's own money again. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:10:32
As of yet they are not promoting it. They told me that they have plans for a major promotional push later this year (I don't know when) and as I said earlier, this government very effectively communicates its messages when they want to. Not sure if they will incentivize it's use with discounts etc.  
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:13:00
yes. you should. that said, be careful. you can mitigate risks, but there are still people who will try and scam you, bank issues, etc.

Hi. I'm the author of this. Yes, my margin's are really that high. On very busy days, even higher. And I posted on reddit when I met the hedge fund guy in the pet store a month or so back, so could be why it looked familiar to someone. 
edit: those margins are before fees
edit2: since lots of people are asking, yes I still do this. That said I have been trying to decrease volume and now that I published this, it seems wise to bring it down to a very low level (or none at all). Writing about it may mean the end of actively doing it.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:52:57
The difference is that it's controlled by the government. Previous to this it has been controlled privately, ie. your bank, mobile carrier, etc. This has also allowed a monopoly--other payment systems that may compete, such as bitcoin, are explicitly banned.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:26:40
A lot of people I asked hadn't heard of it either. Though the government has a very powerful propaganda machine so I'm sure that whenever they decide they want everyone to know about it, they will. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:55:47
In theory you could create an exchange for digital dollars to BTC which would be very easy to fund and withdraw from--but I don't think the government would allow that.
