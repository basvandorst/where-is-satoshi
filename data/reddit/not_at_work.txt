What are you talking about? Have you seen the data? 
Of course, it's not all rosy, but I think the issues regarding a widening pay gap are more systemic issues than related to QE or the 2008 crisis.

I know this is a super-old thread, but I felt that you were somewhat missing the concept here. Forget the USD/BTC conversion rate. If you used this service, you would be turning BTCs into shares of companies. 
Let's say 10 BTC could buy you 1000 shares of apple today. If in 1 year, the value of BTC doubled, why would you think that you could turn 1000 shares of apple back into 10 BTC? We just said that BTC doubled in value, so you'd only get back 5 BTC (or probably a bit more, since presumably the value of apple shares would also go up by some amount, but certainly less than 200%).
You take this exact same risk when you buy anything with any currency. The problem is that BTCs are much more volatile than your standard currency.

Don't use bloomberg much because it doesn't have complete tick data, but I imagine those times are just not displaying dates. June 1 17:00 - June 2 16:59 would make sense for example.

And inflation is below the Fed's target. TARP happened 6 years ago, when is the sky supposed to fall again?

Cool very interesting. Will watch the video when I get a chance. Any idea what exchanges allow this? (sorry if it's in the video... At work now!)

Can you specifically describe how HFT queue jumps? I'm curious.
