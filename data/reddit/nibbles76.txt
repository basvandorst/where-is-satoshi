Make sure you are transferring the coins to your own wallet not keeping them in the wallet they gave you.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:25:54
I don't think you know how an exchange works...
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:42:45
Yeah, definitely worth it for the piece of mind.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:22:34
retire? it's not that much.

If bitcoin is around in 2040 and your whole extended family is living off it you will not be using the phrase 'cash out'.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:01:25
what's that from?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:26:37
Armory only needs a lot of ram if it's running online. Any old computer will do for the offline wallet.

I'm Aussie and my bitstamp verification took 3 or 4 days about a month ago. I imagine they are a lot busier now though.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:53:52
If you bought a decent amount the safest way is to create an offline wallet with bitcoin armory and send them there. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:55:36
man, feel good thread

I think the 5 Million was what was seized. Who knows what else they had. TBH at this point if anyone is still trying to use GOX and they get burned they only have themselves to blame.

Withdrawing from bitstamp by bank transfer to Australia works well for me.

What exactly do you want to do? Did you download bitcoin qt? If so then you'll need to download the blockchain which will take a few days. There are other clients that don't need to do this which you might be better off with.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:14:12
What reason did they give?
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:49:17
same reason everyone didn't sell at 1K. If the bad China news didn't come along 2k in the next few months was looking pretty likely.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:05:25
The biggest thing markets don't like is uncertainty. The more clarity there is on a country like China's position on btc the  easier it is to price decisions. 
The fact that this announcement also gave the go ahead for 1 billion chinese consumers to freely use bitcoin is not really that negative when you weight it up. I wouldn't be surprised to see a quick rebound after the initial shock and panic wears off.

A 50% fall is not a 'dip'.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:52:01
So you've made the wrong decision at every turn and now you're borrowing you families money to do more of the same? Any one of us could have been a millionaire with hindsight.

Gox has been totally fucked for at least 6 months, there's no excuse to still be using them.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:38:44
Bitstamp is good if you don't mind verifying your identity and a $15 bank transfer fee (it's worth it compared to the cost of most of the Australian places if you have a few coin).

Just listened to the show, Jesus Christ I've never heard such long ad breaks.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:27:20
nice work
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:27:47
only withdrawn
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:45:27
Get a job and buy some. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:42:14
Use armory then you only have to back it up once as it is deterministic. QT is every 100 transactions but do it more often than that to be safe. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:09:43
good luck with that
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:09:55
I'd take 'insightful' with a grain of salt. It's mostly a bunch of 'traders' that would like to think they know what they're talking about but don't really.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:28:19
I bank with the Commonwealth and use bitstamp, I've only withdrawn money though (without issue). I agree it is diabolical behaviour.

Bitcoin made me purchase a legitimate copy of Windows for the first time ever and become much more security conscious in general.

I agree, correction is probably the best term.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:37:09
quit bitcoin then just copy blocks and chainstate folders over. It will have to scan them which will take a while when you load it back up again.

I gave a friend 15 btc back in 2011. He lost the USB...
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:10:53
You are 3 years too late, sorry.
