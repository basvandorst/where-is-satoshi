I hope you don't mind me responding on here (after a month), but it's always good to have at least 2 or 3 100 dollar cards. Just in case someone wants them. I know it costs a lot of money, but you will be grateful if they do get sold (and they eventually will).
By the way, if you ever need any help with jQuery, my inbox is open ;) I have done a few Bitcoin projects now including rewriting an exchange website for someone so that it accepts more Coins and Payment methods. (Yes, I can proof this, of course). 
Anyway, good luck with your project! It looks awesome ;)

"8 mBTC (same as 0.008 BTC)" 
Thank you for doing this! I hate seeing mBTC, because I still haven't learned all the denominations of Bitcoin.

SEPA payments are chargebackable IF you take legal actions. That is what ING told me.

Sounds good and good luck building!

Nice one dude!

I really like BitVegas.
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:47:41
I need BitCoinTalk!
@_date: 2013-10-04 11:47:52
It was. Theymos said that in the main thread.

You can check it here: 
Keep in mind it is hashed in a database so that adds even more security.

Not a tip, but a long time ago someone gave me 3 BTC so I could invest and work on my website. You are missed mLiberty!
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:27:26
Lol. That is quite a challenge if you ask me. I know I could do it, but it would take quite a while. Anyway, good luck finding someone to do this :P
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:36:05
This is a very very good point!
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:52:15
Same. I keep refreshing the page, because I want to check out my PM´s, the topics and so on.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:08:15
Well, what do you have in mind?
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:16:51
Well, you can always send him that as a suggestion. I am not the owner of the website. I thought it was a very interesting website, so I wanted to share it.

Dipshit. This is my faucet and I am willing to prove it if someone doesn't believe me.

My password WAS connected to my old gmail account. Changed it after I heard it, so I am safe again. Not that there is anything bitcoin related on that address, but still.

1.6.2 at the moment.
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:49:28
Like I predicted. Hahaha.
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:39:43
You are clueless, lol. I guess you are the guy who wanted 400BTC to keep his mouth shut. Your article doesn't make any sense if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:18:31
That is a very good point. Those PM's could contain very valuable information.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:41:28
It ain't working for me.
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:37:57
Or you can just wait until bitcointalk gets back online, like most people do.
