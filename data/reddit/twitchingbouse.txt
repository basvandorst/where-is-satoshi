I sincerely hope you have no more than you can afford to lose in its totality in bitcoin/ any cryptocurrency... for the sake of your child and family.

Well, if the amount in there compared to his total assets is minuscule, then being down so much doesn't hurt so much. 
Yea it still sucks to see the red, but its not really here nor there.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:47:41
eh, might as well keep it in.

I think I see your problem.

The common man doesn't really give a shit.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:43:29


Reasonable people don't. Delusional people do, and stupid people who have put their life savings in bitcoin and have to believe it for their sanity's sake do.

Doesn't really sound like healthy living honestly, curious about if that shop is still taking bitcoin for goods given the current huge drop.
If they are, they are essentially giving away money so hey, good for you, but its stupid of them.
And dear god, you say you have a family? What are your children going to do if it in fact does go to 0?
You shouldn't be going all in on this volatile shit.
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:20:18
Then they will force them to withdraw at gunpoint. I mean, they're essentially in brutish gang territory now, so it wouldn't be surprising.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:01:23


What do you think?
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:30:12
sounds like the denial phase.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:02:40
\&gt;  No one can take them away from you.
You are holding the government to a higher standard than I would in that sort of scenario.
If we're talking about a government arbitrarily seizing everything you have, which assumes a breakdown in rule of law, they'll seize your bitcoin account too at gunpoint, or perhaps after torture/ threats against your family. Of course, assuming they know you hold bitcoin.

and then rebounds...
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:52:14
the delusion is high with this comment. Ill trust a currency thats hundreds of years old over a decade old crypto.

It has influence, yes, but it isn't directly in regards to policy. They are in many respects a gate keeper for the boss, as any secretary is, but their own legal authority is effectively nil.
Its neither a positive or a negative for bitcoin, its irrelevant.

He doesn't like bitcoin because there is no inherent value to it.
bitcoin != the technology. If the technology truly is useful, then you'll see it co-opted by the banks, but it won't be bitcoin.

Normally you put your retirement funds in the safest investment possible.  10-15% is a significant amount considering you're gonna need it to live in the years after you retire.
Its your prerogative, i don't think its the best idea to put it in such a speculative investment though unless you're looking at a truly mediocre retirement and there really is no alternative for whatever reason.
As long as you don't do it for something that's supposed to benefit family.
Just make sure you don't forget the key in your old age, because shit like that can happen to the best of people.

If anyone could do so, then everyone would be getting rid of fiat currency to buy it. But that is not happening.
The demerits for bitcoin as a currency are pretty big, its notorious volatility, the limited amount available (i hear this isn't subject to change), and that it isn't backed by any government.
There is no benefit for governments to switch to bitcoin in that manner, given its limited amount, its anonymity, and the inability of the government to create more, so why would they do so?
I'm not saying crypto can't replace a currency, such as in Venezuela, whose government has totally shit the bed, but given historical trends, there is no reason to believe that even if the US govt goes through a period of hyperinflation, that it will either remain there, or give any reason for people to permanently switch to bitcoin as a currency without US government acceptance of that currency for taxes (without converting it to dollars first).
Also, if a cryptocurrency is adopted, there is no reason to believe that the currency adopted will be bitcoin itself, and not some government created currency, which is actually what the Venezuelan govt did.
Even if it was miraculously adopted, that period could very well come long after you are dead. There's no reason to believe that a hypothetical universal bitcoin adoption would happen in our lifetimes, and its actually very unlikely given the lack of benefits for governments.
To me, these are big strikes against its widespread adoption, but thats not the present. In the present, its mainly a speculative asset, and should be treated as such.
