I think one problem is that Bter lost a ton of volume after the hack a while back, hard to pay back anything without revenue. But you a right a little bit better communication would be helpful. Maybe tell clients how long it will take them to pay back the coins.

I also prefer that finex stays in business instead of going through the slow legal process, BUT finex has to be 100% transparent. Release balance sheets, earnings on a regular basis that have been checked by a reputable third party (a company not someone out of the community).

it's a personal message not a company message. he is interested in looking into crypto nothing more. The headline is a interpretation and its not stated like that in his post.

Bitcoin won't change everything due to limitations like holidays, opening hours etc. As long as something has to be approved by a person and is not automated. ;)

The headline makes no sense. 
-BTC market is super small compared to the stock market.
-China's saving rate is still very high
-big part of BTC's volume in china is trading on no fee exchanges, not long long term buy and hold investment by mom and pop.

Well said, the most important point here is. The OP is talking about monetary inflation and not price inflation. Feels like a lot of posters think this is the same.

buyers and sellers are normal customers. Its just an auction, instead of continuous trading.

They made a blogpost about the higher fees and had a popup for users after the login. They increased their fees but not really quietly.

Let's pick a random number that looks good and put out a price prediction. 
Would be better if he would add value, and talk more about MU2.

In order to really compare transaction costs, you have to include the cost to buy and sell bitcoin, not just the network fees. This is just misleading.

As long as they are not banned by law, exchanges can list them or not. People can choose on their own and do their own research. There is no rule that cryptos have to be decentralized.
