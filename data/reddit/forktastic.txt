Enter a random incorrect passcode 3 times. That will reset the device. Then reconfigure as a new device.

I was looking at custom machining one out of titanium when I came across these on Amazon. They do 99% of what I need at 1% of the cost! :)

Easy $4 DIY waterproof Ledger Nano S Case. These aluminum cases can be found from numerous sellers online for about $3 each. Google: "Waterproof aluminum pill box case bottle cache". Foam on both end caps keeps the Nano S secure. I used thick foam from the packaging on one end and some thin foam I had around for the other. For a little better protection, I will buy and add better O-Rings in the near future.

Wow... 
I turned off wifi and everything is working fine. It looks like my wifi connection was causing the issue even though other non bitcoin apps were working and connecting to the internet just fine. Very strange indeed!

For everything else, there's Bitcoin!

I really like Gemini! I have had nothing but great experiences with them. Funds usually available within 3-4 hours of wire transfer.

Using a person to person exchange (Paxful, LocalBitcoins etc.) is expensive for several reasons:
1. The seller must pay a fee to the exchange (typically about 1%)
2. The seller must escrow BTC that you may or may not pay for
3. The seller must trust that you will not reverse the payment after he has released the bitcoins.
Essentially, the seller is taking a risk by sending you immutable (non reversible) currency and is charging a premium for the convenience and relative anonymity. The "safer" the transaction for the seller, the cheaper it will be. Eg. Cash deposit cannot be reversed, so it will be cheaper.
As suggested, you may sign up on an exchange website (Gemini, Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase/GDAX are just a few) and purchase from them. 
This will require you to register some amount of your personal information. This is often Full Name, Address, DOB, SSN, Driver's License selfie with handwritten note (no I'm not joking!), passport, utility bills etc.. This information is required due to KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) laws.
After you submit your ID verification documents, it can sometimes take weeks to get approved to start trading. Once you are signed up on an exchange, you will have to fund your account. Some let you use a card, some require a direct bank deposit. ACH is free in the US but often takes 3-5 business days to clear. A wire is another option that only take hours, but that will cost approximately $25.
Exchanges have fees, too. Coinbase is something like 4% (depending on how much you buy). GDAX which is owned by Coinbase offers free trades for market makers (you set your price and hope it fills). 
TL;DR: There is no absolutely easy, cheap way to buy bitcoin. This is due to the inherent risks in our current legacy financial system and our strict KYC/AML laws.
