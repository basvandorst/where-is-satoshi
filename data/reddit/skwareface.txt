They're the 5th economy in the world and a western capitalist nation, unlike China, so if they hop on board in a big way they could be huge players for the crypto economy

The explanation for mining is really watertight to justify this currency system, and its the work of genius, but still, my point above holds regardless of that. 
Seen in the grand scheme of world economy, mining being in it's infant stages, multiply the difficulty factor and the scale of mining rigs when things get REALLY big, and then we get a clearer picture of a monster in the making. 
Google's servers are extremely energy consuming supercomputers...but unlike the rig-mining monster of the future, they provide a real-world service, it generates and stores useful information to us all that in turn generates more wealth.

There may be an art bubble, but the fact is, there has never been a burst! Even during the great depression, art as an investment has never fallen short of being positive. When an art work has historical and cultural value, it becomes heritage, it has emotional value on a collective level. Like a watch handed down from grandpa who fought World War 2 with it, handed to Dad, and now yours, it has a value more powerful than intrinsic value. Speculative as it is, art investment is one solid upstream chart, because it's traded between the rich, and however broke one part of the world is, another one is getting rich, and the rich buy art from one another.

The ratio between them is getting closer to the largely speculated 0.25, and the race of the the alt coins has Litecoins way ahead in the pecking order. We may be witnessing  right now only the beginning of an exponential slope upwards for Bitcoin considering how little the average citizen knows about it, and how much untapped territory there is for this new technology to grow, so it seems pretty feasible for Litecoins to reach theses current lofty heights of BTC value in a not so distant future.
