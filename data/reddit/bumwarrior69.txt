To be honest though, I am really suprised at the jump. I was under the impression that China was contributing alot to volume. Once they 'dropped out of the race', it only took a few days for the market to jump back up.

I'm Calli g bullshit on the article. When it was first being popularized years back, the biggest hurdle to jump over was that Satoshi owned a large portion of bitcoins and that a dump by him would destroy the price. People did plenty of research and to say that not searching for the actual name seems a bit of a farce.
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:08:06
That keeps getting repeated every time this happens and yet the price is still in fluctuation due to news in China.

I think Bitcoin and Dogecoin are fundamentally very different. I have been around and followed Bitcoin for years, and even from the start, it had a very elitist vibe around it. The libertarians were the main ones who fell in love with it. Personally, I looked I to it because I am excited for all things related to the future and technology. Even from the start, Bitcoin was meant to be considered serious if it was going to gain any traction. There was a minor sense of community and people were handing out tips. When the price of bitcoin rapidly rose, there were less tips and there were schisms.
Fast forward to the present and we see that Bitcoin has gained a lot more traction, value and people supporting it. These people heard about it whether it was due to Silk Road (and other similar communities), the rapid increase in price/publicity, or for other (serious) ideas. 
Dogecoin originated as not taking itself as serious as Bitcoin (and is trying to call itself the community coin). Before the price significantly rose, many (serious) people in here referred to it as a joke and played it off. Others who did not have a major holding in Bitcoin (or the risk takers) saw this as an opportunity to get involved with Cryptos. The power if the Doge meme already left an imprint in people's minds that it is not super serious and they can be very casual about it. Since the cost to buy even 1 Doge is considerably small, the barriers to entry made it quite accessible. Couple that with the fact that you can throw large amounts of doge and for it to be worth a minor amount, it adds a thrill.
Bitcoin today sits as the main crypto and news related to it is taken in a serious/financial understanding. If there is news, it is either about a new retailer, something added to the blockchain, scams, etc. Dogecoin on the other hand has a more lighthearted stance and as such, any news to it has been due to its jovial sense of community.
**TL;DR - IMO Bitcoin has always been considered serious, while Dogecoin is considered "fun and carefree".**

I've been involved in bitcoin from when it was worth less than a penny, and I can assure you this is all just speculation. At best this is a pump and dump. There has been plenty of news surrounding bitcoin, but nothing significant that would cause this much of a significant price increase.

This did not happen today.
Before you get involved trading, make sure you are familiar with what the current situation is at your exchange of choice.
As a side note, the credit card you have to add on file has to be a Visa (and an actual credit card, not a debit card)

Why is the website a 'bitcoin only business' if all the prices are in dollars? I understand that the only payment type may be bitcoins, but it still throws you off to see the total in USD.

For the knowledge/experience, its up to you 
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:16:38
A lot of people have their money held up in mtgox, do you really think that they would keep their money in there if they are given the opportunity to leave?
The way I see it, mtgox sells for higher than most other exchanges. Seeing that they could make a quick buck, people will flood mtgox with their bitcoin to sell -&gt; crash in price. Just looking at this subreddit, a lot of people still rely on the mtgox price. A drop in price at the most popular exchange (via word of mouth amongst average people) will lead them to panic sell.

Coinbase is the simplest exchange imo. You can buy instantly with a Visa credit card.
Edit: You can buy instantly if you have a CC linked to your account. You still need to have a bank account added

Ummmm... What the hell kind of checks do you use?
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:48:32
Some may call me crazy, but should MtGox allow people to withdraw into USD again, I sense a relatively big crash, not just for MtGox, but for other exchanges as well.
To me it seems like that MtGox's price would crash should it allow USD withdrawals again. The bigger problem is that many people still unfortunately rely on the trading price at MtGox instead of other exchanges. When they see the price fall, they are going to want to see. From then on, I only see panic sells and a crash. 
The market will recover as usual of course.

Being of Persian/Iranian descent (I may be a bit biased) but we are not bad people. The media exploits certain events and over generalizes the acts of certain people to instill this false idea that all people act that way. Despite what your opinion is about American government (or government in general) it is vastly better than Iran's.
