re the timing issues.
The reddit post and my comment on github were made within minutes of each other.

Well, Microsoft disagrees.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:46:28


This misunderstands the details.
An individual full node would indeed invalidate the TX after some time. But your wallet keeps on broadcasting the transaction and so any new node being started up somewhere in the world can end up with your transaction again. For 2 weeks.
Not to mention people actively re-broadcasting their mempool. Yes, they definitely exist.
So, sure, after 2 weeks you may double-spend your own transaction. Should your wallet support this. The results are not at all guaranteed, though.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:14:33
They must have adjusted their settings on the mempool, rejecting any transaction under X dollars fee.

And 5 minutes later someone adds a couple of blocks that includes the transaction mrEvil wanted to leave out. So you'd have to keep making a chain of only your blocks till the end of time to avoid that.
Which makes everyone else on the planet sooner or later stop using your chain, since its not distributed anymore and people will use the other 49%'s fork. Well, that or Bitcoin will just die.
Either way, mrEvil can't win this one.

Last year there was are report that there were 500.000 people using bitcoin.  This image shows that 2 years prior there were 375000 people running full nodes?
Which means that in May 2013 about 250.000 people ran a full node but owned no bitcoin. Before Bitcoin made any waves in the technical press and was essentially largely ignored.
That data stinks, it can't possibly be realistic.

I'd add some psychology to that; practically everyone has learned how money worked and has followed that all their lives.
Now Bitcoin comes and says that we have been lied to. That everyone using fiat money is being exploited every day by central banks.  Inflation is not a neat 2%, its more like 10%. Etc.
At the same time as Greece and all the other shit is happening, people can stick to their belief and work actively against Bitcoin, hoping that this makes the problem go away. Or they can embrace the Bitcoin and get a heart-attack every month over the price drops...
Revolutions always polarize people, typically against their wills. Don't expect people to be nice about it ;)

Who told you that? Having 51% allows no such thing, unless you are willing to compete with the rest of the network until the end of time, essentially forking it. Hoping that everyone will choose your more restrictive fork.
Everyone will get blocks in, so you can't block stuff from being mined, it will be mined by someone else.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:38:39
I guess the question to ask is why you do this. Why you want to spread the word.  Maybe the answer is that you expect it to cause the price to rise (and it has in the last day).
In that case you can see the advertisement as an investment for your own bitcoins to raise in value :)
Proper advocacy is done in person, not so much using posters. So you should be able to do it on a minimal budget.
Then when you have some results to show, and some actual activities you did, maybe you can ask people for funds to help you out.

The difference is that the rest of Europe *is* manipulating the Euro and the eurozone has made Greece able to borrow money cheap because Germany is backing it.
So the Euro is bad for them because it is a very poor match to their way of working.  The euro actively works against them, in fact.
Reasons for that are the disconnect between spending possibilities vs income (from taxes etc). Different economic growth projections from other Euro countries.  So the ECB makes adjustments to the Euro that are plain hurtful to Greece.
Eurozone really is showing that everyone is equal, but some countries are much more equal than others.
Bitcoin on the other hand is predictable, can not be manipulated by anyone. So everyone really is more equal.

You are arguing from the position of a technical person. Not a normal person and certainly not a business person.
The right question to ask is "what is the risk".  The answer to that question is that the risk of zero-conf is very low and the actual risk and investment for lowering said risk is a personal assessment.

I hear that internet in the US is poor, but I didn't realize it was that bad.
About 15 years ago I had 100Mbit connection, this is the norm in many European countries. If you are not connected by fiber you may have cable modem with half that speed.
Downloading 100Mb takes a good 45 seconds. Doing that once every 10 minutes is really not any "crumbling" situation.

Blocks are filled up with transactions. Spammy transactions means people using the fact that Bitcoin allows practically free transactions to be send.
So someone could create a million transactions just to destroy the Bitcoin network because they like to fill up everyones harddrive with useless transactions. Remember how email was almost dead 5 years ago because of spam?  
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:39:27
Notice that a increase of cap doesn't mean you will get blocks that are suddenly 20Mb. It will probably take quite a long time before we get there (2 years or more).
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:35:06


you are wrong.
Miners mine stuff and put a version number in the block to signify the feature is supported by them, so anyone can check the last X-number of blocks (1000) for this sign and see that if 75% of them have the consensus is reached because 75% of the hashing power has voted to upgrade to support this feature.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:48:30

20Mb every 10 minutes is 34133 bytes/second (thats 34kbytes) on a connection that can support 5megabyte per second...

@_date: 2015-06-11 06:58:56
I don't particularly see any benefit of one over the other. The 20Mb one means people are forced to rethink this in a couple of years time. Yours means we might be able to use this for many more years and we can ignore it until it breaks.
I don't care which one we get, as long as we don't get held back by the current limit.

First of all, always remember the rule to keep your money in an exchange the minimum amount of time.  Since this exchange has been operating for quite a long time already, your "don't touch" is just FUD.  Assess your risks properly...
Second, this exchange is in Poland. The country has a very different way of thinking about these issues.
The name Money laundering is really misused and not applicable to small amounts. It is meant for Breaking-bad kind of people. Remember how they calculated it would take decades to launder the money via his washing station?
If you apply some common sense you would realize that money laundering via an exchange doesn't work. The volume is just not there. Unless you are the USA that wants to have total control, countries leave these small things alone.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:14:21
Which makes a lot of sense; if miners  start to see Bitcoin price is not rising due to transactions not being acknowledged, they can upgrade and trigger the bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:02:29


How would it?
The blocks that this 26% makes will be accepted by the 75%, just not vice-versa. And they are in the minority, so any hashing-fight they do will be lost by them.
Any fork that happens will be short lived as the people on the 25% side are guaranteed to lose and thus not get any of the block-rewards they have made in their fork.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:58:46
The scaling IS dynamic. The blocks get fuller as more transactions are processed.

@_date: 2015-06-20 21:10:07


Because we are soooo far below current bandwidth provided in many parts of the world that it will take 16 years for home users to catch up to current top-of-the line.
4G home users 2 years ago had 50Mbit, which would allow hosting a node 14 - 16 years of doubling from now.  I realize that you don't have this at home, and I hope that this gets there soon. But I a pretty sure that in 15 years you'll get what Europe has now.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:37:14


Makes total sense to me.  Do you use the client? If you do, you'd know that if you run it only once a week, it takes a while on a slower machine to catch up (an hour). Switching to an easy to install client that no longer syncs is a no-brainer then.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:47:44
I do think that in 20 years the USA has speeds that can do this, in Europe most normal-price connections already can do 13.65Mb/sec. (and have been able to do so for some years).
A simple phone 4G connection currently can do 50Mbit. Which will mean that the current technology deployed in a huge part of the world will support the blockchain size 16 years from now.

It is a continueing process of improvement. The new verification routines (that don't rely on the slower openssl) will push this time down even further.
Other technological improvements can make this even better in the future.
But the bottom line here is that you don't use bitcoin-core as a wallet. You use it to become part of the network. Part of the solution.
You may not want to invest anything in a solution, and just complain that its too hard. But I bet plenty of people will want to do so. Open source and Free software have certainly shown us that this is the case for the last 30 odd years.
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:20:52


The issue there was that that "core" dev was the only one that thought perfectly valid person-to-person transactions were spam just because his religion didn't like that those transactions enabled gambling.
Lucky for us his censorship didn't get wider traction and as a result the coinvalidation was not needed.
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:34:47


Having the transactions from the dawn of time is not something that every node wants, or needs.  Only a small amount of nodes need to actually have this info for the Bitcoin network to continue operatiing.
The main purpose of a node is that it does have the UTXO and thus relays (and verifies) transactions.
Why would you argue that not having the full exhaustive node would make it useless?
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:55:05
Your statement is only true for miners, not really for full nodes.
Next to that you forget the already ongoing research for  [IBLT]( which will most likely be rolled out this or next year. This means that the propagation of a new block ends up being just a couple of kilobytes of data upload. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:00:07
Also wrong; you forget [IBLT](
You can properly mine without huge bandwidth increase when that is deployed.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:59:38


Show your math...
Here current home-connections bandwidth in a small city in the UK;
It shows you can get 76Mbit at home.
A quick google shows that in Germany you can get at home a connection that  standard has 150Mbit
For nodes that means we are not using anywhere near the max bandwidth. Not even double-percentage digits.
After the  [IBLT]( is integrated this will be true too for miners.
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:41:23
Coinmap *is* the problem, not the database behind it. So how does it benefit from your project? Unless you want to re-implement the javascript and engine of the site itself. Which essentially means replacing it :)
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:03:47






And not increasing the blocksize is doing exactly that. It will unnecessarily exclude people from using Bitcoin because their transactions won't go through.
Having bigger blocks means that people far outside the highly-connected world can't mine or in some extreme cases can't be nodes.  That in no way means they can't use bitcoin.
So your statement is wrong in two ways.
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:24:38

@_date: 2015-06-11 06:46:48
Does this take into account that you have to wait about 8 months between deciding to increase and between the increase actually taking action? So the majority of miners can upgrade their software.
Since that will happen now as well as when we roll-out a new solution, you double that time. So you loose about 1½ years in inaction. 5Mb doesn't seem to buy much, with the current rate of growth we will reach that in 2 years. And 6 months is not a long time to find any real solution.
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:34:23
Are you thinking of paying with bitcoin at the location? Or on their only website?  Then I'd say its Ok to tag.

@_date: 2014-04-15 21:53:33
Common misconception; hardforks are not about "hard" things like fileformats, etc.  Hardfork is about changing the rules of the bitcoin protocols. How the nodes communicate between each other.
Imagine a normal node rejecting a payment, and the patched node prioritizing the same payment, and forwarding it to the rest of the network.  They disagree which of the two to use. Which is 100% against what the whole point of mining is about.
Again, I don't care if its a good change or not, I care that changes are first agreed upon before being deployed.

Since you posted this to bitcoin, I have to comment on that part first.
This service is not a really smart idea for several reasons;
* you are misunderstanding bitcoin basics.  People don't have *one* wallet address. Thats not how it works. Remember, there is no message you can send with a bitcoin payment so what you are expected to do is create a new bitcoin address for every payment you want made out to you.
* you will very quickly run out of useful names and instead get confusingly similar names. It gives the illusion of human-readable, but its really not. See [ 1279)
* The limits that people can only use a-z in name is a bit too north-america in my mind. People here have lots of other characters in their name. Think about russions for instance.
I hope I don't come across too negative if I say that this service looks like a solution in search of a problem.

For those that have pickup-points, postal addresses (not a box) etc, I think it still helps to place them on openstreetmap. The reason is because you can also add a website address and various other details there which then show up on coinmap.
Please keep in mind the network effect. If there are different places to collect bitcoin based businesses, and all of them only have a partial view, the total value goes down.
Since openstreetmap is so liberally licensed and not owned by any company it is a great base which i hope sites like kerncy will use as a source.

Its interesting since its so confusing.  People don't seem to realize that a payment goes through faster than Visa using Bitcoin in practically all cases.
It *doesn't* take one or even 6 confirmations to accept a payment. After these confirmation the thing that changes is that a payment goes from "made" to "100% guaranteed to be irreversible".
In the Visa world the same takes days or weeks.
The logic here is that a 100% guaranteed irreversible transaction is only possible after a significant proof of work has been done that eliminates cheating. Even due to 51% attacks.


Certainly true, but this is not Bitcoins doing, this is the company accepting the bitcoins having either a misunderstanding of the tech or a policy that is a bit more strict than needed.
Over time, and with vendors competing, I am pretty sure this requirement will go away for the vast majority of bitcoin merchants.

No, you misunderstand consensus. Or, rather, you invert its meaning.
Consensus is defined by ISO (by far the most important institution when it comes to cooperation) as reached when there is no active objections to the proposal.
You turn it around and say everyone must actively agree, and this is a very dangerous change that can't work because anyone that is lazy or stubborn will stop progress.
So if you push a certain controversial patch in bitcoin-core for gentoo and make it possible to disable this in the users build, when the amount of people that go in and actively disable this feature hits zero, you reached consensus.

After syncing the client takes about the same amount of CPU as ktorrent (yeah! love that app..). Which is, near zero.
So if you leave it running for days at a time, the only real problem is that the client takes between 1 and 2Gb of ram. But most of this ends up in swap for me after a day or two.

Don't use IE, Office and Outlook and you'll be a lot safer already.
As someone that works on Windows every day and uses Linux at home, I can tell you its really not easy to keep your Windows env sane and protected. For instance add-on software is so often compromised, or you are fooled by a copycat official-looking website that installs a trojan as well as the software you want.
Even sourceforge has many infected apps available for download.
So, unless you just use it for work-work and don't do much fun stuff with your machine...  to be completely blunt; its only a matter of *when* your machine gets compromised.

I think your model makes sense, and it makes it easy since it uses the concepts of the current model to quickly start using the bitcoin model.
There are some features in bitcoin that are not used, though. Bitcoin has various features that are not immediately obvious, but it may change the model you have quite a lot.
The most significant one is that a wallet can be duplicated for backup purposes. Two people can walk around with the same wallet, and use it. Or you can have 10 backups at friends places. Using passwords to make sure they are not abused.
Then there are multi-sig wallets that can be used for long term storage. The main idea behind it is that more than one person has to "Ok" the release of all the coins.  For instance both your parents.
There are some even more exciting ideas being planned for with smart contracts, but I'll ignore those for now.
So, specifically for your life-savings and the long-term stuff, I'd say we'll see a bit more creative solutions.

A non-forwarded client still connects to 8 nodes. And so its definitely part of the network and is able to do the job it is there for (validating and propagating transactions).
Granted, it will not work if the vast majority is not listening, and 8 connections is not that fantastic (I have 50). But its not hurting.

Some time ago one of the core developers theorized on this topic and tried to find a way to hack the system.  The amount of work and the amount of luck you have to have is pretty depressing for any would-be criminal.
While there is never a 100% guarantee, the conclusion has to be that its not profitable.
Stepping out of all the theoretical talk and going back to real-life; I expect a lot of merchants to use a service that helps them with their wallet management etc. This kind of service already exists and they insure merchants against this kind of thing.  So in the end there is no risk to either bitcoin adoption or to individual merchants.

Not really; compromised hardware is hardware that does stuff on its own.
This article talks about adding hardware to the system. That added hardware will not do anything on its own. It needs software.
So it talks about a compromised system; which means hardware *and* software.
Hence the suggestion to boot from a live-cd that ignores any harddrive and thus is free from the compromised software. And as such is immune from any added hardware.

Two big mistakes in your post
1. The 8 connections are outgoing. If you don't get more you need to fix your port forwarding. 
2. There is no relation between node count and confirmation time. Next to that, the fact you bring it up shows a misunderstanding of what it means. The only thing that happened on confirmation is that a "made" payment turns into a 100 percent guaranteed to be irreversible payment.
In comparison, visa takes days or weeks to do the same.

The point is that the pool operator and the pool members (miners) are different people.  With different goals.  Miners have a really strong incentive to avoid a double spend-attack.
So even if the operator would want to start an attack, and please remember that a succesful attack would take at least an hour, all miners have a very strong incentive to move away from that pool as soon as possible to avoid their business model going down the drain.

The effect of a (community organized) asic farm will be that more blocks are found and that the rate will go up. Meaning you need more hardware to get the same percentage of the network.

first of all realize what it means;
having 51% of the hash-power means that statistics are on your side. The mining concept is nothing but a game-of-change. Like flipping a coin to get heads-up.  But instead of a 2-sided coin you have a coin that has 2^256 sides. (Its a bit better since there are multiple correct answers). So in order to get the right value before the end of the universe, we flip more coins simultaneously, which translates in the real world to more mining equipment.
What it means that a mining pool gets 51% is that it has more coins to flip than anyone else, and so its coin-flipping will get it to land on the right "heads" side faster, on average.
Having more than 50% of the mining-power means one thing only; if we wait long enough, and try often enough, you will eventually get more 'wins' in a row than the competition.
Here is the problem, though. Its still random, and you only have a very small advantage. So to get a guaranteed win so many times in a row, you need to try weeks or months. Probably even longer.
The 51% **attack** only works when you have a win a lot of times in a row. If you don't get lucky for a while, you loose and the thing you tried to accomplish is removed by another miner in the next block.
So, with all things being equal, a pool getting 51% of the hashing power is only dangerous if we don't monitor them for trying an attack, since them trying an attack that requires a 6-block chain is almost guaranteed to not succeed the first time. Statistics is just not with them.
If an attack is tried, and we are monitoring them, I'm pretty sure the Bitcoin community will take drastic action.  The core devs can block the whole network, if needed. But I doubt it will be needed as many miners will realize that its better to work with Bitcoin than against it. And leave the pool.

Huh, Bitcoin 2.0? These people are talking about Bitcoin (the platform) like its a released thing. Its not, its not even got a 1.0 release yet, nor a timeline on when that will be.
This is really putting the cart in front of the horse. I would think that the author has no clue about open communities and how long it takes to make something revolutionary.
Can't entirely blame them, it seems to be a common misconception nowadays. I saw it when a year after the first release of BB10 people were declaring the platform a failure. Forgetting it took Apple may years to make their platform a success (and they were first-movers!) Forgetting that it took Android years as well. Microsoft is still at it, and they have had a mobile platform for many years as well. Only recently did they start to show significant growth.  It takes a lot of time to build a platform!
On top of that is the open community which Bitcoin is. Everything is done in public. Compare that with a company like Facebook that works for years on something before a single reporter hears about it.

Bitcoin has a logo and a 'sign' (฿) already, and has had that for years. The Logo and sign are very similar, although the logo has 2 lines and is 30° rotated.
To suggest both signs are a good way to identify Bitcoin is going to get the exact same objection as the suggestion to change to Ƀ altogether. The objection is simple; changing the only unique visual part of your brand is guaranteed to hurt the brand. 
Keeping suggesting this is throwing out the window decades of knowledge of how marks and brand-recognition works.

You are using money in some cases where you meant to write currency, and I think you may end up confusing people, including yourself :)
The concept of FRB leads to an increase of currency, but not of money.  In the context of this thread you would see 199 bitcoin in circulation as currency in the economy while there exist only 100 bicoin which is the money (assuming the EU 1%FRB standard). Naturally, this process is recursive and it can end up being much much more than just two times the amount.
The only reason that FRB doesn't lead to a lot of inflation is because a small amount of banks own most of the funny-money. There simply is no way for everyone to take out all their money in store it in their mattresses.  In Bitcoin that assumption will fail the business plan of the banks.
I do agree with you that FRB is inevitable for bitcoin to succeed.  But just for a couple of years. It will likely just end up taking the banks down hard when bitcoin grows up to such an extend that we no longer need banks and people will massively try to take out their bitcoins to store them elsewhere.

This is based on an faulty assumption, that one person can be so wealthy that he or she can steer the network.  This is demonstrably false.
Democratic distribution is based on many common people doing the work, but only those that have the ability (so the poor don't get more poor by being forced to do work). In that regard Bitcoin is really pretty democratic.
Maybe you are also under the false impression that doing bitcoin mining is making people millionaires. I have my doubts that this is the case; most turn a nice profit as any company would, but most of the money goes to pay back the cost of hardware and cost of electricity.

Bitcoin is a protocol, not a piece of software. Its defined by the way that communication happens.  As such those "settings" are part of the architecture.
Tweaking those settings can not be done without *everyone* that runs the client agreeing.  If only one party changes it, he will fork the blockchain and live alone on his chain, ignored by the rest that still follow the current protocol.
So, yeah, these tweakings really are bigger than one might realize.
And, similarly, adding features in the software that only require some extra data in the protocol are much smaller changes that one might realize :)

First of all, only they can answer it fully.
There is not that big a risk, really. The fluctuations have been pretty much ok.
My guess is that they put for sale a percentage of the coins and have a professional trader take care of actually selling them. This way they can make a profit in a fluctuating market.

This is an often misunderstood concept, and it doesn't help that the main users of bitcoin currently are exchanges.
The basics of bitcoin is that as soon as you make a payment it gets sent to the network. Mere seconds after you make it, the person receiving it will see that payment and he can verify it as real (or depend on a company to do so).
The 30 minutes waiting time is something that the exchanges have build in as a way to protect themselves. The main reason is that because those exchanges are run without human operators. Next to that, they are money operating companies so a big target.
Normal merchants (selling groceries, books, coffee, etc) don't have either of these issues and they can take the transaction as soon as it has been made. Optionally asking a big company with servers all of the world to verify it for them.
The only thing that happens after those 30 minutes is that a transaction that was "made" turns into a 100% guaranteed irreversible payment. In comparison it takes Visa days or weeks to do the same.

It would be possible, and the original white paper actually suggests this. The problem is that if you do, you can no longer run a full node since that requires you can share all full blocks.
So the Bitcoin core app doesn't have need for this feature and has instead been spending development time to make storage of the full chain as small as possible.

How can that work? If someone gave me dodgecoin on this sub, I'd ignore him. If you gave anyone bitcoin on do you think they'd start using it? I'd think you would get downvoted quite a lot to be honest ;)
I have no reason at all to believe that lots of tipping will introduce people to bitcoin.  At best it will kickstart people that were already hooked.  Not sure what the value is there.


This I actually have an issue with; since the position is that its good for bitcoin you must assume that the quality of submissions will go up if people get rewarded for them.  There is plenty of research to show the opposite where people start to write just to please crowds and where people only support the established opinion.  Its the ultimate karma-whoring. Not an unheard phenomenon on reddit, I can imagine that getting worse when coins are added.
The whole "it helped dodgecoin" is not funny, or even useful. On the dodge subs rewarding is like kids that get a sticker for their effort in class.  Its not real, you can't really do anything with it. If those stickers were replaced with dollar bills, things would change real fast. And not for the better.

Decentralization is a side-effect of the main innovation which is zero-trust consensus building.
The point here is that if you want perfect decentralization, you may have to accept that we never will be able to get a throughput that is good-enough for Bitcoin to actually be a money transferring service.
If, on the other hand, you can accept a good-enough solution that isn't perfectly pure but is going to still be maginutes better than anything the market has to offer right now, *then* we can grow and grow. Growth is currently more important than a perfect solution since that perfect solution can still be worked on and still be invented 5 years from now.
However, if we can't get more than x-transactions per second, we won't have a Bitcoin in 5 years.

I would fully agree with you, as a geek its really hard getting the things I'm enthusiastic across to others.
The solution, I've found, is explaining it better. Which is accomplished with one rule in mind; people don't want to be made to feel stupid.
Imagine geek-guy explaining things with lots of words like blockchain-keys-halving etc. The chances are pretty darn good that the person listing will get lost. And in most people that raises the feeling of being too stupid to understand. With predictable reactions like "Boring!".
The best way to teach bitcoin is with conviction to build trust (you know what you are talking about), low complexity and small increases in complexity over time (not one evening). And most important; goal driven.  So make it a conversation; work on their goals first. The how will have to wait.

The fun part of this discussion is that nobody can just point to a rulebook on how this works. The reason, naturally, is that banks love rules and they get quite complicated. And each bank has their own set of rules.
For instance, transferring between accounts of the same bank is typically done within second. Transferring to another bank in the same country typically takes one work-day.
The point is not the specifics, or even that others have a different experience, the point is that banks have lots of rules and most people have no idea what they are.
Its time for some proper competition, that tends to help make things simpler for the end-users.

The movies (and tv series) paint a really incorrect picture that has nothing to do with reality.
I see so often in popular series that the geek just takes a couple of hours and cracks her way into any system.
In reality the only systems that can be broken into like this are systems that have badly written software on them that has a very specific type of bugs.
If that happens to be true, then this specific software has to actually have functionality and rights on the computer that allow it to do more than its intended function. This is why on unix systems they create a new account for each piece of software. Apache, mysql etc, each have their own account and can't write in each others files.
If that happens to be true as well, then you need to be able to trigger the bug, on that machine with just data that is meant to be, well, just data. This implies that only a tiny, incredibly small part of the application you are attacking actually handles this data. So the bugs have to exist in that tiny tenth of a percent of the code of that application.
So, in short, the amount of stars that need to align in order to allow some Bitcoin software to be exploitable, like you suggest, is so staggeringly improbable, I dare to just say "no, they can't".

You are ignoring everything I wrote and what you seem to believe is plain wrong.
Your scenario is only correct if you think of hashing like having an engine, and more horse-powers means you go faster.  This is not a good analogy at all because having more power in Bitcoin-hashing will only mean you have more luck in finding a block.
Having more hashing power, however, will certainly not give you any guarantees on getting more blocks faster than anyone else.
I tried to explain this using the coin-flipping. Its a game of luck and people are notoriously bad at intuitively thinking about luck. (which is why casinos and lotteries makes so much money).

Some basics;
a 51% attack is by no means a guarantee of repeated blocks coming from that pool.  It also doesn't mean every block coming from that pool will be able to be compromised. Individual miners will continue to run checks on the transactions that actually end up in the block.
If for some reason a mining pool published a block that does something funny (like including a double-spend), this will most likely immediately lead to a hard-fork. Any blocks mined on top of that block will from then on not have any recognized profits on the chain for the rest of the network. The predictable effect is that most miners using the bad pool will immediately switch to another.
This means that the block with the bad transaction will be orphaned and soon forgotten.
Bottom line is that a mining-pool with 51% hash-power is still compromised of loads of individuals with free-will. Those miners don't get to profit from any attacks, and they will naturally leave the pool as soon as it does something funny.

Thats one of the reasons we should use NFC in the near future. Lets hope that is in the works.
NFC is different in some core concepts; first of all you don't need to start the app before you can swipe. The app is auto-started based on the type of thing you swipe.
So if you swipe a point-of-sale, your phone starts your app for you and all you have to do (and even that is optional) is press "yes".
Second major change is that (at least with my blackberry) you can swipe an NFC tag before you unlock your phone.  So you swipe, the phone screen wakes up and asks for your pin-code.  Your app is waiting as soon as you finish typing your pin, you press "yes" and the payment is send over 4G to the network.
And not more than 2 seconds later the merchant will see the payment on his device (which is connected to wifi).

A wallet that integrates with the users-system better.
The bitcoin-qt people are seriously thinking of removing the wallet from their codebase and focusing on the networking backend alone.  I totally support that as its quite useful for them to focus on their specialty and UI people on user-facing software.
What I'd love to see (and if you use a nice language, I'd help out too) is a wallet that is task-based, very well UI-tested and has features like integration with your systems addressbook (or google-calendar/caldav) to store bitcoin addresses.
It should focus on NFC based communication instead of QR (but naturally support QR) and aim to only be about the day-to-day wallet of people.  This limits the scope and should make it easier to focus on just being an awesome UI experience.
My suggested technology is Qt+QML2, because its so easy to create different user-interfaces that look amazing and are specific for the device you are targeting.  Creating several user-interfaces is trivial and makes it easy to target different form-factors.  But the wallet idea still stands if you don't like my personal favorite technology choice ;)

In todays world people have to get a subscription for practically everything. You need a subscription for internet, you need one for using any of the number of chatting applications and one for banking.
Most of these subscriptions take from you in the form of private data. The subscription for banking typically takes different things.  Most people don't realize the amount of money you loose on a daily basis by just using all of those subscriptions. Banking is also doing a really good job of hiding their costs, but that doesn't mean they aren't there!
The simplest and most straightforward reason for people to use Bitcoin is that they do not need any subscription or agreement to use it. There is no middle man that can decide to cancel your subscription or that can decide you are using it wrong. Or even impose higher fees at any time in the future.
I think the question you ask is natural, people nowadays are so used to having to agree to a contract to do anything fun, they don't notice when that contract is suddenly not there.
The moment people will realize Bitcoin is better is when suddenly at the end of the month they have more money left because all those hidden costs that the banking industry managed to put into the system just fall away.
In the end its really hard to convince a single person that its better for that one person to switch. Network effect making it only useful if plenty of others are using it. But I also know that that same network effect can make the change seem overnight when it switches to a point where its just plain stupid to stay on the current system.

This does not fit with the concept of "Proof of work" that Bitcoin uses.  A person can claim one block only when the rest of the network accepts it. Mining 30 blocks in sequence is practically impossible to do without the rest of the network knowing about it.
The reason for that is because as soon as a block is mined it will be broadcast in order to get consensus about that block being the new 'tip'.  If you keep it for yourself, you won't get anyone to accept this block.
The situation you are talking about is a hard-fork of the whole blockchain with malicious spends in there. The chance of that being used by many people around the world is next to zero, so the money claimed to be owned by people is also worthless.
And we are back to all the individual miners running away.
I doubt this will happen since there is no incentive to do so, and I severely doubt it will take 30 blocks before everyone runs away from the pool.
ps. individual miners will also reject blocks being offered to the network that have double-spends in it.

I find it mystifying that someone comes up with such an elaborately wrong solution to a simple, long-solved, problem.
Most obvious solution (since its been done hundreds of times before) is to actually, properly, package your software and use FTP sites with mirroring capabilities to do backups.
Notice, for instance, that there is a ftp.[country].debian.org  set of servers. Where country is things like 'nl', 'se', etc. *that* is how you do redundancy. The reason why is simple; you stand on the shoulders of giants.  Using existing, decentralized, infrastructure (ftp sites) instead of inventing your own new one that won't really work because you won't have enough people hosting it.

Doing an interview is essentially sharing a lot of information, and it can be used any way the reporter likes.
While I support your decision to opt-out of the interview, I believe its a short-term solution only. The better solution is to become better at choosing words when you know you are "on the record".
The trouble with the Voorhees issue is that he didn't lie; the guy really did say those words he printed.  So while it wasn't fair, it wasn't breaking any rules.
The bitcoin community needs people that are aware of this distinction, and can thrive in that environment.
For instance, the question if money was lost due to Gox can be answered in many different ways; the most stupid one is to say yes.  Slightly more smart is to just say you don't know, it would be premature to speculate.
Smarter answers are that you invite the reporter to talk to someone from MtGox instead of making you speculate. Or simply to repeat info about the US investigation.
Bottom line; its perfectly Ok to say to a reporter that you don't know or don't want to tell him something he asks you about.

Mostly because it's not an issue. The mining pool can't hide an attempt from its participants. So the pool operators can't really pull off the attack in practice because they would loose all their hashing power.

I've worked in post for a while and a documentary-style you can calculate that every 5 minutes of video takes 1 day of work. The Tribeca showing was in April, its June now. Polish and cutting takes half the time you spent on it.
The point is that you are either putting too much time into making it perfect, which causes the product to loose value faster than you can add to it by polishing more.
Or you are not talking about all the things that take your time away. For instance the distributor..
Whats the deal with a distributor? Why do you need one? Its 2014 and half the world is looking at TV that is streamed anyway. The vast majority of your target audience is perfectly content to watch content streaming over the internet and you are looking for a distributor?
If your content is as good as your blog and posts make it sound, you should be fine with using a pay-what-you-want model. Even if 90% of the people do not pay anything, the only loss from those people is the bandwidth cost. Which is near zero anyway.  So you get payed by people that enjoyed the content. Which is kind of how it works either way.
Bottom line is that if you wait longer, the return on investment will go down. Unless you are planning on selling to the history channel.

While I haven't seen that video, the idea has been floating around for quite some time. I can understand it scares people. I'm not entirely unaffected either.
The main difference is that with Bitcoin there is no way for any government or corporation to "print" more bitcoins. The rules for inflation and growth of the bitcoin stash have been set in stone when it was first released and can't be changed now without every single person using bitcoin agreeing.   Naturally, this can go both ways. There is no guarantee this is better than a government doing things.

* The most secure wallet is the one where nobody but yourself has access to the private keys.  Electrum and many webbased wallets store the private keys on their server.  You should avoid this if at all possible.

In the basic bitcoin protocol there is a solution to this, and its only just starting to become more available in user-interfaces.  The concept is called n-of-m payments.
In short; you can "transfer" your money to the company that sells the goods. The money won't actually be transferred until a 3rd party decides to transfer it (or refund it) at a later time.

The moment you make a transaction it is sent to the network for verification and eventually for inclusion into the blockchain. So the moment you make a transaction the other party can see it and act on it.
To be sure you haven't send a wrong transaction (a double spend) the safe solution is to wait for the transaction to be included in the blockchain, but there is no need for that if you trust the person standing in front of you having spend the coins only once. Its not very hard for a big computer to check that the transaction is not false (i.e. spending coins you didn't have, or not correctly signing it) and so they can act on it.
The only risk a company that acts instantly on transactions will have is if you double-spent your coins. Which is a complicated process that requires immense processing power. That means its costly to do. And nobody in their right mind will try to double-spend a 20 dollar transaction, its just not profitable.

The statement isn't completely correct, it is possible, just unlikely. The reasoning goes like this.
When you make a deposit in a bank you are essentially giving them the money and getting an IOU in return.
With bitcoin the same is possible, but I think thats not what we will end up with.  Yes, you can transfer your bitcoin to a bank and get an IOU in return, but what about you instead keep being the sole owner of your money (by keeping the private keys) and just make the bank hold on to the money for you.
This means that only you can spend it, since its only you that has the right to transfer the money.  And naturally it then follows that banks can't do funny things with your money.

This means you don't realize you were being silly by using an exchange like it was your private wallet.
It also means you didn't read up on the history of this one exchange and the many problems it has had over the years, before putting your money there. Or worse, you did and ignored it.
People that lost more than a little money on MtGox have my sympathy, and I feel for them. At the same time, its irresponsible to let those people that made the mistake of giving control over their money away to a not-very-reputable company just be reimbursed.  Actions have consequences.
If you want to convert fiat to bitcoin, transfer the fiat, buy the bitcoin and shortly after move the bitcoin to your own wallet on your own computer.
The fact that MtGox had more than about 0.2 bitcoins per active user means you didn't do this.
Those that had tens or even hundreds of coins on that server are part of the problem. Notice that as an owner of bitcoin I also lost money, due to the price drop. If the amount of bitcoin *owned* by mtGox was just about people trading, this wouldn't have happened and the dying of the exchange would not have hit headlines for weeks.

Bitcoin is another horse in the race for a good monetary system. Everyone in this world is in that race, everyone that uses some sort of currency is going to have a financial impact of bitcoin.  So if you choose to continue to base your savings on USD or EUR you also made a choice.
Our current monetary system has been in operation for 43 years, which is pretty long as fiat currencies go. The way it operates is worrying various people, including me, there are experts that say the USD will hyper-deflate in this decade.  I'm not sure about that personally, but I'm willing to hedge my bets.
So for me its not so much about bitcoin as a way to make money, its equally about a way to provide an alternative and realize that the current monetary system may fail one day, because history shows fiat currencies fail at a predictable 100% failure rate.

The original whitepaper actually has an idea for that; it states that the only thing you need is the signature of a block, not the entire block, in order to verify that new blocks coming in are valid. The whitepaper suggests old blocks are discarded and just their signature stored in a database.

His technical point is still true. He argues that the pool operators and the participants are not the same people.
So if the operators do an attack, both the participants and core devs will respond. Far before an attack actually becomes a problem.
So if an attack starts, everyone is going to notice. Certainly the miners on the pool doing the attack. The response will be that many of them will stop mining on that pool. Stopping the attack before it became an issue. 
A pool with a high percentage of hash rate is monitored closely by a lot of smart people.

A destructive interaction with a system that is meant to store all changes, I'm not sure how thats even possible. Unless you are misusing your tools, this just doesn't happen.  Maybe you are talking about force-pushes, which are disabled for most repos.


This also doesn't appear in the kickstarted description, and it looks weird. This sounds like configuration-data of github or gitorious etc. 
I don't know which problem this is trying to solve.
Bottom line is that you are talking about making non-mergable a set of data that git currently merges just fine.  Its missing the point of git and/or the blockchain.

There are several assumptions in this sentence that I want to question. This is a bit naive way of calculations, its equivalent to saying that a company that pays its employees debases its products.
The proper way of thinking about it is that it enriches the product because it makes it possible to use it in the first place. Nobody will blame a company for spending money to make a product work.
Its also important to not jump to the conclusion that the cost of operation is seeping out of the bitcoin ecosystem. Only if all those coins get sold for fiat can you claim that the fiat-cost is something that debases the bitcoin ecosystem.  If, on the other hand, those bitcoins stay inside the ecosystem then this is just another way for people to purchase bitcoins. Either through fiat, or though doing mining.


Where do you think those coins came from in the first place?  New people buying coins need to find sellers. You can't grow the amount of people owning coins without new coins entering the system at all.


Thats like taking apples and dividing them by oranges.  Those things have nothing to do with each other...
This whole attack on Bitcoin is also very interesing because it fails to make a comparison to competing system.  Its easy to say something is bad, but maybe its the best system there is. Does it still make sense then?
The amount of US-dollars grows by $85Billion per month, freshly printed bills created out of thin air. The debasement of the dollar is magitudes worse than bitcoin.
Doing a transaction from the US to Europe by wire-transfer incurs a 5% cost on each and every transaction. Its free for Bitcoin.
Its Saturday evening, I can't be bothered to do a detailed calculation, but thumbing the prices make bitcoin operations and end-user-efficiency look significantly cheaper than the current alternatives.


If thats true, then the price per coin will go down and the network size will grow until equilibrium is reached.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:21:10


The comparison is better made with credit cards; the payment for bitcoin is immediate. Basically limited by internet bandwith. With credit-cards you need to swipe and the system comes back soon too.
The confirmation is a separate step, with bitcoin this takes about 10 minutes on average and with credit cards this takes weeks.
There are some technical risks you accept by allowing a person to leave before confirmation in both cases. In bitcoin this risk is much smaller because it is so much harder to cheat.  First of all, you need a custom written application that speaks the bitcoin protocol. You typlically need a server farm as well to do all the hard work needed to cheat the system. And even then there is no guarentee you'll be able to pull off the switch.
So, I would agree that its not perfect, but its pretty darn good.
Next to that, the merchent can sign up with a business that insures against this kind of thing. Compare that to Visa or Mastercard that essentially tells the merchent they don't get their money because they must have checked the signature wrong.

Bitcoin removes power-over-others from the system, as such its a huge step in the direction to avoid anyone taking advantage of it.
The main reason the poorer are getting poorer in todays world is because the rich get to set the rules on where money goes to. Bitcoin is decentralized and the rich don't have the ability to, say, print more money that mostly goes into their own pockets.

Clever answer; also quite wrong and not answering the question.
Its wrong since everyone in one pool hopes everyone in the same pool gets a block. That's the whole point of pools. Winnings are shared.
You also didn't back up your claim that miners somehow do not gain from a strong Bitcoin.  As long as you can't back that up with rational arguments, you fail to convince me that the protocol is guaranteed to fail.

If loopd incorporates an on-the-phone wallet with the ability to transfer money to others using the normal bitcoin way of transferring, that sounds like an awesome thing. You can transfer to a person identified by a photo instead of to a long string of numbers.
It would help people send things (like money) while avoiding QR codes etc.
It would help the company by adding a payment feature with very little risk to itself (it would not hold any money).
The only downside I see is that if bitcoin addresses are automatically transferred in a profile this introduces a higher incentive for fraud in the loopd profiles. But I doubt it will be a big issue.

I'm not sure if I follow your slightly terse answer;  if I'm guessing then I'd say you think that when there is no bitcoin reward left for miners, there is no incentive to mine in proof-of-work environments. Let me know if that's not what you think.
First of all, we are talking 100 years in the future before all bitcoin rewards go away for miners. Lets make sure we realize what that means.  Either bitcoin is dead and all this doesn't matter, or bitcoin is a very successful technology used for many many transactions.
With a huge amount of transactions, even tiny fees are adding up. A miner creating a new block with a 10 minutes amount of transactions can easily get enough fees to pay his electricity bills. Its going to be orders of magnitude more transactions, mind you.
So, there *is* incentive for mining. And the tragedy of the commons doesn't apply.

I'm afraid this is a bit naive way of looking at things. The idea behind any sort of regulations and rules is the aim for balance. Balance between the rights of everyone in the market.
In a completely unregulated (bitcoin) market the merchants are left with significant risks. For instance, without any rules, there is no decision by government to state Bitcoin is Ok to use. As such any investment in hardware and training may become useless if the government were to ban bitcoin from being used in stores.
On the other side of the spectrum there are exchanges, they all operate by taking peoples money and holding it for them. If there are no rules about how much bitcoin or fiat the company has to keep on the books (i.e. not spend), we could have a repeat of Gox again and again.
You don't need much regulation to establish a simple balance in the marketplace. Having some rules just makes clear that if things go wrong you actually are able to go to the police. Currently, you can't.

You bring up an interesting since its so confusing to many. People don't seem to realize that a payment goes through faster than Visa using Bitcoin in practically all cases.
It doesn't take one or even 3 confirmations to accept a payment. After these confirmation the thing that changes is that a payment goes from "made" to "100% guaranteed to be irreversible". In the Visa world the same takes days or weeks.
The logic here is that a 100% guaranteed irreversible transaction is only possible after a significant proof of work has been done that eliminates cheating.

This project makes no sense at all. An (incomplete) solution in search of a problem.
The point of bitcoin is based on the fact that two diverging histories of transactions per definition mean one of them is wrong.
The point of git is that two diverging histories of code-changes can be merged together to get the best of both branches.
Somehow implying that they should be merged means you don't get it.
The only problem the project suggests is that if GitHub goes down, you loose your "upstream". This is a mis-characterization. You can talk to your team-mates and avoid github and exchange changes that way. If you really want, you can always just create a mirror-site that just takes all the stuff that is on github and makes it available again on a different continent. If you are a company, just mirror the git repos every 5 minutes inside your own firewall.
All of those features are available in Git by default. No need to give a guy money.

There are some parts to this question;
* the "taking it off of the blockchain" refers to payments in bitcoin from one person to another person. The payments made inside of MtGox are not public and you loose the ability to stand up and claim you actually have money.  Or, in other words, everyone that had a certain bitcoin amount in MtGox has only the word of MtGox that its backed by real money. Not good.
* The point of transferring money to any exchange is not so much about the fact that you need to transfer your money and control to that exchange. The point was about security. Listen to the part where he says you get the worst of both worlds to see why I say this. 
Bottom line is that if you transfer your funds to any company, you need to have some way to trust they guard them well.
MtGox didn't have a reputation, it didn't have trust of qualified engineers and it didn't have laws keeping it honest.

Piracy of content is always going to happen, and people focusing on that are always going to get sad because they look at potential earnings; even though all research shows that there is no such thing.
The correct way of looking at this is the street-performer model.  You put up your content with an option to pay. The amount of people not paying are completely irrelevant because the price of distribution is so low.  So the only factor you look at is the amount of people that do pay. Which is directly proportional to the quality of your content.
**Tl;Dr** Because its so cheap to 'ship' your content and the internet allows an audience of the whole world, the amount of people paying voluntarily will pay back for your investment if your content is good enough.

As Cory Doctorow said it so nicely; when you have a pacemaker, you have a piece of closed-software in your body and you put your body in a car that is also closed-software.
His point was about security and about being able to set your own rules instead of trusting big-software-company to make sure its secure.

If you look at countries like China where there is a big inflation every year, to countries at war where the value of their local currency is going down quite a lot in a very short time, you will realize that the belief of currency being backed by gold is not true.
Most currencies are backed by the promise of the government to manage it well. A promise that is unfortunately not really one that countries can make true. Sure, they can bail it out when stuff goes wrong by moving money around or lending from other countries.  But the promise was that it was well managed.  The result is not a well managed currency but a protected currency.
See andreas latest post [Failure is an option]( for why this is a ticking timebomb.
The point I'm trying to make is that fiat currency has value based on the promise of being well managed. Like a country not printing more money when it gets in trouble.
Bitcoin is following those same promises, but instead of having to trust your government you get the guarentee that the bitcoin protocol prohibits these bad behaviors. There is no way to print more bitcoins.
In essence the difference is just that a government will bail out a bank if it goes down (for example), which may sound great, but it hurts everyone in the long run.

You can't compare popular content with a research paper. Totally different audience and different repeat-listening numbers.
The 'donationware' concept (google-ble as pay-what-you-want) has been shown to totally work.  But only for popular content.
Its about big numbers; even spotify had 93% non-paying customers. Which is actually pretty good score.  If you had 2% of the 'downloads' pay for it, then you got a pretty good return on investment.

I suspect that as we get closer to "actual commerce" we see more people have more of their money in the form of bitcoins. This would mean that it becomes money to hold value (i.e. your savings) and I expect that many will get a new set of coins every month or so, based on their paycheck.
So the amount of money represented by bitcoin is the money people have in their bank account after paying rent etc. until they spent the most of it at the end of the month. Maybe go for 40% to be safe.
Multiply this value with the amount of people using bitcoin worldwide and you have a good idea.

The November growth was exceptional and based in large part on the Chinese entering bitcoin.  This has mostly been reversed and only a tiny amount of chinese trading is going on with bitcoin.
So I'd say that the price is mostly stable right now until we get to a point where we'll get a steady inflow of people starting to use bitcoin. This in turn is based on merchant acceptance which in turn is based on good tools and software. 
I think you are thinking a bit too optimistically about how fast bitcoin acceptance will come, this will take months and years.

If people say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, recognize that it's repeating a known hard question. Recognize that it's meant to get out of the conversation.

Talking about changing currency is emotionally sensitive. It's a core way of thinking. Make sure that you realize this and communicate that.

Smaller is faster, for sure. Its not really all too relevant a difference, though.

So you don't want people here to blame the person who was so careless with his security he got broken into, but you do think its Ok to start a post which whole point is that your friend blames Bitcoin.
I think you will do your friend much more benefit by offering to educate him not just on Bitcoin, but also on general security practices. We live in a world where just doing what you've always done, and what many around you do, is just careless and leaves you open to abuse.

The bitcoin community has to take a bit of blame too; the fact is that the problem would not have been so bad if people used it exclusively as an exchange.  They used it as a wallet too.
So as the bitcoin community, or maybe something like a foundation, I think we can do better in making clear what the goals of bitcoin are. First of all, people should start laughing if there is a new site that calls itself a "bitcoin bank". Which will hold your bitcoins for interest...
My point is that we are so focussed on the technical implementation as something we educate that we forget to tell people how it is better to *not* use centralized websites and companies. That actually will give a better user-experience. And its safer too.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:15:09
Your premise is false; a website losing millions of passwords just doesn't happen if they implement it properly. The worst that can happen is that they lose the useless salted+hashed version.  The only thing a cracker can do at that time is bruteforce it, one user at a time.  Not really useful.
Your solution completely skips over what the website has to store; I can tell you, its a username with a un-encrypted public key.  Which is essentially equally bad as the original solution. No gain has been made in what could get leaked.
After the premise shows a zero increase in security; there is a huge decrease in usability. Now you need to somehow sync that key between all your wallets on all your computers. Since you can no longer remember it.

I would agree its not about attacking Fiat, that kind of misses the point.
What I believe is important, though, is to give some insight into the world monetary system.  Most people don't even know where inflation comes from or how government-depth is created or payed-off.
I think if more people knew this, they'd be scared and would trust those governments a little less.
But bottom line for me is that Bitcoin takes away control from people that have been abusing it by printing more money.

FUD stands for "Fear Uncertainty &amp; Doubt".
The application here is apt since the paper spreads exactly those 3 things about Bitcoin.  The fact of it being true is not the important factor.
The good FUD is true, that helps immensely.
The question to ask is if this new information is relevant to any of the important elements.  Since Bitcoin was never claiming to be anonymous, and this is also not exactly new information, I'd say its not that relevant to any successfactor of Bitcoin in the near future.
Edit; Should note that I'm not at all supporting the silly idea that this is FUD spread by darkcoin people!!1

There was one project that was 7btc worth to solve; but without a clear way to define milestones and clear indication who gets to decide on the payment being made, its too risky to start working on it.

For instance, practically all my bills (electricity, rent, borrowed money from friends) are payed that way, using a bank-to-bank transfer. With a dozen banks in this country alone, practically all those transfers are bank-to-bank.
If you experience that differently, you are indeed on the far end of the bell-curve.
Notice also that you ignored my main argument; the rules are opaque and each bank has different ones. People that do use these services will benefit from simpler rules. The first rule that I'd question is why a computer-to-computer transfer can't be made after 17:00...

I'm the first to say that Bitcoin isn't ready yet. Big rollouts of BTM (Bitcoin cash-machines) is one of the things that are just getting underway. Outside of the USA they are actually nice to use and don't require silly things like a palm-scan.
There are exchanges that do a pretty good job as well, but its certainly not a solution for mom and pop.

@_date: 2014-03-21 22:07:14


such as, what advantages?
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:53:01
The price is an effect of how many people buy it vs how many people sell. Which is directly related to how popular the coin is.
In my mind the adoption of bitcoin will continue by vendors that will ultimately sell as soon as they get the money. This will make the price go down slightly in the short term since there are not many non-technical people involved that buy bitcoins just to spend them.
When more and more vendors support bitcoin, and companies come and make it easier to use there will be a continues growth of people that own bitcoin and use it. Where "own" is just having a small amount, just like people "own" only small amount of money in the form of paper bills. You may check with [Adoption Lifecycle]( on wikipedia for the steps this normally takes.
We are currently in the "early adopters" phase, recent calculations showed that only about 200000 people in the world owned one bitcoin or more.
When we go to the "Early Majority" phase we need better technology (its too hard right now), we need better acceptance by counties governments and we need about 6% percentage of vendors accepting it.
But when we enter this phase, the amount of people signing up and buying bitcoin every day will be more than we have right now.
And as an effect, the demand will go up with a linear supply. Result; huge price increase.
I'm not willing to put numbers to this, but 1K and 5K sound possible for sure.

How can price increase if the value goes down?

Thats not the best of comparisons.
Paypal has a financial incentive that is not transparent to us. It also has to listen to a government that can revoke its license or just freeze it for a while if they don't.
They also own your money, and you just have a not-very-strong promise they will give them to you on your request.
In bitcoin country, however, nobody will ever have power to steal my coins. Nobody ever will be able to block my payments from going through. 
Now one player has a tiny little bit of power in a trustless system and you freak out.  All they can do with it is cut their own wrists. Yet the amount of hours spent on complaining about them is more than complaining about Paypal and banks.

In addition to those other excelent answers I want to point out one huge difference between a regular database and the blockchain.
In a regular database you can make changes. In the bitcoin blockchain any 'insert' done is sealed in a block with a lot of others and then becomes immutable.
As a result you lower the risk of corruption to almost none, basically media corruption is the only way to get faults. And those will be detected very quickly.

 I'm not a lawyer; Antitrust laws were put in place by federal and state governments to regulate corporations. They keep companies from becoming too large and fixing prices, and also encourage competition so that consumers can receive quality products at reasonable prices.

You write two questions since the title question has very little to do with the body of your post.
Title;  can you double spend?  Its theoretically possible, but very very unlikely.  Higher fees doesn't guarantee its used.
Body; can you pay and leave? Yes, you typically can. There is no reason to wait for a confirmation as your phone based wallet pushes its transactions on the network the shop will be able to see all those transactions in real-time.  As such it can make a decision if you payed.  It would be able to see your double-spent as well, btw, if your wallet pushes them to the network at the same time.

I noted that quote too, and I find it very interesting. First of all, it would be a great way to sell the idea of Bitcoin to a lot more people. Tell them this, and they will be laughing at an inside joke that those silly libertarians won't get ;)
The problem is that his premise is false; while the ledger is fully public, claiming that we can see what people own which wallets is not really possible. And I expect that identifying wallet-ownership will become less possible over time, not more so.
So, while his premise is false, I hope he is right, and I hope that that idea will sell, even if its not based on truth.  Never stopped people before from believing stuff :)

I love this line; it has a lot of depth.
for instance, the first ones to start using 'internet telephony' were the telcos. They digitized their phone-lines decades ago and started to run it over the same lines that the internet goes over. When I worked for a big telco in 1995 the president said he expected 98% of their sales to be data in the next 5 years. (he was too optimistic)
Legalization is fun too; skype (still?) has had a disclaimer saying you can't call it real telephony since you can't depend on it to call emergency services. Didn't really hurt uptake, did it?
What I'm trying to say is that as the internet grew up, the question if it was like a telephone started to become silly. Internet absorbed telephony and became a platform for so much more. The ones to benefit from it most were the telco's that should have been most afraid of it.

I found some logic errors in your post;


ASICs don't get very hot. Around 80°C. So unless you are talking about a huge operation there is no need for cooling. Additionally, data-centers are located in places like north sweden where its cold most of the year.


You made a grammar or logic error; the amount of electricity spend doesn't change based on the price of the bitcoin. This kills a lot of the argument that follows...
The price of bitcoins is determined by the open market, people pay what they think its worth. This includes the price of miners to keep the network running and keep the network safe.
If the price is too low, miners that live in areas with high electricity costs will stop mining since it would not pay the bills. If the price of bitcoin rises there is a bigger incentive for more people to mine.  Its an equilibrium.

To be clear; the Gox disaster was about an exchange between bitcoin and fiat.  Not something most of us do on a daily basis.
Compare it to the NYSE, another kind of exchange.  I doubt you use that one very often either.
Its important to make the distinction between MtGox and a general bank.  MtGox was not a bank (although some used it that way, and they got paintful results).  The downfall of gox is not at all the same as a bank with all their users money going down. People that owned bitcoin still own them after this.
See, bitcoin doesn't store money in banks, but instead on your personal computer (or phone or some piece of paper you keep secure).  The aim is that there is *no* single place that will fail and cause you to loose your money. And it works quite well at that.
Once you see that, then the downfall of MtGox can't be seen as important to the future of bitcoin. Its a lesson learned, for many, but it doesn't in any way make the coin less attractive.

I agree with lukestokes, my point of view really is that over many years people have started to realize problems with currencies like dollars.
The goal of Bitcoin was to use modern technology and fix all the problems with fiat currency (aka dollars) while keeping all the good parts.
And that, I think, is a very important part to stress. For normal people its important to know that money will stay money. They will still be able to buy their bread and get payed.
The technology that is bitcoin is not going to change the things that people depend on, it will change more for people that right now are bullies. The bankers that take home millions because they are playing with *your* money.
In short; bitcoin is money done right. It takes away many opportunities for bad-people to take advantage of the normal people.

I'm not sure what you expect. This is an experiment that has been done often and the output is predictable. See tragedy of the common.
The point of a digital currency is not to solve this. So using Bitcoin will not change the outcome.
A digital currency allows us  to work with the known character trait and solve the original problem. Using micro payments the system can force fairness and avoid misuse.

As money arriving in your wallet have no identifiable information other than the address it comes into, you want to give out different addresses to different people and likely even a new one for each expected payment.

The problem with that is that general public still blame bitcoin for the downfall of mtgox. I'm going to assume that those centralized institutions will take every opportunity to repeat that bitcoin is the problem and banks have stood and served for hundreds of years...
So I think we should assume that initially banks will join bitcoin and try to do all the things they've done with other forms of currency for years.

Coinmap is a mess because of their implementation of showing the dots in some javascript or something.  Its low quality. It freezes my browser on my phone.
On the other hand, the features that it provides are impossible to do nicely in google-maps because you can't just tag a building or POI on google-maps with something like 'bitcoin=yes'.
What we need is a better front-end for the data that is being collected in OSM. I have a great mobile-app in development that shows this data, but I'm clueless on the browser side so there needs to be someone stepping up to make the tech better there.
Bottom line is that using google maps would not really help since it doesn't have as much information as openstreetmap has.

The "at all costs" you can put into a sentence a bit more to make it clear.
If you have a choice where you make 99.9% of the users happy (make it faster etc), but its not perfect (yet).
Then the "at all costs" concept means you will not make all those users happy and just stay where you are and get stopped from innovating.

Excuse me? I think you have been reading a bit too much on this sub without checking the facts on the official wiki.
The only thing that 51% states is that if you try often enough (and I'm talking weeks, not hours here), you will eventually have more blocks than anyone else. Naturally, this only works if everyone else still accepts your blocks (the core devs will likely take action) and if your miners don't run away causing you to to below the 50%.
In practice your scenario of one party being the sole miner of bitcoin just won't happen.

Net neutrality is about high-bandwidth services. Like streaming video. The idea is not blocking, its about guaranteeing a certain speed of download continuously.  This is typically done by slowing down torrents and prioritizing netflix. (for example)
For services like bitcoin this is completely irrelevant. There is no need for a constant throughput. With one megabyte block every 10 minute, your web browsing can use more bandwidth.
What you are worried about is censorship. And this is still illegal in the US.

The logic goes; the way we have been "fixing" the economy for the past 20 years is to lower interest rates.  Its not going so well, but we're still here. So lets continue doing that.  Problem; we reached near zero.
So, the logic goes, we can solve the issue by making the simple act of owning money, cost you money. (=negative interest rates). Thereby making sure that people spend it as soon as they get it. Always always having to work, no couple of month off you can save for, no far away holidays you can save for allowed.  Saving is frowned upon now.
Naturally, if you loose money by having it in the bank, then the simple solution is to not have it in the bank.

I'll probably get downvoted for this; but dodgecoin is not something that helps build trust with consumers (i.e. Facebook users) in crypto-currencies.
Most Bitcoin users I know are hopeful that it will be used for real-world payments on a big scale eventually. I want to be able to buy a burger at the fast-food stand, specifically. Adding a silly dog face to a payment system doesn't help with that goal. Marketing wise, money stuff is supposed to be boring.
Dodgecoin is a fun thing, and its for speculators. It has zero chance of replacing bitcoin in the goal of being the next payment system. Anyone that pushes dodgecoin for serious busyness is in my opinion a pyramid-scheme pushing speculator.  So I won't open a changetip account if it supports dodge.

Bitcoin will not be deflationary for decades to come.
There is preciously little research on what would happen if inflation was taken away. We know with the current system it would bankrupt countries, so we know its needed.  But if the basis of our monetary system were, hypothetically, based on Bitcoin, all our assumptions and previous studies on the subject become useless.
Your response that people will just start hoarding and stop working sounds like a silly assumption on what would happen. People still need to eat, still want to do things that cost money. Its proven that people that own more will spent more on non-needed things.
But in the end, nobody knows what will happen. People and economics are quite unpredictable.  I'd like to give a Bitcoin economy a chance. It might just work.

The point you make of ATMs being too difficult is a good one. And it should be easy to make that easier!
What you have to remember is that bitcoin is not centralized. This means that what you call "Bitcoin ATM" is probably better labeled as "ATMs from company XYZ that gives Bitcoins".  Not as sexy, but the difference is that it makes clear those machines are from one company that just happens to do business using bitcoins.
The reason they can get away with asking such a rediculous amount of personal info is because there is no competition. Yet.

NFC is a really good solution for this issue, it is one of the prime usecases, really.
The biggest problem there is that a huge percentage of people have an iPhone which doesn't do NFC. This is a problem that is going to get better as the brand has fierce competition from Android, where most phones do have NFC.
Naturally, the store must have good cell-tower reception so people can assume fast internet.
Either way, early adopters will likely accept and use practically any method. This leads to innovation and ideas like QR codes will likely be used for a while and then replaced by more useful solutions.

The moment you make a transaction it is sent to the network for verification and eventually for inclusion into the blockchain.
So the moment you make a transaction the other party can see it and act on it.
To be sure you haven't send a wrong transaction (a double spend) the safe solution is to wait for the transaction to be included in the blockchain, but there is no need for that if you trust the person standing in front of you having spend the coins only once.
Its not very hard for a big computer to check that the transaction is not false (i.e. spending coins you didn't have, or not correctly signing it) and so they can act on it.
The only risk a company that acts instantly on transactions will have is if you double-spent your coins. Which is a complicated process that requires immense processing power. That means its costly to do.  And nobody in their right mind will try to double-spend a 20 dollar transaction, its just not profitable.

Sorry if I didn't explain myself correctly; you are right that the chain with the most work in it is honored. I didn't mean to imply otherwise.
The point is that a pool of individuals will be required to publish its blocks as soon as they are discovered, because if they don't, they won't be able to make the longest chain without destroying the network. And as such most miners will leave the pool as soon as possible since they won't get any rewards for blocks mined in secret that will later be orphaned.
So the example gave for mining 30 blocks and then publishing them is not going to work due to the way that the concept of "Proof of work" benefits those that stay honest and cooperative with the whole network.

I'm not sure if I follow your line of thinking; how does coin distribution have anything to do with the pricing?  I don't see any connection.
My logic is that if the vast majority of the daily payments made are for common "buying bread" kind of transactions, then the percentage of buys/sells that investors make is going to be tiny. They won't move the scale much.
So if a couple of countries start using Bitcoin for real, volatility will go down.

You are completely right.
Notice that in the Fiat world (USD and all the other currencies) this is not an option.
There existed no money at the beginning and the FED printed money after buying some bonds. Which means that every single dollar in existence is loaned with interest. To pay off this interest the FED prints more dollars.
We have been doing this since 1913. And the interest-on-interest year over year means most of the money in the economy goes to paying out debt.
Without printing more money, the world would go bankrupt in no time.
Please view the "hidden secrets of money" on youtube for a more detailed explanation.
On a positive note, Bitcoin doesn't have this problem.

I'd say thats already overcomplicating it.
In the current world you can buy 3 breads in an eastern-european country for the same price as one bread in a scandinavian one.
The introduction of Bitcoin, or any global currency, won't change this. There are numerous reasons why this price difference exist and I don't see any way to get rid of it.
The end result is then that people price a load of bread in bitcoin AND local currency. The more stable of the currencies will be the one that ends up being used because its a better store of value.

The question is if its profitable :)
If you push two transactions the merchant will see both of them too and, as others commented, they can act.

Always hate the findings of logic and reason after the fact. It's so natural to try to understand. Yet so silly that people need it. 
The price rose due to a global emotional consensus that the price was going up. One little trigger (nobody knows what) causing many to buy. Out of fear, out of elation that the prediction came true, etc.
Price went up because people felt it should, and their feelings became an self full filling idea.
Afterwards people start thinking and trying to find logic behind their emotional decision to buy.

Imagine you had so much debt that it amounted to 50 full-year pays to pay it off. Can you still pay it off?
You still need to eat and the loan costs interest, so your full salary is not available for just paying it off. So you'd need to win the lottery, steal from others, or work for the next 80 years or so to pay it off. And avoid going in debt at all in all that time.
This story is a very very optimistic one compared to what the US-treasury has done. There is no way, no way at all, that the debt can be payed off. And they continue with QE4 to loan billions a month. Violating the first rule of paying off your debt; they go deeper in debt.

@_date: 2014-04-09 13:08:43
The problem in the current system, which has been building for years now, is interesting to speculate on.  What happens when it finally collapses? Let me give a little stab;
the main problem with the current system, this is at the basis of everything, is that our currency (USD/Euro etc) are owned by some private companies and guaranteed by countries. The form of this guarantee is based on future tax earnings.  This inherently means that the only way we can keep money stay worth the exact same it is now by economic growth.  Which is the same as saying we need to output more in order to get the same return.
Year over year, this gets troublesome.
The solution countries like the US have found is to lend more, which in short means they print more money.  This is not a solution, this is making it worse on the long term.
So when someone says that the current system will fails (or like Op called it; commits suicide) this means that there is no way out of the debt and the only result is hyperinflation.  Money you earned today and buys you a car this week buys you only bread next month.
What this means is that nobody wants to own dollars or euros anymore, they want to own Tulips, or houses; something that doesn't loose value every week.
The direct effect is that people will want to change their fiat for something that has more lasting value. We have seen before that the price of Gold went up dramatically in a similar situation.
Since you can't do your day-trading with gold or any of the other things that hold their value, it would be nice to see if Bitcoin can be seen as a more stable store-of-value.
If Bitcoin's marketing does well, its tools get better, it stands a reasonable chance to replace fiat.
The biggest change from the current system to a Bitcoin based one is then that governments loose the power to stabilize economic unrest by loaning more (i.e. print more money based on future growth).  And personally I think that's a good thing.

having 51% of the hash-power means that statistics are on your side. The mining concept is nothing but a game-of-change. Like flipping a coin to get heads-up. But instead of a 2-sided coin you have a coin that has 2256 sides. (Its a bit better since there are multiple correct answers). So in order to get the right value before the end of the universe, we flip more coins simultaneously, which translates in the real world to more mining equipment.
What it means that a mining pool gets 51% is that it has more coins to flip than anyone else, and so its coin-flipping will get it to land on the right "heads" side faster, on average.
Having more than 50% of the mining-power means one thing only; if we wait long enough, and try often enough, you will eventually get more 'wins' in a row than the competition.
Here is the problem, though. Its still random, and you only have a very small advantage. So to get a guaranteed win so many times in a row, you need to try weeks or months. Probably even longer.
The 51% attack only works when you have a win a lot of times in a row. If you don't get lucky for a while, you loose and the thing you tried to accomplish is removed by another miner in the next block.
So, with all things being equal, a pool getting 51% of the hashing power is only dangerous if we don't monitor them for trying an attack, since them trying an attack that requires a 6-block chain is almost guaranteed to not succeed the first time. Statistics is just not with them.
If an attack is tried, and we are monitoring them, I'm pretty sure the Bitcoin community will take drastic action. The core devs can block the whole network, if needed. But I doubt it will be needed as many miners will realize that its better to work with Bitcoin than against it. And leave the pool.

you probably should move your money then; not because Bitcoin is a problem, but you clearly won't take anything other than perfect solutions. And thats your choice.
The rest of us will appreciate any improvement over the status-qua. Cheaper, faster and more secure is what Bitcoin gives you right now. Its magnitudes ahead of any serious competition out there. And I'll take that any day over a not-existing utopia solution.

As part of BIP109 Gavin wanted to fix the sigops which has several known issues (core thinks so too).
He introduced a new concept that doesn't count signature operations, but instead counts how many bytes are hashed in an entire block.
Enforcing that is a hard fork and it was part of the 2MB (BIP109) proposal. Which didn't get traction.
Nobody is running that code anymore.
Sigops remain untouched.
@_date: 2017-02-10 10:10:33
The sigops limits have not been removed.
You are likely confused by the concept sighash as introduced by BIP109. Not the same thing.

My idea of what bitcoin is, is slightly different. The problem is a very real 3rd world problem. Its a great alternative to currency inflation and government control, for instance. On this I'm sure we agree.
Where its a good solution for 3rd world people is that there is no need at all to shoehorn it to the current system. As you note, there is no real need.  The only reason to do this is to convince the 1st world people to participate since they don't have the problems of inflation to convince them.  1st-worlders just have to find it easier, not better.  Its likely not going to be significantly better for them for years.
Remember how in 2011 the United Nations made internet access a human right? I think that a crypto-currency (bitcoin or not) is the best way to allow people that live well below the european poverty line access to goods where internet gives them access to information.  It won't be this year, but its the right direction IMOHO.

In the long term you'll use an exchange less and less.  Realize that if you convert fiat to bitcoin you can use an ATM which holds your money for minutes at most after which it is transferred to your wallet and you control everything again.
The "online wallet holders" is something that you don't need at all, I personally don't use it and have money stored on my phone in one wallet and another wallet on an offline-computer.

you assume miners will mine on a 25% chain, which will generate a block once an hour of at most 1MB trying to fit in all the transactions from both chains this will give you a confirmation time that is rather useless.
Miners mining on the minority chain would very quickly realize that the chain doesn't have any worth as its like a 250kb blocksize.  So miners leave. Causing the time between blocks to go up and it will be even more worthless as it will just be mining transactions also on the majority chain.
Miners know this, know that there is no way that they will get paid for their efforts if they just mine on a minority chain.

Its a bit hard to explain why something won't happen, I don't really know why OP thinks it does. I'd gladly answer any of his worries, if he explained them.
I can explain what will actually happen in a normal and well executed protocol upgrade like the one we are talking about; the removal of the maximum block size from the protocol rules.
Miners will first get to a point where there is clearly enough support. This is likely at a super-majority percentage of blocks flagging.
Then they can talk about an exact date (expressed in block-height) after which the new rules come into affect. Their conclusion will be made very clear to everyone in the community. Everyone should know about this before we hit that date.
In this specific protocol upgrade, users using SPV wallets are unaffected. Already a large percentage of the network is running compatible clients. So the rest of the people need to use a client that supports this change. I have no doubt a simple 1-change Core software client will be released. Either by them, or by some volunteers.
People that did not upgrade in time will simple be off the network until the moment they do upgrade. Its similar like being offline. There is no risk to the safety of your funds and payments to being in that state. Just like there is no risk to the safety of your funds and payments when losing your internet for a day.

Not having AD doesn't make Classic incompatible with BU.  It just means I don't condone 51% attacks is all.
And, no, they don't have "the same flag".
So, the reality is
* First release BIP109, the 2MB stuff with sighash in addition to sigops.
* Second release added BIP 9, 65, 68, 112 and 113.
* 3rd release changed to the BU sizing idea.

You just pointed to a core developer doing a review of the code! Sure he was being abrasive in suggesting the person was wrong instead of the code having a bug, but it does disprove your point that it was one developer in isolation.
Matt got his bugs fixed less than an hour after his review. Now, some months later, the FlexTrans code is in production.


That difference most likely comes from the fact that FlexTrans is 600 lines of code and SegWit more like 6000. And much much more complicated code as well, as it touches all subsystems of Bitcoin.

Not sure if you are serious, or making a joke.  If its  joke, its a bad one since the price has been higher than it is today.
The point you likely missed is that if a bank gives out loans, or a government gives out credit, based on an assumption of future growth and that assumption is only based on the idea that its been growing for many many years now. Well, then when (not if) it does go wrong, it really really goes wrong.
I don't see any parallels with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:13:11
Awesome :)
I'm wondering about one thing, as far as I can tell the "fees" part about bitcoin is not false, but I think it can be stated more positive.
In practically all cases the fees for a bitcoin transaction can be free (gratis). Only in a small fraction of cases its wise to add a fee to make the transaction go through.
Your current comment puts to doubt the idea that you can use bitcoin to pay for an article you want to read, which only costs 0.50 because the fee would double the price.  As far as I know its more positive than that.
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:58:34
The core of their argument;
In 100 years when the reward in bitcoins per block mined is quite low, we can calculate using today's volume and fees that there is no incentive to mine.
Phrasing it like that may make it pretty obvious what the flaw in their argument is.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:19:56

No you don't. You only have to assume that there *will* be miners that are human and greedy.  In other words; that there will be humans around.


At minimum that is an over-reaction. Being selfish is not 'good', its normal.  Also there is currently exactly one party in the world that *might* be able to do something to harm Bitcoin. And I stress the *might*.


All of these are demonstratively false. You are spreading a lot of FUD with exaggerated sentences liker those.
Bitcoin is still trustless. It still works properly and you have to remember that its still in beta. The main client does not have a 1.0 release yet.
Flaws are known and being worked on. Bitcoin is already a success, it doesn't need to be perfect because nothing in this world is. It just needs to be good enough.
I just want to give you one heads up; it will never be perfect.  And if you are aiming for that and expect that Bitcoin will only succeed if its perfect, you will be disappointed.

BB10 and QNX are indeed seen as the best and most secure by many countries governments, including the US.
I'm not sure why this matters, though. The limitations of it being on a phone you carry with you are more indicative of what kind of usage with bitcoin it has.
You don't really want to store a lot of money on it either way, you also can't really keep a fully off-line wallet on it since the block-chain size is too big and it would cost too much battery to keep fully in sync all the time.
That said; I'm a happy owner of a Z10 with BB10.2 on it, and I run the android (open source) app as my wallet. My main complaint is that it doesn't support NFC, but I guess thats more the app than anything else.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:23:50
You are wrong, those would have been spent just the same on both chains.
There is absolutely no difference between what can be mined on one that can be mined on the other.
Only when you start to combine it with mined coins do things change, and that will take longer than the entire chain will be alive.

People seem to have a really hard time imagining the actual speed of the bitcoin network. The amount of computations done outstrips any nation, certainly any one company.
The computer farm that google has is likely not going to be able to get 1 percent, and they'd have to shut down all their websites for that.
The reason for this is that they are all CPU based, which is so much slower than ASICS its not calculated in "5 times" or "7 times" as fast. Its calculated in amount of digits.
Not 100 times, but 10000 times as slow.
A Core i7 3930K can get to 66.6 MHash/s, but almost nobody has one of those. At 6.7 MHash/s (mining speed of a Core i7 2600K), it would take over 82,000 CPUs to match the Jupiter's 550 GHash/s

Not quite sure what you are talking about; his has nothing to do with the initial point that the FED buys bonds. Bonds are essentially a loan against an interest rate. Read wikipedia for "Government bond".
This is the government creating money by investing in a company or whoever in the economy uses that bond.  The hope is that the investment will create more value in its own economy. But this is just a hope, not a guarantee.
We started doing this kind of debt based on the USD back in 1913. In 1978 it stopped being backed by gold. And the end result is that in an ideal world you are right, but in this world we have failed interest payment on interest payment.
So we had inflation and therefor the actual money to be payed back on those loans is less. 
Now we have inflation without people calling it inflation. The QE 1 till 4 pumped trillions of dollars into the system. All of which should be replayed since they are loans. But the amount of money each and every person makes in the US isn't enough to pay off this debt.
Again, please watch the youtube series to get a better understanding. Its just scratching the surface, really, there are a lot more details to be aware off. But the basics is enough to know that it can't work long term.

Predicting market is for sure a black art, long reserved for the initiated but since a couple of years open to everyone.
The markets typically move in mysterious ways, but they rarely (i.e. never) have an exponential climb without really good reasons.
The bitcoin price has for the last 9 months or so been set completely based on what day-traders think it will do. Them playing the bitcoin price gamble (and many of us loosing).
My feeling is that this has mostly been played out, there is little to be gained by aggressively playing the market. Naturally, it will continue, but the price has been pretty stable the last month or two. Where stable means its following the price that it would have based on the fundamentals. Which essentially means the price comes from the actual worth instead of traders betting.
The price doesn't look like its going up in the next month yet, probably 2 months. There is simply too much work left undone for the big audience to start using bitcoin. When a big inflow of people comes, that is when the price will likely rise aggressively.
Naturally, the threat of war might accelerate things, but in the real world even that takes time. So I'm sticking to my timesheet that the next two months we'll keep going downwards.
ps. the reason we are going downwards at a slow pace is because the miners get more coins out than we have inflow of people.  Its a temporary issue.

Wow, thats impressive. Each and every line is wrong!
The 2nd version is non existent...
The "punishment score" mechanism is non existent too (a blog is not exactly the same as a release!).
Not having AD doesn't make Classic incompatible with BU.  It just means I don't condone 51% attacks is all.
And, no, they don't have "the same flag".
So, the reality is
* First release BIP109, the 2MB stuff with sighash in addition to sigops.
* Second release added BIP 9, 65, 68, 112 and 113.
* 3rd release changed to the BU sizing idea.

I agree. FT doesn't fix malleability for everything, just for FT transactions. Please read more carefully if you got confused.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:28:00
Thanks for the example.
Those kind of changes do not require everyone to agree on a change. They are extensions, extra features on top of the core concepts.  So its typically Ok to have people run different clients and all cooperate just fine.  Older clients just won't understand the newer features.
Or, simply said, those examples are not Major Architectural changes.

No, not really. If your client is stuck at block 100000 and refuses to update its not on another network, its just behind.

yes, just the block size.
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:41:24
There is one big problem with this chart, it compares two things that are not the same.
The issue here is that SegWit is a bunch of very good protocol fixes, and it has a little feature in there that is really just 5% which allows it to have more data in a block.
You compare that 5% to the BU solution...
A fair comparison is;
* SegWit vs Flexible Transactions
* The Core team vs Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited.
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:32:22
I'd say it starts at merchants accepting it. Not at businesses paying in it.
The reason is that if my colleagues that don't know about bitcoin get payed in it, they want to be able to see at every other store that their paycheck is worth something.  Otherwise they will just demand fiat payouts.

EC is irrelevant in this context.
What happens is simply that miners decide to fork without the software developers coordinating it.
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:47:55


Super majority is defined on wikipedia, please look it up.


You can define what would happen very easy. Your minority chain would have much slower confirmation times and since all transactions from one chain would end up being available on both chains your confirmation times would go through the roof. Especially compared to the majority chain that can trivially compensate by having a bigger block size.
The end result is that your minority chain will quickly loose its value because its unusable, it has a 1MB block only once every hour and any transaction done on that chain will get replayed on the main chain.
The end result is that miners mining on that chain will loose a ton of money and its career suicide to focus only on the minority chain.
The end result is that your minority chain will never actually start because miners know how it will play out.

Well, I maybe have 150mBTC on my lite wallet. Certainly not worth spending 12.5 BTC in order to steal.. So your miner losing its block reward better find someone that carries thousands of dollars worth of BTC on their phone.   Maybe you guys have different habits, I don't know.
Naturally, it may be much more common to actually go and steal the phone in case someone does walk around with $5000 to $10000 on it...
@_date: 2016-03-17 10:10:13

This project makes no sense at all. An (incomplete) solution in search of a problem.
The point of bitcoin is based on the fact that two diverging histories of transactions per definition mean one of them is wrong.
The point of git is that two diverging histories of code-changes can be merged together to get the best of both branches.
Somehow implying that they should be merged means you don't get it.
The only problem the project suggests is that if GitHub goes down, you loose your "upstream".  This is a mis-characterization. You can talk to your team-mates and avoid github and exchange changes that way.
If you really want, you can always just create a mirror-site that just takes all the stuff that is on github and makes it available again on a different continent.
If you are a company, just mirror the git repos every 5 minutes inside your own firewall.
All of those features are available in Git by default.  No need to give a guy money.

When you use it, you validate it.  Even SPV wallets validate the proof of work and incoming transactions. SPV stands for *Simpliied*. It doesn't turn off validation.
But here is the thing, you didn't answer the question. What does it give **you*? That last word is bold, for a reason. Your answer is about how many others are validating it.
If your answer is indeed that you think it is valuable that you validate all those coffee purchases, that is naturally fine. I think the majority of us agree with OP and don't think it is valuable.  So don't run a node.

The thinking mistake I see made a lot is the assumption that everyone needs to have a full copy to use Bitcoin. This is naturally not true. In actual fact, there are 100s of millions of people using Bitcoin without having a full copy of the chain.
The question is not how many times it has to be duplicated, the question you should ask is what value does it give **you** to run a full node.
The answer is simple, if you are not a business or a service provider, there is no such value.

No, you have been misinformed. Apart from a new version of script, there is no placeholder or other concept created in segwit that allows you to add future features.


Unused features are not stored. This is not a case of them being forgotten, this is a case of them not being used in 99.99% of the transactions.




If its an issue for initial block download, then why does it only take 7 hours to download 7 years of history?
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:41:12
Early versions typically have bugs. That was 2 weeks into the project, its much more mature now and all known bugs have been fixed.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:07:35


Looking at the history, that is rather unlikely. We started reusing sequence for 3 things now. At one point we'll come up with a feature that doesn't fit in there.


Lightning doesn't use nlocktime either.

The problem they (segwit authors) are trying to solve can be solved in about 500 new lines of code. They did it in many thousands.
The reason for this is that they held themselves to avoid one step, which is to have a hard fork. They required to do it as a soft fork instead.
So, what they *could* have done is;
1. change the transaction format.
What they changed instead is;
1. how transaction-scripts are found
2. how transactions are transferred over the p2p network.
3. how transactions are stored in a block.
4. we now have relevant data in the coinbase transaction.
5. block size calculations are changed.
6. sigop limits are changed
7. it changes the bitcoin-address type people can use
8. a whole new data-structure is added which is consensus critical
9. introduces new opcodes to fix problems found after the above were done.
10. how signatures are validated, quite extensively.
They even made clear (at the Milan meeting) they were proud that this change touches all parts of Bitcoin. That is not something to be proud of, that is something that should tell you that its not done right.
The sad part here is that the entire reason for doing it as a soft fork is to make sure that most parts of the network don't have to upgrade and thus make it much safer to roll out.
The reality is that practically all of the ecosystem will need to upgrade to get this working and on top of that, the much higher complexity over a competing solution will in actual fact make it much less safe to upgrade.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:26:31


FlexTrans would allow that.




It is on github.


I didn't do the math, but since segwit adds considerably overhead whereas flextrans removes data, we are likely talking about 5% savings over segwit.

Like the stuff we put in nSequence now. That field now has triple duty. Stuff that obviously didn't make sense in script.


Definitely. Has been for some time. Check out the website. See the other sub for a url as I don't think I can paste it here.


You make it sound like that is a hypothetical. This happens today, and we still only take 7 hours to sync 7 years of blockchain.
You may fear databases growing, but Bitcoin currently doesn't even us anything optimized for the UTXO. Its just a plain simple leveldb that is better than sql for this, but not at all optimized.  And we have actually no speed issues today with this.

This forgets the reason for the fork, it was not limited to the blocksize debate, the differences in management techniques definitely are an equally bad problem to solve.

You import two of the wallets into your electronic one and then create a bitcoin transaction to move all the funds to the public address of the 3rd.


There is no new wallet, you keep using the 3rd wallet as is. Remember that your paper wallet just keeps (one copy of) the private key to access your funds. It doesn't actually hold the funds itself.
As such you can use the public key to transfer more money to it without touching the paper wallet itself.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:48:59
You explained the same thing again, and its still wrong. It is a naive way of looking at things that has never been practice. Your view of fiat rejects that it is debt based and it ignores quantitative easing that pumps 60 billion dollars of currency into the economy every month for years now.

On the paxful website you link to the appstore page to install it. Which then gets users into the dedicated store of google.
On the paxful website you also have a "send to phone-wallet" link which uses the "bitcoin:" protocol to open the wallet and fill in everything it needs.  The website gets back the address and the website can then send the bitcoin to the address the wallet provides.
Really, its all invented, you have to combine it and make your website up-to-date to use it.

You are both right.
Email used to be both distributed and decentralized; what it is not is trustless.
And companies have been trying to fix email and nowadays its neither distributed nor decentralized.  The reason for this is that in order to become part of the "email-network" you need permission via certificates etc to talk to other nodes.
It is not distributed because most smtp servers don't accept incoming emails from a laptop or phone unless you are their customer. Give it a try, try sending email to the smtp host of another internet provider than you are connected to.
This used to not be the case. But then spam killed the old smtp.

If you worry about losing it, then make multiple copies.
It is perfectly Ok to have 5 printed paper wallets that you give to family and maybe a bank-vault for safe-keeping (be sure to encrypt it!).  Same with a usb-pen.

Economy as the demand on the demand/supply side of money? Thats a concept thats interesting. Never thought of it that way.
I admit, it sounds wrong to me. Money is designed to be the representation of wealth. Otherwise the concept of "store of wealth" would make no sense.
The last 50 years or so economist have explained to people that the economy always grows. Ever since 2008 we kind of stopped believing that, it doesn't make sense. Which means your idea is based on a idea that is already challenged.
The "Price" is currently calculated by converting to USD, which naturally is not something that makes sense in 10-20 years. Either BTC or USD will no longer exist in that timeframe (or both, you never know).
Price, then, is that you can buy the same bread or the same house for it from one year to another.
Honestly, so many of our daily concepts (like a house is sold for more than it is bought) just don't make sense when you take away the enormous influence that the central banks had on setting the price over decades and decades.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:02:39
You are wrong :)
The miners get a vote, weighted by hashpower. Nodes do not.  And if we reach that majority, everyone should upgrade, and at that time I'm positive that the change will be in plain Bitcoin-Core.

The thing to understand here is that the US tries to bankrupt this company via political pressure. There is no due process, there is not even an investigation or a talk with the district attorney.
This is the really big problem in this kind of process, some politician gets to be judge + jury + executioner.
If at any point there actually is a criminal investigation (and I doubt there will be) this all changes. And you have a point. I don't like criminals any more than you do.
Until then, I'd say that people are innocent until proven guilty. And if Bitcoin saves them from getting bankrupted only via political pressure; I'm proud of Bitcoin.

The procedure of a hardfork ensures that there won'\t be an competing chain. There will not be two currencies or whatever other stories I've seen being told.

The way this works is that miners have 28 days to decide which chain to mine on, and after those 28 days only miners that want every block they mine to be worth nothing will be mining on the losing chain, which means nobody is mining on one chain. And everyone on the other.
With that little hashing power, I kinda think the end user won't see any forking going on.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:31:58
Can't speak for him, but the bottom line to me is that currently the decision for new features being included in Bitcoin lies with a very very small number of people that are "core developers".
Having multiple clients moves that power to the whole ecosystem. People running nodes, which includes miners and exchanges and companies that serve merchants.  In other words, it makes bitcoin more distributed.

Ehm, no, please re-read the paper. You clearly misunderstood it. The longest chain can't really be about choosing between two equally long but sent-at-the-same-time blocks, now can it?
Let me save you the trouble of looking it up;


extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-
of-work is found and one branch becomes longer
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:03:58
No, your BTC will never be in danger with regards to this release or the upcoming fork.
If you don't upgrade your full node with wallet, all that will happen is that newly received funds won't show up until you upgrade to a newer version.  They will never be in danger.
If you don't run a full node, you don't even have to worry. Nothing will change for you.  Well, except your transactions will not wait so long when bigger blocks become allowed.

The source is open, the actual release just means you can choose which client you like based on merit instead of putting full faith into one team of core-developers.
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:47:07


You are very confused, my friend, the current transaction format is kept in-tact and as such it is perfectly compatible.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:29:40


Agreed, a hard fork is best to be done very rarely and well planned and executed.
The approach is to make sure at least 75% of the miners agree, then allow 4 weeks for the other 25% to upgrade making sure there is a full consensus on the hardfork before it occurs. Only then is it possible to mine a bigger block. It *only* will create a fork if there are miners not upgraded. and still generating blocks. Which is severely unlikely as the economic push to follow the supermajority is quite extreme.
Merchants not upgrading get a warning that there is a new version and dont accept or send transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-17 12:47:41


Thats a huge assumption you are making there, maybe you are willing to explain that one as it makes no sense to me.  Why would you waste your energy mining something that has such a ludicrous difficulty that you won't get a block for a days or weeks.


If you read the whitepaper it explains that this is exactly what should happen. The longest chain 'wins'.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:25:44


Why did you change the topic? Nobody was talking about dust transactions.  The topic was transactions with low to no fee. I can send a $1 transactoin and for most of the livetime of Bitcoin you could do this without a fee.
Dust transactions are transactions where the output is smaller than most fees are now.
Two completely different things.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:05:37
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:33:00


Ehm, no, over the first 6 years of lifetime of Bitcoin zero-fee transactions have really always worked just fine. It may take a block or two, but they were never priced out.
Maybe you can back up your assertion with empirical data?
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:14:15
The procedure is that a supermajority of miners upgrade to Classic, then another 4 weeks go by to allow the rest of the miners to upgrade and only then can bigger blocks be mined.
Which means that a block can only be mined when there is consensus and the block won't be rejected.  Thats how Bitcoin was designed to work and works every single day.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:42:30


To a 2MB aware node, there are no blocks created by a 1MB node that are invalid or even using different consensus rules. And we already established that miners run the 2MB node, otherwise we can't get in the situation that a super-majority vote has succeeded.  
So, yes, the "longest chain" rule that I quoted 100% certainly applies.
If you want to talk about impossible situations, then I suggest you label your post as such instead of making it sound to the casual observer that this is a conversation about actual Bitcoin future.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:59:45


And runnable in executable form right now! :P
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:51:28


I see where we went wrong; OP made the point about transactions that are considerable in wealth moved, but with future rising fees not worth it to use Bitcoin for. For instance a $1 transaction with a fee higher than a 25ct.
You jumped to dust transactions. Which is not what the topic was about. You misunderstood OP
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:15:27


Maybe you can go back to the article since that was never suggested.  Not sure how you got that idea.


I think you are the first to suggest it :)


Agreed, but really, the fact that you feel the need to write that shows something failed in our communication...
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:35:07
it's not a crackpot proposal .
Its the best way to get Lightning running on Bitcoin.
Look at the video posted yesterday for details!
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:51:43


If that is what people want to pay for, then that is what will happen. No matter how much you want it to not happen.
On the other hand we see that a simple computer on a normal internet connection can today trivially handle goals set fo5 years in the future.   What makes you think we need to actually have any sort of company to run these nodes?
@_date: 2016-09-12 13:17:40
You disagree that more users sending transactions is good for Bitcoin?  Thats the conclusion, if you disagree with the logic to get there thats fine with me. But do you agree with the actual goal?
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:53:14


Where i come from we don't just do things "because thats how its always been", we get people to explain why things were that way before we put resources into doing it again.
If you want to explain why these should be supported, please come forward with an actual usecase.
The current format isn't going away, it will continue to be supported. So no features are being removed!

Is that still relevant after the [OP_RETURN]( introduction which serves the same purpose?
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:44:53
Apologies if it sounded like I'm ok with prohibiting people from using a full node.  I'm frankly confused how that is the case as I think I explained very clearly how people where the cost is too high can share this in a local community.
It looks like you missed that part, the active reuse of communities that many places already have. Most smaller towns do have such communities, either a football club, a church group or just a community-house. In bigger cities this is much less the case, but in bigger cities the cost of bandwidth is also significantly lower than it is in towns much further away.
There is no reason to think that this would lead to centralization in any way that you seem to imply.
Also, I would suggest following the link to the various 'pruned' node-types that we may have as we can certainly innovate in that region.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:06:09
If you read the blog post, you'll see that the entire conclusion is about it being cheap to operate a node even if we grow over 5 years to a lot more users.
The entire point is to provide some actual numbers and evidence to dispel misunderstandings like a Bitcoin node being expensive.  It is not, and we can grow a lot and it still will not be expensive.
@_date: 2016-09-13 13:52:13
You use Reddit many hours and probably go through the same amount of MB in 3 hours as that Bitcoin would use in a day.   So you very likely are mistaken about things.  I think you may have not actually grasped the blog post at all which explains that it really is very cheap to run a bitcoin full node.
But the bottom line is that if you really live in such a place that can't support a full Bitcoin node, why on earth are you trying to tell the rest of humanity to stop using Bitcoin by limiting it?
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:06:56
You have a logical fallacy in that argument.
A user benefits most from **other** users using SegWit. So it doesn't matter to him that he uses a wallet without segwit, and wallet apps won't lose users because of fees.

How often do I need to repeat that the blog doesn't suggest radically increasing capacity. You should read it again to convince yourself.
Edit; Let me quote the important detail: 


@_date: 2016-09-12 15:22:26
A full node managed to download 70GB of blockchain in less than 7 hours. It also fully validated that entire data block.
What you should take away from this is that the speed of our network and the speed of a node is pretty impressive even today.

This is funny.  My blog never suggested that, or anything even remotely in that neighbourhood.  So calling my blog wrong based on something that it doesn't say implies you didn't read it properly.
Please read the blog.  Especially notice the ending which says;


a huge increase from today. But to make sure we do it properly, my goal is
set 5 years in the future.

I think you should let the merchant decide what kind of risk he wants to take. Thats his job.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:44:35
**edit: parent didn't read the article and claims that a 5 year goal is going to be a problem if done today. Well, duh. Good that the goal is 5 years in the future.**


Who was suggesting that? I wasn't.  I think you misunderstood the blog because it explains the opposite.


Well, thats exactly the point of the blog! Thanks for agreeing!
The whole blog explains that in order to reach a goal **5 years in the future** we don't actually need to work on bandwidth and transaction validation cost.


Please search the blog for "pruning" it appears twice at least, and solves the issue you seem to have.


Please refer to the blog and find the part that explains checkpointing and the 10 minute sync.  Two options to solve this.


Please read the explanation (also further explained on this thread) of how communities can run full nodes.  This solves your worry.




This is false, you seem to have no idea how the code works. There will never ever be a block that is mined which doesn't validate. The code knows this and checks anyway. Which is silly.


You misread the blog post, this solution is *exactly* what I explained.  Thanks for confirming that this is secure.


What makes you think that this blog suggest any solution? The **only** idea it suggests is the removal of the 1MB limit.  And then continues being extremely conservative and only suggest a growth over 5 years.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:54:01


I think you misread what I wrote, no such disdain or otherwise negative comments were made towards the lightning network.
Lightning will be judged on merit when it is actually done. It will see its day in the sun and when it does people will use it if its better.


I think you may have misread the blog post, the blog explains that decentralization is not an issue with even millions of users, if we have that as a goal over 5 years of maturing of the network.
Maybe I should have added a conclusion that explains this, because nothing in that post should be seen as critical of your viewpoints.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:46:52


The blog post is reporting tested data and explaining how this actually affects scaling, what kind of software we have and real numbers on what is going on.  Nothing more.  It also speculates on how in future people can avoid having to go with companies when growth continues beyond individuals wishes to run a full node.
None of this opens any divide.


 If you feel the need to argue with me, I'm not sure how to respond. Maybe you should ask yourself why reporting of how good the node software works today is a threat to you?
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:49:51
Can you be specific about the issues you are worried about?  I have to admit your post is a bit handwaving.
About initial sync, the blog post has at least two points about solving that; checkpoints and trusted node. It also is a bit interesting to hear as an issue when the entire blog post shows that we can sync 7 years or history in less than 7 hours.
@_date: 2016-09-12 13:46:07


This may be the case for you (and I guess many others from the USA), but this is not the case for most people.

Sorry, maybe to you, but not to a miner creating a block and sending it over the network
This is a really really bad reason to ask a miner to give a discount and lose profits.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:41:20


History shows the opposite. Communities are natural. Are you part of a small community? A church, a football club, chess club, anything of the sort?  If not, I suggest finding one and talking to them about how people do these things.  Its really educational to find out how trust grows in small communities you see on a regular basis.


Thats not exactly what I said, and I suggested above you find out what people do since the concepts I suggest may just not be something you are aware of, but its really really common. In the offline world, at least ;)
In effect, the suggestion is that people use an already trusted group of people and apply that to money. Making the concept of money being social even stronger than it already was.
If you look at people today, most people that use an SVP wallet end up trusting "the network" (i.e. a random node). The change that my blog explains is that those people are better off trusting someone they personally know. This brings accountability. This brings trust into Bitcoin.  Not in big banks, but in the community of Bitcoin.
If you think thats unacceptable or wrong in some way, then you are essentially saying that people should not be social animals.  While they very clearly are.  So, if you continue to disagree with this suggestion, you are fighting human nature.

Well, if that is your worst issue with the article, I think its pretty good. Thanks!




You removed some part of the paragraph that answers your fears; the real reason LN is not mentioned is that its unfinished tech and there are still many uncertain parts that haven't even been designed yet.
Nobody is putting the Lightning network down, saying anything bad about it or disqualifying it in any way.  It will see its day in the sunlight and the market will decide.  If it is better, it will be used.  I have no worries about that.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:29:11


Yes, I did. It was also discussed elsewhere in this thread.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:17:20
I think you are confusing the rate at which transactions are created and which they can be validated and downloaded (and stored).   Maybe you want to read the article?
@_date: 2016-09-12 18:03:10




Are we even talking the same language?  Thats a compliment  I wrote that you quoted...
@_date: 2016-09-29 19:22:52


The point I was trying to make in the video was that we are at the very very basic of scaling and our hardware has so much more capacity that limiting growth now is really not useful.
The same is true for storage. A 1TB drive can store **25 years** of bitcoin at current size. Sure, bigger blocks make the space get used faster, but we are not going to have 25 MB blocks soon. So your 1TB drive will still last quite a lot of years. Next to that, the drives for sale today are more like 4TB. Thats 100 years of blocks!
At the same time pruning options are getting better. See some ideas here; 
I don't think capacity is going to be a limiting factor any more than CPU is.
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:51:38


I feel I'm repeating myself;  nobody is jacking up capacity, the blog explains a 5 year goal. Not today.  You think Lightning will be ready in 5 years?
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:31:16


This misunderstands Bitcoin at a higher level. There are real benefits to running a full node. People in this thread that argue we should allow people to run full nodes can explain that to you.


I think you missed the title. Let me quote it for you;


@_date: 2016-09-12 20:13:46


We are at the same side to defend your right to run a full node.
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:36:41


That is the suggestion from the Core developers to the Miners, yes. There is no reason to believe that the miners will actually use that suggestion and indeed punish everyone not using SegWit by treating their bytes not with the same weight as SegWit bytes.
Wallets would likely not give a fee discount for segwit as they may end up hurting confirmation times.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:20:02
You are again misreading me; I think I wrote this more than once in this tread; Lightning will get its day in the sunlight and it will be used if it is better than alternatives.  Nobody is putting Lightning down. Nobody is suggesting we should not use it.
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:31:14




No. Why would they?  Why include something large for free?  Thats not how the world works. To the miner there is absolutely no difference between the "base block" and the "witness block" as you call them. They are just data that they have to mine and send to the network.
Why would they give a discount to some bytes and not to others if they cost them the same? That makes zero economic sense.
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:49:16


The sizing is quite irrelevant to the fee structure. If a local taxi service upgrades from 1 to 4 cars and they can serve 4 times the customers, does that mean you will charge the same for the first taxi and less for the other 3?  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
 &gt;  well if they care about maximizing their fee revenue then they will try to pack their blocks with maximum fee.
So why would they give a discount to some bytes and not others?
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:11:02


I won't disagree. But lets not rush things, there are plenty of problems that need to be solved before Lightning is going to be useful and available for the millions of users I wanted to target.
Lightning will have its day in the sun, no doubt.

People that can have an internet connection that can support 89MB blocks. Naturally we are not going to scale to that size blocks any time soon, the point was to give an impression of scale.
If you are not able to watch Netflix at all, but you are on Reddit, you can still run a bitcoin node that allows quite significantly larger blocks than 1MB.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:58:05


Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. You can certainly use a node at home.
Just don't limit capacity for the rest of the world because you think your personal security becomes too expensive otherwise.
Everyone is free to balance their security, their cost and their trust-in-others.  You are too.  If you think I ever suggested otherwise, I apologise. Something went wrong in communication then.
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:39:37
I think you are confused and ended up misrerading my post.
Millions of people is a lot of people, for sure. But our planet has 7 Billion people. According to [the worldbank]( only 2 billion adults are 'unbanked'.   You are off by a factor 1000 or so.


Please feel free to write what you think the issue is.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:00:58
No, there is no contradiction.
I think the issue is that you have forgotten how society has always handled scarcity. How society is itself a concept of centralization that is perfectly Ok and not the evil that you make it out to be. People group together to solve problems together that would cost to much for each and every individual to solve. This is a very basic concept that you are ignoring.
What you are suggesting is an extreme case where each and every single person on the planet validates and checks 100% of the transactions of each and every person on the planet. 
And you suggest that if we don't do that, all payments are insecure and unacceptable.
That kind of taking an idea to an extreme is unhelpful and naturally it will leave you disappointed because nobody will agree with you.

SegWit has been voted on for 6 months and its not gaining mindshare. Losing more every week. They had to DDOS f2pool to get them to vote for it!

Here is one definition;
5000 lines of code to do something that competing solutions (with more features) do in 500 lines of code.
That describes SegWit.
Here is another;
a solution that changes 2 dozen concepts and protocol-level ideas when a competing solution changes only 2 to accomplish the same and more.
Again, this describes SegWit perfectly.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:21:34


Actually, it is. Only Core restricts the block size limit to 1MB. All other full nodes don't. So check the node counts and what blocks are being mined and you'll see you were wrong.  At least 40% of the miners are actively running a non-core node.

@_date: 2017-05-15 13:11:27


False, it is fully compatible. All it does is have a different way to serialize **the same info that current transactions have**. There is no incompatibility, it just writes the same content using a different file-format.  It is like moving from .doc to .docx.


It is fully specified, actually. Technical descriptions and designs are on the website.  If you have failed to find them, feel free to ask.


You can find several independent implementations to help you in the github project.


This is false again, the **only** encoding it uses is one that Bitcoin has had for many years. Its the var-int as the source code calls it. IIRC Compact Blocks exposes it to the protocol as well.


Now you are reaching, saying that a year ago a not released and under-heavy development version has issues is reaching very deep. The first release was early January. (but its been on testnet-ft for months more than that).  
I welcome you to proof-read **that** code (or its multitude of implementations in other languages), it will only get better with more eyeballs searching for bugs.


I'm afraid you show you have not read the spec, you misunderstand the basic.  **There is no separation**. SegWit needs signature rebinding, FlexTrans doesn't because signatures are never separated from the transaction in FT. They **are** the transaction.


It is flexible in exactly the same way that XML / HTML etc are flexible and backwards compatible. If you don't see that adding a new field to HTML is trivial, you will indeed not see how FlexTrans is flexible.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:29:09
You are right.
Only Core restricts the block size limit to 1MB. All other full nodes don't.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:41:48
As nobody is using asicboost, you seem to be very confused and blame something you don't understand.
The only reason we are still at 1MB is because people oppose fixing the block size limits.
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:23:40


It doesn't. And nobody was arguing it does.


Every 'spam' transaction **is** allowed. Some nodes are filtering, many others are not. So your conclusion is wrong since we have a well working network and no denial of service has happened yet. It services people just fine.


Please do mention them, I'm curious. What exactly do you think is bad about mining all transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:07:47


So, what you are saying is that you need new code to parse this new format, but we do agree that the actual content is completely compatible, right? Changing the serialization format is irrelevant to people using the application, as long as there is support. They care that the content is not lost. And in FT the content is all there. No change.


This is interesting, as you **partially** quote one line in a 9 paragraph subject.  If you are seriously saying that that is all it says to you, maybe you can find a different computer to render the github site. There is substantially more in the spec.


If you are referring to the fact that sighashes «specify slightly different subsections of what part of a transaction will be hashed in order to be signed.», then you should realize that hashing a transaction implies serializing it. This is how Bitcoin has done it for years.  
I can try to improve this text, but honestly, if you don't realize that serializing a subsection of a transaction implies saving it, then I'm not sure how to help you further.




You want an explanation why the spec is unchanged?


I'm using the industry definitions of those terms. Serialization is turning an in-memory representation into a on-disk (or on-the-net) format.  
Encoding is a subset of this, it is specifically used for characters and numbers. Like utf-16 is an encoding. Bitcoin uses "compact-int" a lot currently, that is an encoding as well. Var-int is the main encoding for integers that Bitcoin does too.
Flexible Transactions serializes the transaction in-memory format differently than Bitcoin traditionally did, it reuses existing ideas and code, like the integer encoding (var-int) that Bitcoin has used for years.




It is good that you realize that browsers and html have a LOT of flexibility. I agree that too much is bad and as such there are very strict definitions on what is allowed in FlexTrans. In contrary to HTML tags, miners will reject a transaction that has a new tag added that is not part of the consensus rules (by policy rule).
Or, in other words, just because Flexible Transactions is a technology that allows a lot of flexibility, we won't abuse that to break consensus.

In the bitcoin system, which is the collection of the thousands of nodes, the concept of Denial of service by sending legitimate transactions is not a denial of service, it is a lot of paying customers.
Bitcoin as a system is very capable of stopping any transactions that don't follow the rules. They don't get accepted. We have to fix that little malleable situation, but other than that its working as expected.
What you are thinking is about individual nodes. An individual node can indeed see too much and not be able to cope. And naturally that node will protect itself by doing whatever it needs to do. Thats fine.
Another node, of a different implementation, or just a different set of configuration options, will accept those transactions the first denied.
 


The misconception is common, but its not mine. The Bitcoin network doesn't drop transactions. An individual node may, but the thousands of nodes will never all drop the same transaction.
If you have 5000 nodes, and each one randomly evicts 90% of the transactions in their mempools all at once (non-bytewise-weighted) in a single round, then the probability that an arbitrary transaction will be eliminated is 1.6E-229. Which is practically zero.
You are correct that its not a guarantee that the transaction is recorded, but that was not my argument. The argument was that the transaction will never be dropped from all nodes. Ever.




Not sure why you bring up 'consensus'. That has nothing to do with it.
A node that holds 100 transactions has a mempool. But you can't make any judgements about the Bitcoin system when looking only at that one mempool when there is another with 70000 transactions that is propagating all of those to the miners whenever it can.

I do belief that running them at home is a very good alternative. Your 5Mbit should be fine, according to my bandwidth measurements.  That makes your node to relaying and verification of transactions.
I highly support giving your close friends and family the IP address of that node so they can use that in their SPV wallet and trust you, instead of some strangers :)
When it comes to memory size, the usage of the -maxmempooltx argument to your daemon will be quite helpful to avoid wild growth. This is available currently in the XT binaries.

They are called Bitcoin blocks. Because they hold Bitcoin transactions. And moreover, those nodes would break the agreed protocol if they didn't accept them. Naturally you can add some code to Bitcoin Core to purge them from disk after validation.

UASF is an idea where people running a wallet decide to stop following the miners chain if the miner doesn't vote for SegWit.
There are several important details here.
* Miners can last much much much longer without sending their coins to an exchange than an exchange can last without the miners chain.
* Miners would be embraced again by just *voting* for segwit. There is no way for miners to be forced to accept, mine or validate segwit transactions. There is not even a reason for miners to start running Core.
The only effect uasf could possibly have is for miners to vote segwit in, without validating it. Which means that if one miner includes segwit transactions he will quickly get himself hard forked off the net because other miners will happily include a transaction spending that segwit tx because it is an everyone-can-spend.
UASF is a stupid idea. There is no way that exchanges will cut their own veins open by using it.  
If it were to actually work, it would actually kill SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:44:03


Physics shows you to be wrong.
Bigger buses don't cause larger queues of people left behind.
The bitcoin block size is an economic variable. Miners create block-space to be filled up by paying customers with transactions.
This means that bigger blocks means a larger supply. And prices are set by supply-demand.
With this conclusion you can reflect what would happen based on real world situations. You would get 4 barista's instead of 2 creating coffee at your Starbucks. Question; does the queue get less long or longer?
It will get shorter for sure, because there are only so much **paying** customers at any time. Anyone trying to just fill up the blocks will eventually run out of money.

Their graph only shows the amount of transactions on the backog (which the the big blue bar on the far right). Confusingly the numbers for that bar are on the far left.
The amount of transactions has no bearing on the size of a block. A transaction can be 300 bytes or 1MB. So they essentially don't show the backlog.
Next to that, they, and likely many others, choose to implement the first bullet point from my post.  They probably don't allow in their mempool the low fee or no-fee transactions.  Which means they show a distorted view of the world. They have 6K-transactions. My mempool has 31-K transactions.

If it were to actually work, it would actually kill SegWit.
edit: people asked about the way a miner would be forked off the chain;
Here is a step-by-step; and please remember that UASF does not force a miner to validate SW TXs, just to vote for the proposal.
1.    miner one creates a segwit block with a SW transaction.
2.    miner two doesn't understand SW at all. They receive a transaction spending the SW tx from the old block and will happily mine it.
At this point the minority is the SW supporting miner and he will reject all blocks all the other miners are Ok. Thus losing lots of money and killing SegWit in the process (not that there is anything really alive left to kill).
The bcoin client has an explicitly enabled feature to create transactions that spend SW everyone-can-spend.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:50:46
You have a point, but miss that the new feature is always deployed in re-releases of old software.
So if you run 0.9, you just get a new version of that with *only* the new hardfork patch added.
Backports are typically done for 3 or 4 versions.

With 25% actually voluntarily voting for it, I'd say its not a bet, its a certainty that the other 75% will not actually run the software they are against.
If BIP148 forces miners to vote for it, fine. We already have one of the biggest miners, f2pool, that started signalling SegWit because he was DDOSed, that doesn't change the feelings for the bad ideas that SegWit ships and certainly won't make people run your software.

From the article;








@_date: 2015-10-29 12:52:51


Why do you keep quoting me and arguing against something I didn't write?
Read the topic again. This is not about transactions getting in blocks. Thats the entire point, the transactions stay in thousands of mempools as a backlog for miners and full blocks come out and the backlog isn't going away.
And the network is handling it just fine, thank you.  Nobody should think that there was an "attack". If only we could actually handle the backlog :)
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:47:38


Calling it quite simple is stretching it.
There are no transactions you can build that are accepted on one chain and not the other. As UASF doesn't include replay protection (which is really sad, really).
So you need to depend on new coins only mined on your chain of choice. Which means you need to have miners do some work for you, as they are the only ones that hold coins that don't exist on other chains.
This is possible, but definitely not simple.
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:19:48




When transactions are valid (which means they are accepted by a validating node) they get accepted by nodes, and relayed to other nodes.
Unless you somehow magically make 100% of the nodes stop doing that, then you haven't DoSed Bitcoin, the network. You just gave it a lot of work.
Thats the difference between centralized and distributed.
You can't call it a denial of service when the service is still there, provided by the surviving nodes.


This is factually wrong; free transactions are allowed. They are also mined.


And so it follows that this is also wrong; free transactions are mined and allowed. See the first bullet point in my OP story.


I think you are missing the entire point of this posts; it argues that mempool transactions never die. And this is how the software has been running for years. You may disagree with how its supposed to behave, but this is how it behaves now.
This is the inherent behaviour that comes out of the rules that Satoshi himself put in the system. The only way to change that is to centralize decision making on what to evict from the mempool.
Naturally, I prefer to actually handle transactions that people intend to make and put on the network. Why discriminate against valid transactions? You would object if your bank said "no" because they were too busy...
Which explains why the two suggestions I wrote in the OP post are the only solution in the end.

I can see how you can come to this conclusion; history is littered with people and systems that have made the same thinking error.
The error is simple; talking about a different way of doing things doesn't convince nearly as many people as showing them a different way of things.
There are a lot of different, very human, reasons for that. But I think the easiest and also biggest of this is one where a certain mindset becomes your whole world and a suggestion to do something different can cause people to not understand the solution fully.  Especially developers have a lot of problems accepting a solution they don't understand fully.
For this reason you need forks. You need to allow people to do things on their own so you can judge the final outcome, not the process.

Correction, they won't buy SegWit coins, the bitcoins from the main chain continue to be impossible to steal.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:52:46


First, they don't. 40% of the miners disproves your theory. Node counters give a good indication too.
And you know this as you work for BlockStream, brg444, a miner just starting to mine bigger blocks is disruptive. The aim is to have a stable network and a mature coin.
The idea that "practically all the network runs Core", as you say, is contested quite brutally. We have 40% of the hash power actively voting against Core and 70% indirectly voting against by not supporting SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:20:23


I suggest you look at the website.
Voting is on the blockchain, not on a website. And we are talking about a many hundreds of thousands of coins for all those proposals.
If its just Ver's coins, then maybe you can explain why Core doesn't have anyone voting the opposite with more coins?  Or are you going to suggest that Ver owns more than anyone else? Which would be a preposterous suggestion.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:10:38


This shows you have not done software for too long, as this is as far away from the truth as you can get!
SegWit is a huge amount of changes to the ideas and concepts behind Bitcoin. It adds complexity to each and every subsystem of Bitcoin.
A new developer needs to understand not just the subsystem, but also how SegWit applies to it and made it more complex. Only when the developer understands all of that can he do his work.
You helped with the background research behind  which explains the technical debt that SegWit introduces. Your help on reviewing the page was very useful.

@_date: 2017-07-02 21:04:39


If you watch the actual video, you'd know the answer.
The idea Peter proposes is that miners have a huge incentive to 'defect' away from a SegWit chain and any incoming SegWit transaction will immediately be spent to a private address. And the witness never broadcast.
You are correct that upgraded nodes will reject those blocks. Effectively meaning they are no longer following the main chain.
It may be more safe for you guys to not create any SegWit transactions and ran a full node that follows the main chain even if SegWit is not enforced.

Actually, it is. Only Core restricts the block size limit to 1MB. All other full nodes don't. So check the node counts and what blocks are being mined and you'll see you were wrong. At least 40% of the miners are actively running a non-core node.

Thats a strong statement. Its good that you have strong opinions, we all need those in our life.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:26:49


Transactions get mined in a block, that also shared with SPV clients. It only requests a select amount of info and most important for this example is the proof of work and the merkle tree (both part of the header). SPV wallets check the proof of work, they also check the merkle tree of the transactions they are actually interested in which proves to an SPV wallet that the full transaction it receives actually is part of the block.
You are correct that blocks can only contain valid transactions, can not contain double spends and have to have valid signatures.
So when an SPV wallet receives a block with proper Proof Of Work, you know those properties to be true. Again, you can wait more confirmations if you want to be more sure. Its not a black/white thing, more POW extending the chain with your transaction means more certainty.


There are several options and reserach is ongoing. The most obvious solution we have seen so far is to send a very brief subsection of data from all transactions. This means that the same data is sent to all SPV nodes.  
I suggest watching the talk from "Tomas Van der Wansem (bitcrust)" which goes in depth into SPV security. It was at 4pm on thefutureofbitcoin day one conference.




The network will very likely get SegWit very soon. But the core software will not notice it being activated because a different activation method is used (with a lower threshold) than the one that Core has. A different one that is noticed by your SPV client.
As such, a chain split based on a segwit transaction would not be detected by core 0.14.2. It is very likely that there will never be a chain with SegWit activated as Core 0.14.2 would expect it to be activated.
Similarly, you won't be able to send SegWit transactions because the SPV client doesn't know SW is activated.
Any other chain forks we may see will have the same problem, current software may not perfectly follow the chain. As such you need to select which chain you want to follow and download the appropriate software. An SPV wallet will be able to detect the proper chain of your choice, all it needs is someone coding it.

I think that you may want to turn off RBF relaying in your node, then ;)
Also Microtransactions are not dependent on lightning. They work without it just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:00:41


I would argue that the most sure way to know the bitcoins you receive are genuine is to receive them in a block. When part of a block they are protected by proof of work and your wallet checks the merkle-tree to validate without any doubt that the transaction is actually part of the block.
The amount of confirmations you wait then is based on how sure you want to be.
 


There are various options in development that increase the privacy for people that think this is an issue. There is technically no reason at all to have to run a full node to get that level of privacy you want.


The full nodes you talk about that follows a very specific chain don't exist (or, at best, are in beta stage). You pick a chain and pick a client based on that choice. The software picks the chain, indeed. And this choice can be implemented in either a full node or in SPV software.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:09:56
You might want to re-visit that solution. It doesn't hold up to the sniff test ;)
For starters, the slower chain will have a huge backlog from all the other transactions that can be replayed between the chains.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:11:31


Yes, that makes it 10 times more impressive.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:46:48


You mean this part?


Let me translate that for you; SW allows scaling of the signatures, but disallows scaling of the rest of the transaction data.  It basically says that to avoid more UTXO growth we just avoid making the space available for actual transactions larger.
I'm just wondering if people buy the long story that boils down to "Our solution for UTXO growth is to avoid serving more customers"


The baseline system can be run at home. You don't need to trust anyone, if you are someone that doesn't trust the people in their social circle.

No, you can't.  BCC coins don't exist yet.
What you can buy is a future contract.
The difference is clear, you can buy BTC and take it off the exchange instantly, you can not take this future contract on BCC off the exchange until they actually exist. Thats the nature of a Future contract. Higher risk, higher rewards.

Block validation and download is mostly serial (more sliding window, but you can assume its serial for pruning). So at any point there are only a subset of blocks on your system. As more is downloaded, old ones are deleted.


The point I tried to make was not that everyone can switch to this system, it was more that its a 3rd node-type.  I don't mean to suggest we can stop having nodes with the full history.  I would think that we can have places like the internet archive, google etc. Places with loads of hard drive space can host the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:09:22

Quite true. The fun part, though, is that the scarcity of memory is magnitudes higher than the scarcity of harddrive space.  You won't find many machines with 16GB memory, but its hard to find a machine in the store with less than 2000GB.

Seriously, you misunderstand proof of work. I suggest reading more on it, start with the whitepaper. None of the things you say are in it.
What it does explain is how proof of work creates consensus. You running a node does not create consensus. The best you can hope for is you detecting it when consensus is silently broken.
Now, you are fine running a full node to detect that if you fear that nobody honest is running a full node anymore.
But your instance that everyone in the world should run a full node and SPV is unsafe is delusional and destructive to Bitcoin.
