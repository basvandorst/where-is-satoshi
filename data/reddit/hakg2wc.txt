Bitcoin is not about fast and cheap. If that’s what you want, use fiat or dogecoin.

Anything that is protected by a patent proves it’s not an open, free, and permission-less global system. And the tech debt would have to be dealt with, this is an economy, not just some game we can hit the reset button on. Economies need stability. 
There also seems to be many unsettling security flaws with these graph based systems, including the fact that there is probably no alternative to Proof of Work to secure the information in a network, so these DAG’s, as far as I understand them, are victim to the same “nothing at stake” problem as Proof of Stake.

Whether the tech can be protected by patents is the crucial issue of this entire movement. If there is a patent that can be enforced, then there is someone who is enforcing the patent on the network (i.e. someone controlling the network), and that would be no different from the existing fiat system. 
I agree and am hopeful that one day Bitcoin can drop the blockchain and remain secure.

They can’t regulate Bitcoin. A government can only regulate the way in which its citizens interact with Bitcoin.

Actually no I am a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but this is a serious issue we need to be prepared for. Saying it could never happen is a sure way to be caught off guard.

Paypal solves the double spending problem in a centralized manner. The blockchain is used in Bitcoin to solve the double spending problem in a decentralized manner. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:42:00
Centralized hubs within LN (if graph algorithms really do require them), are totally different from centralized control in other systems. All the LN hubs can do is charge trans fees, not rewrite history or counterfeit or produce invalid transactions. 
How can other coins avoid centralized mining?

The blockchain was created to solve the double spending problem in a decentralized way. Bitcoin was created to offer a distributed peer to peer electronic cash system.

It’s manipulation, they want the public to think Bitcoin’s only benefit is that it’s digital
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:16:57
Bitcoin has the best tech behind it. Its blockchain is secured with the most PoW. The whole point of blockchain is to be secure, not efficient. With that being said, efficiency will come to Bitcoin soon.

Fair enough, we should certainly be as civil as possible to welcome newcomers. The reason you will see hostility here with issues like the one being discussed here, is not because it's frustrating to teach people about Bitcoin, but because there is a lot of propaganda trying to redefine Bitcoin and how it works by taking advantage of people's lack of distinction in technical nuance.
For example, if Bitcoin is redefined as something that solves the double spending problem, it can be used to manipulate people into buying into centralized systems that also solve the double spending problem.
The important thing about Bitcoin is that it is uncontrolled, decentralized, and permission-less. There are many people in government and banking that hate this and will redefine words like "cryptocurrency" and "blockchain" to serve their own goals.

He’s not talking about replay attacks, he’s talking about double spending, or “rewriting history” with hashpower. 
What many people seem to forget is that the Bitcoin blockchain is only as secure as the hashpower that goes into mining on it. PoW is the key to btc, nothing else. And because Bitcoin has the most PoW, it is the most secure (best) blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:27:27
Yes but PoW is a fundamental quality that probably nothing can ever replace. Without PoW the network is not secure. With hashgraph or DAGs how does a newcomer know which graph to trust when multiple graphs are being presented? Ask an authority? PoW is the only deterministic measure to place trust in.

Lmao, PoS is an utter fail. Basically asking for centralization and corruption

Yes, I understand I’m a huge fan of Andreas. Andreas has pointed that in Argentina, for example, people break the law and still exchange out of the shit fiat native to the country. They bribe the cops, etc. 
What I’m saying is, how can we prepare for the US feds shutting down Coinbase and Gemini, confiscating everyone’s bitcoin that was left on the exchange, passing laws to criminalize the use or ownership of Bitcoin. 
What are we doing to prepare for that. If you’re saying we shouldn’t prep for that very possible scenario, then maybe you are the shill.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:19:23
Just thinking about it. It’s obviously threatening the positions of many corrupt people. Control of the money supply being taken away from them is not something they will just sit idly through and watch get taken away from them. Bitcoin needs to be prepared to respond if they try to kill it (or at least revoke the legality of its use). 
At this point do enough people know about Bitcoin to understand what a human rights violation the criminalization of it would be? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:19:24
What do you mean? Do I think USD&lt;—&gt;btc exchange rate could go to $300 next week? Sure. But Bitcoin will never go away. This will be an ongoing battle of freedom of money vs. those who want to control it. 
Focusing on the USD exchange rate in the short term is myopic. Money makes ppl irrational and emotional which makes them susceptible to FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:50:52
It’s being downvoted because it’s not accurate. Bitcoin was not created to solve the double spending problem. It was created as a decentralized peer to peer electronic money system. The double spending problem was just one of the technicalities which Satoshi devised of the blockchain to solve in a decentralized way.

If you want fast transactions just get a visa card and use fiat.

17 because of lost coins. And the physical assets will be valued against the currency and purchased with the currency. So if all the real estate, for example, is worth 10% of the global wealth, then that 10% altogether should be worth ~1.7M btc. This is assuming there are no alts or fiats, of course, which would be the ceiling for Bitcoin.

Spending is not beneficial during this stage of Bitcoin adoption. Don’t let others get their hands on your precious bitcoins before hyperbitcoinization is finished.
The desire to hoard (hodl) gives btc value. Spending does not. Read the nakamoto institute crash course in political economy for explanations of why this is true. 
Don’t let con artist shitcoin pumpers and economic illiterates deceive you.

Electricity consumption from mining secures the network and has nothing to do with tx processing. It should be encouraged to grow to make Bitcoin more secure. Build an industry around it and watch entrepreneurs determine better ways to produce energy.

Yes, money is a basic utility that everyone needs and uses.

P.S. What you said about getting noobs into btc is indeed true and beneficial. So giving away a little bit to someone who has never hodled is smart because it creates new hodlers. But no one needs to be buying goods and services with btc until they are forced to in a post hyperbitcoinization world (after Bitcoin’s word domination). I.e., don’t pay with btc until they force you to.

Then what about those of us who already own Bitcoin and support it.  Why do we not use it more?  Is there any way that we can increase and maximize our use of BTC amongst each other while fiats are still alive?  Is there a desire to use it more but not means to do it with today's capabilities?

So what do you think of the work that BitPay is doing where they have issued debit cards and partnered with Visa to handle transactions between merchants and customers? What would your "grandma or mom," as u/lowlarkin points out, need simplified in order to start using BTC.

I see the point that hard forks lead to a slippery slope where changes (including controversial ones) become acceptable because a precedent has been set. Furthermore, if blocks get too big then eventually computing capacity which may only be available to big players provides the voting rights for the community thus taking away more democracy.
However, I'm wondering if there were somehow a solution to not create any hardfork but create a scalable network that is directly and necessarily tied to the original chain. If that is able to be implemented, then small block proponents could just use the original btc chain, and those who wish to scale and increase transaction volume could do so on their own sub-network all without corrupting the original coin by creating duplicates or updates that are not backwards compatible?
What I'm trying to figure out here is: would everyone get what they want if this were the case?
