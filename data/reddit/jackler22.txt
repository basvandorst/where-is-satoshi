I dont have this 3,5" display but i have a 2,8" display. But when I plug it in (with restart of course), it does not work. There is only a white screen, can somebody help?

yeah I already thought about an casa node, but if I understand it correctly, if i has a lightning node, do I also have a normal bitcoin node at the same time?

Bitcoin is also a cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:09:17
Ja ist fake, heute sind noch mehr mails aufgetaucht und auch schon mit paypal geklärt

The best thing is, I never bought / sold any cryptocurrencies via paypal. I only paid for a bitcoin key chain from ebay. But supposedly the word bitcoin is enough.
