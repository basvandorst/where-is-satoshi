I am seeing two (plastic?) pieces and a glass/transparent cover. Can you see this as being 3D printed? There's a growing market for such small things, and imagine if I could just 3D print it my own wallet. Would love to get the stl files for free, but hey if you want to charge something to cover your cost/research sure.
I can then print this in whatever color I want, make changes, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:49:24
makes sense (the key part here is how the two pieces lock and is tamperproof). Would love to see something in 3D printing world that is similar yet achievable with small scale (Makerbot, M3d, etc) printers.
Neat concept nevertheless. I'll be looking forward to your product

As someone who is a similar boat, another reason I can think of holding on to them is being a (original?) trusted cold storage. Similar to holding onto a gold coin. I have looked into number of similar cold stroage coins and I am not sure if I can trust them as I did with Casascius coins.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:15:23
true. I still liked the physical medium of the coins. However I refuse to trust any one else making similar coins or cards. I guess I am a little biased towards casascius since I was following him/his coins from early on.
I like your thread/thinking here. Has made me and I am sure others holding onto few/lots(?) of these coins...

Same here - My transfer via MoneyGram/WM was instant, I was so happy. Came in to look at the wallet and had almost $37 taken off for some reason. The BTC wasn't bouncing much that time. I've contacted Bitinstant but got an automated reply. Lets see if I get some help. Finding alternatives now...

So if they "eat up" some $$, that's our fault for not following directions? If you read all the threads about "DO NOT USE BITINSTANT", there are two types of issues: 
1. I didn't get my coins period.
2. I got the coins, but WTF was that charge for? 
I also fall into that 2nd category and am "patiently waiting" for their support staff to look at my ticket. 
They quote x amount during the order. This includes their fees, as well as other fees. They tell you that you'll get x $ (or equivalent bitcoins). When the coins finally arrive (unless you fall into  above), they are 5-10% less in USD value. I like others have given every piece of information their highly technical support staff can use, but so far the feeling is that they just need more (or less of users like us).
For me, it was a small $ amount, but I can see why so many users are upset. 
So yeah, we didn't follow the directions and go to another service to order our coins.

Buy ASICMINER shares (btct.co has passthroughs, or look at bitcointalk.org's auction section for people selling the direct shares. If you own 5000 direct shares, then you become a board member. They are pretty much the only ASIC company shipping products...unless you count BFL's once in a year shipment).
PT shares can be converted to direct shares easily, so not really a difference. 
No point getting into mining as there aren't any meaningful products you can buy that will yield profit with ever increasing difficulty. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:05:11
ummm so are 1000s of other guys since couple of years now. I don't think ANYTHING can explain this price for a bitcoin (unless the bidders know something that we don't)
Those last couple of bids were a big jump. Somone's just a noob there.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:17:22
Thank you sir!
(I know... I know.. I've been ignoring those wallet backup emails, but they were indeed a life saver)
This approach works! And you are right, their email is probably down. No verification mail sent on the new account too. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:09:53
True, though I believe if that happens then BFL or other companies are suddenly shipping out tons of new hardware (regularly and not just one-offs). Also the dividends may offset of the price fluctuations. Short term atleast, asicminer seems to be the way to go.
@_date: 2013-07-10 01:38:39
If you don't think ASICMINER will do down any further (or that dividends in the future will basically offset this), then this is a no brainer. Get the PT shares and you can easily trade them back to BTC when you need to... With just BTC, you get no return, but with the shares, you atleast get the weekly dividends (e.g. 0.025 on avg x 10 weeks x 10 shares is approx. 2.5 BTC profit in 3 months. This isn't counting if the share prices go up)
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:08:47
Try another option if you haven't - 
I've seen resolution on Reddit, but on bitcointalk there seem couple of their support staff. It seems that they are really short on support through their regular channel. I really hope this is sorted out because this is NOWHERE close to how bad it will get going once normal users start dealing with bitcoins.

Careful! CampBX has a 30 day wait period for new accounts. If you deposit via Dwolla, you can buy BTC but would have to wait 30 days (from your first Dwolla deposit) to transfer the bitcoins. You can sell them during this time and I think* you can then withdraw the USD funds back to Dwolla, but you might want to check out their facebook page / support for more questions.
I am now stuck with BTC until my 30 day period is up. And the market is going a little up, so I wait and wait before buying more BTC (which will be held there for few weeks anyways)

(Sorry no idea what happens to these dead coins. I suppose they are really dead/lost, since with the whole setup, you don't really know if an address is lost or someone just wants to hold on to that forever). Maybe in the future, when the coins are harder to come by (mining, trading, etc), someone will write a bot that goes off and finds these public keys, generates the correct private key and brings back those forever-lost bitcoins!

So I've seen this and another (US based) group by that's still going on... however I am a bit confused. If say I go with the US based group by that's ~10.5 BTC for 5 USB miners. Doing the math with current difficulty, this will take me about 5 months to break even. probably even more if I do a single buy (like this international group by). This is not even factoring in the increased difficulty in coming months
It's all fun after those 4-5 months, but even then the difficulty will keep on rising.. So this is purely for fun/hobby? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:40:26
I believe the price is when BitInstant gets the money from ZipZap (the middle man) and process it for bitcoins. The price may have well jumped 200 at that time :-) if you are unlucky.
For new users, this works... but I've found the best option is to convert cash to cash (i.e. deposit it into one of the exchanges). I previously used BitInstant-&gt;BitStamp. Did this twice and was on average, very good/quick experience. At BitStamp, I can then place limit orders and get a good rate when the market is going down for a brief moment. 
I hate the 3.99% fees + 3.95 (ZipZap) that I have to pay at BitInstant...so now using Dwolla (US Bank account) + CampBx to trade myself.
@_date: 2013-07-29 21:29:07
Same here, legit and very good service.
Make sure you verify with the required details and they can even bump you to the next level (bronze +). CC+Drivers license should get you there.
Their fees are little higher, but the fact that you can use your CC is just worth it. Buy enough BTC and you'll probably pay around 5-6%. 
Another option is Cashintocoins, but that requires you to use your bank. The owner, Will, is also awesome in responding and sending the coins. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:00:05
Here's more data for you :-)
I am in US... heard about Bitcoins about a month back.. for a few days I sort of ignored on it, but then started looking up videos and reddit posts. Finally figured out what mining was. Unfortunately I couldn't mine Bitcoins, so started mining litecoins and understanding those a little better.
I finally figured out the easiest option for me was BitInstant. Walked up to Walmart, paid via MoneyGram, went home and the Bitcoins were waiting in my wallet. Second time I did something similar, but had it deposited in bitstamp account where I figured I can learn trading.
Overall the experience was good, but I still find it difficult and time consuming to buy bitcoins (unless I want to pay heavy premium on eBay/Paypal sites)
@_date: 2013-09-17 23:02:15
atleast he didn't pay 200 BTC in fees like the other ~~poor~~ dumb soul. AM refunded those.
Wonder who mined these and whether they'll refund. If this was me, I'd be pissed..but at the same time the user has to be careful.

Thanks! 
As I mentioned, based on the communication given at the time of transaction, all the fees were factored in and accounted for. You have the details above, but let me know if I can provide anything else. The $37 is a small amount, but if there are similar things happening in other transactions (in future), I'd hate to just scratch my head and probably will find another alternative. I hope you take this as a good feedback because I really like the service and the instant delivery (when it works :) ) was much needed service in this new bitcoin world.

I've read the high-risk stories pretty much everyday now. I think it is safe to trade at either MtGox or CampBx where this is instant (have your funds in the account, then at the right price just buy the coins).
Or buy the BTC directly.
doing it via Bit "instant", Coinbase, or any similar site is just a scam or "high risk" transaction waiting to happen.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:44:39
if you can wait 2-3 hrs (in some cases 12, and your luck is really bad, days - for some users at bitcointalk forums)
Try BitInstant-&gt;Cash (via Walmart/CVS/7-11) -&gt; BitSpend...then trade away.. Funds go directly into your bitstamp account. You'll need this setup first (easy)
They also offer Cash-&gt;BTC, but I would suggest trading as it has less delays in this approach and you know what price you are paying.
I did this twice in 2 days (yesterday &amp; today) and got it in my bitstamp account in 12 hrs and 1 hr respectively.
@_date: 2013-07-31 22:06:30
I appreciate your reply and efforts to improve the service. As you can expect, there's going to be a lot of questions here and skepticism. To start with, there's already BTCquick.com, which is doing quite good (although running out of coins when folks really need them). They are using credit card from day1. Your name sounds similar to theirs, and now the CC option is no longer there.
I think a better option would be to start off here (and bitcointalk) with feedback from what users of these existing service would want in an ideal service. Then start with a simple checkout process (perhaps like Google Checkout or Amazon payments) and a small daily limit to gain confidence. Work out all the kinks before expanding. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:28:33

For now I am using the good old browser with pages pinned to my start screen - blockexplorer links for my LTC and BTC addresses to check the balance. There's a MtGox specific app that shows the latest rates. It also has a space for getting balance from one BTC address. No live tiles though.
But we really need something cool like integrating it into the WP8 wallet experience. It already has a NFC chip... tapping the phone to another user's phone to transfer BitCoins!!!?? Buying the phone would be totally worth that

BitMit is another site I've used besides gyft for purchasing giftcards.
One seller (no relation to him, but seems to have good feedback). If you do buy gift cards or any electronic codes, my advice is to use it soon before releasing the escrow. I've had cases where the seller seemed genuine, but if I waited a while and used the codes it would be already redeemed. Later got him/her to provide a new one free.
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:08:11
+1 (and no, I don't have a new account created an hour ago just for this :) )
I tried Cashintocoins a while back and it was excellent service:
- Submitted the form online at around midnight
- Asked him via email if he would accept the "quick pay" option that our bank offered. This allows me to pay via my phone instantly and he probably gets the payment instantly as well
- Replied within mins with a yes
- Got my coins pretty much within the hour. Next morning I was happy to use them.
The fees were 4%, but I will recommend cashintocoins anytime over BitInstant that has similar pay, but even BFL might look like heros compared to BitInstant in terms of service.

I like this!
Screw Paypal, but aside from that help the bitcoin community. I don't like BitMit much and using eBay for so long, I want to stick to it.
I only thing we don't have is a good/central escrow service (kind of what Paypal provided...but I get that it ended up screwing sellers more than buyers). As a buyer I want to use bitcoins, but because once it is sent there's no way to get it back (hell, even convincingly prove that I sent it), I am a little afraid of this.
Bitmit has something like this (escrow option in all auctions). I haven't used it, but whenever I see an auction with that option I feel a little comfortable.

I have no idea what I am talking but I think the prices may go up. Mining will become increasingly difficult, which means less new coins in the market. Non-miners or folks with GPUs that don't give much now will start buying...
