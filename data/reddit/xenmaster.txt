Kinda.  As long as your old PC supports PCIe graphics cards (and hopefully PCIe 3.0, but if it's an old PC it's probably not).  From my research, AMD cards tend to give you the most bang for your buck from a mining perspective.  If you're just getting started, I wouldn't spend $1500 on a graphics card alone.  I'm doing some research on ASIC mining since that seems to be the future.  GPUs are far outclassed by dedicated ASICs, but they're currently very hard to come by.

Yeh, this got me wondering if there was anything out there like Kickstarter using BTC.  I don't know that we really need something like Kickstarter though.  It seems easy enough to just tell people to donate to a specific wallet and get it funded that way.  Then we can get funding from all over the world.

Yeh, that's what it was.  So pretty much like this recent "hack" that hit bitinstant?  That's just social hacking.  Seems like it's no more or less secure than any other bank, except that your transactions aren't FDIC insured.

It does make it very apparent that the only way to make sure you have control over your coins is to use your own local client.  And to make sure to give yourself a few days buffer if you need to Exchange it.

Everybody needs to read and understand this article.  Trading with other currencies doesn't seem to effect us in day to day life because most US consumers are so far removed from the process that we don't see it.  All we see is "X product just went up/down in price" without much explanation into the market forces that caused it.
In my city, a local restaurateur posted on their facebook wall that after a long discussion, they've been forced to raise prices.  In the interest of transparency, they listed several reasons why raising prices was out of their control.  One of these was the price of importing certain foods from foreign countries.  What they could buy for $5/lb 6 months ago now costs almost double due almost solely to the Exchange rate between the two countries.  At the end of the day, the customers of the restaurant will only see prices increase by a dollar or two per meal and will just chalk it up to "inflation" and go about their lives like it's not a big deal.

My balance hasn't updated properly in several days.  Before I knew any better, I setup my mining client to send payment to my Coinbase Wallet.  That transaction is showing up as completed, but my balance has never been updated to reflect the total.  It seems the balance is only updated when you actually buy/sell from coinbase itself.  What's the point of a wallet that can receive payment if it doesn't update your balance??

So in 100 years when the whole world is using Bitcoins, there will be treasure hunts for those cold wallets that contain 100 BTC worth an equivalent of $100B today :)

Wishful thinking to try and drive the price back down so we can buy more at $50 again.

Ha!  The world would be financed by people who understand the internet and cryptography and who believe in open source.  We can only hope.

What is this equipment?  It all looks like cheap knock-off gear.  I've bought a few off brand continuous LEDs and their output is not very consistent.  I'd love it if Lens Rentals or Borrow Lenses let me rent with Bitcoin.  That would be game changing.

So as somebody who's trading, doesn't this "attack" benefit us as well?  I mean if the goal is to force the price to crash, then we can also buy more and sell when the price goes up.  We don't know the exact timing, but you could still benefit in smaller amounts.

I think the bigger newb question I have is why does Coinbase have a limit while MtGox seems to be where all the action is?  As a new buyer, I was only able to buy 5 BTC from Coinbase by checking every few hours until they had enough coins.

Very well written article.  I think we are seeing something that truly can't be predicted in any way.  It's not just like gold, it's not just like fiat currency, it's not just like an IPO, it's not just like a stock market, it's not just a protocol, it's not just a network.  It's all of these things at the same time, and that's what gives it so much potential value.  It will be interesting to see where this ride stops.
@_date: 2013-03-19 14:38:49
The way I see it, this just pushes the economy of Bitcoin further because people will be less likely to mine Bitcoins simply for an Exchange to your local fiat.  If you're a miner, you now have an even bigger incentive to purchase goods with BTC instead of just holding onto it in the hopes of a big Exchange down the road.  If we could get 1 or 2 big utility companies (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) to start accepting BTC to pay your monthly bill, why would you even worry about Exchanging it for USD?

Notice he said "i did do a fairly large order".  not "I bought coins".  Sounds like he sold and made profit and is still trying to make a point.
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:04:13
If you're buying coins hoping for a quick profit, then you're speculating.  If however you're buying coins hoping for a healthier economy that's not run by a centralized government, then you're investing in the future of digital economy.  All investing is inherently speculative, but some investments do tend to have a better track record.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:08:38
No, but as the article points out, the value of the USD does fluctuate a lot more than we notice on a day to day basis.  The narrative is, if BTC gets to a point where we are both being paid in it and buying goods with it, the fluctuations in the Exchange matter a hell of a lot less.
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:02:04
Very good explanation, thanks.  If I had coins I would tip you! (still waiting on my first transaction to show up in Coinbase).
So is it safe to assume that most people with bitcoins have multiple wallets of different types for different reasons?  Then just keep an encrypted text file somewhere with all your wallet addresses?
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:43:27
Everything cleared for me in Coinbase this morning.  I sent some coins to my blockchain wallet and sold a small amount of coins just to make sure it deposits back in my bank account (for testing).  Both transactions have cleared.  Now we wait and see if the deposit shows up in my bank account.  The site does feel a lot faster now.
Now if I could only buy some more coins :(
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:44:04
The economy is still there.  My hope is some of the recent day traders who don't understand this jump ship, price drops to around $35-40 so some of us who want the long term investment can buy a few more coins.
Edit: And right after I posted that the price spiked back up to 46.9.  Maybe not...lol

Really people?
Can't believe how many people don't get the reference.  Is the bitcoin community full of people who haven't seen Back to the Future?
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:25:30
This is for pending transfers.  My problem is a transfer that shows "completed" and has hundreds of confirmations, yet the balance on my account doesn't reflect that transfer.  Weird.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:22:31
I really think it's too soon to go crying scam.  Especially considering all the "i'm new" posts on this subreddit (including me), an the fact that the FAQ refers everybody to Coinbase, and the fact that their site looks fairly well put together and makes it super easy to buy coins, I'm sure there is a good bit of traffic on their servers.  They have started communicating on Twitter that they are working on it.  I personally had a problem with a stuck transaction that finally showed up about 2 hours ago.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:24:56
Is this accurate?  The way it appears to me, if you spend $250, you get whatever $250 gets you at the time of purchase.  So if the price for a btc is $100, you would get 2.5.  
They also still have the rolling 24 hour period.  I bought one at market rate a couple of ago because I've been checking their site every few hours today to try and get some at a decent price.  Transaction went through just fine WITHOUT having to check the box.

This is a really solid use case that succinctly explains Bitcoin's strengths as a global currency.

I think the general idea is that GPUs can do a lot more than just mining.  It seems as if Coinlab is saying they can leverage the power of the Bitcoin network to solve other computation problems.  I'm no expert, but this doesn't sound any different than how mining pools allow you to mine for more than just Bitcoin at the same time.  On Bitminter I mine for Bitcoins and Namecoins at the same time.  It isn't too far fetched to think that a GPU network the size of Bitcoin could solve other complex computations.
