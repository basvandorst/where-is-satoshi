Do you know if anyone can attend?

I had a friend who said Bitcoin was stupid and wouldn't work when it was at ~$100 levels.  We don't talk much anymore...

This page is a great resource on the process of mining:

That's awesome, even easier. Thanks!

I've been using Tunnelr since it launched and it is an awesome service. The web panel allows you to monitor your data usage and it's very convenient to switch the location of the VPN node you're connecting to. I emailed them asking for bitcoin payments about a year ago so I'm happy that they finally came around and implemented something.

Awesome! I was kinda lost in my understanding of bitcoin until I read that book. It really clears up how all the components of Bitcoin fit together. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:07:39
Been meaning to pick up The Bitcoin Standard, it's next on the list! Thanks for the recommendations.

That's mostly for work (SRE) actually, but there are tons of examples written in Python for Bitcoin related tasks. eg. [Bitcoin The Hard Way](
I have been focusing on Go in the past year because I wanted to know what the heck was going on here:

Mastering Bitcoin really kicked it off for me. I do have a background working in technology so it may be a difficult read depending on your tech experience. Just take it one chapter at a time and try to do your own research on any related topics, like hashing, bloom filters, public/private keys, etc..
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:08:07
No, I just stare at them :P
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:06:52
Will check it out! thanks

This is where this story should have stopped...

Which is why digital currencies controlled by the 'current financial prison' are bad.
**Decentralized** digital currencies are good.

Twitter is my other go to. You need to follow the right accounts to avoid spam though.

This magic internet money is **only** worth ~6.4K. What a scam.

Old people just shouldn't talk about bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:33:28
Start off with $20/month

No. Bitcoin is decentralized. It depends on thousands of people around the world running the exact same software independently. For someone to shut down Bitcoin, they would need to shut down every node in the world. Shutting down the power worldwide would be effective, although not advised. Even then, we have nodes in space now.


Since everyone runs these Bitcoin nodes independently, it is their responsibility to upgrade the software on their node. If malicious code was ever introduced into the Bitcoin repositories, it's very likely that it would quickly become well known and people would simply not upgrade their nodes.


I think government price manipulation might be an issue, although difficult to prove. Big players in the Bitcoin market definitely have an impact on the price and they will use every trick in the book to kick money out of it while pointing at the volatility saying it's not working.

I seriously think most of them just don't get Bitcoin and haven't set time apart to learn about it. Proven by Jamie Dimon, when he said the government would 'shut down' Bitcoin. That tells me he doesn't get it.

Thanks for posting this. Just switched over to the BIP148 branch!

Interesting...I thought it would have been higher than 2013 levels right now.

Don't do drugs kids.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:43:05
The point of bitcoin is not trading. You're taking a risk by using it as an investment. If you don't understand the technology, take the time to learn more about it. If you're "not very smart at all",  maybe try to change that.

Bitcoin will keep working even after all this segwit/block size drama. If there is a chain split, one chain will eventually become the dominant one. Bitcoin will continue.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:23:42
Still good
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:07:55
Didn't know what you were confused about. This video should help you better understand how Bitcoin works and how a chain split does not mean the end of Bitcoin. I'm expecting the price of Bitcoin to recover by end of year.

Wow you figured it all out! You must be really really smart.

I sold .5 bitcoin today at coinbase.
