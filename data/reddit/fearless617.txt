Yeah I would think so (I don't actually use the app but they're both the same concept - one saves the other purchases)

Damn caught me. No seriously, I don't want this thread to be a bunch of people arguing about this and that. It'd be nice to see how diverse this group really is. I did a thread like this a little over a year ago with much less people in this sub and the results were actually pretty neat.

I'm loving this right now but let's no forget, bitcoin hit 300+ back in March. Hopefully we can get back up there and not look back

My law firm just held a small get together in a conference room to have cake for someone that was leaving. They all know i'm into Bitcoin and always poke fun at me. Someone made a few jokes about it towards me and then everyone started asking me questions about it/making of me. It was very frustrating to say the least. I ended up calling them all old (most are late 40's, 50's and 60's.)
It's our generation that actually understands how fast technology is growing and I'm very excited to see the beginning of this movement as well.

I'm actually being paid to go there and have a job lined up afterwards. Suffolk has a huge network and it's all about the people you know. The last firm I worked at had some of the top trial attorney's in the state and more than half of them went to Suffolk.

my heart melts for bitcoin 'til the dusk of day.
The night afford when bitcoin's away,

tipping is all I do,
While waiting for the moment, for bitcoin to say "I do."

Yes I'm fortunate but it's rather unsettling. The compromise never would've happened if I used Bitcoin.

South Station in Boston would be a perfect spot for a vending machine. We recently had a Bitcoin kisok put in the main lobby where people eat lunch and wait for their trains. The vending machine would be perfect near the kiosk for people wanting to test out their new purchases. I might have to look into this..
edit: I thought this was an actual vending machine that accepts Bitcoin! My bad

No no I totally agree with what your saying. There are a handful of people who like to complain with the Bitcoin-related subreddit and that's who I'm really focusing on. We definitely should have a standard set in other threads for tipping.

Great response, I really appreciate it! I currently work in-house for an insurance company but have the next 3-4 months off from school and will definitely try and teach myself at least the basics of coding. My brother's pushed for me in the past to learn to code but it just seemed daunting jumping into something totally new. I will definitely check your book out. Best of luck to you man
*Just bought your book, looking forward to reading it over the next day or two. Hopefully I don't withdraw from my school within the next few weeks ;p

Don't have to take my advice but I'd buy .5 and round that sucker up to 1 whole btc

You should offer customers a campaign such as a loyalty rewards program so they have incentives to use your site with their bitcoin/usd and hopefully cause them to come back for future purchases.  Check out

I made a post about 1.5yrs ago asking people what field of work they were in and what brought them to this page....had about 300 legit comments.....asked again this week to see if I'd get an even more diverse set of answers...ended up getting 21 comments and about 16 of them were people arguing about how bitcoin will fail etc....I feel like this sub has been taken over...very frustrating but I will still come back every single day
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:25:27
I was really happy when the price went up to 280 the last few weeks...I'm fine with where its at right about now
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:49:27

A man walks into a butcher’s shop and asks the butcher: “Are you a gambling man?” The butcher says “Yes”, so the man said: “I bet you ฿10 that you can’t reach up and touch that Beef hanging on the hooks up there.” The butcher says “I’m not betting on that.” “But I thought you were a gambling man” the man retorts. “Yes I am” says the butcher “but the steaks are too high.”

I did a comparison of a post I made about 1.5 years ago on here asking people about their profession to see how diverse this group was. I received about 300 legit responses. Asked again last week and received about 20 comments - 16 of them bashing bitcoin and arguing about how it would fail. This sub has definitely changed

Do you offer any loyalty rewards programs to customers to keep them coming back? Check out  if you're interested in offering some type of campaign

Bought an Xbox One with Bitcoin when it was at 227 last week...
@_date: 2015-09-19 13:40:27
  Once you get Bitpay/Coinbase setup you can use chainperks to set up different campaigns for your customers...loyalty rewards etc.
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:59:54
 has a nice loyalty rewards campaign. More merchants need to incorporate this campaign for their consumers...consumers need an incentive to spend their bitcoins!
lawnmower.io is also pretty neat...they convert your change into bitcoin via your checking account.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:46:12
$1000 tomorrow...one can only dream
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:53:39
Been there, done that. I'm at the point now where I'll either spend my bitcoin (recently bought an Xbox One and a bunch of games) or just not care about it (check the price 1000x a day like I used to). I can't really help the system out at the moment but I have plans on doing that once I graduate law school in a few years. If you're in it for the long run, don't let it overtake your life. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 03:55:11
I bought an Xbox One as well as some games all with bitcoin...figured I might as well spend it since not much has been happening

@_date: 2015-11-03 17:32:02
Price should stabilize around $2,500 for a few months so you can grab them cheap before we rocket even higher
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:55:01

It sounds like bitcoin is being bitcoin. Relax
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:48:31
The Bitcoin community really needs incentives on the consumer side....merchants are saving money by accepting bitcoin but consumers really have no reason to spend their bitcoin....Hopefully companies like  will help bring incentives to consumers with their loyalty rewards program

I recently bought an Xbox One at $280 level and cashed in 1.5 back in June/July to buy some golf clubs. Although I'm regretting this, I still have some coins along with TMAG clubs and an Xbox One. My first buy was at $852 but got my cost average down to $321....Keep buying!
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:27:17

I was told by some talented programmers that a Trezor can be hacked within 30 seconds by someone who knows what they're doing. Ledger ftw

Somewhere above or below its current price
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:51:00
If the price goes up yea...

@_date: 2015-11-03 17:33:14
I've been following bitcoin for 2-3 years now. My best guess is that the price will either go higher than it is right now or possibly even go lower than it is right now. Hard to tell after looking at all my data
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:13:03
mmm back in the day when I was in the green I bought Egyptian cotton sheets, Tommy Bahama pillows and gold.... now I just buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:24:36
I think it'll either go up or go down...or both
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:46:44
  
They offer different campaigns for merchants and one of them is a Loyalty Rewards Program..consumers need incentives to spend their bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:11:24
I agree that the price might or might not hit $1,000
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:42:28

@_date: 2015-10-26 01:06:11

I can definitely see this taking off...Bitcoin needs incentives on the consumer side right now...not just the merchant side (low transaction fees). I use LevelUp almost everyday to pay for meals solely because of the incentives of spending money at these locations and being rewarded with money on future visits. I would definitely spend more bitcoin if merchants offered me incentives to do so (online &amp; brick and mortar)
