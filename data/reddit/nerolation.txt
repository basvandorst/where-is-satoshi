These 1.5 are mentally already gone. I've been in the same situation. It felt great to buy my mother something of it. This didn't make me poorer nor richer. Ämm, no sry, it made me richer. Love.
If you're that lucky to have someone you love, share. 
Happy new year.

I see that some of you might think he killed somebody under his pseudo "dread pirate robert", but i don't think so. I think he's is prison, innocent.

I think he did things wrong too. But a life sentence is exaggerated.

That was never proven. He denied that and i believe him.
