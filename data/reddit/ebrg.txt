10k USDT*  ;)

Because Bcash is a 2018 project based on Zcash. The smallblockers call BCH bcash to distance it from the bitcoin name (even though it's closer to what bitcoin was meant to be) and confuse newbies.

He's right you know

HODL tight my man
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:28:02
**Technically** it is the real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:15:44
But it's just a store of value amirite
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:25:49
Depends on the fee for the miners
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:42:29
Split your coins then. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:40:21
At least there is no censorship there
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:00:28
You seem uninformed 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:44:44
No. That would cause replay
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:21:46
If S2X succeeds
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:06:40
At best you'll be downvoted to oblivion on r/btc. The mod log is public (you'll see they don't censor stuff). Different story here

Once the goddamn max block size increases 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:51:12
Yep. The devs pre-mined 8000 blocks (100.000 coins) 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:47:34
Maybe B2X becomes BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:10:47
Don't forget to premine 8000 blocks
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:12:18
The thing that is used along with your public key to validate a transaction and access your coins. If you use an exchange, you probably can't view your private keys.

So he isn't that Craig Wright guy? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:00:07
You'll have to wait till the fork to know all the options
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:43:40
You only own it if you have access to your private keys
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:41:05
You'll get them automatically. The only thing you must do is to have access to your private keys. Then you should split your B1X and B2X coins to prevent replay.

Don't use jaxx. It has some major security issues regarding the seed key
