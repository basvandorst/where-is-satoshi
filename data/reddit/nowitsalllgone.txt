All of the following addresses belong to the operators of the Cryptolocker virus:
- 174psvzt77NgEC373xSZWm9gYXqz4sTJjn
- 1Facb8QnikfPUoo8WVFnyai3e1Hcov9y8T
- 1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwP
- 1AEoiHY23fbBn8QiJ5y6oAjrhRY1Fb85uc
- 1Ne5bGjDdgmbsGdNK9ocwrQiWf8K1FTuSa.
Any money that was in those addresses is tainted on the assumption that the address owners only got it by stealing it from victims of the Cryptolocker virus. An exchange wouldn't accept money directly from one of those addresses, they would instead work with law enforcement to arrest whoever sent them money from that address. 
However, as you can see by looking up any of those addresses in a block explorer, most of the money that used to be in them has moved by now; much of it was laundered through bitcoin mixers (mixers are perfectly legitimate in and of themselves, but sometimes criminals use them to launder their money, which is illegal) and afterwards filtered into the rest of the bitcoin market. Some of it was likely sold on exchanges weeks or months after the Cryptolocker virus was dealt with.

It is possible right now due to privacy protocols like coinjoin and lightning. We know these work because, if they didn't, there would already be a secondary market for tainted coins where they sell for cheap. The reason there isn't such a market is because it's super easy to "untaint" a coin by running it through a coinjoin or popping it into a lightning node. If "untainting" coins was hard, there would be a secondary market where people would sell their cheap coins on the cheap to people who are savvy enough to untaint them and then resell them at the "standard" price.

It's the exact same thing. The courts would not let the government violate the First Amendment by saying "We hereby classify bitcoin transactions as something other than voluntarily published data, that way we can get away with banning it."


Then they are allowed to transfer bitcoins to each other. Simple as that.


No, they could not. They cannot say "You're still allowed to write data on a ledger, people just can't give you anything in return." The courts have repeatedly affirmed that the First Amendment protects the people's right to get compensation for what they write. See, for example, the Son of Sam laws, where the government tried to prohibit some people from making money from their books even while still allowing them to write them. The courts struck it down because that would be too easy of a way to get around the First Amendment. The government cannot say, "Hey, you can still write stuff, we'll just stop you from getting anything in return." That principle doesn't change just because the thing you're writing consists of numbers and letters published on a public ledger. If people want to voluntarily reward you with goods and services in return for your bitcoin transactions, they have a right to do so. The courts would immediately strike down any law that prohibited that because it is an obvious violation of the First Amendment as it has long been understood in the American court system.

Finney attacks and race attacks only work on payments that aren't confirmed yet. The standard solution for high-value payments is to wait for one or more confirmations before handing someone a product. Or, if it's a low-value product, you can receive your bitcoins over the lightning network, which prevents finney attacks and race attacks through a clever use of multisignature smart contracts.

Then you shouldn't use a custodial wallet, so ignore my original suggestion regarding Wallet of Satoshi and BlueWallet. Those wallets don't protect your privacy at all. Your best bet will be to watch some youtube tutorials on how to use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, or Eclair, or the new Lightning Labs wallet, or Breez. They are all very good, but none of them has "childlike simplicity." You'll need to manage your channels yourself, so watch a few youtube videos on how to do it.

I'm not very familiar with it myself, but I think it has to do with percentages and game theory. As bitcoin's value grows, the total percentage of it that a rich billionaire can obtain diminishes. But also, as it grows, people who do have large amounts will likely cash more and more of it out, which also diminishes how much is owned by large holders. If these trends continue, there will be fewer and fewer large holders, which means bitcoin will mostly be held by small holders. This reduces the ability of people to make a huge impact on the market by dumping a huge percentage or buying up a huge percentage. It's all theoretical, but those trends, if they happen (or continue to happen), could cause the market to become relatively stable compared to what it is now.

Making it unpopular would not infringe your rights.


Tools for sharing text and pictures -- including tools that have been used to share IP and CP -- are perfectly legal to use. The legality of such tools is protected by the First Amendment under the court's longstanding interpretation of the constitution. The same level of precedent has not been established for weed or CP, so it's a false equivalency.
As for IP, as far as I'm aware the only time IP is illegal to possess (correct me if you can think of some other example) is if it belongs to someone else, as described by Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution: "...securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." So if anyone has ever claimed that they're allowed to violate someone else's IP rights on First Amendment grounds, it would fall absolutely flat since the Constitution itself clearly says the gov. can establish penalties for violating an author's IP rights.
As for private keys, the courts have long said that private key generating software is protected under the First Amendment -- see the case law I cited in my original post.
I agree that the courts have allowed unconstitutional laws to slip through, but they've been increasingly protective of your First Amendment rights, and all I'm saying is those rights are not going away any time soon.

They do have a bad track record. The last time this happened (with the Gold Reserve Act), the president, the congress, the supreme court, and the voters all conspired together to take people's gold. Roosevelt's campaign was open about his desire to prohibit people from "hoarding" gold (he called such people speculators and openly campaigned on restricting their right to do so), and the people voted for it because they were in the midst of a great depression. Gold was doing well in the markets, but it was hard to come by due to the "speculators" having most of it, and everyone wanted to find someone to blame. But even in that case, they at least passed a law that said they could do this, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment which says that the government can only take your property after "due process of law."
I think it would go quite differently with bitcoin. How would the government outlaw the ownership of bitcoin, which is text? The First Amendment contains no exception for "due process of law." They would literally have to make an exception via an amendment, or get the supreme court to ignore the amendment entirely, or prohibit the supreme court from hearing the case. And I don't think any of those solutions would sit well with voters.
Consider the fact that generating a bitcoin address is generating text and publishing a bitcoin transaction is publishing text. As long as it is legal to publish text, bitcoin will still be legal, even if mining and node operating is made illegal -- because you would simply have to write your bitcoin transactions as text and send them to miners in other countries. 
Even if the government passes a law that says you have to disclose your private keys to the government, so that they can get at your coins that way, such a law might get around the fifth amendment (due to having "due process of law"), but it would also have to deal with the fourth amendment, which requires an individual warrant for such a search and seizure of text that you keep in your own home rather than in a bank. If the government manages to ignore all these protections, and shove everything through the courts to boot, do you think the voters wouldn't cry foul at this incredible repression of their right to write text and keep it free from search and seizure? Would the voters, the congress, and the courts all ignore the Constitution so blatantly? Perhaps, but I have more optimism than that -- I think we could make our case effectively that bitcoin is simply text that everyone has the right to write and make public. And I think the people of the united states would side with us on that.

It is already possible to create tokens on bitcoin using the Omni protocol. Tether is the most well-known crypto asset that is issued on bitcoin instead of on Eth. Another protocol for asset issuance on the bitcoin blockchain is the Colored Coins protocol; this protocol involves using one of bitcoin's metadata fields -- op_return -- to associate particular coins (or even a few hundred satoshis) with a unique string of bits ("coloring"), which can then be assigned purpose and meaning.
For example, a baseball stadium could make an agreement with you where, if you send them $50, they will return you a few hundred sats with encrypted data that says "These sats, originating from address X, constitute a ticket to Saturday's game." When you show up to that game, just prove your ownership of those sats, or, if you can't come, you can transfer them to someone else, who can then show proof of ownership. The baseball stadium would decrypt the data and let you in, knowing that they were the only possible issuers, being the only ones who had possession of the original address and the keys to encrypt the metadata with an accurate date.
This "colored coins" protocol makes it possible for anyone to issue digital, transferable, counterfeit resistant assets on bitcoin. Tickets are one possible use case, but other currencies can be done too, layered on top of bitcoin. The major limitation of the colored coins protocol is the speed of transfer; since they are a layer on top of bitcoin, colored coins are only transferable via the blockchain's 10 minute blocks, and some of the asset it always eaten up in the form of bitcoin fees. Luckily, there is work being done to transfer colored coins over the lightning network, by provably transferring the metadata using the lightning memo line and its proof-of-payment system. This attempt is ongoing and is called the RGB protocol. If/when it is released, bitcoin will be the fastest and most secure issuance network for digital, transferable, counterfeit resistant assets, which further adds to its utility.

Let me use the lntip bot as an example. The private keys are held in a lightning wallet connected to the internet. The computer that holds that wallet is also running a program that checks Reddit every 5 seconds or so to see if anyone has posted a private message to the lntip username with the code word !deposit followed by a number.
Imagine Redditor BobtheMagicHammer writes !deposit 5000. The bot operator's computer sees this, and since it already has a lightning wallet up and running, it creates an invoice for 5000 and responds to BobtheMagicHammer with that invoice automatically. If Bob pays it, the computer opens up a spreadsheet and adds an entry like this: "BobtheMagicHammer has 5000 sats." If Bob then writes the message \!lntip 50 to JimbosThrowawayAccount, the computer will see it, because it watches the forums for that code word, updates Bob's entry so that it says, "BobtheMagicHammer has 4050 sats," and adds a new entry that says, "JimbosThrowawayAccount has 50 sats." (Or, if Jimbo already has some sats, it updates his record to reflect the new amount.)
The only other thing the tipbot does is watch for private messages with the codeword !withdraw [invoice]. If it receives such a message, it checks its spreadsheet for a user matching the profile name of the person withdrawing, and, if that person is on the spreadsheet and he's got enough money to cover the cost of that invoice, it uses its lightning wallet to pay it -- or throws an error if something goes wrong. And that's how tipbots work. The bot operator's lightning wallet holds all the money on its own private keys, and just watches for code words to programmatically send money or receive money on behalf of any Reddit user.

I am not aware of any built-in gui for the Raspibolt, but if you're able to follow the step-by-step guide that gets your Raspibolt up and running, then you can also follow the "Bonus Section" guides, several of which give you guis for controlling it. Zap Wallet Desktop is one such gui, and with it you can remotely control your full node. Shango is another option, and it's for smartphones.
Regarding BlueWallet and Eclair, the main difference between them is that BlueWallet's lightning wallet is -- by default -- a custodial wallet. Their lead developer could run away with everyone's lightning coins if he wanted to, so it should only be used for small amounts. (In a weird contrast, the onchain part of BlueWallet is a perfectly standard wallet -- the developer can't steal the onchain coins, only the lightning coins.) If you want to change the defaults and make it non-custodial, you can connect it to your own node, and if you do that you not only get a perfectly functional non-custodial lightning wallet, but you also get to remotely control your node similar to how you can with Zap or Shango. It's a pretty neat option.
Regarding fees, if you don't mind it taking a long time, then set a fee of 1 sat/byte. The network has never gone 2 weeks without the mempool clearing, and lately it's been clearing like every other day, so your transaction will likely go through today or tomorrow.

As one of the network operators of the bitcoin blockchain, I can absolutely confirm that this network can get overloaded, as can all computer networks when there is a sudden increase in traffic. One of the differences with bitcoin is, all transactions clear eventually. Or at least, there has never yet been a time when network traffic got so high that it didn't "clear out" (completely) afterward. There are also new solutions to high traffic conditions which are available to users now but which weren't available in the last bull run. An example is the lightning network, which allows you to continue making instant bitcoin transactions even when the underlying bitcoin network is overloaded. Have patience -- bitcoin is certainly not without flaws, but these flaws are being worked on.

The next transaction doesn't reveal information as to who the thief is if he's smart. A smart thief would use his next transaction to send the bitcoins to an anonymous bitcoin mixer, after which the coins no longer have any history. Or he could create an anonymous lightning wallet and send the coins to that, because if you transact using a lightning wallet you don't put any information on the blockchain, so there's no way to find out who is spending or where they're sending money to or what amount they're sending. On the other hand, if the criminal is dumb, he may send the bitcoins directly to an exchange without mixing them or without using lightning, and in that case the exchange, who has his personal info, will know precisely who he is and where those coins came from, and they will give that information to the police.

It is quite possible that Satoshi kept mining coins long after other miners came on the network. If so, he could have many "later" blocks to spend from without anyone knowing those are his coins. He may be spending those and just hasn't yet had to dip into his "early" coins.

- Borderless: it doesn't care what country you're in, anyone can use it, even robots/programs
- Censorship resistant: no one can stop you from making a payment
- Permissionless: you don't have to ask permission to make applications on top of it
- Decentralized: there's no one on earth who can shut down the network or stop the blockchain from working
- Immutable: once a payment goes through, it is basically irreversible, which makes bitcoin a reliable form of money
- Lack of privacy: all transactions are logged on the blockchain for everyone to see, unless you use lightning
- Lack of speed: Visa can process 10000 transactions per second whereas bitcoin's transactions are limited to about 7 per second, unless you use lightning
- Volatility: bitcoin is hard to accept and hold as a business because its value can go down 20% in a few hours
- Not fully fungible: it is easy to identify "tainted" coins, i.e. coins that were used in illegal transactions, and exchanges often refuse to accept tainted coins -- if this isn't fixed, it could tear bitcoin apart
- Irrecoverable: if you lose your private keys there is no way to recover your coins (unless you use multisig and entrust some reliable third parties with the other keys)
Oh yeah and just for good measure here's a sixth "con":
- Cost: when the network is busy, transaction fees can be very high, like $50, which precludes usage for small payments, unless you use lightning

Putting your coins in a coinjoin does not taint your coins. There is no way for you to know ahead of time who is going to be in a coinjoin with you. If it turns out a criminal joined and mixed his coins with yours, that doesn't "spread" the taint to your coins; you didn't do anything wrong, and, at least in America, you have to actually commit a crime with your money before the government can put you on a blacklist. Mixing your coins to enhance your privacy is not a crime, and the government can't put people on a blacklist just because they used publicly available cryptographic tools to enhance their privacy. It's not the innocent party's fault if a criminal happened to be in the same mix as him.
I suppose it is possible that an exchange could refuse to provide service to people whose coins have been mixed, since they aren't required to provide service to anyone; but I've never heard of any exchange doing that, and if any of them start to do that, their competitors will eat them alive. Plus there are already exchanges -- like HodlHodl, FastBitcoins, Vaultoro, and Zigzag -- that let you use lightning to deposit your coins; and if you use lightning it's impossible for the recipient to know the history of your coins.

It will depend on what bitcoin is worth when the time comes. If any miner finds that the transaction fees aren't enough of an incentive to keep mining, that miner will turn off his mining equipment. If enough miners do that, the difficulty of mining will drop (because mining difficulty automatically drops whenever there are fewer miners mining and rises when there are more), which might incentivize other people to start mining to earn those fees. It's hard to say for sure what will happen in the future, but we'll have more data after this upcoming halving.

I think it's bad policy to ban pipes and syringes, but I don't think it's unconstitutional. Ordinary "stuff" doesn't have the same protections as speech. If the government passes a law that says (for example), "Syringes are now contraband unless you're a doctor, because they are associated with criminals," they can then go ahead and confiscate syringes using the 4th amendment (search and siezure with a warrant) and the 5th amendment (deprivation of property after due process of law). I don't think they *should* do that, and I would not *vote for* such a law, but if they passed it I don't think it would violate *the constitution* -- just good sense.
That said, I don't think they can do the same thing against bitcoin, because the constitution has much narrower loopholes for the suppression of text. The only loopholes it allows regarding suppression of text are for situations like if the text you're publishing constitutes a treasonous plot, or like if you publish someone else's text without their consent.

That's not true. The reason the blockchain is uncensorable is because it is open, permissionless, and decentralized.

Habits change when incentives change. If bitcoin becomes widely used, people will be disincentivized to take out 25 year loans, and they'll be incentivized to increase their savings and use that instead. When we used to be on the gold standard, people still bought houses, but not so often by taking out a 25 year loan.
Short term loans will be less effected, except by being less frequently sought, due to more people having some money saved up.

Miners get transaction fees as part of the block reward. Over time, the network gradually reduces the percentage of "new" bitcoins in the block reward, meaning that transaction fees -- over time -- become a larger and larger percentage of the block reward. So the transition to mining for fees instead of for "new" bitcoins will be gradual, but steady. (Anyway that's the theory -- we'll see how it works in practice.)

Gold is not text. Bitcoin transactions are. The First Amendment comes into play when the government tries to prohibit people from voluntarily making text public, not when they confiscate gold.

TLDR: they think that mining can become too easily centralized, so they propose "\[having\] a reliable broadcaster...\[distribute\] proposal values," and then every other miner votes on whether to go along with that or else tell him to try again.

Well, if you want to check who the most active contributors are on github, you can use github's apis to get [an array of users]( sorted by number of code contributions. That tells you a lot right there, but you also have to keep in mind that not all developers are on github; much of the development discussion takes place on Slack and on IRC channels, and some contributors wish to remain anonymous, so they simply ask another contributor to submit their pull request for them.


Building products and services that use or accept bitcoin is separate from working on the protocol itself. Entrepreneurs are responsible for finding out what customers want and then building products and services that provide those things. Bitcoin just allows you to tap into a demographic of techy people who want to use this cool new form of money.


What propels bitcoin's growth compared to Libra are the things that differentiate it. For example, Libra transactions can be censored by Facebook, whereas no one can censor a bitcoin transaction or stop it from going through. Libra transactions must comply with America's know-your-customer laws because Facebook is incorporated in America, which means Facebook must slow down transactions in order to first verify that the person sending or receiving money isn't doing anything bad with it. Bitcoin will always be faster because it isn't subject to any laws. If you want to know more about bitcoin's tech properties as compared to other payment networks, I recommend watching youtube videos by Andreas Antanopoulos, who does a great job of explaining bitcoin's fundamentals.

I largely disagree with you. (But hey let's keep it friendly.) Saving your money and spending your money both have positive and negative effects on the economy and the price. Saving your bitcoins effectively reduces the supply of bitcoins in the market, which drives up the price due to the law of supply and demand. Spending your bitcoins feeds the demand for bitcoins, which also drives up the price. But those aren't the only factors. Spending it increases the amount of bitcoins in circulation, which effectively increases the supply on the exchanges and drives down the price. And the main problem with saving your bitcoins -- especially when merchants test out bitcoin as a payment rail -- is that it drives them away because it's an *unused* payment rail. So there needs to be a balance, and different people are likely to assess the tradeoffs differently, or not consciously think about it at all and just act on a whim. On the whole, I've come to the conclusion that it's best to save most and spend little. But then I go out and buy a bitcoin pizza so huzzah.

Network fees (which are usually called mining fees) are typically calculated from an equation involving three variables:
- the size of your transaction in bytes (most transactions are about 250 bytes but that number is higher if you're sending from several addresses, or if you're consolidating several payments that were made to the same address)
- the amount of time you're willing to wait for one confirmation (most wallets, by default, try to pick a fee that will get you into the next block, which is often expensive, but many wallets let you change the default if you're willing to wait longer -- and that's cheaper)
- the average fee paid by transactions in the last 6 or so blocks (this variable is affected by the previous variable -- if you're willing to wait 10 blocks for a confirmation, there are ways to estimate how long it took transactions in previous blocks to get confirmed, and use the average fee paid by those which had to wait about as many blocks as you set yours to try for)
Wallet makers use a variety of algorithms to estimate an optimum fee depending on these variables. Check if your wallet lets you configure these variables in the settings, and/or get a wallet that lets you set a custom fee.

There is no central source where you can search through the history of bitcoin ideas and be sure to "get" them all. Early on, most new bitcoin ideas were discussed on Bitcoin Talk forums. It's where things like coinjoin were first proposed, and all the BIPs were at some point discussed on there as well. So you might start your search there.
However, if you're just worried about posting a thread and "looking stupid" because it's something people have heard of before, I recommend just creating a throwaway account and posting your thread anyway. Don't get emotional if people say "How could you not know this was posted all the way back in 2012?" or "Uh, this is so dumb, how could you ever think this would work?" There's no reason to get emotionally tied up about the things people write on the internet. I recommend just opening a thread here on reddit with a throwaway account (so you don't get bad karma if people don't like your idea or don't initially understand it) and telling people what it is. The worst that can happen is it gets downvoted -- and that only matters if you're emotionally wrapped up in what the internet thinks.

I think we're in agreement at this point.

@_date: 2019-07-29 20:51:06


The amount of coins being spent can't affect the fee, but the amount of inputs can. Assuming you don't reuse addresses, the number of inputs is the same as the number of "from" addresses. The more you have in the "from" part of your transaction, the higher your fee will be. The same goes if you're sending to multiple addresses in the same transaction -- the more addresses you send to, the higher your fee will be.

Me too. But the argument is not quite "it's just text." The Constitution has one provision -- a double-edged sword, as I'll mention in a moment -- which implies that possessing text can sometimes be illegal: when it was published without the consent of the original author. Article One Section Eight of the Constitution says that authors have "exclusive Right to their respective Writings," which implies that unauthorized publication of someone else's writings is illegal.
To my knowledge, this is the only provision in the Constitution that allows the government to punish someone for unlawful publication of text. But this provision can't be used to ban bitcoin, because the "author" of the bitcoin software (Satoshi) authorized everyone to publish it by releasing it under an open source license. The government also cannot use the "exclusive right" provision to punish people for publishing their own bitcoin addresses and transactions, because those are generated by their owners, and the "exclusive right" provision implies that you have a "right" to make your own writings public.


The government has seized property before, but text has higher protections than other forms of property. To seize people's gold they had to pass a law that exploited the "due process of law" exception for seizing property. But user-generated text doesn't have such an exception. Think of what would happen if the government wanted to ban books (for example), and so they said, "We're not violating the First Amendment. You can still *write* books -- we'll just confiscate them once they're written, and we've got due process of law because we already passed the law that says we can do so." The courts would not stand for such an obvious run-around of the First Amendment. The Constitution trumps all other laws, and the Constitution was in part written to protect people's right to own and publish text. The same thing applies if you swapped the word "books" for bitcoins, which are also text. To let such a law pass through the courts, the courts would have to become sympathetic to the idea of eroding their longstanding interpretation of the First Amendment, and that would take time or a major upheaval. I'm not saying it's absolutely impossible under a hyperinflation scenario, but I think we could make our case in an effective way so that the voters would be on the side of upholding your right to make text public.


Yes, but those bans were never enforced so they haven't been challenged in court. If they did go to the courts, I think the DVD companies could succeed in prosecuting people for unlawful publication of those decryption keys, because the "exclusive right" provision of the Constitution would protect the original authors, who claim that they alone should have the right to publish those decryption keys. But that's precisely where bitcoin is different -- its author did authorize other people to publish the code. Everything else -- the addresses and the transactions, for example -- are original writings produced by the users themselves who choose to make them public. The "exclusive right" provision would thus protect the users, so it wouldn't help the government.

Bitpay is actively trying to push more people toward bch and away from btc. They prefer bch because it is centralized around figures such as Roger Ver and Jeff Garzik, who can easily make changes to the protocol that benefit companies like Bitpay. Also, since bch has so few users, its network has never been backlogged, so it has never seen high fees. Because Bitpay prefers bch, they have stopped implementing bitcoin upgrades in their user interface, meaning fee-lowering features such as segwit and lightning are not available to merchants who use Bitpay. These decisions have all resulted in Bitpay charging high fees to users who choose to pay via bitcoin and low fees to users who choose to pay via bch. If you were at some company who accepts bitcoin, advise them to switch to a new payment processor such as BTCPay Server, Globee, or OpenNode, all of which support segwit and lightning, which allows fees to be far lower than they are on bch.

Those graphs look like they contain excellent data, though it's not quite intuitive to me how to read them. In the first chart it looks like if you coinjoin 0.4 btc (for example), your fee using whirlpool would be negligible, next to 0; I guess this means you simply pay one mining fee, which could be as low as 150 sats. Whereas if you use wasabi, your fee would be about 1.8% of your total amount, or -- for a coinjoin of 0.4 btc -- about 72,000 sats ($7.63 at current prices). Am I reading this correctly?
In your second graph, it looks like -- with wasabi -- no matter how much btc you mix you will only receive one or two utxos in return. Whereas with whirlpool, if you put in 0.4 btc that will be split into 500 utxos? There's no way that's what your graph means, right?

Opening up a lightning channel costs at least 180 sats. Refilling one from an exchange can now be done for 99 sats, if your exchange pays your onchain fee for you and if you're willing to use this centralized service.
- Create a lightning invoice for however much you want to refill your channel with
- Paste it into golightning.club
- Copy the onchain address and amount provided by golightning.club
- From your exchange, click the Withdraw button, and enter the amount you copied and the golightning address you copied
Voila! You've refilled a lightning channel for 99 sats, cheaper than you could open a new one.

It is unlikely that you will find an unregulated exchange that lets you buy bitcoins with paypal unless there's a large markup. This is because paypal transactions are easy to reverse for days after the transaction happens, whereas bitcoin payments are basically irreversible after the first confirmation (which usually takes 10 minutes). Scammers would simply buy the bitcoins with paypal, wait for the transaction to confirm, and then reverse the paypal payment claiming fraud. A regulated exchange could deal with this by using some sort of contract, but they don't want to do that because it's too much of a hassle. And an unregulated exchange or a peer-to-peer exchange? No way, the only way they'll take that risk is with a huge markup.

Many proposals start out their lives as a research paper -- often called a white paper -- that discusses similar ideas that have been done before, elaborates on what makes the new idea different, shows how it can be implemented, and talks about what difference it makes (such as by using data from a private testnet). These papers are often presented at bitcoin conferences such as Scaling Bitcoin or Baltic Honeybadger. Other times they're just posted online and a press release is sent to crypto news sites. If you want your idea to be taken seriously you'll need to do a research paper before making an announcement; if you're looking for collaborators to work with you on doing a research paper, many developers hang out at  on IRC and on the bitcoin Slack channel. Try reaching out for collaborators there.
If you don't want to do the research but just want to throw an idea out there and find out if other people run with it, then reddit is a fine place to do so. Open up a thread and say "Here's my idea." If it's bad, people will tear it to pieces (try not to get emotional about it), but if it's good, it may inspire someone to take the next steps.

Various figures have been proposed based on a variety of realistic models of possible future mining profitability once the block subsidy runs out. For example, Dan Held made some realistic projections [in this article]( His assumptions involve a 5x blocksize increase, but you can play with his tool for producing estimates [here]( and plug in different assumptions.
For example, if bitcoins are worth about $475,000 each in the year 2140 (a rather moderate projection, in my opinion), then bitcoin will have a market cap of $10,000,000,000,000. And if, by that time, it only has a 40% increase in transaction capacity from now (again, a moderate estimation in my opinion), it will be processing 9.8 transactions per second onchain. In such a scenario, if miners earn $1,000,000,000 per day in fees, that would mean the average transaction pays them $8.27. I'm not sure if you count that as fees going "way up" -- to me, that's quite reasonable assuming that the vast bulk of transactions happen on higher layers, which would render onchain transactions rare for the average person. $8 or so is well within reach of an average person for the rare occasions when you must do a transaction onchain, like creating a new lightning channel when you get a new job.

(1) There is no way for the protocol to know that the address is a ransomware address. It has no idea who owns the address or what they did to get those coins.
(2) If the developers wanted to add something to bitcoin to let them flag certain coins as no longer valid, bitcoin doesn't have an automatic upgrade mechanism, so that "upgrade" would -- by necessity -- be optional. People would have to *choose* to download it and install it, just as they have to do for every other bitcoin softfork.
(3) And if some developers did create an optional "upgrade" that flagged certain coins as no longer valid, too few people would care enough to download and install that "upgrade," so it would always fall short of a majority.
In conclusion, stolen coins will always remain valid coins at the protocol level, just as stolen gold remains real, valuable gold in the physical world.

They can't ban it. We have a court system in this country, and under the courts' longstanding interpretation of the first amendment -- going back to the 90s (see Bernstein v. Department of Justice, Junger v. Daley) -- the courts have firmly stated that any prohibition of cryptographic communication software is a prohibition of writing/communicating and is therefore unconstitutional, a violation of the first amendment. The courts have consistently reaffirmed these decisions and they are not going away any time soon.
When you make a bitcoin transaction, all you're doing is writing numbers and letters onto a public ledger that everyone can read. What you write -- in computer language -- is a simple statement equivalent to, "I hereby transfer X unit(s) to Bob." If the government tried to ban that, the courts would immediately say, "This is a prohibition of open communication and free speech."

You're missing something: the protocol says to create 0 new bitcoins from block 6930000 onward. That block is a "halving" block, and in some sense it *should* change the inflation rate from 1 satoshi per block to 0.5 satoshis per block. But since there is no "half satoshi" according to the onchain protocol, it just zeroes out and stops issuing new bitcoins entirely. See [this spreadsheet]( for more details. It's interesting to note that before 2036 over 99% of all bitcoins will already be mined.

A block explorer allows you to connect to the blockchain and use it without running your own bitcoin node, as long as you trust the company who runs the block explorer. They essentially run a full node and put its data on the internet with a graphical user interface and, often, an api for developers. Bitcoin software can then use these apis to interact with the blockchain on the assumption that a given user who is running that software doesn't have their own bitcoin node to connect to. If you're using software that connects to a block explorer instead of your own full bitcoin node, you're trusting a company to give you correct data about things like what the latest blocks are, what transactions are in them, and whether a given address has any money in it.
Blockchain.info used to be the most popular block explorer, and still might be, but they have lost some favor in the bitcoin community due to promoting the scammy bch altcoin. Blockstream.info (which has a similar name, but a different company runs it) is rather a newcomer to the block explorer scene, but they've got some talent on their dev team, including Rusty Russel, who was quite a famous linux developer long before bitcoin was even a thing. Apart from running a block explorer, Blockstream also produces the second most popular implementation of a lightning network node, they contribute to the Bitcoin Core node software and its associated wallet, and they run a business exploring bitcoin sidechains as a way to help exchanges scale their operations. I'm not familiar with the other two block explorers you named.

Presumably that's what forums like reddit are for. So let's start with portability. With bitcoin, you can store any amount you want on a piece of paper, or in your phone, or basically anywhere. There is no additional weight when you want to bring more with you to some place you're going, so it's easy to carry across countries and across borders; it's already "in" the destination country because it's all stored on the blockchain. With gold, the more you have, the more it costs to transport it (and also to store it). Therefore, bitcoin is more portable. Do you have any counterpoints regarding portability?

I use bitcoin every day at places like walmart, target, burger king, and dominos. If I'm buying food, I estimate/calculate how much my food is going to cost before I go and then use my bitcoins to purchase an egift card for that amount, or, if I'm at walmart or target, I do that while I'm at the store or waiting in line. I guess that's technically still exchanging your bitcoins for something else, but it works out because I only actually have the gift card for a few minutes. It certainly *feels* like I'm buying with bitcoin. And I am -- I'm just not paying the *store* in bitcoin, I'm paying the *gift card companies* in bitcoin. It's also nice because you can immediately add gifts card to Google Pay and Apple Pay -- then you can just tap your phone to the terminal to complete the purchase.
The sites I use to buy gift cards are mainly bitrefill, coincards.com, and foldapp.com, because they let you pay in bitcoin using the lightning network (which makes it all happen faster and cheaper), but there's also spendbtc.io, egifter.com, and gyft.com where you can get a few additional gift card options. But those last three sites don't support the lightning network yet, so it's more expensive and slower because you have to pay for block space and wait for the blockchain to confirm the payment.
On yeah and I almost forgot -- you can also use bitcoin very seamlessly on amazon now, using Chrome extensions like the Moon extension or purse.io. When you're ready to checkout, the extensions give you the option to make a bitcoin payment to complete your purchase. (And Moon lets you make your bitcoin payment via the lightning network to boot.)

It is correct to say that the base layer matters. It would be incorrect to imply that it is the only thing that matters. I don't think that's what you're saying, but I'm pointing it out because I think it's important.


Monero's lack of an open, transparent base layer is precisely the reason why [the monero hack]( happened.

That's why there are several teams developing an autopilot for channel management. Still, I suspect that there will always be occasions for manual handling, because there's no 100% accurate way for the wallet to know ahead of time how much money you might receive. If it's ever more than you have in your current channels, your wallet will have to do something to get more liquidity, and, since that costs money, it shouldn't do it without asking you for your consent.
Nonetheless, it can be made far less complicated than setting up your wifi and the hassles that come with that. If people can handle wifi, they can handle a lightning wallet, even if it does ask you to do something about your channels once in a while.

Oh I think I understand a bit better now. I'm not aware of anything that lets you convert your bitcoins anonymously into money that is accepted "anywhere," but one neat workaround that I use daily is to use bitcoin itself to anonymously shop at online vendors via extensions and gift cards. For example, the Moon extension for Chrome lets you use bitcoin to complete any purchase at Amazon anonymously, via bitcoin's lightning network. Or you can anonymously use foldapp.com to exchange your bitcoins for Target egift cards of basically any amount and use those online or in-store. You can do the same thing for Walmart egift cards (including their Murphy's brand of gas stations) using Bitrefill. I use apps and extensions like these on a daily basis to spend my bitcoins anonymously and buy stuff online and in stores. I suppose I'm not being very helpful, since this isn't an answer to your question anymore. But I just am happy that anyone can do these things and I want to spread the word.

The amount of coins being spent can't affect the fee, but the amount of inputs can. Assuming you don't reuse addresses, the number of inputs is the same as the number of "from" addresses.

Ever since the mid 1990s the use of cryptography for peer to peer communication has been regarded by the American court system as a First Amendment right. (See Bernstein v. Department of Justice; also, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act from 1998 protects a citizen's right to use cryptography to communicate. It even prohibits most third parties from attempting to decrypt a message that was not intended for them, with exceptions for people in fields such as cryptographic research, who need to do so in order to find flaws in cryptographic systems; and it further states that such researchers must cooperate, if possible, with the originator of an encrypted message so that their privacy is not violated.)
Bitcoin is just a cryptographic tool to say to the world, "I hereby subtract 1 unit from my balance and add it to Jim's balance." Any government that forbids its citizens from using software to say such things is forbidding speech, and, at least in America, they can't do that. As a protocol for communicating about value transfer, bitcoin is protected by the First Amendment, and can't be banned by the government without overturning decades of precedent, ignoring the Constitution, and saying, "You know how we used to protect your right to communicate using cryptographic tools? Yeah, forget all that, we've changed our mind." Which would not go over well with voters.
Here is the money quote from the landmark 1995 ruling Bernstein v. Department of Justice:

A wallet like Wallet of Satoshi is easy enough that a grandma could use it. The problem is, it's also custodial. The tradeoff is, any non-custodial wallet is necessarily harder to use because you have to store your keys and manage your channels.
Someone needs to make a wallet as easy to use as Wallet of Satoshi, except your grandson can set it up so that he manages your keys/channels. Then the grandson could just set it all up and manage it, and let grandma just press the easy "send" and "receive" buttons.

Yes, and the fact that some regulations are constitutional does not mean that any regulation, such as a ban, is constitutional. For example, guns can be regulated, but not if that regulation is effectively a prohibition on bearing arms. Bitcoin, too, can be regulated, but not if that regulation effectively prohibits people from writing data on the bitcoin ledger and receiving goods and services in return.

If you run out of money that's not censorship. ISPs censor you when they stop letting you post stuff because they don't like your views, not when you run out of money. An individual file hoster could stop hosting your data, that's true, but that's ineffective if there's a decentralized marketplace of anonymous file hosters. Bitcoin miners can do the same thing by just not mining your transactions, but it's ineffective because even if one miner is a bad actor, there will always be others who want your fee. It will be the same (I think) with decentralized file hosting. One file host might censor you, but another one will want that money, so it's effectively uncensorable.

That is because people have not yet come to grips with the fact that bitcoins are mere text. They are digits on a ledger that are associated with a corresponding address, which is also text, text that you've generated yourself. Swap the word "bitcoins" for other forms of text -- if the government tried to prohibit you from profiting off of your books by saying "You may publish your books, and other people may ask for them, but they may not accept or receive them," the courts would strike it down as an obvious run-around of the first amendment as they have long interpreted it. They say that amendment permits you to make your writings known to the public, and that implies that the public may receive them and possess them, with your consent as the original author. Well, it's the same with other forms of text. If you own the text that is a bitcoin, you have a right to give it to someone else in return for compensation, the same as you have a right to do so with an ordinary book. And therefore other people have a right to receive your text, i.e. your bitcoins.

No, that is a planned (but still non-default) feature for the 1.1 Bolt specification, but we're only at Bolt 1.0 right now and so there is currently no way to auto-balance your channels. At least none built into the protocol. There's really nothing stopping a developer from doing it anyway, because there are now decentralized ways of doing it, including through the use of Lightning Loop. But Loop transactions are kind of expensive.
If you use Eclair Mobile, there's a built-in button that says "Request inbound capacity," and if you press that you can pay a small fee to Acinq (the maker of Eclair) who will provide you with inbound capacity, which is effectively the same thing as having your channel balanced right out of the gate. If you use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, you can do a similar thing by buying inbound capacity from Bitrefill using their Turbo Lightning service, but that, too, is kind of expensive. If you're using a lightning full node such as LND, C-Lightning, or Eclair Desktop, you have no options other than to balance your channels manually. The cheapest option available for that is to use an exchange like Zigzag to deposit some bitcoins via lightning and then withdraw them to your onchain wallet.
Theoretically, a developer could pretty easily automate the use of Zigzag and do it as soon as you put money in a channel, but most lightning developers shy away from doing that because it's a centralized solution and Zigzag could have an error or just run away with a user's money. (They'd have to be quick, though, because they really only *have* the money for a few seconds.) I wish there was a lightning wallet that gave you an option when you're funding it -- "Balance this channel 50% via Zigzag?" and then you'd just tick that box and it would do everything else. Again, there's nothing stopping a developer from doing that, except trepidation that Zigzag is centralized and could fail to do the thing that's asked of them.

Yeah, the developer seems to have announced the availability of two new tools today (bitflash.club and golightning.club), and he's been pretty responsive to my feedback here on reddit and in Telegram. The bitflash.club service is a centralized batching/mixing service, and it is likely the first to accept lightning as a form of deposit. They're using BTCPay as a (decentralized) payment processor, which is cool, and they offer a decent api for programmers to use the service programmatically. The real question is, are they trustworthy, or are they just going to run away with the money as soon as they see any real usage? I suppose only time will tell.

Are you talking longterm or short term? In the long term, if everyone in your neighborhood has a channel open with the local grocery store, there's no need for the involvement of any hub, because you can just route through your neighbors. In the medium term, people will likely receive money into their channel via their exchange, and their exchange will act as a large hub. In the short term, you can connect to your grocery store directly because onchain fees are cheap right now and it's easy to connect directly to the places you most often do business with.


One of the nice things about lightning is that intermediary nodes have no control over your payment. They can't see who the sender is, who the recipient is, or how much was sent. Centralization means putting control in the hands of a few people, but that's impossible on lightning because even if there was only one intermediary node, that node would have no ability to control payments. The lack of knowledge leaves intermediary nodes powerless to control the network.

First of all, you should not have your savings on a machine that Microsoft, Apple, or Google can rifle through. You should only keep a couple hundred dollars on a hot wallet; the rest should be on a private key that you've stored offline, not on any internet-connected device. There are hardware wallets and linux distros you can use if you still want to have easy access to your offline savings, but if you don't want to spend time and/or money to keep your money safe, you can also just use any bitcoin wallet to generate a recovery key (the twelve word thingy), write down the key somewhere, send your coins to the first address of that key, and then delete the app. Now your money is safely stored offline and you can restore that wallet whenever you need to spend some of your savings.
Secondly, Microsoft, Apple, and Google would vigorously fight back against any order that would drive their users to linux. They would go to court over it first, on the grounds that the government cannot order them to suddenly steal from their users and thus alienate them. On a related note, the government defines bitcoin as property, and the Constitution says that the government cannot take your property without a law authorizing them to do so; and they cannot make secret laws that only they know about. So an order like that would either be challenged in court as an unlawful order, or else a law would have to be published ahead of time, which would make their secret plan more public. In either case you would have plenty of time to move your money to linux or a hard wallet, making it inaccessible to the government.
Lastly, the answer to your question "Is there a chance the government will sieze all BTC?" is No. Even in the worst case scenario, where they shove through a secret order and the software companies cooperate with them and no one blows the whistle before all the money on those devices is stolen, they could only steal the bitcoins on those devices. Which means not all btc -- not by a long shot.

I know, I have one, and I use it when I can't use lightning. But that is becoming increasingly less and less common as more and more apps get released that make lightning easy to use in more places.


2% or more in fees is a concern because there's no reason for it in a world where lightning exists. And that's not even mentioning all the other reasons why Visa is not as good as lightning.


Visa cards that can be prepaid with bitcoin may be a decent temporary tool to pave the way for bitcoin to be used everywhere, but Visa has so many tradeoffs -- fees, privacy, censorship, international latency, inefficiency, theft, and permission -- that lightning is a much better option. Wherever lightning is accepted it is vastly superior to Visa even now. What can Visa possibly do to stop it from eating their lunch?

It is my understanding that the phrase "nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law" allows the government to pass laws authorizing the confiscation of property without reimbursement.

By challenging it in court as a violation of the constitution. If they say you cannot write and publish bitcoin transactions, or if they say that people cannot give you goods and services in return for sending them bitcoins via voluntarily generated bitcoin transactions, that will be challenged as a violation of the first amendment, which -- according to the supreme court -- protects both your right to publish text and other people's right to compensate you in return for such text. If they prohibit the use of a bitcoin wallet to receive money, and impose any requirement that you disclose whether or not you are doing so, that will be challenged as a violation of the fifth amendment, which protects you from self-incrimination.

I can identify two arguments in your post. One is that financial transactions by banks are not accorded the protections of free speech, even though they are often just writing/manipulating text, so why would these protections apply to bitcoin, and the other is that, even though we have free speech laws, the government can still get away with prohibiting you from sending money to specific people ("by their name"), so why couldn't they just do the same thing but extend it to everyone?
To your second point, there's a phrase called "narrowly tailored" that the courts use to identify acceptable restrictions on constitutional rights. For example, even though the second amendment protects the rights of both gun owners and gun merchants to buy and sell weapons, no one is allowed to sell them to people on the Ofac's SDN list. But this prohibition is nonetheless upheld by the courts, since it is "narrowly tailored" and does not affect people's second amendment rights in a general way. The same thing applies to text. A blanket ban on sending/receiving bitcoins would be just as unconstitutional as a blanket ban on buying/selling guns. But a "narrowly tailored" prohibition of sending bitcoins/guns to a particular person who is (for example) on a terror watchlist would not be unconstitutional.
To your first point, it is possible for people who are engaged in certain types of business to voluntarily restrict their own constitutional rights for the sake of running their business better. For example, certain jobs require their employees to sign non-disclosure agreements, where you voluntarily -- for the sake of the job -- give up your right to say or write certain things that would otherwise count as free speech. When it comes to finance, people who seek a banking license must first sign away certain rights over what they can write in their banking database. Since this is voluntary, it's okay. You or I, as non-bankers, have not signed away any of our rights, so either of us could create a database where we assign each other arbitrary amounts of money, and no one would care, nor could they (constitutionally) stop us. (Also, no one would accept our fake money.) But Chase? They've obtained a banking license, which means they've signed the dotted line that says they won't write certain things in their database. So they've voluntarily restricted the rights that they would otherwise have under the first amendment. And that's fine, because it's voluntary and therefore passes constitutional muster. But if the government said "You bitcoiners, you can't write this stuff," when we haven't voluntarily given up that right, that would be illegal and a violation of our rights.

1. Because Visa charges 2% or more in fees to the merchant, who gets those fees from you by adding 2% or more to their costs. (Lightning is cheaper.)
2. Because with Visa it's still slow and expensive to actually settle your coins if you send them abroad, whereas lightning makes the whole process faster and cheaper.
3. Because if you use Visa they know every single one of your transactions, who the sender is, who the recipient is, and what the amount was, and if you use lightning no one knows anything.
4. Because Visa can censor your transactions and lightning can't.
5. Because why have a middleman when you can transact more efficiently without them?
6. Because if Visa holds a bunch of coins for you and thousands of others, they are a honeypot for hackers, meaning your coins are more likely to (eventually) get stolen. On lightning you hold your own coins, and you're (personally) not likely to be a honeypot for hackers.
7. Because if you use Visa then developers who want to make new application layers on top of bitcoin have to get permission from Visa before they can integrate it, whereas lightning is an open source protocol that is just as fast as Visa but anyone can start working on it immediately to enable new features and new applications, without waiting for anyone's permission.
In short, because if you use Visa, you'll be left behind.

Intermediate lightning nodes cannot find out the source of a payment, or the destination, or the amount; not even the recipient can find out the source of the payment, though he can know the amount and the destination (which is also true of monero).

I think the phrase "built on" is loose enough to include what I'm talking about. Uncensorable file hosting of small, user-submitted pieces of text and graphics cannot be done at scale without decentralized micropayments (or at least I don't think they can), and lightning is the only way to do those right now. One of the problems with file hosting is that the incentives aren't there for a lot of people to do it anonymously. But the existence of widespread deplatforming of unpopular opinions, combined with the ability to earn bitcoins easily by offering file hosting, may align the incentives so that decentralized file hosting becomes a thing. From there we'd only be one small step away from an uncensorable social network.

But that's a very silly comparison, because neither system's energy usage is correlated with the number of transactions they handle. Bitcoin's energy usage is a function of how profitable it is to mine. This is why bitcoin's energy usage sometimes goes in an opposite direction from its number of transactions.

The ATM didn't say "you may not replace your transaction," nor did it say, "if you do replace your transaction you must return the cash." It just said "Thanks, have a nice day!"

No, unless the donor told you his or her public key somehow. Whatsat allows you to send a message directly to a lightning node, but if all you've received is a payment, then you don't actually know whose node sent the payment.

I mostly agree with your post, so have an upvote. I will say this though: bitcoin's bandwidth requirements are, by default, much higher than the 1 block every 10 minutes thing would suggest. In particular, by default Bitcoin Core connects to new nodes all the time and it sends and receives mempool messages with them constantly. Many of these messages are simply confirming or denying whether your node has a particular transaction in its mempool, and/or asking your peers the same question. If left unchecked this process uses dozens of gigabytes of bandwidth per day, and that's not even counting when you serve whole blocks to your peers. These bandwidth-heavy processes can be slowed down by running in blocksonly mode (where you don't keep or serve the mempool) and/or by setting your node to not serve blocks to your peers (or you can just limit the number of blocks your node will serve per day). This affects me personally because I am only able to run a node as a result of these bandwidth-saving techniques.

The 50 first bitcoins -- the ones in the first block -- are unspendable. Possibly due to an early bug, or possibly to avoid charges of premining. It's not clear which other addresses are Satoshi's because he didn't start mining again until six days later, after Hal Finney had started mining.
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:09:02
Mining is expensive because bitcoin's software makes it harder to mine as more miners come online. It does this so that the amount of coins in circulation keeps a stable rate of increase -- if mining was easy, there'd be millions of additional bitcoins in circulation every day. Since the price of bitcoin has gone from 0 to $4k in only ten years, mining became a very profitable enterprise for a while, so there are now many thousands of powerful miners -- e.g. [this one]( in Iceland. As a result, it's very difficult to mine profitably right now unless you can afford a data center and cheap electricity. In short, you're probably not able to profitably mine right now.
So your best bet is to purchase them. You can indeed use an exchange, but the easiest way to buy bitcoins right now is using the Cash app from Square. They have very fast ID verification, faster than most exchanges, letting you jump right in after a couple of hours (whereas exchanges usually take several days to verify your ID). And, as others have noted, the best way to buy bitcoins is actually from other individuals who have them in your community. Search Craigslist and places like localbitcoins.com -- try to meet up with someone in person and get involved in your local bitcoin community. That's the best way to get bitcoins.

Consider phrasing their argument this way: "Bitcoin is not an improvement over the current financial system because it uses too much energy."
That argument backfires because the current financial system uses more energy than bitcoin. Every corporate bank owns or rents data centers now, and data centers have just as high electricity costs as mining farms. But banks also have many more buildings than miners do, which increases their overhead energy costs, and corporations also use things like airplanes to transport people to conferences and to meet with government officials; and they use armored cars and weaponry to protect people's cash when it's being physically transported. All of these are things bitcoin doesn't need, and they add additional energy costs to the current financial system. So their argument backfires -- bitcoin actually *is* an improvement over the current financial system because it uses *less* energy.

Ask him to sign a transaction as proof that he owns the bitcoins. He won't be able to do it on an exchange, but he can send it to an off-exchange wallet first, one which supports signing, sign it from there, and then send it to you. Electrum is a good wallet which supports signing.

Whether or not lightning works out, we'll continue implementing scaling improvements like better batching, smaller transaction sizes, and risk reduction when using a custodian. Moreover, if lightning's only problem is that not enough people are using it, it will continue to be a part of bitcoin's ongoing improvements to scaling.
Also, lightning is not "The only proposed scaling method for bitcoin" (as that article claims) and there was no significant drop in the amount of money in lightning channels. The article based that claim on bad data, as they themselves hint: "some suggest\[ed\] this was just a reporting error...a client upgrade may have led to Defipulse not tracking properly for a brief period." Moreover, Defipulse only tracks publicly available information self-reported by routing nodes on the lightning network. It does not track private channels, so it does not give a full picture of the amount of money staked on the lightning network.
Also, consider this claim: "Even without this drop, however, usage is down considerably to the point LN is pretty much irrelevant." They have no evidence to back their claim that LN usage is down. According to [these stats]( lightning is the fourth most popular payment method among Australian crypto users. Similar stats are reported by Bitrefill and Coingate. Apps like Foldapp (dot) com also continue to add new mainstream stores as partners and are gaining more attention to the lightning/bitcoin economy. All of these facts indicate that lightning usage continues to grow, and that the article you read is fake news.

You're wrong. \[\[EDIT: actually, I'm wrong, he's right. See [chalash's response to me]( The newly printed money is given to smaller banks, who, in return, agree to pay the federal reserve more than they borrowed at some point in the future. Thus, the federal reserve theoretically earns money from this exchange; the Fed gives the smaller banks new money now with the expectation that they will get it back later, plus interest.
One of the problems with this is, later never seems to come. When it comes time to pay up, the smaller banks often don't have the money they agreed to give back to the Fed, so the Fed kicks the can down the road by giving them even more new money in return for promises of even greater repayments later. In the meantime, the value of the loan is estimated at the amount the Fed will (supposedly) receive later, so it goes onto the federal reserve's balance sheet as a positive asset. ("We only paid $500, but we'll receive $700 when the payment comes due. So this loan contract is really worth $700. Put it on our balance sheet as an asset worth $700.")
Here is a chart of the growth of federal reserve's balance sheet since the repos started:  \[[source](
As you can see, there's a whole lot of money that hasn't been "eliminated the next day." And that doesn't include the amount they added this week (over $100 billion) because they only update that graph once per week. The total amount of loan contracts added to the federal reserve's balance sheet since the repos started, including expected interest payments, topped $400 billion two days ago, and they say they intend to keep printing more money -- and buying more loan contracts -- every night at least through Q1 of 2020.

Note: on [the twitter thread about this software]( by Joost Jager, who developed it, one person asked why anyone would pay for instant messaging when there are already free messaging apps all over the internet. This was my answer.
"This is infrastructure inversion. You're currently paying a monthly fee for internet access (which IS messaging) and you get bitcoin/lightning on top. In the future, you might just pay lightning nodes on a per-message basis for all data types, including money transfers."
You might not need to pay a monthly fee for internet access in the future. If the lightning network overtakes the internet as a more efficient/cheaper way to transmit messages, then you'll only need a connection to a lightning node through a mesh network. With that, you'll be able to use that connection for all the things you use the internet for today, but without a monthly fee. You'll just pay a few sats when you want to send someone a message or ping a website for information, and others will pay a few sats if they want to send a message to you.

Whatsat is a new text messaging app that uses bitcoin's lightning network to exchange messages instead of money. It is possibly the first third-layer application to be built on top of the LNP/BP stack (Lightning Network Protocol on Bitcoin Protocol). The lightning network is a good candidate for exchanging messages because it is already capable of routing bitcoin transaction data in a private, peer to peer way, and bitcoin data is already a form of text message. Whatsat works with the existing lightning network on the bitcoin testnet and leverages the built in capabilities that most up-to-date lightning nodes already support. What it adds is a new data type: instead of transmitting transaction data, it uses other lightning nodes to transmit a custom message to the recipient.
There is not currently any charge for exchanging messages over whatsat, but if usage grows, lightning nodes may begin charging money to route whatsat messages, creating a pay-per-message model. This could increase revenues for lightning node operators and potentially incentivize the development of special purpose mesh networks for privately transferring both money and messages to any lightning user -- separate from the internet and built on the LNP/BP stack. The future is bright! Test the software today.

Using bitcoin-purchased gift cards allows me to retain greater control of my money than if I used an easier bank card. Some of these gift card services offer very granular control over how much I put on the card, meaning that, at any given time, only $5 or so of my money is in the hands of a third party. To me, the upside -- which is full control of my monetary value -- outweighs the downside -- which is taking an intermediary step whenever I go to a store.
There is another notable inconvenience of gift cards: not every place that I'd like to buy stuff from offers gift cards that are purchasable on bitcoin-supportive gift card sites. This is limiting. Nonetheless, a sufficient number of general-purpose stores are on those sites that I still personally think the positives outweigh the negatives.
There is another important positive to using bitcoin-purchased gift cards. There are rather seamless ways to integrate them with existing payment terminals, which effectively allows third parties to make merchants accept bitcoin without the merchant knowing it. They just see the transaction as a gift card purchase, the but user's cell phone (and a third party service) handles the conversion from bitcoin-to-gift-card in the background. Most of this is only theoretically possible, not something that is currently happening in any app that I know of, but an example of what I am talking about would be a bitcoin wallet that automatically adds gift cards you purchase to Google Wallet. That would allow you to easily use bitcoin to pay for items at merchants about as quickly and easily as it is to use a bank card. And the merchant would have no idea it was even happening.

Bip125 means that "your node" won't send a doublespend to the miners. If your node was the only one that mattered, that would solve the doublespend problem. But your node is *not* the only one that matters. If someone else sends money to you and sends a doublespend to another node with bip125=true (or directly to a miner), then the doublespend can make it into a block, and you will be scammed.

Node operators tend to create payment channels to places that they intend to buy stuff from frequently. For example, in the future, you might set up payment channels with Starbucks, Walmart, and a fuel company. Then, you can send money to those places without paying a transaction fee, and other people can pay those companies through you. You earn a small routing fee for helping their transaction along.

You're correct about the first part. Blockchain does not rely on the internet though. It relies on users sending transactions to miners and miners sending blocks back to users. That's *usually* done through the internet, because of convenience and speed, but it doesn't have to be.

Extension blocks aren't a form of sidechain. They're similar to segwit, except on steroids. Segwit was very controversial and it merely moved signature data to a different part of the block. Extension blocks move some transactions to a block that only upgraded nodes can see. Old nodes don't see those transactions or those blocks. That would be very controversial in bitcoin because it would force many users to upgrade their software (and probably their hardware) in order to continue validating all transactions and blocks. Bitcoiners don't like being forced to do things, so a lot of people would refuse to run the software. And an upgrade like that can only go through if the majority of users opt in.

@_date: 2019-11-02 14:07:03
**Advantages of BTC/LN**
* BTC node software runs well on low-end hardware, which makes it inexpensive to fully verify the blockchain and ensure the integrity of your money
* BTC has the most secure blockchain
* BTC is the most popular digital money, accepted at more places than any other money except government money
* LN payments are instant 
* LN payments are nearly free
* LN has pretty good privacy
* LN scales linearly, offering *each user* 15+ transactions per second (that can be confusing to wrap your head around -- it's not 15 tps *for the whole network,* it's 15 tps *per user.* So *you* get 15+ transactions per second, and so does your friend Tim, and so does your brother Greg -- which means, if you three were the only three on the network, it would have a total TPS rate of more than 45 TPS. Linear scaling is amazing in a large network. There are already more than 4000 lightning nodes, which means the total TPS rate is more than 60,000 TPS)
**Disadvantages of BTC/LN**
* BTC wallets don't usually support LN, and the ones that do often present you with two different balances, making them feel like two different currencies
* BTC is hard to use privately (unless you use LN)
* BTC is still in beta and can result in loss of funds
* LN is even more in beta and can result in even higher likelihood of losing funds
* LN payments have a pretty high failure rate, especially for large amounts (failed payments don't cause loss of funds, but they're still annoying)
* LN isn't supported by as many merchants as regular BTC, resulting in a fragmented experience (making them feel -- again -- like two different currencies)
* LN has frequent upgrades via hard forks, which makes it hard on developers because they have to frequently retool their software to keep it working with the new codebase
**Advantages of BSV**
* There are none, but here are some of the ones they claim:
* They claim it has higher potential transactions per second than BTC (but that's false once you account for LN's linear growth in transactions per second)
* They claim it's good that it has turing-complete smart contracts (but I count that as a disadvantage -- see below)
* They claim it's good that it has a smaller, more nimble development team (but I count that as a disadvantage -- see below)
* They claim it's good that it has frequent "upgrades" via hard forks (but I count that as a disadvantage -- see above, where I counted this as a disadvantage of LN, and below, where I count this as a disadvantage of BSV)
- They claim it's good that lots of app data can be easily and cheaply stored on its blockchain (but I count that as a disadvantage -- see below)
**Disadvantages of BSV**
* BSV node software requires high-end hardware, it can't run on low-end hardware, making it expensive to fully verify the blockchain and ensure the integrity of your money
* BSV node software is thus mostly run by centralized corporations
* BSV thus basically forces you to trust centralized corporations for almost all information about your money, including whether you've received any
* BSV also basically forces you to trust centralized corporations to allow you to spend your money
* BSV's security is way too low. It has less than 2% of bitcoin's miners, but it continues to use the same mining algorithm. So any miner with more than 1% of bitcoin's hashrate can attack BSV with a 51% attack.
* BSV is very unpopular with crypto merchants, you can't use it almost anywhere
* BSV is frequently delisted from exchanges due to lack of interest from traders and high maintenance cost to keep it operational (as well as controversy -- some of the people leading the project are widely regarded as fraudsters)
* BSV has no equivalent to LN yet (but this is fixable now that BSV has second-layer support) so for now it's still limited to 10 minute payments
* BSV recently added support for turing-complete smart contracts, giving it a wider attack surface and more centralization, very similar to Ethereum (but this hasn't been a problem yet because BSV has too few users to actually make its blockchain grow significantly or develop significant dapps)
* BSV has a much smaller development team than bitcoin, meaning there are fewer eyes auditing the code for bugs
* BSV has frequent hard forks, which makes it hard on developers because they have to frequently retool their software to keep it working with the new codebase
* BSV allows developers to easily and cheaply add lots of app data to its blockchain, which increases its bloat and makes it more expensive to verify all blockchain data
* BSV is still in beta and can result in loss of funds
@_date: 2019-03-11 11:34:06
Here's an explanation of what's going on for those who aren't following Pierre on twitter.
BIP157 is a proposed code change to bitcoin core full nodes that does not affect any of the consensus rules. People can actually run BIP157 already in a fashion somewhat like an addon or a plugin. What it does is, it uses the blockchain already present on a full node to create things called "compact block filters," one for each block in the blockchain. The compact block filter is basically just a list of the addresses that got mentioned in that block. Certain types of light wallets -- Neutrino and Wasabi are the only ones I know of right now -- download these compact block filters from a full node running BIP157, and by doing so they can find out which blocks mention their wallet's addresses without downloading the full blockchain. Then they can request those blocks from another full node.
This allows light wallets to download all the information they need about their user's funds from the blockchain without revealing to any full node which addresses belong to their user. This is more private than most other SPV implementations, which basically just tell full nodes "These are all my user's addresses, can you send me any blocks that have those addresses in them?" Getting information this way is less private than using BIP157 but it is also what most light wallets do (and it uses less bandwidth).
Pierre wants to make BIP157 a built-in part of bitcoin core instead of an addon, that way basically all full nodes will run BIP157. Right now, very few full nodes run BIP157. Consequently, if you run a light wallet like Neutrino or Wasabi, you're relying on help from a rather small group of full nodes. We could be more trustless and more decentralized if more nodes ran BIP157, so that's what Pierre's pushing for.
What's he's stating in this tweet is that if BIP157 isn't integrated into the most popular implementation of Bitcoin Core, he'll create a fork of Bitcoin Core that will stay in sync with the standard one but which includes BIP157 as a built in part. Presumably, he would starting using his fork as the software repository for his Node Launcher software, which helps people set up full nodes. That way, anyone using his software would get a (nearly) identical copy of the *real* Bitcoin Core, except it would come with BIP157 included. This would increase the number of people running BIP157 as part of Bitcoin Core (or a piece of software nearly identical to it and in sync with it).

Even with bitcoin's onchain payments, you need to be online to send payments and you need to be online to check if you've received a payment. I don't understand why it's such a dealbreaker that you've got to be online to receive a payment in lightning. Does he think a bunch of merchants are sitting there giving out products because someone told them "I sent you a payment, trust me" and they haven't checked? Because if you can check, that means you've got internet, so you can use lightning. Or is he concerned that normal people won't be able to receive micropayments during chance encounters at places with no wifi? The slightest bit of preparation solves this problem: if you're going to meet someone to get paid for something, make sure you can get online when you're there. The only scenarios I can think of where you can't make sure of that ahead of time are if you didn't know you were going to get paid, i.e. a chance encounter where you had no idea ahead of time that you were going to do something that you need to get paid for, and you can't contact the person later. But how often does that happen? Should we really throw out lightning because 0.5% of the time, you'll be in a chance scenario where it would suddenly be nice to get paid for something but there's no wifi?

There aren't a whole lot of legit websites that give bitcoin payouts for little tasks, and the legit websites tend not to stick around for that long. But here are a couple of options that currently work:
- [Kriptode Sats for Likes]( -- pays you satoshis (small amounts of bitcoin) over the lightning network for tasks that are mostly related to social media promotion; liking, retweeting, 5-star reviews, etc. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [Stakwork]( -- every couple of days they upload new tasks that you can complete to earn satoshis (sats) over the lightning network. So far the tasks are all related to typing out the writing on pictures of nutrition labels. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [LNtxbot Sats4Ads]( -- this is a chatbot on Telegram which will pay you sats over the lightning network to view ads served to you by other chatbot users. Supports text ads and graphics. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [Zap Read]( -- on this bitcoin-powered social networking site, which is similar to Reddit, users can only "like" your content if they pay you sats over the lightning network. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [Ln Pay]( -- this free service lets you charge people money to view your blog posts, podcasts, videos, or other web content. Set up a paywall and send the link to others. Then they need to pay you sats over the lightning network to view your content. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [Yalls.org]( -- this paywall service is for blog posts only, and you need to have a full lightning node. You can give viewers a free preview of your content, but then they have to pay you to read the rest. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount. There's also a clone of Yalls called [Satoshi's Club](
- [Bitcoin4Photos]( -- this stock photo site lets you upload your own stock photography for free and sell them for bitcoins. Uploading photos is free. You can withdraw your earnings to a bitcoin lightning wallet at any time, there is no minimum amount.
- [Joinmarket]( -- this is an open source bitcoin wallet focused on privacy. If you already have some bitcoins, you can stake them on Joinmarket and make them available for coinjoins, which is a way of comingling several people's transactions together so that you don't know who's paying whom. You can charge a fee and set the wallet to run coinjoins for you in the background. If you do that, and if you put a few hundred dollars on there, you can expect to make a few hundred sats every few days.
- [Bisq]( -- this is bitcoin's largest decentralized exchange. If you already have some bitcoins, you can stake them on Bisq and make them available for people to buy at a slightly-above-market rate, and use your profits to buy more bitcoins. This service essentially lets you get paid to allow other people to buy bitcoins from you without providing their personal info to a centralized exchange.
- [BTCPay]( -- this is a decentralized payment processor. It has free integrations with Wordpress and Woocommerce, allowing you to set up a website and start selling stuff for bitcoins. Retail stores can also install it for use at the cash register.
Good luck earning your own bitcoins! Even if you start with the smaller tools, you can gradually accumulate bitcoins until you're ready to use the more complicated tools.

Yes, I do think that is possible in theory, but I think it needs protocols that are still being worked on. It would be pretty easy to make a centralized version of memocash, but making it decentralized and uncensorable is the hard part. The main thing I see that's missing is some method for decentralized storage of prior posts with on-demand access. We're not going to put all that data on the blockchain like memocash does, so where do we put it? Whatsat provides interactive messaging but no storage. [Storm]( allegedly allows decentralized storage via the lightning network (as well as non-interactive messaging, like email), but right now it's only a concept, I'm not aware of any actual implementations.

For one thing, Resilio Sync is proprietary, whatsat is open source.


What the lightning network adds is an incentive for people to join the network as routing nodes (the incentive is stacking sats), which should make the network faster, more distributed, and bring in fee competition to drive routing prices lower. Theoretically, this could be built out so that anyone could sell access to the internet (or their own files) to anyone else -- even if that other person had no other way of accessing the internet -- at a seller-defined rate of some amount of sats per gigabyte.


I totally agree. It needs to be available by app, by web, and at the edges of the world through meshnets and ham radio.

If your money is in a non-private address, there are several ways to regain your privacy. This is especially important if you want to regain your privacy after reusing an address or sending your money to an address from a service that has your identity, such as an exchange.
One way to regain your privacy if your money is in a non-private address is to start using a lightning wallet. The lightning network completely anonymizes your expenditures -- no one on the network can know to whom you sent money or how much you sent. You can even send all your money to yourself at a new onchain address by opening a second lightning channel with a different counterparty and sending all your money into that new channel via one or more lightning transactions. If you do this, your money will appear to remain in your original channel until you or your counterparty closes that channel, at which time it will go into your original counterparty's address. No one can know that an equivalent amount first went into a new channel belonging to you. You can then close your new channel at any time to get your money back on the blockchain in a fresh, new, address with no prior history for blockchain analysts to track. Lightning is thus a fast, secure, and fully decentralized way to completely regain your privacy.
Another way to regain your privacy is by using Wasabi Wallet or Joinmarket Wallet to send your funds to a fresh, new address that no one has ever seen before. Since these mixer wallets are both completely decentralized, no one on the bitcoin network except you can know what address your money went into -- not the wallet makers, and not even the other participants in the mix (well, unless all the other participants are colluding together AND managed to get you and you alone to unwittingly mix with them). Analysts, if they are trying to track you, can only know that your money is in one or more of the addresses that received money from the mixing transaction, but they can't know which address in particular. Thus, the more participants there are in the mix, the more it makes the trail go completely cold.
@_date: 2019-03-03 01:41:55
Yes you can, I do it all the time. Underneath the "Buy" and "Sell" buttons and the "About" textbox there's a "Withdraw Bitcoin" button. You simply put in a valid Bitcoin address (doesn't support bech32 addresses yet, unfortunately) and you can withdraw your bitcoins instantly at no cost.

Sometimes. If your counterparty is online there's no delay beyond the standard block time of about 10 minutes per block. If your counterparty goes offline and you want to close the channel while he's offline, you can force-close the channel. Force-close transactions are timelocked, typically for 2 weeks. No one can take your money during those two weeks, because no one has your private key, but the timelock allows time for your counterparty to come back and potentially work with you to start the channel again (or force-close it faster). Also, if you tried to cheat while your counterparty was offline and broadcast an old channel state, the timelock would allow him time to see your cheating attempt and broadcast the real channel state.

Agreed, thank you for the correction. It is also important to point out that a whole truckload of bitcoin wallets don't even use bloom filters -- they just ask blockchain.com or various similar websites to tell them how much money is in their addresses. This is faster and less bandwidthy than any other SPV implementation, but it's also the *least* private and most risky option, other than using a completely custodial wallet.

No. Scaling up the technology isn't a priority until the technology is secure, stable, and private. Scaling now would mean getting everyone to run light wallets on their cell phones and desktops, connecting to a comparatively small network of full nodes trying their hardest to keep the network secure. In that environment, it is easy to attack light wallets using techniques such as hard forks and SPV attacks. We don't want to scale when that would put most users at risk. Secure scaling will mean everyone will have full nodes (maybe on their internet routers?) and we shouldn't try to make that happen when the software is in its current incomplete state, because people will only upgrade their full nodes as often as they upgrade their routers (i.e. like two times in their life). Scaling securely now would massively reduce bitcoin's upgradeability and completely ossify the protocol in its current, unfinished state. Scaling now is a terrible idea.

@_date: 2019-11-05 22:57:51
No, because it's hard to agree on what counts as decentralized. It's a sliding scale, not an on-off switch. One important measure of decentralization is the number of full nodes running on the network.
\- BTC has 60,000 full nodes  
\- ETH has 12,000  
\- BCH has 1,800  
\- BSV has 500  
\- LTC has 100
At what point do you say, "Okay, enough people are running this software that no one can easily shut down the network, therefore it's decentralized"? Some people might say 1,000 nodes is enough, others might say 10,000, and others 50,000.
But it's even more complicated than that. A large number of BTC nodes don't actually hold any money on them, so those nodes aren't actually contributing to consensus by protecting people's money, they're just gathering data for block explorers and analysis companies. If you're one of the people who says 50,000 "contributing" nodes is the magic number, then you might conclude that bitcoin itself is too centralized, because there are more than 10,000 bitcoin nodes that only \*measure\* consensus without \*contributing to\* it. Also, most ETH nodes are run by one company, Infura, who runs them on corporate infrastructure as a service for ethereum developers. So that sort of makes the majority of ETH nodes count as just one large node. It's all very nuanced and not clear what counts as decentralized, and different people make different judgments about what blockchains they think "count" as decentralized. That's why there's no obvious website that everyone agrees on.

Yes, because if you use an xpub your script can generate new addresses without having them all in a plaintext array. You'll still need a script to iterate address generation, though. And that's also a more complicated script; an array with a "for" loop is something any script kiddy like me can audit. Xpub scripts are a bit more esoteric.

The first time I heard their use suggested was during the scaling debate that ended in 2017. Extension blocks were proposed as a way to add more transaction capacity without a hard fork. If it had been implemented, miners would choose whether to put transactions in a normal block or an extension block, and then send all blocks to the network for validation. Upgraded nodes would validate every block; unupgraded nodes would only be sent normal blocks, they wouldn't see the extension blocks, so they would think there were still a bunch of transactions awaiting confirmation. As long as the majority of nodes were upgraded, though, it shouldn't cause a network split.
Extension blocks are interesting because they allow you to add almost any feature to the network without a hard fork or a network split (as long as the majority upgrades). We could add greater privacy protections in extension blocks, or turing complete scripts, or a lottery game -- whatever the majority wants. Right now, though, the majority of node operators -- myself included -- don't want extension blocks, despite the benefits they could bring. The downsides are too much right now, in my opinion.
Extension blocks are theoretically useful as a method for deploying features that can't be soft forked in under the current development framework. But features that don't fit in the current framework are (almost) necessarily more complicated than the stuff that works for bitcoin today, and those added complications would introduce significant risks, such as more bugs and more edge cases. Testing risky features is not a bad thing, but it's not something we should do in Bitcoin Core, in my opinion. Instead, I think we should test stuff on sidechains, altcoins, testnets, and bitcoin-based apps like the Lightning Network or Etleneum.
One more point: more complicated software also means more expensive hardware, and bitcoiners typically want to keep node costs low so that anyone can run a node. Ensuring that anyone can run a node is good for decentralization. The more complicated the code gets, the more centralized the network gets. So, for now, I personally don't want to see extension blocks in bitcoin. But I'm just one voice in this -- if you want extension blocks, I recommend you start running a node and learn how to configure it. Once you do that, you can add the features you want to support by means of software patches. If the majority of users add a soft fork, that means it's part of the network by consensus of nodes. So go for it! If you do, I bet you'll gain some firsthand appreciation for why node operators tend to see a lot of downsides in complicated software.

The sale you described is already like 98% efficient. Optimizing for the last 2% is probably not necessary.
That said, the contract itself can be defined as a token whose transfer (via the signature of both parties) represents the transfer of ownership in the real world. You can do some interesting things with that. Before signing the contract, both parties could create a multisig address together that has two spending parameters: first, a timelock parameter says that if the parties don't cosign to move the funds within 30 days, the buyer can move the funds out on his own. Second, a multisig parameter says that if both parties do sign, they can move the funds out immediately. Once the multisig address is created, the buyer could put enough money in it to buy the house. Now they've got 30 days to complete the deal, and if they don't complete the deal, then the buyer can recover his money at the end of those 30 days.
At that point, instead of signing the contract with a pen, the two parties could sign with digital signatures, where each signature also signs a transaction that immediately moves the funds from the multisig address to one of the recipient's addresses. That way, the signatures that transfer the funds are atomically tied to the signatures that transfer ownership of the house. The one can't happen without the other.

I'm probably a bad person to ask because I didn't develop this and I know very little about protocol development in general. But it is my understanding that the lightning network is currently very vulnerable to DoS attacks and that part of the reason for this is because, by default, nodes tend to charge nothing (or next to nothing) to route messages. Perhaps nodes will have to learn to increase their rates if there is evidence of a DoS attack against them. But I really don't know if I'm even thinking of this in the right way, it's way out of my depth.

Not necessarily. The user might send it to a couple of swap services. Such a payment would be turned into an onchain payment and then sent to another lightning node before finally reaching its destination. This can all be done trustlessly through services like Radar Redshift, submarineswaps.org, and Lightning Loop. If services like these are used, the exchange cannot know whether or not the recipient node belongs to their user.

- Your privacy is improved
- You don't need to be 18
- Or a citizen
- Or a person (bots can hold their own money now! No bank account needed!)
- You don't need good credit (yay for the homeless, and people in Section 8 housing, and anyone in a poor country, and single moms, and deadbeats who want a fresh start)
- Cross-border payments are faster and cheaper
- Domestic settlement is faster and cheaper too in most countries, but Europe is a big exception (at least for small "Average Joe" amounts)
- Merchants don't have to pay a processing fee, which should eventually result in slightly lower prices for consumers
- You can stake your money on Joinmarket or Lightning and generate passive income without risking any loss of funds
- You and your apps are safe from being deplatformed
- That's because of something called "permissionless innovation" -- a world-changing concept even by itself

Here's an idea that I tried to implement recently, but my hard drive crashed and I lost all my work:
The idea is for an ad company that pays website owners some sats for displaying ads. Ad creators upload banner ads to the ad company and send a payment of 11k sats with it. 1k of those sats are kept by the ad company as profit; the remaining 10k sats enter a payout pool specific to that ad. Anyone can create an account, copy a script for displaying banner ads, and run that script on their website. The ad company transfers a sat from the payout pool of whatever ad most recently got displayed on the ad displayer's website to the ad displayer's account. Ad displayers can withdraw the sats they've earned at any time. If an ad's payment pool is about to run out of money, an email is sent to the ad creator prompting them to ad some more sats if they want to keep their ad operational (and maybe giving them some metrics like what websites their ad was displayed on, with options to continue advertising on that website or not).

Yeah, something equivalent to this is already in the works. Rusty Russell gave a talk about it at the LNConf in Berlin last month. He took inspiration from a nonstandard protocol called lnurl which has support in about 4 lightning wallets. Lnurl allows users to create a payment code (which can be represented as either text or a qr code) which compatible wallets recognize as a url that they can look up on the web, and if they ping that url it will serve the wallet an invoice on the backend, so that the user never sees it -- they just scan a static qr code and up comes a dialog box saying "How many satoshis do you want to send to so-and-so?" Lnurl payment codes can then be printed out and stuck on business cards or wherever you want because they are essentially a way of encoding a static web address so that only compatible lightning wallets can decode it and know what to do with it.
Anyway, lnurl is pretty cool but Rusty's talk pointed out several ways it can be improved. For example, lnurl data is passed along in plaintext, which is bad for privacy, and messages are shared via html Get requests, which bypasses the lightning network's built-in messaging abilities. So in his talk he showed how we could create a better version of lnurl using lightning's built-in support for messaging, and then use that instead. For more info, Rusty's talk is available here on youtube: [

It was a question, not a statement. In other discussions about this topic I've seen two attempts to establish the existence of rights apart from them being a divine gift: society gives them to us or each individual creates their own rights by physically asserting them with their strength. Both result in terrible consequences -- oppression by the majority in the first case (because if society gives you your rights, then they can also take them away), or oppression by a tyrant (because if might makes right, then whoever's the strongest has all the rights). I thought your comment about the consequences of wrong nicknames might indicate a preference for "might makes right" because the conclusion I jumped to is that you think violence is to be expected if someone calls you the wrong nickname. Thankfully, it appears that's not what you meant.

Right now, it's not illegal in most countries to run a node, even though every node on the network processes all payments, even illegal ones. In most countries, there's an understanding that no \*particular\* node is needed to process illegal payments, and most node operators have no knowledge of where a payment originates or where it's going. Thus, you can't really place the blame on anyone over the simple fact that some of the transactions on the blockchain are (later) discovered to be illegal. So right now, it's totally legal to run a node.
If you're asking us whether or not the government will make that illegal in the future, we can't really predict that. It probably depends on where you are. Some governments will probably continue to use the above reasoning and will never ban bitcoin; others may feel threatened if a significant number of people abandon their national currency, and may start thinking differently and ban it. We can't really know.
If any government does ban bitcoin in the future, they hopefully won't apply that law retroactively -- that is, hopefully they'll give users plenty of time to turn off their nodes without facing legal consequences because they ran one in the past.

TLDR flops per second are not convertible into hashes per second so there's no way to tell how many hashes a supercomputer could do, but the answer is probably "very few," because supercomputer microchips are not designed for hashing.
Flop stands for "floating point operation," which is a type of math that is heavily used in 3d modelling, protein folding, hydrodynamic metrics, and other things that scientists need supercomputers for. Supercomputers optimize their cpus to bring them a high number of flops. Bitcoin mining does not use floating point operations, it uses hashing operations. Hashing is based on standard integers, not floating point numbers. So the number of flops that a computer can do is irrelevant to the number of hashes it can do; the two operations use different parts of the cpu, and supercomputers don't optimize for hashing, they optimize for flops. If anything, supercomputer makers would leave out any cpu circuitry that is designed for running hashing algorithms in order to make more room for circuitry that does floating point operations. Supercomputers can thus be expected to be capable of fewer hashes per second than a regular computer, let alone an asic.

The guy sent you 1.15870265, he did not send you 1.57457483. There was a total of 1.57457483 in the "from" addresses, and of that amount, 1.15870265 went to you, two amounts -- 0.24491393 and 0.17073218 -- went to other people (he probably sent you this money via an exchange, and they batched it with two other withdrawals), and 0.00022607 went to the miners as a fee.
The red arrow next to 0.24491393 and 0.17073218 indicates that those amounts have already been moved out of the addresses they were sent to. They've been spent. The recipients must have moved their money to other addresses. The little x next to 1.15870265 means that the money in your wallet has not moved since it got there. You haven't spent it yet.
The 0.00022607 does not show a "to" address because fees are not sent to miners in the same way as you and I might send money to each other; instead, the fee is what you get when you subtract the "to" amounts (1.15870265+0.24491393+0.17073218) from the "from" amount (1.57457483). The miners then mine the transaction, do some math, and take the difference as a fee.
The other issue is the price. The transaction was sent on Nov. 20 at 18:32:16 UTC. At that moment, the price of bitcoin was about $8123. So 1.15870265 bitcoins is what the OP should have received -- because, at the time, that was about $9.5k.

It sounds like we have complete agreement. The spammy nature of the current toy implementation seems to be very temporary. The devs I've talked to have all indicated support for this messaging thing with only minor-sounding fixes to get rid of the cludgy, spammy way it currently operates.


He probably doesn't know that it currently involves spam, and that will likely be fixed soon anyway. I think it's a non-issue even in the short term because it will probably be fixed while it's still in the testnet.

If the transaction hasn't confirmed yet you can try to use the Replace By Fee feature to get it back before it confirms. Wallets that support RBF include Electrum and Bitcoin Core. If the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain the only way you can get it back is by asking the address owner for a refund, if you can contact him. Creating a way for users to force an uncooperative refund after a payment has been confirmed would allow people to steal from others, which never solves anything; uncooperative refunds is one of the problems bitcoin is trying to solve.

Schnorr and Taproot are upcoming upgrades that help address these issues. Schnorr enables a transaction capacity increase of 40% or more by making transactions smaller and by building a foundation for signature aggregation (which reduces transaction sizes even further). Taproot helps with fungibility by hiding some information about the scripts used to create a transaction.
There's also ongoing scalability/fungibility work on bitcoin's second layer, the lightning network. Lightning payments are already faster than Visa payments and they help mask the identities of the sender and receiver from most third parties. An upcoming upgrade to the lightning network will also make it harder to detect amounts sent.


It's imprudent to insult your superiors, especially when they control the banhammer. Just because you're unfamiliar with bitcoin/lightning development right now doesn't mean it isn't happening. In fact, development on bitcoin moves faster than any other crypto project. I recommend subscribing to the weekly [Bitcoin Optech newsletter]( if you want to stay abreast of the latest updates to the core protocols. If you want to get updates when new products and services are built on top of bitcoin and lightning, I recommend listening to the podcasts mentioned in the menu of this subreddit. New products and services are often discussed on those podcasts when they come out.

Excellent points. I think the problem you've identified could be solved in the following manner. Let's say Barry sends a message to Harry, Jerry, and Larry. That costs 3 millisats. If all three of them reply before Barry sends his next message, great, he got his money back. But let's suppose Larry has not replied yet. Barry's client might be willing to send him up to 10 messages/millisats, but after that it requires reimbursement if he wants to continue receiving messages from Barry.
So instead of sending him more and more messages/millisats, it sends him a "last" message: "To continue interacting with me, you must either reply or pay this reimbursement request. [Insert payment request here.] Then you'll receive messages from me again, including a backlog of the messages you've missed." The chat client would be built to create/send/pay those reimbursement requests automatically (as long as they don't exceed the amount of sats received from the sender), and Larry can only try to cheat by modifying his client to not pay those reimbursement requests -- in which case, he just won't receive any more messages from the sender.

You can't use Paypal to instantly buy bitcoins at market price. If you could, scammers would buy some bitcoins and then reverse the Paypal transaction since you have up to a week or more to reverse any Paypal transaction. Bitcoin payments are irreversible, so this would be an open door for scammers to stack some sats for free.
What you're really asking for is a way to have your clients buy bitcoins for you without them necessarily knowing they're doing it. I can't personally think of a way to do this, and I believe most exchanges actively try to prevent people from buying bitcoins without filling out "know your customer" forms. It would be really bad UX to make your clients fill out a "know your customer" form before paying you. Thus, I don't know if there's an "easy way" to do what you want. I hope someone who knows more will answer with alternative options.

The cash register doesn't have any private keys on it so it can't send anything. The cashier might have a few satoshis on her personal mobile wallet, so she might give the robber that. He won't get anything from the cash register though.


Probably not. He probably leaves and hopes that the cashier is unable to RBF the funds back into her wallet. Maybe he steals her phone to make it harder on her and just hopes she doesn't have a backup.


Do you mean how do confirmations work? Or how does waiting work? I'm confused.


That's possible, or he could just hand the cashier a bitcoin address (possibly encoded as a qr code) and tell her to send all her money there.


No, a worker would not have access to the private keys to the restaurant's income. The restaurant's income would all go to a wallet kept by upper management, and the private keys would be stored in another location. The cash register should only be able to display bitcoin addresses which allow money to go into management's wallet.


If you want a refund, please send a handwritten letter with a bitcoin address where you want us to send the refund to.

Good questions! I haven't tried the software myself yet, but if you're willing to give it a whirl on the testnet we could try it together. On the Twitter thread, Bitconner says, "[it] would be cool to expand to messages of arbitrary length by using AMP," so that implies that there is a limit rn. DM me if you want to test its limits together. Regarding pics, I suppose if you can send text you can send data that can be rendered as a pic, but that would require a gui to decode the pic data and render it. Right now it looks like it's command-line only -- no gui, so no pics for now.

I'm not a core protocol developer, nor did I develop this whatsat project, so I'm a bad person to ask. Consider reaching out to Joost Jager on twitter:  
But it is my understanding that the lightning network is subject to a variety of privacy attacks. If a network-level attacker is able to examine global internet traffic, they can identify the sender and recipient of a message that is sent via the lightning network, but they can't decode the content. Outside of that, I'm not aware of any way for an attacker to identify the sender or the recipient.
Also, if you're sending a message that includes a payment, and there's an attacker who controls an intermediary node along the route to your recipient, it is currently possible for the attacker to use heuristics to make an educated guess about how much you're paying the recipient, but that attack (and the potential solutions to it) are not really relevant here because whatsat messages only transmit text, not payments.

If the chat clients are configured to log messages, Kerry can pay one of them to send him the logs and thus reconstruct the chat history as far back as he is willing to pay for. If that happens, people might start storing data in these chatrooms, and/or create special purpose chatrooms designed for data storage. People with extra storage on their computers could go to those specialized rooms and get paid to host data.

Yes, they talked about it at the LNConf last month. The plan is to release it in three stages: the first stage is MPP (multipath payments), which is a version where the merchant has the option to give you your product even if they haven't received the full payment. The next stage is AMP, which is a version where the merchant does not receive anything unless the full payment goes through. Then there is a third stage which is an optimized version of that that uses less data (by swapping out hash-based AMP for points and scalars). The third stage won't arrive until after Eltoo and Schnorr, which are not guaranteed to be implemented, so the third stage will wait a while.
Preparations for MPP have been coming steady in the latest builds of LND. The release notes occasionally mention things like "We added this or removed that to prepare for multipath payments in an upcoming version." For example, in the latest release -- 0.8.0 -- they talk about a messaging format called "type-length-value" and mentioned: "The largest impact of this new feature is to lay the groundwork for the AMP/MPP work that has begun."

Yes. Anyone who has bitcoins on their phone or computer can send them to a hardware wallet.


Slight correction: wallets do not register themselves on the blockchain. An address is valid if it is created in accord with bitcoin's rules; a device only has to be able to do math to create a valid address, and a hardware wallet can do math. It can create a valid address, and if someone sends money to that address, it doesn't have to be "registered" anywhere; the math checks out, so it goes through. But you're on the right track -- hardware wallets cannot send money *out of* their address unless they somehow get that transaction onto the internet. Transactions are made of simple text, so there are several ways to do this; some hardware wallets display a QR code which you scan using a camera on your phone or PC and then let your phone send it to the bitcoin network. Others have a way of plugging into a computer or use bluetooth.


There's a one in a billion quadrillion zillion chance of that happening, but technically, yes, it's possible.

Yeah that would be awesome. BTW I'm not a developer on the whatsat project, I just saw a post about it on twitter and decided to talk about it here on reddit as well.
That said, it's pretty dope that RSK is working on decentralized storage. There are a few interesting decentralized storage options out there; IPFS is neat, but I'm not aware of any way (currently) to pay via lightning to upload/download files to/from IPFS nodes.
The folks over at [Defiads]( have built an implementation of "side memory" for the bitcoin blockchain, and side memory is a decentralized way to pay a fee (in bitcoins) to upload/download data to a decentralized network of file storers. However, the "memory" in that case is volatile memory, meaning the space allocated for your files can be re-allocated to someone else if they pay a higher fee than you did, and if that happens, your files will be deleted. So it's not really fit for use in a social networking context, where posts need to be available indefinitely. (The defiads folks are planning to use their platform for a network of limited-time advertisements, where it's okay if the files are deleted once someone else makes a higher bid for the memory slot.)
There are also altcoin blockchains with lots of space allocated for memory, including bcash, ethereum, filecoin, and storj, but those projects are all centralized and are really in danger of disappearing in the short to medium term. I have similar fears about RSK. It's true that it's the most secure platform for dapps, and it's great that its token is pegged to bitcoin, but I fear that they've essentially adopted some of the fundamental problems with ethereum. It's a fundamentally bad idea to put lots of data on the blockchain, but it looks like doing so is core to the way the RSK platform works, and I don't see how it can remain decentralized in the longterm. It may take longer to fall than ethereum, but that's only because fewer people are using it.
In short I think that decentralized storage is an unsolved problem. There are several interesting projects, and right now I am most interested in IPFS and Storm, but we'll see what happens. I don't think this problem will be solved in the next twelve months, I'll say that.

@_date: 2019-11-14 12:10:35


It's occasionally discussed.


Yes, there are several projects that do that. Sidechains like Liquid and Rootstock also take in bitcoins and give you a token representing BTC. One of the main differences is, in both of those projects, the custodian is a multisig federation of 20+ well-known bitcoin companies (exchanges and payment processors, mostly). On Eth, the custodian is just Bitgo. That makes it a lot more centralized and risky.


Because they trust BitGo and want access to Compound. Compound is another centralized project; they don't do KYC but they let you entrust your crypto to them as collateral in return for a loan, often in stablecoins, which you can then use to buy more bitcoins. It's a way to add leverage to your bitcoins without registering with a trading platform and doing KYC. But it's also a lot more risky because of all the custodians involved, and because it runs on Eth, which is already centralized and essentially run by a company called Consensys.


Well, no, not really. Wrapped bitcoins have a 1:1 peg with the bitcoins that Bitgo has in custody, so in an economic sense there's no additional currency in circulation. Not unless Bitgo starts doing fractional reserve.

I want to see this chat service combined with one of those nifty meshnet devices so you can chat with other lightning users via someone else's internet (with your gateway node taking a small X-satoshis-per-megabyte fee of course). Then I want to see those gateway nodes add an http-to-lightning service. You message your gateway with a message like "curl  and it returns the the text of that file, and it's incentivized to do so because of the fee.

Second, a block could onboard 4 million people without needing 4 million inputs.

Not every output needs to go to an individual; multi-party lightning nodes can take 1 input and use it to create trustless HTLCs for hundreds of people.

If two people can talk then three or more people can talk together too. Here's one way to do it:
Let's say we've got Barry, Harry, and Jerry. Barry and Harry are already chatting. Now it's time for Jerry to join. Either Barry or Harry tells the other one, "Here's Jerry's pubkey. Make sure you send him a copy of all your outgoing messages." And he also tells Jerry, "Here are the pubkeys for everyone who is currently in the chat. Make sure you send a copy of all your outgoing messages to each of us." Now let's add a fourth person: Larry. One of the participants just needs to send a message to the others saying, "Here's Larry's pubkey. Make sure all outgoing messages include Larry." And tell Larry, "Here are the pubkeys for everyone who is currently in the chat. Make sure you send a copy of all your outgoing messages to each of us."
By this method, you can add any number of additional people to an ongoing chat. It would be theoretically easy to create a version of Whatsat that does this automatically. As long as all participants used a group chat version of Whatsat, it should work.

We can't give you a decent answer unless you tell us the name of the colored coin token you're talking about. "Colored coins" are custom tokens whose transfer is paid for with bitcoin. The "coloring" refers to custom metadata which must be sent between wallets whenever a transfer of the token is made so that it can be identified -- otherwise the recipient wallet just sees it as "regular bitcoin." No wallet can support all potential colored coin tokens because they can't know in advance what type of custom data is involved, or how to recognize it, or what to do with it. That stuff has to be added on a case by case basis.

Note that in order to send bitcoins "out" of CashApp you'll need to use the Withdraw button. There is no standard "send" button in CashApp like normal bitcoins wallets have, but the Withdraw button does the same thing  -- you don't need to withdraw all your bitcoins, you can just say "withdraw 0.00045631 to address 3xyz123abc etc.

One major difference is that bitcoin makes it easy for the average user to run the rules he or she wants, in the form of a full node. In other projects, such as ethereum or bch, the constant hard forks and larger requirements for bandwidth, storage, and cpu usage make it hard for average consumers to run a node, so they just use wallets that "trust" a node operator. Node operators are thus more centralized, and they tend to gravitate around an even more centralized focal point (the ethereum foundation in ethereum and bitcoin.com -- the company -- in bcash). In such an environment, it's harder for users to "just choose" the rules they want -- there are incentives that lead them to follow the centralized foundations because they control or have heavy influence on the economic majority of nodes.

TLDR: it just got tons easier for wallet developers to support advanced features like timelocks, secret passwords, and multisignature trees. (Like: you can only move money from this address if the branch manager cosigns with another worker, or if the vice-president signs on his own after 30 days, or if you have the secret password.) Bitcoin Script now has a higher-level language (Miniscript) that can turn easily-readable code into Bitcoin Script. Miniscript also works very easily with javascript, Rust, and C++. This is big news; ethereum has had stuff like this for years, which is why it attracts many novice developers. Bitcoin now has a counteroffer.

Option A) Ask your employer to pay you in bitcoin.
Option B) Sign up for Bitwage. Tell your employer you've changed banks and give them the direct deposit number Bitwage provides. When money from your employer comes to Bitwage's account, they'll give you the equivalent amount in bitcoins. (It's not anonymous though; Bitwage follows the USA's Know-Your-Customer laws.)
Option C) Get a paycheck instead of direct deposit, cash the paycheck at walmart, turn the cash into bitcoins at coinstar or another bitcoin atm, or use a site like craigslist or localbitcoins to find someone near you who will give you bitcoins in exchange for your cash.


Option A) You can buy vanilla visa gift cards from egifter:  (anonymous to visa; not anonymous to egifter).
Option B) You can also get them from amazon:  -- amazon doesn't yet support bitcoin natively, but you can use purse.io and/or the moon extension for google chrome to pay with bitcoin (anonymous to visa; not anonymous to amazon).
Option C) Instead of using a visa card, buy merchant-specific gift cards from anonymous sellers like foldapp.com, bitrefill.com, and coincards.com. You can get gift cards for many common places like walmart and target, but these still aren't quite as good as a visa gift card -- except they're fully anonymous. Then you can just buy a vanilla visa card for the few remaining places that aren't on the websites of the anonymous gift card companies.

Lightning supports something called "hodl invoices," which is where you send a payment to someone through an intermediary, and that intermediary (or the recipient himself) can choose to temporarily delay your payment until goods have been delivered or else cause the payment to fail altogether (also, the sender or the receiver can set a time limit on the payment, after which it will fail automatically if it's still being "hodled"). This feature can be used to effectively recreate an escrow scenario. Note that "hodl invoice" intermediaries do not hold your actual money, they can merely delay payments or cause them to fail.

For me, bitcoin is already better than any alternative payment method, regardless of bitcoin's price. If I was forced to cash out and go back to using my bank, I would miss bitcoin's consistency, uptime, security, privacy, the freedom it brings, and the fact that -- with bitcoin -- I get full control over my money, with no risk of confiscation or of vaguely defined and unforeseen fees. Also, due to the ongoing work on improving the lightning network, bitcoin is sometimes faster than my bank card when it comes to making payments. So long as bitcoin continues to function as it currently does, I see no reason to "cash out" even if the price remains at current levels forever.

4. Write a recurring shell script that executes the "pay" command every 30 days (make sure it's paying to the right address, or use the "curl" command to automatically get a new address every time)

Pretty smart analysis, but I have five counterpoints:
1. It doesn't matter who Satoshi was
2. Why spoil what Satoshi tried so hard to keep unspoiled? (his privacy)
3. Bitcoin was really a group effort all along because (see the next two points)
4. It was based on the prior technologies cited in the whitepaper (not developed in a vacuum)
5. And when Bitcoin was released more devs immediately started to improve the code
We'll likely never know who wore the Satoshi mask, but the bitcoin we have today came from many early contributors and precursors. Hal is certainly included, but so are Adam Back, Peter Todd, and Nick Szabo, all of whom still work on bitcoin to this day.

How is that in any way like what we have with banks? Banks "let you" create an account on their terms. LN is an open source app. Banks require your identity for every account. With LN you just hit "create wallet." Banks decide who you can send money to. On LN you decide who to send money to. Banks hold your money for you. On LN you hold your own money. Banks can view your transaction history and share it with corps and govs. On LN your peers have no idea who the sender is, who the recipient is, or how much you sent them. Staying permanently in LN has nothing in common with banks.


That's not new. Before bitcoin existed, there were cryptocurrencies that did not have miners -- namely, all of them. Egold had no miners. Digicash had no miners. Hashcash had no miners. All the current Proof of Stake proposals do is recycle those old ideas: "instead of confirming transactions with a decentralized network of anyone-who-wants-to, let's just have the biggest holders do it!" This creates a black hole of centralization as the biggest holders collect the biggest rewards and thus become even bigger holders, gaining even greater control over the network. This is why we need miners and increased miner decentralization. (e.g. more mining by more people in more countries.)


They've tried. They've failed. Not a single PoS altcoin has done anything but get more and more centralized over time, because the PoS model rewards centralization. What you reward, you get more of.


That's not how bitcoin works. The miners work for the people running nodes. The people running nodes and using bitcoin are the ones who set the rules, if the miners break those rules they automatically get kicked off the network. And nodes (economic nodes, meaning nodes operated by people who use bitcoin) are free to download and run by anyone.

There are now ways to use the lightning network as a decentralized mixing service so that KYC services cannot discover your addresses. For example, you can create a lightning wallet, put bitcoins in a private channel, use loop-out to increase your inbound liquidity, and then use submarineswaps.org to receive money from exchanges. Submarineswaps.org generates a single-use address that does not belong to you; any funds sent to it trustlessly go to your lightning wallet. If you use this service when receiving from KYC services, they cannot find out what your addresses are.

It's not. Anyone can download a liquid node, which includes a wallet, and -- if you want a more user-friendly wallet -- Greenwallet is expected to add it as a supported blockchain any day now. If you want to use liquid, go right ahead.


Liquid is not instant. Liquid blocks come one minute apart. That's infinitely slower than lightning. But there are lightning implementations that support Liquid, so it's sort of moot at this point; if you use lightning, it is quite possible that your transactions are now going through Litecoin and Liquid and you wouldn't even know about it. The recipient receives whichever coin he chooses.


There's literally nothing wrong with that. But personally, I don't expect to do that, because there's a federation that controls Liquid token issuance, and I just think it's better to let an algorithm do that like bitcoin does.


That's the only difficulty, Liquid is so new there are only two wallet available for it: the Liquid node itself (which is primarily a command-line tool) and the c-lightning node, which requires you to run a Liquid node as well. I suppose you could also make Liquid paper wallets by generating them from a Liquid node, but still, that means that -- right now -- the only way to use Liquid is by running a command-line tool. When Greenwallet gets updated to support Liquid, the future you imagine will be easier.
But it will still probably be a lightning future, where everyone's using lightning, and many people anchor that to Liquid.

Fyi for those who are interested: even though exchanges have centralized databases (with the exception of some decentralized exchanges), transactions that happen on exchanges are another type of off-chain, layer two transaction.

Bitcoin will always support 1xxx addresses. When Satoshi created bitcoin, during the very first month of its existence he created the first address format and prefixed a 1 to signify that they were the first version of an address. Later, 2xxx addresses were created for testnet users to distinguish them from "real" bitcoin addresses. In 2013, 3xxx addresses were created, and their main new feature was/is that you can use them to encode any contract that is supported by bitcoin's scripting language. (This means you can use them with segwit, which is just a script that restructures the way signatures are handled.) However, it took years for all the exchanges and wallets to build out support for the new address format.
In 2017, a lot more experts were working on bitcoin and one of the things they found was that there were much more efficient address formats possible, including a type of address format -- the segwit address format -- where you could save up to 40% on fees, make it case-insensitive (which means it's easier to read aloud because you don't have to say whether it's a "capital X" or not), get perfect typo detection for up to 4 typos, support all the old features of 1xxx addresses and 3xxx addresses, and make it forward compatible with new features (like Schnorr and Taproot) in a robust way so that we shouldn't have to ever create a new address format again (nor go through these multi-year upgrade cycles).
This was why the segwit address format was invented, and it is so much better than 1xxx addresses and 3xxx addresses that a new prefix was created: bc1xxx -- and the intention is to make this the "default" address format for bitcoin moving forward. However, we do have to make it through one last upgrade cycle, but we are most of the way through it now -- almost everyone supports bc1xxx addresses (see a chart [here](
Anyway, I hope that's interesting to you, but the short answer to your question is: 1xxx addresses will be supported forever, but bc1xxx addresses are much better technologically.

I agree with your comments about making this a post of its own and that this is not talked about enough. This subreddit, in general, seems to alternate between price memes and highly technical posts that are of special interest to base-layer developers. Lightning has somewhat improved this, because it seems to be a second layer application that speaks to the general interests of bitcoiners. Nonetheless, some of the applications I mentioned above -- like stablecoins -- are of far less interest to bitcoiners because hardcore bitcoiners are aware that "stability" in any currency is paper thin. It collapses very quickly during economic turmoil, as we saw in 2008 and will likely see again during the next recession. Most bitcoiners want to see bitcoin become the open, standard, international currency -- not just collateral for a stablecoin pegged to a centralized national standard.
Regarding ethereum, I say ethereum is centralized because of poor decisions that were made by its early developers and which continue to be made by its current developers. The first awful centralizing decision they made was to create the network with millions of coins already premined and owned by a single foundation. Ever since that time, development has centralized around that foundation because developers want that "development fund" to be paid out to them. One consequence of this is that Vitalik and his team are able to ram decisions through even if ether users don't like it.
An ongoing example of this is EIP 2025, which is a proposal to skim rewards off of every block to feed them into the original development fund. Ether users (and especially miners) are strongly opposed to this theft -- but it's being railroaded through by Vitalik and co. because they control the development of ethereum as well as its economic foundations, and "normal" ether users are essentially incapable of running their own nodes to vote against the centralized decision-makers.
The inability of an average user to run a node is a consequence of Vitalik's early decision to have unlimited block sizes, 15 second blocks, and turing complete scripts. This has resulted in the ethereum blockchain growing massively beyond the ability of most people around the world to store. Moreover, the bandwidth requirements as well as the cpu usage mean that you have to have at least a gaming-level pc to run an ethereum full node, and it must be running and processing all the time in order to maintain synchronization. If you try to do that in your apartment or home office, you not only fill up a room with fan noise and waste heat (meaning most people will want a dedicated room for it, adding additional costs), but you also run the risk of ruining your machine because you're operating it like a constant-load webserver except in a far-from-ideal environment.
The only current solution -- if you can't afford a climate-controlled, dedicated room for your ethereum node -- is to run your node on cloud servers on the internet. This is what most ethereum developers do, which means that not only are "regular people" pushed out of the network infrastructure -- that would be centralizing enough -- but most nodes are run on centralized cloud servers, which is an additional element of centralization, but also of inefficiency -- because why run your dapp on a cloud-hosted ethereum network when you could just run it directly on the cloud servers that host the ethereum nodes?
In response to these centralizing concerns, which have plagued the network from the beginning, most ethereum devs have proposed scrapping the Ethereum 1.0 blockchain and starting a new one from scratch (Ethereum 2.0) which uses Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work. To me, this just shows that they are continuing to make the types of bad decisions that led to the current, centralized situation. Proof of Stake rewards centralization by giving all block rewards to people who have the most ether holdings, along with the right to add new blocks to the blockchain. This results in a black hole of centralization because it gives control of the network *and additional money* to whoever is the richest staker.
So yeah, ethereum is far too centralized to be the kind of network I would personally like to be a part of. I do admire some of the projects that have been built on ethereum -- like makerdao and uniswap -- but the platform they are running on is a joke. When those projects can be ported to bitcoin, things will be much better.

8MB would do terrible things to decentralization. It would increase block propagation times 8-fold, which would give an enormous advantage to the largest mining pools, since they have the fastest connectivity. Think of it this way: if small miners without the best internet speeds have to spend 30 seconds uploading their successful block to the internet, that's 30 seconds during which a larger miner can find and propagate a block. I.e. it's effectively a 5% reduction in the hashrate of smaller miners.

Bitcoin is not private by default. By default, all transactions are recorded on the blockchain; the sender's address and the recipient's address are clearly discernible, so if you want to track someone, all you need is some way to know their addresses (which, if you hold your money on an exchange, they know that, or if you withdraw from an exchange, they assume you withdraw to one of your own addresses).
There are tools for enhancing your privacy: Wasabi, Samourai Wallet, Joinmarket Wallet, lightning wallets, and Lightning Loop are all privacy-enhancing tools. Lightning Loop, in particular, enables near-perfect anonymity when sending bitcoins from a lightning wallet or receiving them into a lightning wallet. But you have to choose to educate yourself about how to use these tools, because bitcoin is not private by default.

I agree with most of what you write here, but I think there are use-cases for this. Users can have more than one wallet, and assuming you're the type of user who can't be online all the time, you could have a special wallet which uses long expirations for its invoices and maintains a channel with a lightning rod. You could then use that wallet to create invoices if you need to receive a payment but you're not sure precisely when and/or you may not be online when it arrives. So you use that special wallet to receive the payment, then -- the next time you get online -- you send it to your "normal" wallet. Voila! Lightning has become more useful because now you can receive payments non-custodially even when you're offline.

Let's say you want to send 8000 sats to Bob. Here are your instructions:
If Bob has a lightning wallet, then you should download a lightning wallet from the link above, send some bitcoins to it (say $5 for example), ask Bob for an 8000 sat invoice, and then copy that invoice into your wallet and hit "Send."
If Bob has a standard bitcoin wallet (with no lightning support), then you should download a wallet like Electrum, send some bitcoins to it (say $5 for example), ask Bob for an address, then copy Bob's address into your wallet, create a payment to Bob's address for 8000 sats, and hit "Send."

Paypal would be fine if it had the properties bitcoin has, like censorship resistance, permissionless programming, and independence from the government. Bitcoin has those features plus everything paypal has, except on second layers.
If you want to be able to reverse a transaction if you don't get the product or service you paid for, you're going to need a middleman, either to custody the payment, or to resolve disputes. Within that paradigm, there are degrees of decentralization, with some services being completely centralized, and some at least trying to make things as decentralized as possible.

Their duty to punish crime does not give them a right to invade everyone's privacy. If they think someone has committed a crime, they can submit their evidence to a judge, ask for a warrant, and then do a search. That's the method that "We the People" gave them to track down criminals. Eavesdropping on everyone's income and recording all their payments is not a method we gave them, and they do not have a right to force everyone to reveal that information. On the contrary, you have a right to immunity from search and seizure, a right which the government may not invade without a warrant. It's not at all "logical" that your money should be "transparent." No more than it's logical that your house should be. You have a right to keep your belongings private, including your money, and the government does not have a right or a duty to invade that right without a warrant.

If the same entity runs 10k nodes it's no different from if they just ran 1 node. Their 10k nodes all act as one because it's one entity telling them all what to do. If the government's 10k nodes run the same rules as the rest of the network, then everything's fine and good. If those 10k nodes change a rule, that won't cause the rest of the network to follow them -- each node operator would have to go into his node and manually change the ruleset to match the government's nodes. And very few people would do that, so the government's rule-breaking nodes would just be ignored.

The word "stable" is relative. There are contexts where you can apply it to moving things if they "seem" not to be moving from your current perspective. E.g. the earth and sun are considered "stable" in some contexts, but the earth is whirling around the sun and the sun is whirling around the galaxy. When the term "stablecoin" is applied to a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the dollar, it's being used in this relative sense. The dollar's value does move, but from the perspective of those who use it as their regular unit of account, the movement is very subtle and -- to most -- not noticeable for years.

1. Not your keys, not your coins. In the wBTC arrangement, Bitgo takes your BTC and gives you a token whose value is pegged to bitcoin via a 1:1 issuance rate (for every bitcoin they receive, they issue 1 wBTC). Bitgo can refuse to return your bitcoins when you are ready to cash out, leaving you "stuck" on ethereum.
2. Bitgo and their partners control the "money printing" button. If they want to, they can print more wBTC than the number of bitcoins they've received. This would break the 1:1 peg and reduce the value of wBTC, but there are scenarios where they might think it's worth it (e.g. they could print it for themselves, claim it was a bug or a hack, all while sending it anonymously through an exchange for other money).
3. Your money is no longer secured by bitcoin's blockchain. WBTC tokens are secured by the ethereum blockchain, which is [far less secure](
4. Ethereum is centralized. Most of the nodes run on cloud infrastructure and most of the development is funded and/or controlled and/or heavily influenced by the folks at the Ethereum foundation.
5. As Colin Harper [puts it]( "\[wBTC\]  offers...centralization with \[extra\] steps...instead of submitting your coins to the custody of a centralized exchange, you’re putting them in custody with a separate company and *then* using the tokens of credit this company gives you."

Use a script address -- the 3xxxx kind -- and ensure that the script it encodes is null. It's impossible to create a script that satisfies the script "null" and returns as valid, therefore any coins sent to that address can never be spent. And if anyone asks for proof that the address really corresponds to a null script, you can prove that by showing them the null script, hashing it, and going through the steps to turn that hash into a script address.

Most of the things I highlighted are developer tools, which are not meant to be user-facing. They are meant to allow developers to create the kinds of financial apps that users are asking for, and that's what brings in new users; not the tools directly, but the new things that can be built with them. For example, look at four of the top apps of the  meme -- makerdao, compound, uniswap, and augur.
What does makerdao let you do? Issue stablecoin tokens. These stablecoin tokens are limited only by the amount of collateral put into them and the underlying blockchain they run on -- which, in makerdao's case, is ethereum. In bitcoin, stablecoins have traditionally been issued on the omni layer (tether being the best known example), which means they function as colored coins. These stablecoins inherit limitations such as, at minimum, 10 minute transaction times (and they're usually much slower than that because omni issuers usually batch transactions together in order to reduce fees).
But the new colored coins protocol, RGB, will allow bitcoiners to issue stablecoin tokens with the underlying properties of the lightning network, meaning instant settlement, basically for free. A stablecoin with instant settlement and negligible transaction fees? That sounds a lot more attractive than "RGB colored coins" doesn't it?
It even sounds more attractive than makerdao stablecoins, because the biggest problem with makerdao is the insecurity and centralized nature of the underlying blockchain -- and that won't be a problem if the underlying blockchain is simply switched to bitcoin. (Plus makerdao tokens still have 15 second average transaction times and high fees in times of network congestion; the lightning network is instant and has low fees all the time.)
Now let's look at compound, which lets you lend out your crypto at interest. That brings in more users, right? Because it's passive income. Well, the way this has traditionally been done in bitcoin is with apps like Abra and Blockfi, where you entrust your coins to the lender and he/she splits the earnings with you.
But now, better multisig tools are in development: PSBTs, miniscript, and musig will let developers build apps where users can interact with each other's wallets without giving up their keys. This will allow developers to program a more flexible microlending tool than what's possible today.
So what happens when someone makes an app where your bitcoins are your collateral and the lending instrument is an RGB stablecoin? Now the lender gets passive income and the borrower gets a stable currency with instant settlement. Sounds like it could bring in lots of users, huh? But that's only possible because of the developer tools I highlighted above. (Meaning, it's not YET possible, because not all of those tools are available yet, so no one has made lending apps that leverage those tools.)
Now let's look at uniswap, which is a decentralized exchange (or DEX) -- at least "decentralized" insofar as ethereum is decentralized, which means, not very. Users want that, right? Because it means they don't have to give all their personal details to corporations. 
Well, bitcoin-based DEXes based on today's escrow technology include things like Bisq and HodlHodl, but the latest lightning features allow for major improvements. HodlHodl only supports lightning today through a custodial solution that bypasses decentralized escrow, but recently, LND and C-lightning both integrated the hodl invoices feature, which can be used to autocancel a lightning payment if the recipient of the payment doesn't complete the exchange. Meaning decentralized escrow can now be done on lightning.
Atomic swaps are another way to build decentralized DEXes on bitcoin, and we're already seeing some exchange startups integrate atomic swaps, including SparkSwap and submarineswaps.org. Bitcoin's DEX platforms will bring in new users too, so there's huge promise there.
Finally let's look at augur, which is a (theoretically) decentralized platform for futures contracts, including massively lucrative things like betting, but also more mainstream-but-still-lucrative things like insurance. Like everything else on ethereum, it's limited by the problems of the underlying blockchain.
Bitcoin's still-in-development Hivemind is an alternative that has much greater potential, but it needs things like scriptless scripts and taproot in order to build out an equivalent feature set. Well, these are coming -- and they will enable a *truly* decentralized platform with massive use-cases that users have shown great interest in.
In short, the developer tools I highlighted in my original response are needed in order to create apps that have attractive properties for new users. Bitcoin is just more careful about how it creates these tools, so that we don't give up decentralization and censorship resistance along the way. It may be slower, but at least it's not broken like the altcoin-based platforms are.

It is already possible to make onchain transactions that are completely untraceable to you, whether you send or receive. Here are the steps:
- If you need to send onchain, use Loop Out
- If you need to receive onchain, use Loop In
- For everything else, use lightning
That's it! Onchain transactions sent via Loop Out cannot be traced to your addresses. Onchain transactions received via Loop In cannot be traced to your addresses. No one -- not your counterparty, not your channel partner, not the merchant, not block analysts -- no one can know who sent a payment via Loop Out or who received one via Loop In. Loop is a tool we already have, and we got it without introducing coin-ruining bugs.

Don't use a DEX that relies on a blockchain to provide decentralization. Most blockchains are not really decentralized, especially not blockchains that are purpose-built for one use-case. You can build most decentralized apps without using a blockchain -- e.g. Bittorrent is a decentralized application which does not use a blockchain. If you want a good example of a decentralized exchange that does NOT rely on a blockchain to provide decentralization, try Bisq. [bisq.network]( is the website -- it's just a program you download, it connects to the internet via Tor and to the bitcoin blockchain via an SPV node, and its decentralization comes from the fact that all of its users provide the resources to run the network, there is no central server nor any need to use any specialized token.

The tips are \*backed by\* real money and can be withdrawn as real money. BottlePay uses a spreadsheet to track the balance of each user. When your balance changes due to tipping someone or getting tipped by someone, no "real money" changes hands, they just reduce the sender's balance and increase yours. Anyone who has a balance on the BottlePay spreadsheet is able to withdraw real bitcoins (denominated in satoshis, fractions of a bitcoin) to their own personal wallet. To get a balance on the BottlePay spreadsheet, you can either get tipped by someone else (in which case no real money changes hands), or you can send BottlePay real bitcoins and they will add that amount to your balance.
TLDR the money on BottlePay is \*backed by\* real money, but once it's on their system they hold the real money and just display a number on your account. That number itself is not real money, but when you withdraw you get real money. In the meantime, you're trusting them not to get hacked and/or lose your money.

It's not too much different, and it's a pretty cool service. The main things to know about Bottle Pay are these:
1. It's a custodial service. This means the Bottle Pay company holds any money you put on their service. This is usually fine for small amounts, but if you plan to put a large amount of money into bitcoin, you ought to get a wallet which is under your complete control. Good wallets for large amounts of money include Electrum, Eclair Mobile, and Samourai. These wallets only store your bitcoin data on your computer or phone, they don't send it to any third-party service. That's good because it means you're not relying on other people "sticking around" like you are with Bottle Pay.
2. Bottle Pay uses a payment protocol called Lightning, which is a rather new protocol (it first came out in 2017) that allows instant bitcoin payments for very low fees. Since lightning is beta software (even more "unfinished" than the bitcoin protocol it's based on), it could have bugs. So, once again, don't put large amounts of money onto Bottle Pay. If you do receive large amounts of money on Bottle Pay, you should withdraw it to a wallet under your full control that's not reliant upon such an experimental payment protocol. (BTW this is not a criticism of the lightning protocol and I'm not advising people not to use wallets that implement lightning support; I'm just advising you to be cautious about using them for large amounts until the protocol they rely on is closer to being finished).

I admire the attempt at syllogistic logic. I think your syllogism can be improved so that the logic is more apparent. The main problem with your current syllogism is that there are significant terms in the premises which are not in the conclusion. A better syllogism would go something like this:
P1) A ledger cannot have a scalability problem
P2) The blockchain is a ledger
∴ The blockchain cannot have a scalability problem
In support of P1 you could add:
P1.1) If a ledger could have a scalability problem, banks would have a scalability problem
P1.2) Banks do not have a scalability problem
∴ A ledger cannot have a scalability problem

You can if you use Breez. You can also start up Zap Wallet and -- immediately -- type in your debit/credit card and receive bitcoins into a lightning channel. When you do that, the Zap team also provides you with additional incoming liquidity in an amount matching what you bought, so that you can receive the same amount *again* without waiting for anything. So there are two non-custodial wallets that let you do the thing that you say cannot currently be done.
Not to mention that there are at least three custodial lightning wallets that let you do this: BlueWallet, Wallet of Satoshi, and DropBit. Custodial wallets are obviously a different story in most ways, but if the short-term future of bitcoin is one where users have a custodial wallet for daily spending but keep their savings in a non-custodial wallet, there's nothing wrong with onboarding the masses to a system like that. It's not much different from Hal Finney's (very early) [musings]( about how a future bitcoin-based economy might work.


Lightning Labs wallet does this. Also, your second point differs considerably from your first point. (That is not a criticism btw, you're welcome to make two points in one post.) The ability to open a channel "as soon as you fund the wallet" is different from the ability to receive money "as soon as you create the wallet." You can do the first without the second, or the second without the first, or both. I'd like to know which one (or both) you think is necessary for mass adoption.

There is a reason why bitcoin has more developers than any other cryptocurrency. It's got the best development tools around, with tools in all major programming languages and an upgrade process that actually conforms to industry standards (with things like peer review, version control, and a variety of development environments). Other coins are like "Look how easy we are to upgrade! We have a hard fork every month!" But that is not attractive to most developers because hard forks mean the apps you wrote might no longer work on the new version. That never happens on bitcoin because bitcoin uses proper version control to ensure backward compatibility. This is a major reason why it attracts new developers.


- partially signed bitcoin transactions (more flexible signing policies)
- zerolink and whirlpool (privacy protocols)
- neutrino filters (for faster mobile wallet sync)
- dandelion (a new transaction relay policy)
- betterhash (more decentralized mining)
- payjoin (a more private payment protocol with coinjoin characteristics)
- static channel backups (lower storage requirements for lightning)
- watchtowers (enhanced security on lightning)
- ion and webln (decentralized identity via bitcoin)
- hodl invoices (feeless refunds)
Also, bitcoin developers are currently working on the following upcoming upgrades:
- miniscript (enhanced modularity and flexibility for bitcoin's scripting language)
- RGB (a new colored coins protocol that also works on lightning)
- schnorr (more efficient signatures)
- multipath payments (enhanced outbound liquidity on lightning)
- musig (signature aggregation and up to 40% lower transaction fees)
- stuckless payments (faster lightning payments)
- taproot (more bitcoin scripts per transaction with enhanced privacy)
- sighash_noinput (low-risk lightning payments)
- scriptless scripts (more flexible smart contracts)
- dual funded channels (enhanced inbound liquidity on lightning)
- utxo snapshots (faster initial block download)
- sphinx send (static lightning addresses -- no need for invoices)
- trampoline payments (outsourced pathfinding on mobile)
- utreexo (smaller size utxo set)

The fee is not one of the outputs. The fee is the the difference between the sum of the inputs (I) and the sum of the outputs (O). I-O = fee. Suppose your wallet used 2 inputs, each with 0.5 bitcoins, and had 2 outputs: 0.7 bitcoins to the merchant, and 0.2 bitcoins back to one of your own addresses as change. That means your inputs, added together, are 1 bitcoin, and your outputs, added together, are 0.9 bitcoins. So the fee would be 0.1 bitcoins, and that's what goes to the miner. (That would obviously be a super high fee, but I'm just exaggerating to make it simpler. Right now fees are low so the amount going back to you as change would be larger.)
Here's a video that explains it better: [ (btw when he says "the coinbase" in that video, he's not referring to the exchange. Before the exchange named "Coinbase" existed, the word "coinbase" referred to the first transaction in every block on the blockchain -- the transaction that pays the miner the block subsidy and the fees. And that's still what the word "coinbase" refers to when it's not capitalized. The exchange "Coinbase" just named themselves after that technical term.)

The main benefit is that if you run your own node then your wallet can ask that node for information about your bitcoins and you can trust that it's not lying to you. If you use a wallet that connects to someone else's node, you might not have any bitcoins, their node might be lying to you.
There are also ancillary benefits. Running your own node gives you a speed advantage over your other peers if you do things like stake your bitcoins on joinmarket or in lightning channels. Doing those things can earn you money as a "risk free rate of return," but if your joinmarket wallet or your lightning wallet are always pinging someone else's node before they reply to a peer's request to use them, that can introduce uncontrollable delays and cause people to avoid your node. In short, running a full bitcoin node can also help you earn money.

No, it validates them before and after they are mined in a block. But currently, all transactions get into a block except some 0-fee transactions, so even a "blocks only" node validates all transactions (or very nearly all -- the only exceptions are transactions that never get mined, which are rare; to my knowledge, only a few 0-fee transactions fall into that category).

Ah I see. Well, websites can offer escrow protection like purse.io does or HodlHodl. This is where you don't send your coins directly and immediately to the website, instead you send them into an escrow account first, one run by an escrow agency that has a reputation to uphold. An escrow account is a shared wallet where you have a private key, the merchant you're buying from has a second private key, and the escrow agency has a third private key, and the money can only move if 2 out of 3 keys cosign. So your money remains in the escrow account for 30 days, after which the escrow agent and the merchant cosign to move the money to the merchant.
If you've received your product, all is well and good. If you haven't received your product, you have until those initial 30 days are up to file a complaint with the escrow agency, who can then step in to review the case (and do stuff like ask the merchant for proof of the shipment). If the escrow agency decides in your favor, they can cosign with you to move the money back to you, or if they decide in favor of the merchant, they can cosign with the merchant to move the money to the merchant.
Not very many websites use escrow services, but some do, and they are a relatively decentralized way for merchants to offer buyer protection without giving anyone the ability to steal your coins for themselves.

Try not to perpetuate the myth that 1 address is ever ideally 1 person. People who "use" bitcoin on their own wallets typically have dozens of addresses, so 15 or more addresses might be just 1 person. Even more often, 5 or 6 addresses correspond to many thousands of people, because they're all using the same exchange, which holds everyone's money in the same 5 or 6 addresses. My point is, checking how many addresses there are on the blockchain is such a poor way to estimate how many people own bitcoins, you shouldn't really be extrapolating from it.

That's incorrect with this wallet, which is a custodial wallet that does not give you control over the channel or the keys.

The answer "Yes, but." Yes, it can and already does exceed 4.5 tps if you use lightning, but not when the transactions are all vying to get into the next block on the blockchain. What you've got to understand about Visa is, they aren't doing what bitcoin is doing, i.e. final settlement in 10 minutes. Visa sends a promise from your bank to the bank of the person you're paying that the money will eventually come, after a few business days to ensure there was no fraud and other edge cases. Comparing bitcoin to that is assuming that bitcoin's blockchain is trying to compete with a company like that, and it's not.
A "bitcoin visa network" can be built on bitcoin if people choose to deposit their money into custodial accounts and let a centralized payment network make payments on their behalf, and if they do that, those transactions can be just as fast as Visa because the centralized payment provider can just take custody of the funds until the next block arrives. But even though that's possible to do, no one's trying to do that because most developers think that we can do better, and make a decentralized payment network that is just as fast as Visa. (That's lightning.) But on the blockchain itself, without any payment network built on top, no, transactions are unlikely to ever reach Visa's level of speed.
Your question SHOULD be: is lightning faster than Visa? It's reasonable to compare those because they are both popular payment networks for the underlying currency. And there are other payment networks that could be compared too -- for example, is liquid faster than Western Union? Or, will state chains be faster than Paypal? But just comparing the base currency system of final settlement with Visa is not a good comparison because one is doing final settlement and the other is not.

One thought: even if this sidechain had an equal hashrate to what the base layer bitcoin blockchain has, confirmations on it would have 0.17% of bitcoin's security, because 1 second is 0.17% of 10 minutes. That's less than a fifth of one percent. Who's gonna trust that level of security? And that's not even counting the fact that *no* sidechain has a hashrate equal to bitcoin's, or anywhere remotely close to the same ballpark. If your goal is "throw away the security of confirmations, because they no longer mean final settlement and are easy to roll back," then what's the point?

To be clear, I am not in favor of limiting blocks to 300kb. But these are some of the reasons I've heard and/or thought of by myself:
- 300kb blocks would slow the growth rate of the blockchain
- More people are likely to run full nodes if the initial sync time stops increasing so fast
- Smaller block sizes would help the fee market grow
- The fee market should grow because we need to help miners move to the fee incentive over the built-in block reward
- And we need to do that because if the fee market remains small, the network will get less secure as the built-in block reward decreases (because that means profitability will go down, and miners will leave)
- Small blocks also encourage faster lightning adoption because it will help make onchain transactions more expensive

The memo option lets you attach some information to the payment such as, "This was for my 2019/02/28 transaction." The memo stays on your device, no one else can see it.
You should be able to spend your money as soon as it has received one confirmation on the blockchain, which typically takes 10 minutes. Tap the transaction to get more information about how many confirmations it has.

Bitpay has done a number of things that have angered a lot of people in this community. The worst thing they did was support a hard fork called B2X that tried to take over the bitcoin network; as part of this failed attack Bitpay tried to move everyone on their network to a new blockchain (one whose network management software completely stopped working the day the fork was scheduled -- which would have been catastrophic for bitcoin if that fork had gained majority support, because no transactions were able to confirm on that network).
They also support the BCH coin (which is scammy) and they continue to only let you pay their merchants if you use a deprecated payment protocol called BIP70, which is insecure because it relies on third parties to verify the encryption status of your connection to Bitpay. BIP70 is also not supported by very many wallets, because it is deprecated, which makes it difficult to pay their merchants and confusing for new users. Bitpay also charges bitcoin users a higher mining fee than they need to and they add a second fee called "Network Fee" which is actually just a second mining fee. This is on top of the 1% transaction fee that they charge merchants.
All of these things, in varying degrees, anger bitcoin users in this community, and many find Bitpay to be such an egregious company that they refuse to use their services. Personally, I find their debit card useful enough to keep using it when a merchant doesn't support bitcoin directly, but there are many decent alternatives if you feel you need a debit card: the Shift card is decent, and so is Wirex. But at least now you can be a little more informed about why Bitpay is controversial in this community.

Because if the network had a rule that said no ip address can have more than 25% of the hash power, a miner who actually had more than that would simply put his extra hashing power on a separate ip address. And thus we wouldn't have solved anything.

First, LND is not the only implementation. Second, changing that to 0 involves changing one line of code in an open source program.

As almkglor [explains it]( neutrino nodes go to full nodes and say, "Hey, can I have some data about block X? I only want to know what addresses got mentioned in it." The full node will then serve it a file, smaller than the full block, only containing a list of addresses that got mentioned in that block. The neutrino node has to download this file (which is called the "compact block") and examine it to see if one of its own addresses is mentioned in there. The problem is, neutrino nodes have to ask for address data regarding *many* blocks in the blockchain -- specifically, it has to download a "compact version" of every block it might have received money in, i.e., for every block mined after the wallet was created. Before long, this means downloading a significant amount of data every time the wallet needs to sync (which is typically whenever it's opened), far more data than a bloom filter would ask for. There's still work to do to reduce this bandwidth requirement, which is more than a mobile phone should have to download (especially in third world country).
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:16:32
My understanding of the proposal is that the person running a state chain would not need to download and verify the entire chain, but only the data about his utxo. I don't know if that claim is accurate, but that's how I've heard it reported.

Neutrino isn't all roses yet. It still has this huge downside: downloading all the compact blocks still takes up several gigabytes of storage space. It also uses a lot of bandwidth for the initial sync. Until a workaround for this is found, mobile wallets will likely continue to grab information from the electrum network and/or various nodes of wallet creators. Not very many mobile wallets use bloom filters anymore, but those who do (such as Greenaddress and BLW for Android) will probably continue to do so because the bloom filter method still has far lower storage and bandwidth requirements than neutrino. Neutrino is better for laptop wallets currently, whereas most desktop wallets ought to be full node wallets and not rely on things like SPV/Neutrino. Work is still being done to create low-storage, low-bandwidth options for mobile phones that still preserve your privacy. Neutrino isn't that solution -- at least not yet. (Using the electrum network is also not a good solution for privacy, btw, unless you're running your own personal electrum server.)

Benefits of legacy address: you can do proof of reserves by signing a proof that you own a particular address, and anyone can check the proof using standard software. (Note that this advantage may disappear soon, as there is a BIP to let you do this with segwit addresses, but it hasn't been merged yet.)
Benefits of native segwit: 25% lower fees; smaller size; works better with QR codes; has better error detection and correction. Disadvantage: older clients can't send to native segwit addresses, and some old sites and exchanges haven't upgraded yet, so they can't send to these addresses -- but this problem is quickly disappearing because most sites and exchanges have upgraded and more are doing so every day.
Benefits of P2SH segwit: You get most of the "lower fees" benefit of native segwit, plus it's backward compatible with older clients (unless someone still has a reeeeaaaaallllly old client from before the P2SH update in 2012, but that's very unlikely), but you don't get the smaller size on QR codes and P2SH addresses don't have native segwit's superior error detection.

Yes, you can do this.


No, sending does not take a 1% hit. (In fact, sending/withdrawing via the CashApp is cheaper than in most bitcoin wallets because in most bitcoin wallets you have to pay a small mining fee, but if you use CashApp they pay that on your behalf. Still, if you plan to keep any money in bitcoin longterm it's better to get a standard bitcoin wallet such as Electrum or Eclair, because as long as your money is on the CashApp wallet they have full control over it, whereas wallets like Electrum and Eclair are fully self-hosted and under your full control.)

The same way most routing problems are solved. By checking a map. A node can "ping" its peers to tell it routing information, which it compiles into a map, and then tries out routes based on that map. If one route fails, it tries another. If it fails a bunch of times in a row, it tells the user there was an error. The user can then try to create a new channel to (hopefully) get a better route.

I buy lunch and dinner nearly every day using bitcoin's lightning network. I typically pay absolutely nothing in fees because I have a direct channel open to Bitrefill, and that's what I use to buy lunch (e.g. Domino's, Burger King, seafood options, etc.). The transactions go through instantly, which means I have my gift card within seconds of placing the order. For me, bitcoin is absolutely worth it as an everyday payment, because I get greater speed, free transactions, and enhanced privacy compared to using a debit/credit card.

If you're just an ordinary user trying to pay lightning invoices from your coinbase account, here are the steps:
- Go to bitrefill
- Select the Lightning option in the left sidebar under Lightning Utilities
- Select Thor Recharge
- Type in the amount of the lightning invoice you want to pay (for example, if you are sending 10000 sats from Coinbase to your own lightning channel, you would type 10000 into the amount box on bitrefill)
- In the box that pops up next, paste any lightning invoice for the amount you said you want to pay (presumably, if you're sending from coinbase to your own lightning wallet, you will create this invoice in your wallet using the "receive" button -- but you could use this box in Thor Recharge to pay any lightning invoice, not just one that pays your own wallet)
- Then type in an email that they can contact you at if anything goes wrong
- Finally select Coinbase as your method of payment, and follow the steps to authorize Bitrefill to connect to your Coinbase account to complete the payment

Luke's math says that if we have 300kb blocks we'll be approximately at the level where Moore's Law lets most people run a node.
(That summary sentence is a little inaccurate. He did an estimation of the percentage of node runners when the blockchain was a certain size, and he wants it to be approximately the same percentage again after accounting for the better bandwidth and storage people have gotten since that time. The percentage of node runners has gone down significantly and he thinks 300kb blocks will help bring it up to the right percentage again.)

Suppose your cost of living is $1000 per month. You can find the dollars-per-second by dividing the month into 30 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds. 30\*24\*60\*60 = 2592000. That means your cost of living is $1000 per 2592000 seconds. Now just divide the seconds into the dollars to find the final value: the cost of living is 1/2592 dollars per second.
Now let's get the dollar price of a satoshi. Suppose 1 bitcoin is worth $10000. 1 bitcoin is 100000000 satoshis, so 100000000 satoshis is worth $10000, or (you could say) 10000 satoshis = $1. Divide both sides by 2592 and you'll discover that \~4 sats = 1/2592 dollars. Now, substitute in your 4 satoshis for your dollar in the previous formula, and your cost of living is 4 satoshis per second.

HTLCs are payment contracts. They can be compared to prepaid money orders, funded by bitcoin addresses on the blockchain instead of by a company. When you pay someone via lightning you're actually passing "money orders" back and forth (payment contracts, or HTLCs) which people on the network can "cash" at any time for onchain BTCs. However, just like money orders, you can also just treat the contract itself as a form of payment. It's "just as good" as getting onchain bitcoins, except it's faster (and, so far, much much cheaper for the payer).

Within the past month, several new onramps have been built so that you can buy bitcoins directly within a lightning wallet, directly into a lightning channel. These onramps include:
- Zap Olympus
- Sparkswap Desktop
- Breezwallet
There are also several exchanges with lightning support, including hodlhodl.com. Other exchanges have announced forthcoming support. Bitfinex [says]( they will have lightning support by the end of this year. [Bitstamp]( is already running a lightning node and looks set to build in the support soon. Kraken [just hired]( a lightning developer. Even Coinbase has integration with a third-party lightning service provider ([Bitrefill]( allowing users of Coinbase to open lightning channels from their Coinbase account and refill them if they get empty. And General Bytes -- one of the largest bitcoin atm companies in the world -- added lightning support in a recent upgrade to their software (Version 20191009 -- see the changelog [here](
Then there are the wallets: new wallets include Lightning Labs wallet and Zap Mobile, and Dropbit [is letting users beta test]( a new version of their wallet with lightning integrated. Also, Electrum [plans]( to add lightning support in the next major version.
According to merchants at Bitrefill, TravelByBit, Coingate, and ShopinBit.de, lightning is the second-or-third most popular payment method for products where cryptocurrency is concerned. The only thing more popular is a standard bitcoin transaction (and Dash at ShopinBit.de, and something else at TravelByBit, I forget what they said  was).
So yeah. Adoption is happening -- lightning is becoming just another way to spend bitcoin, faster, cheaper, and more privately,  at more and more places.


I never saw anyone expect that, and it's not expected now. It's simply another way to spend bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more privately.


I never saw anyone expect it to be the "one true way" to do anything. It's another way, and it happens to have advantages over a standard transaction, but it's not the one true way.


Go right ahead with on-chain coffee payments if you want them. Fees are low right now so you're not going to pay much in fees either way. The only downside of onchain payments right now is the whole "wait 10 minutes" thing.

Or maybe we'll get better at building competitors quickly.

I bring up those two examples because coinjoin services are one of the areas where I am most excited about the Schnorr upgrade. Once they work with Schnorr, wallets like Wasabi and Joinmarket will be massively cheaper than their competitors, and it will make it profitable to become a liquidity provider on their markets. I imagine we'll see wallets proliferate with the option to earn bitcoins while helping improve its fungibility, all without needing to trust anyone or put yourself at risk.

If there were such a site, and they didn't require you to provide identification and wait while they verify it, scammers would take advantage of them by sending $15 USD worth of bitcoins to themselves and then telling Paypal or their bank that the transaction is unauthorized. Then Paypal and/or the bank would reverse the transaction, because they err on the side of the consumer when the merchant doesn't do background checks. The bitcoins, however, would remain with the scammer, because bitcoin transactions aren't reversible after they've been confirmed on the blockchain. This is why all sites that let you send bitcoins to an address make you verify your identity first, so that, if you cheat, they can hold you accountable.

Don't forget to add costs for a 3.40GHz quad-core CPU ([here's one]( for $165.00), 4GB of DDR3 ram ([$15 used]( an empty PC shell in which to hook them together, and the ongoing cost of 10 Mbits/s in bandwidth. Sure, there's no need for a cloud service. But now you've got to have some place to store this equipment and keep it cool. Not many people are running full archival ethereum nodes in their bedrooms. Unlike your desktop, this cpu will need to be processing data 24/7 because ethereum blocks come in every 15 seconds. That constant usage makes the processor run hot, and it will break if it's not kept cool (actually it will break eventually anyway so factor the replacement cost in). Since you're not likely to run this thing in your living space, you're gonna need to store it in a separate room from where you have friends and guests over, and ensure that room has separate climate control. A startup who isn't going to rent this equipment from a cloud provider is going to need a room to store this equipment in and cool it. And that costs money, especially if your startup is in a big city (and most are, because it's in the big cities that they gain access to a large pool of talented developers). This is why it's often so much cheaper to just rent the machine from Amazon or another web service provider. And it's also why the vast majority of people running full nodes right now on the etherheum network are not standard users -- they're developers, and this is a form of centralization.

If onchain BTCs ever sell for more than lightning BTCs, than anyone could make risk-free money by buying the lightning BTCs while simultaneously selling an equivalent amount of onchain BTCs. When they start to run out of onchain BTCs, they can use one onchain transaction to put all of their lightning BTCs on the blockchain. At that point, they will have more onchain BTCs than they started out with (because they were able to buy a larger quantity of lightning BTCs with the money they made), so they can do it all over again and make even More risk-free money. Any spread between the prices would thus be smoothed out by instant-arbitrage between the two. Because of this option, I doubt their prices can ever be significantly different.

So if that's a necessity, I suppose you should first check BTCPay Server to see if they offer that yet (because they really are the best available), and if they don't offer what you need, then you might check out Coingate, OpenNode.co, and/or Globee. They all offer a convert-to-fiat option and an easy API for integration into other apps, but they also charge a fee per transaction, similar to a credit/debit card payment processor.

Ethereum is a computer network where you can upload a computing script and pay miners to run it. It uses a native token called ether to pay miners to run user-created scripts. The network is extremely slow and very large scripts don't work -- especially if lots of people start using it -- but the hope among Etherians (i.e. fans of ethereum) is that eventually the network will be fast and powerful enough to replace centralized web servers like Amazon Web Server, so that, instead of paying Amazon to host your website's backend php scripts (and then they have control over it can shut down the backend of your website), you can upload your backend scripts to the Ethereum network (with enough money to incentivize any ethereum miner to run them) and then you don't to worry about any sort of contract with a centralized company and you don't have to worry about your website's backend getting shut down. Ethereum doesn't have much to do with bitcoin except that they both use a blockchain and have a currency, and some of the developers who work on ethereum also work on bitcoin.

The speed of lightning payments using all these new tools is fascinating. Interacting with the developers is also fun. One of Bitlum's devs worked with me to uncover a way to (1) open the extension in its own window (without the url bar), (2) pin it to the taskbar, and (3) modify its default size, all without modifying the extension or its code. By using these features in combination, it is easy to make Bitlum wallet look and feel like a full-blown wallet application installed on your machine, and having it in its own window makes it faster to use because you don't have to keep clicking the extension button but can keep it open pretty persistently. If any of that sounds interesting to you and/or you can't get it to do it on your own, let me know.

Here's a line-by-line explanation:


Translation:  One guy sent bitcoin to another guy via shortwave radio. He used a free protocol for shortwave communications to do this. The protocol is called JS8Call, and it lets you connect a shortwave radio to a computer and essentially send and receive shortwave-transmitted text messages to other JS8Call users without having to obtain a special license.


That link shows the transaction where the recipient transferred the bitcoins into his wallet.


These are the locations, from and to.


The sender didn't prepare a signed transaction and then send it to his recipient so he could broadcast it to the blockchain, though he could have done that. Instead, he sent his recipient a private key, and the recipient transferred the funds to his wallet using that private key.
The last picture is a visual representation of data that came from the recipient's radio to the sender's radio. Shortwave radios hear background electromagnetic "noise" all the time (also known as static), and when they receive a recognizable signal, it can be visually represented as a blip or interruption in the background noise. The graphic portrays a blip in the static which appeared as an agreed-upon signal meaning, "Yup, I got your message."

Yes, good point. I suppose a neutrino node could discard compact blocks that don't contain information it needs. That would probably solve the storage problem. It would still use over a megabyte of bandwidth every 10 minutes, but I suppose there are worse bandwidth hogs out there, such as games. If you didn't open your wallet for a while, you'd have to wait for it to download each compact block that came in since the last time you used it, and that would take longer than using bloom filters or just pinging nodes for information about specific addresses, but it would still be more private.

Yes, it is possible. Just install a lightning node and download its graph of all available channels. That's what [1ml.com]( does to get their "Network Capacity" value. If you assume that all multisig segwit outputs are LN addresses you could also use a script to aggregate all of those from the blockchain, but that assumption is not a perfectly true assumption so you'd end up overestimating the number of LN addresses if you tried to do it that way.
BTW not all LN addresses are bech32 addresses. LN can also use 3-style addresses.

There are several statements in the video, but if I was chatting with him and he mentioned that we wouldn't have enough electricity to power the bitcoin network if it was scaled up to accomodate worldwide usage, I would reply that bitcoin's energy consumption is independent of how many users the network has. Bitcoin's energy consumption has no fixed "watt per transaction" requirement. Instead, the energy consumption of the network comes from miners voluntarily turning mining equipment on, which they do when the price of bitcoin is greater than the price of electricity in their area. Thus, we could theoretically scale up to worldwide usage without necessarily seeing any increase in energy consumption -- and certainly it will never "require" more energy than what is available to miners, that's just silly. When the price of bitcoin is higher than the price of electricity, miners will turn on whatever mining equipment they have. When it's not, they'll turn that equipment off. The network needs no more energy than what the miners are willing to consume at any given time.

Scammers often try to convince people to let them pay for bitcoins via paypal because paypal transactions are easy to cancel up to a month after the payment, and bitcoin transactions are irreversible after 1 confirmation (which usually takes 10 minutes). So they'll get the bitcoins, wait for a confirmation, and then cancel the paypal transaction, which means they got them for free. And if the seller tries to appeal the cancellation to paypal, paypal will tell them that bitcoins are a high-risk instrument and they do not currently provide support to people who lost money selling it. This is why there are very few sites that let you trade paypal to bitcoin, and the ones that do charge you way over the spot price so that they can be sure to profit (by cashing it out) even if the paypal transaction gets cancelled soon after.

If you think blockchains are good for messaging, you misunderstand them. Blockchains are very slow, for one thing, and when you put messages on the blockchain you bloat its size, which makes it slower and less secure. Blockchains, in order to be secure, need to be very slim. For example, bitcoin's ledger has been logging transactions for 10 years and is still less than 250GB. You start adding a bunch of text messages, pics and videos to it, and it will massively grow in size until no one can download it anymore or run a node to keep it decentralized. And then, there goes its security.
@_date: 2019-02-17 13:20:05


No. The security of drawing a random word out of a dictionary of 2048 words -- and doing so 12 times -- is just as secure as a private key, which is created by drawing a random bit out of 2 possible bits (one or zero) -- and doing so 256 times. Both are computationally infeasible to figure out by a brute force attack.
To be more mathematically precise, it is true that a 12 word recovery key only has 128 bits of entropy, whereas a private key has 256 bits of entropy. But a 24 word recovery key has the same 256 bits of entropy that a private key does, and, more importantly, 128 bits and 256 bits are both are computationally infeasible to figure out by a brute force attack. Thus, whether you use a 12 word recovery key, a 24 word recovery key, or a private key, you've still attained the same security goal: no one can "guess" your recovery key or your private key, not even if they harness all the computing power in the world.


No. Complexity and security are inversely related; the more complex a security system is, the more flaws it is likely to have. Secure systems are simple. One simple security mechanism (at least when an attacker has to figure out a password or something similar to a password) is to use a long, random password. Judged by that standard, a twelve-word recovery key is just as secure as a private key. (Well, within the caveats I mentioned in my second paragraph of this post.)

If you're using a custodial wallet and the wallet loses all the info, then the satoshis are lost. This is one reason why it is better to store your bitcoins in a wallet where you control the private keys, so you can write them down and have a backup.

Correct. The Bitpay "network cost" goes to Bitpay, and they claim to use it to pay a mining fee when they sweep transactions into one of their addresses. I imagine this has something to do with utxo consolidation, since they get a lot of small-value utxos. In my opinion, it is fair to call this "network cost" an additional mining fee, because after you've paid the miners for your own transaction, you're also paying for them to "sweep" the payment. I'm not a fan of the way they describe it, but you're right that it's probably how they make money. I wish they would call it a service fee instead of a "network cost," because it's not really a network cost.


Well, they *claim* it does, and I imagine they do spend at least part of it to consolidate their utxos. But it's higher than it needs to be if that was the only purpose. And it's also non-negotiable (except that you always have the option of just not using their card).


I think you mean you don't have to pay the mining fee they suggest to your wallet. I am aware of that, and I never do pay that. But you do have to pay their "network cost" which they *claim* goes to the miners and which I think can fairly be described as an additional mining fee.
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:12:40
Yes. New blocks are added to the end of the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes by the miners. If you use full node software such as Bitcoin Core (see  it will automatically download the entire blockchain, verify each block, and add on new blocks every time the miners put them out (which is, as I said earlier, approximately every 10 minutes). Be aware that the full blockchain is almost 250 gigabytes, so you'll need to make sure you have enough drive space on your computer.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:42:06


There is a semi-hidden additional mining fee which you DO have to pay and have no choice in the matter (other than the option to stop using the card). Next time you pay one of their invoices, click the little "i" for more information and hover over the fee they call a "network cost." It's different from the mining fee you pay in your wallet -- it's a second mining fee that they build into the total amount you pay. It is always set for next-block confirmation without you being able to do anything about it other than pay it or not use the card.

Because it is already possible to anonymize your bitcoins and remove the possibility of accurately tracing their history, and several upcoming upgrades to bitcoin will incentivize wallet makers to do this for their users automatically.
As an example of how you can anonymize your bitcoins right now, consider what happens if you do a Joinmarket transaction. You join a transaction with ten other people; each of you pays (for example) 0.25 bitcoins into the combined payment, and each of you gives an address where you want to receive your coins. In your case, your 0.25 bitcoins were once owned by a casino. But Alice's weren't, and she was part of this combined transaction; neither was Bob's, he put perfectly clean bitcoins in. When you put your 0.25 bitcoins into JoinMarket, and so does Bob and Alice and seven other people, you receive an amount of bitcoins equal to what you put in (and so does everyone else), but there's no way of telling who got whose bitcoins. Once you've received 0.25 bitcoins into the address you provided as part of the setup, how can anyone possibly tell whose 0.25 bitcoins were once owned by the casino? There's absolutely no way to tell who has them -- you, Alice, Bob, or someone else in that group of 10. *Someone* in the group has them -- but who? You can't tell, and neither can anyone else in the group (or outside of it, for that matter). There's *no way* to tell. You've totally anonymized your bitcoins and no one could stop you.
This is already possible today using wallets like Wasabi Wallet or JoinMarket wallet. And pretty soon we're going to get a bitcoin upgrade called Schnorr which will let everyone save money on fees by running their money through decentralized mixing services in the manner I just described. Since it will *literally save you money to do so,* *most* wallets will end up using these decentralized mixing services. At that point, how will anyone trace any coin's history? All coins will automatically run through decentralized mixing services (like Joinmarket) and thus no one will be able to uncover a particular coin's history.

No, Eclair can't take all your funds, it is a noncustodial wallet. It does, however, connect you to Eclair's node by default. The only risk with that is this: if there is ever a hard fork, Eclair (or actually Acinq, the company that makes Eclair) gets to set their node to select which fork to follow, and all the wallets connected to their node will then only work on that fork. If you trust Eclair to make good decisions, well, I guess good for you then, but in my opinion it is significantly better to run your own node and connect your wallet to that, that way you get to decide things such as: what forks to follow, what upgrades to download, what network to connect to, and what blockchain to store your funds on. I think it's better to make those decisions yourself rather than let a company do it for you, but some people don't want to pay that much attention to this space, so if you're comfortable letting Eclair make decisions like that, it's not evil or anything. They definitely can't take your money.

It is better to just write down the recovery key that is built into most bitcoin wallets nowadays. (That's the twelve word thingy.) If you don't have a wallet with a recovery key, download one (they're free), generate a recovery key, and write it down instead of using a paper wallet site. You can store your bitcoins in that recovery key and it's got better features and higher security than a paper wallet generator.
Just to give one example of its better features: I once stored a backup copy of my paper wallet at my parents' house.  When I lost my primary copy, I had to telephone them to get the backup. They read each character to me over the phone, specifying whether it was upper case or lower case, since private keys are case sensitive. The possibility of writing it down wrong, or of them saying a wrong character, would have been greatly reduced if I had used a recovery key instead. Because twelve words is easier, faster, and more securely communicable than \~40 random case-sensitive characters.

Here's a somewhat simpler version: All their users' wallets now have a new setting. The next upgrade of their wallet will use that setting to make large bitcoin payments work better. Specifically, instead of trying to send one big payment through the network, their users' wallets will try to break up big payments into a bunch of little ones automatically, and send those little payments through a bunch of different paths on the network. This should be a good upgrade because big payments fail more often than small payments, and no one likes their payment to fail.

If it never arrived, then it was not sent. Until you have received your money, the sender's counterparty cannot receive his. If a payment successfully goes through, you should see a message like this:

BTW if it makes you feel any better, I just tried to withdraw 1000 satoshis and it is also telling me my balance is now 0.0, but it hasn't given me a preimage and my wallet shows no transaction has come in, so I know the bot hasn't actually sent me any money.

He's using it as a metaphor to mean we won't be able to fit all the transactions on the network into blocks, because more transactions will be broadcast than there's room in each block to fit them in. I.e. we'll hit a "wall." This is because blocks have limited block space and we don't want to raise the maximum capacity yet.

He is probably right that the network will get congested again, but he is wrong that this could destroy bitcoin.

It's not something you would choose while making a payment. Miners decide which blocksize to create up to the limitations of the software run by node operators -- if node operators chose to only validate blocks that are 300kb or less, miners would have to ensure that they don't create blocks that are bigger than that, otherwise those bigger blocks would be rejected by the network and the miner would have wasted his time and money.


It would just be more expensive, which would sometimes result in the perception that it is slower, but never that it is faster. A payment is usually seen as "fast" when it gets confirmed quickly. Confirmation times would still be roughly 10 minutes apart, but, since block space is more limited, there would be more competition to get into them, resulting in a lot more transactions "not" getting confirmed in the next block. So, for those transactions, it would appear to be slower, though if your wallet continues to correctly estimate fees, transactions would seem to take the same amount of time as ever as long as you continue to use the same settings.


Yes, all of the blocks from before the softfork would remain the same size as they were originally, but after the softfork all blocks would be 300kb or less (until the rule got changed -- and I believe Luke's proposal is to make this a temporary thing, such that the rule would automatically get lifted after a year or so, restoring us to the standard block size limits that we have now).


You are correct that bitcoin counts time by counting blocks, but it would continue to count blocks without any hiccups so it wouldn't be a problem. Already there are occasionally blocks that are smaller than 300kb, just because (for example) the miner didn't include low-fee transactions and there weren't very many high-fee transactions. The blockchain would simply see that suddenly *all* blocks would be less than 300kb. The amount of time they are produced in wouldn't change, so the network would continue to count time in intervals of (roughly) 10 minute blocks.


The cons are that transactions would be more expensive and sometimes seem slower. The pros are that smaller block sizes would result -- for the first time -- in it actually getting *easier* to set up a full bitcoin node and participate in validating the network rules. That is important because it is the only way to use bitcoin trustlessly -- if you're not running a node, there are (expensive) ways for miners, whales, and/or very savvy geeks to cheat you by tricking your wallet into thinking it has received a payment when it has not. This is because light wallets don't validate network rules, they connect to other people's nodes and trust those to validate the network's rules. It is thus very important for merchants to set up full nodes, and Luke's proposal is a way of making it easier for them to do so. (It's less important for "regular people" to run a full node, but the more money you have in bitcoin, the more important it becomes.)


People who run full nodes would optionally download a "patch" that says "after block ABC, only validate blocks if they are 300kb or less. Then, after block XYZ, start validating them at standard segwit sizes again." When block ABC is reached in the real world (it would probably be set for at least 6 months into the future from the time the patch came out), the network would do exactly what the rules say: they would reject any "new" blocks that are bigger than 300kb, which would force miners to mine smaller blocks, making it easier to set up a full node. Then, after a year or two (i.e. after whatever block was set in the second part of the patch), the rule would go away, allowing miners to mine standard-sized segwit blocks again. Doing this soft-fork would still require over 50% of network operators to activate the softfork, so there would need to be plenty of time for coordination of the effort.

Schnorr development is coming along nicely. A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for it [has been written]( and you can track proposed changes to the draft on [this page]( The BIP includes an example of a pure python implementation of Schnorr signatures that passes all the test vectors for bitcoin. This will be necessary for the Electrum network, because Electrum-based wallets are typically written in python. There are also test-passing implementations in [javascript]( and in [Go]( The javascript implementation will be necessary for most web wallets and many mobile wallets, and the Go implementation will be necessary for LND, which is written in Go.
Before Schnorr can be merged into Bitcoin Core we'll need an implementation in C++, which is the language that Bitcoin Core is written in, and that implementation will need time for testing, feedback, improvement, and deployment on the testnet. Moreover, once Schnorr signatures are added in Bitcoin Core, it will take time for other parties in the ecosystem to upgrade, especially exchanges and other wallets, which do not always use the code in Bitcoin Core. Even after the changes in Bitcoin Core have attained consensus, many exchanges and other wallets will upgrade to the "new" Bitcoin Core but won't immediately make Schnorr signatures available for general use, because it will take time to upgrade their systems. They'll likely have to be pressured by users and competitors to do so.
Even once they make Schnorr signatures available, it will take their engineers time to utilize its benefits, such as signature aggregation, and time to help people get used to patiently waiting for batch transactions to be broadcast. Instant transactions will still be available through lightning, but we want people to use batch transactions if they're not using lightning; you'll also be able to pay for onchain space without waiting for a batch, of course, but batching will be so much cheaper.
Have patience; these things take time. But the first wallets with Schnorr signatures should be available this year.

It is workable but your description is a bit overly complicated.

However, this solution requires trusting zigzag to send you coins. Very shortly we'll have better swap technology solutions which will allow us to do the same thing without trusting the person we're mixing coins with.

If you don't already have an LN-compatible address, you can use several wallets to generate one: Eclair Wallet (last I checked, they use software that produces addresses beginning with a 3), Bitcoin Lightning Wallet (uses bc1), and Electrum (uses bc1) are all good options.

Theoretically. It could only get that high if the batch creator crafted a transaction with 1 input and 32,256 outputs and paid a fee high enough that a miner decided to mine an entire block with just that one transaction. So while it's theoretically possible, it's easy to judge that it's super unlikely. But it's a good illustration that batching can get us a long way toward proper scaling.


Schnorr wouldn't help in that particular scenario because Schnorr's scaling advantage is that it aggregates signatures, and in a batch as optimized as that -- i.e. "1 input 32,256 outputs" -- there's only one signature to aggregate. But it will help us get higher numbers under more realistic scenarios. For example, the signature aggregation will incentivize people to use coinjoins, which are a form of batch transaction; but in a coinjoin, there are lots of inputs and lots of signatures. Each input in a coinjoin reduces the number of possible outputs in the total batch, and under current conditions so does each signature; but Schnorr will help by making it possible to aggregate all the signatures in a batch into one signature, thus freeing up space for more outputs, i.e. more recipients. So we'll probably never hit 32,256 outputs in a single block, but with Schnorr we'll definitely be able to hit much higher numbers than we currently get.


MAST allows us take complicated scripts and reduce their size so that they are no larger than an ordinary transaction. People who use complicated scripts will be incentivized to use MAST because the reduced data size saves them money, since you have to pay for each bit of data you put on the blockchain. Once MAST is widely adopted, we could integrate complicated scripts in with other batches and they won't take up so much extra space; so it frees up more space than we're currently using, but it wouldn't help us get to more than 32,256 outputs per block as the absolute theoretical maximum.


No, it is possible. As soon as a coinjoin service builds support for lightning (and a lightning client builds support for cosigning a batch transaction), the participants in each coinjoin will be able to open and/or close lightning channels in batches. To open a channel via a batch transaction, you'll just need to provide your input identifiers to the batch creator, same as you do now in a coinjoin (note: there's no way to steal someone's coins with just the input identifier, which is already publicly available on the blockchain), share with him or her the address of your counterparty-to-be (which you can get by pinging any lightning node that accepts incoming connections), wait for the batch creator to craft the batch transaction, and then cosign it with your counterparty (assuming it matches the parameters you specified). Bada-bing-bada-boom, the transaction gets broadcast and mined, and you've got yourself some coinjoined coins in a lightning channel via a batch transaction, and you paid less in fees because you were smart and patient and split the signature cost with everyone else in the batch.

You're premise is "currency needs to flow." That's mostly false, but there is a kernel of truth in there. Any society's currency is whatever thing people can most easily trade for other things. This is a property called saleability. Currency doesn't need to flow (mostly), it just needs to be saleable, which is usually achieved by being desirable. The kernel of truth within your statement is that, in most cases, a currency-candidate's saleability will be low if people don't know what it is or how to use it, and "flow" helps increase knowledge of those things. But it's mostly not required. What's required is saleability -- and bitcoin is achieving that without people increasing its flow.

"Aside from the answer, tell me the answer!"
@_date: 2019-02-17 21:05:05
You are basically correct, with some clarifications.
First, if by "lightning addresses" you mean the QR codes you see when someone is requesting a lightning payment, that's actually not an address. It's an invoice, or a payment request. They don't last forever, like addresses do; they expire after a certain amount of time, and the longest expiry I've seen is two days. That said, it is possible right now to create invoices that don't have a specific amount of money in the request -- they leave it up to the payer.
Second, the Sphinx Send feature is planned for the next lightning upgrade, and will allow people to give their node ID out and receive payments directly to it without an invoice. If two nodes have already merged the Sphinx code, they can actually already do this; this upgrade doesn't require the whole network to adopt it, though most of the network probably will adopt it, since it's very useful. As Sphinx Send grows in usage, the term "lightning address" may take on new meaning as a reference to your node ID.
Third, *lightning channel addresses* are different from *lightning addresses,* in part because the latter isn't a widely used term yet and probably won't be until Sphinx Send grows in usage. But more importantly, lightning *channel* addresses are part of the underlying bitcoin blockchain, and in order to spend money from a lightning *channel* address, both you and your counterparty have to cosign a transaction. This means that if money comes in that you weren't prepared for, your counterparty can theoretically hold that money hostage. It is therefore important that lightning wallet users specify how much money they want to receive into their lightning channel addresses before they receive money into them, and then get their counterparty to cosign a future channel closure transaction in advance that gives the user their cut of the incoming funds (which, initially at least, should be the whole amount).
If any of that sounds confusing, this is part of why writing user friendly lightning wallets is a challenge for engineers. Ideally we'd like to abstract all of the stuff that's difficult to understand away from the user. We want the wallet to handle all of that on the backend, and give the user simple buttons to do what they want, like "Send" and Receive." A second ideal is that it should all be backward compatible with how bitcoin works now. But those are somewhat tough goals to achieve when you're dealing with the nuts and bolts of how it all works. We can expect that various developers will try a lot of different methods of achieving both ideals, and some of the resulting wallets will be more user friendly than others.

But pruning does help more people run nodes, and "more people running nodes" is the endgame here. If we can get to that point without lowering the block size, I think Luke would be happy. He just wants a higher percentage of bitcoin users to run nodes, and he thinks that lowering the blocksize will help make that happen. But lets just get everyone running nodes and then we won't need to lower the blocksize.

If you're talking about the lightning network, there's no such thing as a lightning token. The lightning network is simply a network of bitcoin wallets. Those wallets are able to transmit bitcoin payments between one another instantly and cheaply. The speed and low-cost of these payments are not due to using a different token, they are due to the nature of how these wallets work: instead of broadcasting payments to the blockchain (which is expensive and slow), the wallets that are part of the lightning network communicate with one another to independently construct and verify payment contracts denominated in bitcoin, and they only send those payment contracts back and forth without sending them to the blockchain for miner verification (except in rare cases when someone on the network tries to cheat). Since the majority of these payments aren't broadcast on the blockchain, they don't need to pay mining fees or wait for confirmations, which makes lightning payments faster and cheaper than "standard" bitcoin payments. But they're still bitcoin payments. There's no separate "lightning token." Just bitcoins.

Well, it's one of the easier ways, but there are plenty of cheaper ways. If you sign up for an exchange like Kraken or Gemini, you can usually place a "market order" where your fee is less than 1%. On an exchange, you can also place an order for an amount that differs from the current price; for example, if you place an order for an amount $50 lower than the current price, your order will sit in a queue. If/when bitcoin's price dips to that level, your order will get filled.
Bitcoin's a pretty volatile asset, so you can usually get a pretty decent discount over the current price if you're able to spare some time to wait. (Of course this also means taking on more risk, since the price might not dip to your target price for weeks, or ever. Imagine setting a target of $350 back when bitcoin was $400 and then missing out on all the upside because it never dipped to that level again!)

This sentence is not true in all cases, but in the OP's case it's probably true. P2SH is a script address, or you might call it a smart contract address; you can build any script or smart contract into it and then spend the coins sent to that address by running that script (or fulfilling the terms of that contract). One of the scripts you can put in it is the segwit script, but, since scripts are stackable, there is no limit to the kinds of scripts you can put in it. Multisignature schemes are another popular script type that usually use 3-style addresses. Ever since segwit came out, it's become more popular for wallets to use 3-style addresses for segwit, but it's by no means "what that address-type is for." It's for any script or smart contract.

If you want to do this without a wallet you'll have to buy bitcoins from a seller who accepts paypal and then have the seller send those bitcoins to the address of your recipient. But good luck finding someone who sells bitcoins and accepts paypal as a form of payment -- paypal transactions are easy to reverse for up to a month or more after they happen, whereas bitcoin payments are irreversible, so scammers will often offer to buy bitcoins via paypal and then reverse the transaction after they've received the bitcoins.

BlueWallet has a nice "import" tool where you can type in whatever info you have and the wallet will automatically search for your money in a variety of derivation paths and address formats. The off-chain part is also non-custodial, so the wallet won't share your private keys with a third party. It does, however, query third parties to find out the balance of each of your addresses, so it's not a very private wallet. But the import tool is pretty nifty if you're not worried about privacy.

One of the important points from this talk is this: bitcoin developer Andrew Poelstra is confident that he has figured out a workaround to put a mimblewimble coin on the lightning network, enabling trustless atomic swaps between bitcoin and a mimblewimble coin. If/when the kinks are worked out and they get a working implementation, this should allow us to use mimblewimble similarly to how we might use a bitcoin sidechain; specifically, you should be able to trustlessly move bitcoins back and forth in and out of mimblewimble, thus perfectly masking and anonymizing your onchain transactions, and also route them over lightning, thus perfectly masking and anonymizing your offchain transactions.
The problem is, they're still working out a kink regarding how to do timelocks. But Andrew has a theory involving two elements -- zero-knowledge proofs and using the bitcoin blockchain as a trustless oracle to tell you an accurate approximation of the current time -- and he seems to think that by a clever combination of these two elements, there is at least an *implication* that timelocks are possible on mimblewimble. But, from what I can tell, it seems he hasn't figured out how to actually do it yet. So he's calling on developers to work with him on this to make it happen.

How would it know the average number of transactions for future blocks though? I don't imagine Bitcoin Core is pinging a block explorer and trusting it for accurate information without verifying it. Could it be trusting its peers for that information since it's only an estimate and can't cause harm to your system? If so, it seems like an attack vector for social engineering. Malicious peers could feed you false information about how close you are to having the full chain downloaded. Imagine if your client said you were downloading blocks just fine, but your verificationprogress value was jumping all over the place because one of your peers was feeding you false information about the average number of transactions in future blocks. I doubt Bitcoin Core trusts that information without some form of verification, because such an attack might lead some people to cancel the initial block download.

They'd be very affected. A person with 51% of the hashrate can do two main things: censor onchain transactions and take back money that they've already spent, even after 6 confirmations. Since lightning transactions happen offchain, a typical lightning transaction would be immune from a 51% attack, but the attacker could theoretically censor all HTLCs and prevent them from being confirmed on the blockchain, which would prevent people from opening and/or closing lightning channels. Even worse, the attacker could put money into an HTLC, let it get 6 confirmations, spend the money over lightning, and then take back the funds that originally went into his channel. His counterparty would be screwed because he already sent a payment out of his half of the channel, based on the assumption that he would receive the confirmed-in-channel funds of the attacker, but now they're gone. So a 51% attacker could "fake" a lightning payment and use that to steal other people's bitcoins.

They didn't find those 16 collisions by searching for random numbers. There are many faulty pseudo-random number generation techniques which poor developers used (or still use) for generating bitcoin private keys. Since these faulty generators don't actually produce random numbers, you can game them and estimate a relatively small range of possible numbers that they are most likely to generate. A project like the Large Bitcoin Collider can then search through these non-random numbers for bitcoin private keys. And behold what happens: that website claims to have found 16. But rest assured -- bitcoin's not at risk.

The first transaction in a block is the "mining reward." It is created by the act of mining. It pays 12.5 bitcoins to one of the miner's addresses, plus whatever fees were paid by the transactions in that block. It is the only transaction in the block that can't be linked to a prior address where the coins came from -- they are created out of thin air by the miner as a reward to himself, and all bitcoin nodes accept this as valid because the rules say it's valid as long as the reward is limited to 12.5 bitcoins + fees.

Yes, it will likely be the first lightning implementation written in Python. Ptarmigan is writing theirs in C, the same language C-lightning is using, so there will be two independent implementations in the same language. If you want more details about the Electrum implementation, you can find that [here]( Note that the first thread on that page originally said that they were just planning to integrate an existing implementation, and mentioned LND as a possibility, but that was back in June of 2017. The most recent update in that particular thread (posted in November 2018) says that the plan is now to actually do an independent implementation in Python. And the other threads on that page reflect the development status of the Python implementation.

Here's a line-by-line explanation:


Translation:  One guy sent bitcoin to another guy via shortwave radio. He used a free protocol for shortwave communications to do this. The protocol is called JS8Call, and it lets you connect a shortwave radio to a computer and essentially send and receive shortwave-transmitted text messages to other JS8Call users without having to obtain a special license.


That link shows the transaction where the recipient transferred the bitcoins into his wallet.


These are the locations, from and to.


The sender didn't prepare a signed transaction and then send it to his recipient so he could broadcast it to the blockchain, though he could have done that. Instead, he sent his recipient a private key, and the recipient transferred the funds to his wallet using that private key.
The last picture is a visual representation of data that came from the sender's shortwave radio. Shortwave radios hear background electromagnetic "noise" all the time (also known as static), and when they receive a recognizable signal, it can be visually represented as a blip or interruption in the background noise. The graphic portrays a blip in the static which appeared as an agreed-upon signal meaning, "Yup, I got your private key."

If you're talking about the lightning network, there's no such thing as a lightning token. The lightning network is simply a network of bitcoin wallets. Those wallets are able to transmit bitcoin payments between one another instantly and cheaply. The speed and low-cost of these payments are not due to using a different token, they are due to the nature of how these wallets work: instead of broadcasting payments to the blockchain, the wallets that are part of the lightning network communicate with one another to independently construct and verify payment contracts denominated in bitcoin, and they only send those payment contracts back and forth without sending them to the blockchain for miner verification (except in rare cases when someone on the network tries to cheat). Since the majority of these payments aren't broadcast on the blockchain, they don't need to pay mining fees or wait for confirmations, which makes lightning payments faster and cheaper than "standard" bitcoin payments. But they're still bitcoin payments. There's no separate "lightning token." Just bitcoins.

To some extent, the answer is typically yes, but not easily or cheaply. The need to run your own node is mostly relevant to businesses and whales because they're the only people who are "worth it" to go through the effort to trick their light wallet. Light wallets don't validate network rules (that's what makes them "light"), they typically connect to someone else's node (like the nodes on the electrum network, or an exchange's node, or the wallet creator's node) and ask that node for information, and trust that information to be accurate. So if the scammer gains control over the node(s) your wallet is trusting, they can feed your wallet false information, f.ex making it think it received a payment when it really hasn't.

1. Bitcoin's computer network is the most secure cryptographic network to ever exist. That creates utility beyond just being money, which is why big companies are building non-monetary products on it (e.g. Microsoft is leveraging the security of bitcoin's blockchain to store and verify ownership of a person's digital identity, and some universities are offering to put your degree on the blockchain because that makes it easy both to access the degree later and to prove it was put on there by a wallet belonging to the degree-issuing university, making it harder to trick someone using a fraudulent degree).
2. Even if that wasn't true, money doesn't need to have non-monetary utility in order to be useful as a medium of exchange. Dollars have no intrinsic value either but they are still useful as a medium of exchange. What makes a thing useful as money is not that it has non-monetary uses, it's that it can *represent* value so that people can trade things easier by agreeing on a common standard of value.
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:02:33
Yes, you can download the blockchain and check your ledger entry. If you think of the blockchain as a giant spreadsheet, it would have two main columns that would be of interest to you: the "ID" column, where all non-empty bitcoin addresses would go (note that the blockchain doesn't know anyone's \*real\* identity because the whole thing is based on random-number addresses), and the second column would be the balance of each address. So if you know your address (and know the private key that lets you move funds out of that address), you can look up your address on the blockchain (or any blockchain explorer, such as [blockstream.info]( and your balance will appear right next to it.
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:42:47
Your payment can't leave your wallet until you receive a preimage originating from Satoshi Living Room, and they shouldn't give you that preimage until they've received your payment. So your payment is still in your wallet. Eclair is probably waiting until Satoshi Living Room is back online to try to push the payment through again, so you have until that time to cancel it. I don't know how to cancel it though, so that's the limit of the help I can give. (Sorry.)
Note: if the first sentence of this post sounds like a contradiction, it's not. When a lightning payment is set up, each party involved -- including all intermediary nodes -- have to create and sign a payment contract that will send money to their counterparty if and only if they fulfill that contract by giving the payer a random number (called a preimage) created by the recipient. Once the recipient has a signed transaction by his counterparty, he reveals the preimage, and uses it to fulfill his contract. His counterparty then has it, so he uses it to fulfill his contract, which means that his counterparty has it, and so forth until it gets back to the original payer. So if you don't have that contract, then your payment is still in your wallet, and the recipient shouldn't give you that preimage until they've received your payment.

It doesn't happen on bitcoin for two reasons: first, every byte of data you add to bitcoin's blockchain costs money (that's the mining fee), and second, it takes a long time to put something data-intensive on the blockchain because every block has a low weight limit. These two protections were added to bitcoin by Satoshi precisely to protect against spamming the network. Without mining fees and weight limits, it would be easy to clog the blockchain with junk data, which would slow it down and reduce its security.

I'm not sure how Coinbase works, but here is one way they could do it:
Coinbase might hold a merchant's bitcoins in a custodial wallet and assign the merchant a username and password. The merchant could then view their balance by typing in that username and password on the Coinbase website. Then, if another user "sends" that merchant bitcoins, the \*user\* might send bitcoins, but it wouldn't necessarily go directly to the merchant, because he has no address. Instead, it would go to Coinbase, who would then keep the bitcoins in their own wallet, and simply update a number on the merchant's dashboard -- without actually giving the merchant any bitcoins. In effect, the merchant would have no address to give to. Coinbase could then make further demands on the merchant, telling them (in nice language) that they will only update the merchant's balance if the bitcoins come from a Coinbase wallet, that way the merchant would have to either stop using Coinbase or put up a sign saying something like "We only accept bitcoins from Coinbase wallets."
To be clear, I don't think that is how Coinbase actually operates, but it's just one possible way of doing it that seems relatively easy to implement to my untrained mind.

I use one on a daily basis, and I am really hoping someone makes a lightning-based alternative. I am set against storing any funds on the card other than what I'm about to immediately spend. Bitpay charges an additional mining fee on top of the standard mining fee, and the additional one is non-negotiably set for next-block confirmation, so it can get expensive when there's network congestion. The "standard" mining fee is also tricky, because they don't tell you what you should set it to. If you set it high enough, they'll give you your dollars instantly, without waiting for any confirmations on the blockchain, but if you set it too low they won't put any dollars on the card until 1 confirmation. The fee that counts as "high enough" changes based on network conditions but they never inform you what to set it to.
The card works at most places but there are some places that don't accept prepaid cards, which is what the Bitpay card is. For example, it doesn't work at Wendy's or Cinemark. But it works at every other place I've tried -- gas stations, McDonald's, burger king, walmart, ATMs, etc.

I'm not happy that Bitpay uses the payment protocol they chose instead of BIP21.

There's an in-development lightweight client called Spruned which uses the same command line commands as bitcoin core, but passes them all to the Electrum network instead of relying on a downloaded blockchain. It has been shown to work on raspberry pis and even with c-lightning.
But you could also use bitcoin core but just run it from the command line with this argument: --prune=550 and it will only store the most recent 550 megabytes of blocks. (You can also write "prune=550" in bitcoin.conf to achieve the same thing without typing in an argument every time.) That makes Bitcoin Core not take as much storage space and still gives you full sovereignty over your money instead of relying on the electrum network.

No, they are not lost forever. Lightning wallets are a type of bitcoin wallet. They use bitcoin addresses just like all other bitcoin wallets do. If your lightning wallet goes down, your bitcoins are still in your addresses. Once you can connect to the internet again, you can restore your wallet (as long as you made a backup) and get back to business. The only difference is that with a lightning wallet you also have to backup/restore your channels in addition to your private keys. But it's not that much extra data.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's a period of time in the future when people keep their savings in a non-custodial wallet but use a custodial service for daily expenses. E.g. deposit $150 into Spedn (or whatever service has a widely accepted payment method in the future) and use that until it runs out, then top it up from their non-custodial wallet. If that is part of the future we end up with, lightning will still make it a whole lot easier, because lightning can speed up deposits to such a service (and withdrawals from it into a non-custodial wallet) while also making those deposits/withdrawals very cheap. However, in such a future, companies will always have the option of integrating lightning directly instead of using a custodial service, and if bitcoin usage grows that will become an ever more attractive option, in order to save on whatever fees a service like Spedn has up its sleeve for the merchants who "partner" with them.

Neutrino wallets are a type of SPV wallet, and all SPV wallets are vulnerable to a Proof of Work attack. Since SPV wallets don't verify transactions but only check that the proof of work has been done, any miner could cheat an SPV wallet by mining an invalid block with valid proof of work. They could then put an invalid transaction in there paying the SPV wallet for some product. The SPV wallet would check the proof of work, see that it matches what the bitcoin network says the proof of work should currently be, and then accept the invalid transaction, since SPV wallets don't verify transactions. The miner would walk away with the product, and the SPV wallet would be broken since it has accepted a block that all full nodes reject.
In short, SPV wallets are not trustless. They trust miners not to cheat them. A base bitcoin node is necessary in order to have a trustless (or trust minimized) wallet.

Yes, and/or you can keep using them. Intermediary nodes can't tell from whom a payment originated, so there's no real way for them to stop you from using them. The best they can do is sever/ignore an *immediate* connection with you -- but then you'd just need to remove yourself one step from them and they'd have no way of knowing if you're using them or not. So hubs -- if they ever develop -- really wouldn't have any control at all over anything significant, so a hub and spoke model would pose zero danger to the network.

Not necessarily. I don't know a lot about JS8Call yet, but I do know that two people communicating over JS8Call can encrypt their communications before transmitting sensitive information. For example, you could do a diffie-hellman key exchange to first encrypt your communication, and then transmit your private key via that encrypted channel.
Nonetheless, that is all needlessly complicated if you just want to transmit a bitcoin transaction. Those don't need to be encrypted because they don't contain any sensitive information and they're intended for public download on the open blockchain anyway. So all the sender would need to do is prepare and sign a transaction, then transmit *that.* These gentlemen clearly could have done this in a better way, but as a proof-of-concept I am pretty excited about it. If you can transmit a private key, you can transmit a bitcoin transaction.
This is just more proof that bitcoin doesn't need the internet. As the [JS8Call faq]( puts it: "Do I need a connection to the internet to use JS8Call? [Answer:] No you don’t, FT8Call only requires your computer to be connected to your radio."

Payment channels \*were\* a part of the original protocol ([source]( but they didn't work properly because there was a bug that allowed miners to steal from payment channels. At the time, bitcoin was new and transaction fees were low, so very little work was done to improve payment channels. They simply weren't needed yet, and there were higher priority issues to work on, including bugs in the consensus code that affected everyone, whereas fixing payment channels wouldn't have helped anyone at the time because no one needed them yet. Shortly before 2015's release of the LN whitepaper, serious work started being done on payment channels again, culminating in the LN whitepaper, and they are now regarded as an essential scaling improvement.

Bitcoin wallets create a new address every time you receive coins. If someone looks up that address on the blockchain, it will either be empty (if it hasn't received anything yet) or it will only have that one transaction.

In my opinion, that's a good thing. If a person's self-joins are truly indistinguishable from larger coinjoins, no one would be negatively impacted by their presence on the marketplace (no one would even know). If they are just slightly distinguishable for some reason, that distinguishability can be a litmus test that some buyers use in order to consider buying from someone else.


My thinking was that you could get raided because the FBI's chain analysts claim that they've linked the utxo you bought to illegal activity and then the FBI infers that you can help them identify the culprit because you bought coins from him. (The existence of a perfectly innocent public market for coinjoined coins would also give you an excellent defense if any cop tried to pin some trumped-up charges on you, which is an added plus.) If post-mixing is done properly by the seller, that shouldn't be an issue, and as public knowledge of the marketplace grows, incidences of guilt-by-association raids (if they happen at all) should decrease.

Another poster said you have the right idea. But you're missing a few things too. Let's say you open a lightning channel with someone on the lightning network, and you put $100 in it, but your counterparty doesn't put anything in. That means you can spend up to $100 from that channel to anyone on the network. However, typically, you can't receive money into that channel until you've spent some of that $100. A lightning channel can hold an amount of money equal to the combined amount that you and your counterparty put into that channel. If there's only $100 in it, and it's all currently in your possession, then your lightning channel is full and can't receive anything. You've got to empty it at least a little bit by sending money through the network. Once you do, you can start receiving payments until your channel is full again.
I hope that helps. Let me know.

True. Due to the ongoing improvements in swap technology, people can already pay over lightning with BTC, ETH, LTC, or Liquid tokens, and the merchant can choose which of those he wants to receive the payment in.

It is possible to make a bitcoin-backed debit card. Wirex, TenX, and Bitpay already offer them. None of those companies support lightning payments yet, but it's only a matter of time til one of them does or a competitor emerges who offers a debit card option. The only problem with those cards is that the companies actually put dollars on them in return for your bitcoins; at that point they're no different from a normal debit card, so you're still paying standard debit card fees, which are now up to 3% of each transaction. (Well, the merchant actually pays those fees, but they're ultimately getting the money for it from their customers by increasing the prices on their products.)
I don't know of a method to put \*actual\* bitcoins on a debit card-like tool and have it be backward compatible with current systems.
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:22:45
Those are all very difficult engineering questions and we'll probably see several different implementations that try different answers. One method would be:
- When a lightning wallet produces onchain addresses, use BIP21 with a new "lightning" parameter so that it also puts an optional lightning invoice after the onchain address. BIP21 is already in use on the network so this would be backward compatible with existing wallets. If the sending wallet recognizes the lightning invoice, it will use that instead of the onchain address; if it doesn't recognize the lightning invoice, it will ignore it and use the onchain address instead
- Ensure that all onchain addresses produced by a lightning wallet are actually lightning channel addresses which specify how much to send to them. That way, the user doesn't have to worry about opening new channels; every time they receive onchain bitcoins the wallet either opens a new channel or adds them to an existing channel
- When sending an onchain payment, either use the "Splice Out" feature (which hasn't been coded up yet) to send funds out of a channel without closing it, or use decentralized swap technology so that someone else on the network trustlessly sends an onchain transaction for you and you trustlessly reimburse them with a lightning payment (trustless outbound swap technology ALSO hasn't been coded up yet)
- Have one special exception to the "only use lightning channel addresses" rule. Specifically, if a user wants to put an address out there without knowing how much people will send to it (e.g. if it's for donations on a webpage), have a special button for producing such addresses -- because they should not be lightning channel addresses -- and create them using BIP21 with a "Sphinx" parameter, allowing wallets which recognize "Sphinx send" to "push" lightning payments to your lightning node, and otherwise to ignore it and use the non-lightning onchain address. Then have the wallet alert the user when any money is sent to that address and ask them if they want to add it to a channel (and tell them how much it will cost in onchain fees to do so)

Bitcoin devs won't ignore what's going on in litecoin but there are no short or medium term plans to do anything similar. Extension blocks are not battle-tested (litecoin will help with that) and they are also controversial at the conceptual level. Personally, I think they are a bad idea in general, bad enough that we should only use them if we desperately need a particular upgrade and we've tried everything else besides extension blocks and hard forks. Litecoin's MW proposal takes the badness of extension blocks to a new level because it makes privacy opt-in, which is pretty useless at the base layer. You can already opt-in to privacy in bitcoin on second layers and via wallets that support coinjoin. If we're going to make bitcoin private at the base layer, we shouldn't make it opt-in. \*Public\* transactions should be an option, private transactions should be the default.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:16:42
The rules say that if you hold someone else's private keys, you have to collect personal data from them, such as asking them who they are paying and the source of their income. Bottle Pay didn't want to ask those questions, because it's privacy invasion. So they chose to shut down instead. Interestingly, the new rules "direct" EU countries to implement these rules for custodial wallets, but they also "recommend" targeting non-custodial wallets. Which is insane. A company like Acinq could be forced to add KYC to their lightning implementation or else disband the company. The code would immediately be forked out by users, of course, since it's open source, but it's still an act of governmental insanity to even "recommend" such draconian rules.

Luke Dashjr is the main guy promoting lighter blocks, and I've mostly come around to his way of thinking. If it was implemented, it would need to have more than 50% consensus, and it would a temporary softfork. "Temporary" meaning there would be a timeout built into the code, something like "For the next 4 years, if a block is larger than 100kb, reject it. After those 4 years, blocks can be up to \~4mb once again." (4mb is the current weight limit.)
Right now there's not enough consensus to do it, I doubt we even have 5% of people who would install that code. But it seems like the number of good arguments against smaller block sizes keeps dropping as lightning usage grows.

When you make a lightning payment you are giving your counterparty a valid bitcoin transaction id, one which you have not yet broadcast to the bitcoin blockchain. This transaction id is for a transaction which, if it was broadcast, would send some of the bitcoins in your channel to him, and the remainder back to you. He doesn't broadcast this, however, because it would close the channel. Instead, he hangs onto it until the next channel update, which usually means one of two things: either you sent your counterparty some more money (perhaps he's a routing node and thus he is merely sending it on to someone else) or you received some money from your counterparty (likewise, that money might only be routed through your counterparty, but from the perspective of your channel it's still money moving from him to you). Each channel update is a new bitcoin transaction id, and each of those transaction IDs needs to be valid in order that you may properly close your lightning channel whenever you wish to do so.
The problem is, there is not currently any way to render an old bitcoin transaction id invalid except by moving the money on the blockchain to a new address. Since "moving the money on the blockchain" is expensive and slow (and is really the precise thing that lightning transactions are trying to avoid), it's not really an option until you're ready to close your channel. So you're stuck with allowing your counterparty to keep old bitcoin transaction IDs which are still valid, but which would now send incorrect amounts to you and your counterparty if they were broadcast. Your counterparty can theoretically cheat you by broadcasting one of these old transaction IDs if he has one that pays him more money than the "latest" one.
In order to counteract this problem, the developers are working on a new soft fork called eltoo, which you can think of as a way to invalidate an old transaction ID. (That's not Really what eltoo does, but it has a similar effect: it makes it so that, even if an old transaction id is broadcast to the bitcoin network and confirmed, the money from that transaction can still be recovered by publishing a new transaction that contains proof that the money in the old transaction was supposed to go somewhere else.) In the meantime, they've made a different solution, involving timelocks, where, if someone broadcasts a lightning transaction without the cooperation of their counterparty, it gets "put on hold" by the network for up to two weeks, and, during that time, the counterparty may broadcast a newer transaction id that takes the money first.

It's interesting to me that the author chose to put Rootstock under "Sidechains" and tBTC under "Smart Contracts." tBTC is a way of putting bitcoin onto the Eth network with a 2-way peg. Assuming the project is successful, how will we differentiate Eth from a sidechain? A sidechain is just a blockchain with a 2-way peg, right? Because Eth will be that. And anyone who wants a preview of tBTC's 2-way peg can already use wBTC with Bitgo or sBTC with Synthetix. Those solutions are more centralized, but they still offer a 2-way peg between the bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain.

"**Email a way** of sending and receiving messages." (missing "is")
"...unless everyone agrees to the **change** and implements the **changes**." (singular or plural? should be consistent)
"If a transaction sits for 3 days, it’s returned and the funds stay where they are." That's not true anymore, the only way to recover unconfirmed coins now is by using replace-by-fee.
"there will be very little new bitcoin **getting** created by way of mining." (unnecessary auxiliary verb)
"Some have their advantages like faster transactions, or more capacity, or more privacy." Consider modifying to "Some claim to have advantages," etc. If you highlight the most important positives without mentioning the most important negatives it could create the wrong impression. Mentioning that the positives are "claimed" hedges the claim a bit, because you're not saying the claim is true.
"Core developers have written very difficult code..." I think you mean "very technical code." "Very difficult code" can be interpreted as "very bad code."
"Jack Dorsey is the CEO of Twitter and Square. He referred to Bitcoin as the national currency of the Internet." He also made it a core offering of the Square Cash app.
"The main Bitcoin blockchain is limited to **\~27 transactions per second**." It's actually \~7 transactions per second, unless you include batched transactions, in which case the upper bound is much higher than \~27 tps. Sometimes a couple of exchanges will batch up 2400+ outputs in one or two payments, which makes the tps count, for such a block, higher than 40 tps.
Overall, a very good article!

A pretty high amount of trust is needed iiuc. The hard part is the private keys, as always. If anyone who has ever had the coins reveals the private keys to the statechain operator, the statechain operator can collude with the prior owner to move the coins. At least, that is how I understand it. The upshot is simply that this can be a solution for anyone who doesn't mind trusting an institution with their money.
The benefit of this over something like paypal is, under standard operating procedure, the institution does not have your private keys, so they aren't liable to the same requirements as a custodial financial institution. If a prior owner *tells them* your private keys, they would just need to responsibly dispose of that information and (ideally) advise you to move the coins. But they wouldn't suddenly acquire the qualities of a custodial institution if that happened, no more than Oscar Meijer Weiner would suddenly come under the requirements of the bank secrecy act if if someone randomly told them your debit card number and pin. They would just have to (1) not keep that information and (2) (ideally) tell you that you should change your info.

I don't think the mark of the beast is a currency. I think it's a symbol that people will have to wear or possibly a symbolic salute (think of Nazism). The Book of Revelation contrasts it with the mark of the Lamb (mentioned in Revelation 7:3, Revelation 9:4, Revelation 14:1, and Revelation 22:4) and the name of God. Since the mark of the Lamb is unlikely to be a currency, the mark of the Beast is also (in my opinion) unlikely to be a currency. I think it is more likely to be a badge with the antichrist's name or a symbol associated with him, perhaps a national symbol.
The early Christians sometimes interpreted the mark of the Lamb to be the Tau (a Hebrew letter that used to be shaped like a cross) because in a parallel passage in Ezekiel 9:4, which foretells that God will "put a mark on the foreheads of \[believers\]," the word "mark" in Hebrew is the letter Tau. This is partly the origin of the "sign of the cross," made with the finger and/or thumb by tracing the form of a cross (a "tau") on one's forehead as a symbol of one's Christianity. Later that also morphed into a whole-body cross gesture, which Catholics and Orthodox still do. Catholics also continue to do the original forehead-cross-gesture before the gospel is read at Mass.
The Book of Revelation says that the mark of the beast will be required in order to engage in commerce. In my opinion, this implies that unregulated commerce will be forbidden, whether or not bitcoin is used.

You can still do CPFP. Check to see if you've got any change coming back to one of your addresses; if you do, send the money from that change address to another address you own, and give that transaction a very high fee. The miners will want to mine your second transaction to get the high fee, but they need to mine the original first so that the change properly ends up in the address you're spending from. So they'll need to mine both. The "child" transaction thus pays for the "parent" transaction -- CPFP.

No, the reason the hash difficulty level sometimes rises is not because of the nature of elliptic curve cryptography. Hash difficulty drops sometimes too, as you can see from [this graph]( The hash difficulty level usually rises because mining is profitable and that profitability draws more miners in. The network adjusts to the increased number of miners by increasing the difficulty of mining so that blocks are found at the same rate they were found at before. But for most miners there are occasions when mining is not profitable, causing them to turn off their mining equipment. When that happens, the network adjusts by lowering the difficulty. That's why on the graph I just linked you to, you can see that mining sometimes gets harder, but other times it gets easier.


Miners aren't only rewarded with the built-in block reward, they are also rewarded with mining fees collected from each transaction. We expect the miners to get most of their rewards from the fees by that time.

If it is a bitcoin address, there is no need to keep it secret in your case, it's just a tool for receiving money and checking your balance. You can view the balance of the address by typing the address into [blockstream.info]( However, having a bitcoin address will not help you spend the money -- addresses are "receive only." In order to spend the money, you'll need the private key.
If it is a private key, then you can spend the money in it by importing it into a wallet such as Electrum. Electrum will then calculate the balance and give you easy buttons for spending and receiving.

First of all, he says the records of the credit card purchase won't be available until 25 years have elapsed. In lieu of providing that documentary evidence, he posted a screenshot of part of an html page. Anyone who knows how to right-click in Chrome can duplicate that "evidence." So it's meaningless.
Second of all, he says that one of the reasons why he won't sign a transaction with one of Satoshi's keys is because it's "not proof of anything other than the possession of \[those\] key\[s\]." Seems to me like that's a lot. Having Satoshi's keys would bolster his claims to be Satoshi. He argues that it wouldn't legally prove his claim, but the thing that really matters is this: if he was Satoshi, he could *mathematically* prove it by signing a simple proof with one of Satoshi's keys.
Lastly, you're asking us to "debunk this credit card thing" but the records simply aren't available for proving or debunking it either way. So that's not possible. And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

No, they are both non-custodial. Breez gives you a free channel with 10m sats of inbound capacity (non-custodial) the first time you open the wallet. They try to recoup the transaction fee via routing fees, and they'll close the free channel if you never use it. Phoenix gives you inbound capacity when you receive your first lightning payment and they charge an upfront transaction fee for opening the channel. (They, too, are non-custodial.)

There's a formula involving 8 decimal places per coin, 10 minute blocks, a halving every 4 years, and 50 coins per block as the initial distribution. With 10 minute blocks (a nice round number), the concept "a halving every 4 years" turns into "a halving every 210,000 blocks." If you divide 50 coins in half at block 210,000, and then do the same thing again at block 420,000, and so on, the result you get is that -- when 130 years have elapsed -- bitcoin will need to divide from 1 satoshi to 0.5 satoshis. It can't do that because there's only 8 decimal places, so it just stops dividing, resulting in slightly under 21 million coins.

Staking sucks at insuring the value of the staked asset.
Nonetheless, staking is awesome in projects like joinmarket and lightning, where sats are staked in a non-custodial manner in order to make them available for profitable services like coinjoins and instant transactions. You can make real money by staking sats using those services, and you make bitcoin a better money in the process. For-profit staking FTW!

Yeah I would love for the ux of any existing coinjoin app to be improved, but I guess the point of this idea is that a marketplace interface could easily be faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly than any foreseeable coinjoin interface. For example, coinjoining a utxo 5x will always take more time than buying one that was already coinjoined 5x. Buying utxos can also be done over the web (see e.g. submarineswaps.org), because the client-side computation and interaction is small enough that a browser can do it, whereas for any coinjoin, you have to download a client.


Yes, I don't see a good way to be sure the post-mixing was done properly. One consideration: if coinjoined utxos were bought from lightning nodes, the buyers could rate and review any given seller's node. "5/5 experienced no fbi raids." Then other users could decide whether to buy coins from a reputable dealer or a cheaper noob.

@_date: 2019-02-10 21:37:38
Very poor software design. It's a form of mutually assured destruction and relies upon both parties in a transaction trusting each other not to be a jerk. Specifically, if you use their software, a person who wants to make a payment can't do so until he first gives the recipient a signed transaction spending his entire output as a mining fee. They call this an "insurance transaction." If the payer tries to doublespend his coins after he makes his *real* payment, the recipient can broadcast the insurance transaction, which pays the miners the entire output as a mining fee, thus ensuring that neither the payer nor the recipient gets any money.
There are many problems with this. One is that it doesn't ensure that merchants get their money -- the money is still double-spent, it's just that it's spent to the miners. Jerks can take advantage of this to never pay merchants for anything. Didn't *like* your meal? Just double-spend the coins and the merchant is screwed, because whether they use the "insurance transaction" or not, they don't get any money. So the merchants still have to build in the cost of all those lost transactions into their prices, costing everyone more money. Another problem is that this "solution" forgets that some of the people buying things are miners themselves. So this doesn't at all prevent miners from double-spending -- the "insurance transaction" goes to the miners, so when the miners are the ones buying, the only insurance involved is that they'll get their money back no matter what.
Very stupid idea and very dumb software.

His argument is similar to this one:
No one will use Visa cards because the amount of money you get back in reward points is very low; you'd make more money doing something else.
In both cases, the reasoning is wrong because it takes itty bitty secondary incentives and treats them like the main reason to use a fast, cheap, and easy payment network. The reason you would use LN is not because you want fees; it's because you want fast and cheap payments, while keeping the other features of bitcoin (decentralized, trustless, uncensorable, unconfiscatable, etc.).
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:18:12
Scalability isn't an on-off switch, it's a continual issue. The more you can scale, the more people find use for your network, causing you to need to scale further, and it never really ends. Right now, LN seems to be about a 15x to 20x scaling improvement. The recent addition of multipath payments could improve that substantially, and there are many upcoming scaling improvements for LN in the works. E.g. channel factories, statechains, and of course Schnorr and Taproot. Scaling is a continual uphill battle but right now bitcoin is making a lot of progress on that front.

That detail would need input from smarter people than me. Developers would likely disagree about the when and the why. But I suspect some reasons in favor of a timeout would include: computers will likely be faster/cheaper by then; bigger blocks become safer over time as users' computers get faster; and using a timeout gives us more soft fork options: you can safely lengthen a timeout by a soft fork, or make it permanent, or let it expire naturally."

You are correct that coinjoin does not hide tx amounts, but coinjoin does obscure your address in one sense: after a coinjoin, no one can tell which of the addresses involved belongs to you. So it gives you a large anonymity set if there are a lot of participants in the coinjoin, or a small anonymity set if there are few participants. Monero, on the other hand, gives you a low anonymity set every time, for several reasons, one of which is that there are so few monero users and they can't get many more users because monero scales up like a dog.
Also, lightning obscures the origin, the destination, and the amount sent, so that too is more private than monero. The sender alone knows all of those pieces of information.

Yes. LND natively supports BTC and LTC. If I'm running Litecoin Core instead of Bitcoin Core (or in addition to it), I can set LND to connect my litecoin node to the lightning network. If I want to allow people to send me bitcoin payments, but I want to receive them in litecoin, I can use a non-custodial intermediary to facilitate the swap without any risk of losing funds. There are already two swap providers who enable this for Litecoin:  and 


Right now it's a rather manual process, but any developer can write an app to automate it. If you go to one of the websites I linked to above, you can create a swap contract with BTCLN as the input and LTCLN as the output. This contract is written in Bitcoin Script (which is the language used by both bitcoin and litecoin), so if your intermediary tries to cheat, you can broadcast a signed transaction to both blockchains to get your money. Anyway, once the contract is set up, you just type your LTCLN invoice into the website, and it will spit out a BTCLN invoice. Give that to the person who wants to pay you, and then they pay the invoice with BTCs, crypto magic happens, and you receive litecoins into your LTCLN channel. And the intermediary cannot even cheat, because you have a signed transaction from him that lets you recover the funds onchain if he tries.
BTW Radar Ion Redshift enables the same thing for Ethereum and C-Lightning enables the same thing for Liquid tokens, because C-Lightning has built-in support for the Liquid sidechain.

If the wallet does not have channel management options, you can send the coins to a wallet that does let you manage your channels (e.g. Eclair for android) and then close the channel, or one that autoswaps from lightning to onchain (e.g. Breez, Phoenix Wallet, or Wallet of Satoshi).

Like you said, the features are constantly changing, but right now Eclair is the only one which has implemented the "liquidity\_provider" feature (which is eventually planned for LND). This is closely related to dual-funded channels. It allows you and your counterparty to both put money into a channel, that way you can immediately spend AND receive.
C-Lightning is the only one that currently supports plugins. Which means anyone can write a script that adds new functionality to C-Lightning without having to fork the code. I've seen various experiments with this to increase its feature set to more closely match LND's feature set, but so far I haven't seen any "must have" plugins.
LND has built-in support for submarine swaps, hodl invoices, and push-payments (where you pay a node directly without asking for an invoice). I believe there are plugins in the works for C-Lightning that do the same thing as hodl invoices, and like you mentioned, their features are all constantly increasing, so some of this may already be outdated info. But they are the things I've noticed.

Well, if nodes forwarded doublespends by default, it would make doublespend attacks easier and anger merchants who accept 0conf transactions, some of whom would likely stop using bitcoin out of anger and/or necessity. On the other hand, it would also discourage 0conf (which is already unsafe) and potentially solve long-term problems by turning them into short-term problems. Many merchants would be angry, but all of them would need to stop accepting 0conf transactions very quickly, which is a positive thing IMO. So that's why I'm divided. Also, there are some legit reasons to attempt a doublespend -- such as if you find out 3 minutes late that you've been scammed and want to recover your money before the tx gets confirmed. So it's a mixed bag, but perhaps on the whole I think we should eventually get to a point where all nodes forward doublespend transactions. But we should probably get there slowly.

Dai -- The Broken Alternative
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:57:22
I've been having problems with my Eclair wallet all day. Its most serious problem was this: it was not displaying a transaction that had been received into one of its addresses and confirmed on the blockchain. My first initial thought was that it might be due to the ongoing Electrum DoS attack; since Eclair relies on the Electrum network, its ability to access data on that network (such as block headers) could be affected. But I checked the wallet's block count in Network Info, and it correctly indicated the then-current block height, so the problem had to be something else. I tried connecting to a new Electrum server, but then it wouldn't update the blockcount past 0, which I attributed to the DoS attack.
I ended up uninstalling/reinstalling, and that solved the issue. It successfully restored my wallet from the seed, re-accessed my channel backups, autoconnected to a new Electrum server, and, after scanning the block headers, correctly displayed my balance as well as the transaction that should have shown up earlier.

I think of Ethereum as a slower, more expensive version of Amazon Web Services. The use cases for that are much smaller than the use cases for global digital cash. The only advantage that Eth has over Amazon is that Eth is slightly less centralized than Amazon (though still very centralized). This means that controversial apps are less likely to get deplatformed on Ethereum, which gives it a use-case: if you release an app and get deplatformed from Amazon because it's for drugs or something, you can release it on Eth and keep operating (until the government decides it's worth it to shut down Eth). Being on Eth will add an additional cost to your product or service (because Eth is expensive), and it will force you to make your app slower (because Eth is slow), so normal companies will prefer Amazon as a platform. But if an app is controversial and gets banned from Amazon and its mainstream competitors, at least that app can keep operating if someone puts it on Eth. That gives Eth some real-world use cases (at least temporarily), but those use-cases are greatly limited compared to bitcoin's.
Litecoin is of even more limited use than Eth. Its creator and lead developer (Charlie Lee) has embraced the narrative that Litecoin is essentially a testnet for bitcoin. It's where developers can test features that may eventually get added to bitcoin, but test them with real-world value, since bitcoin's built-in test network uses coins that are intentionally valueless. Again, this use-case, while real, is of incredibly small potential value compared to bitcoin. As long as litecoin remains essentially a testing stage for bitcoin, it would be irrational to suspect the test currency could outperform the production currency in the market.

No, it's not storage intensive. Lightning nodes aren't the same as bitcoin nodes, they don't need to store the blockchain. Eclair and Bitcoin Lightning Wallet are both full lightning nodes but neither is a full bitcoin node. Instead of storing the blockchain, they use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), which is a technique first described in bitcoin's whitepaper where you can verify whether or not you've received a payment without downloading/storing the whole blockchain. (But in order for this technique to work, SPV wallets need to trust the miners not to broadcast invalid blocks, because SPV wallets can't verify whether a block is valid or not, they just check them to see if they've received any transactions in a given block.)

If you think of a bitcoin transaction as a letter in the mail, the "input" is the "from" address (I'm sending "from" my wallet to yours) and the "output" is the "to" address. But since bitcoin is digital it can have multiple "from" addresses (e.g. you might have coins at two addresses which you're combining for a larger payment, or you might be aggregating payments from multiple collaborators in a coinjoin transaction) and it can also have multiple "to" addresses (like if you want to send half a bitcoin to your grandma and half a bitcoin to your grandpa at the same time, you can do that in the same transaction by simply specifying two outputs, and then you would only have to pay the transaction fee once). Transaction-per-second counters typically ignore multi-output transactions that send money to two or more people. But if you're sending money to 50 people at once, it should really count as 50 transactions per second, not just 1. So that's why outputs per second is a better indicator of how fast bitcoin's base layer can process transactions than transactions per second.

Allowing someone to control 6 to 7% of the supply of bitcoins is not terrorism. It's freedom.
And Satoshi's coins weren't premined. He made the coins in the first block unspendable and ceased all mining operations for six days after releasing the first block. Premining is not the same thing as "mining before I knew about it" and you seem to be confusing the two. Plenty of people knew about bitcoin early on and started mining, including Hal Finney.

It is important to point out that the vast majority of BCH blocks are very small compared to BTC blocks, due to low transaction volume on the BCH blockchain. Bitcoin blocks *would be* smaller than BCH blocks if both blockchains were overflowing with tranactions, but *in practice* bitcoin blocks are much larger than BCH blocks, because more transactions *actually happen* on bitcoin's blockchain than on BCH's blockchain. You can compare the two blockchains' sizes at  TLDR: Bitcoin's blocks are currently averaging at 1.2 mb, while BCH blocks are averaging at 0.12 mb.

If you're a merchant you ought to run your own node anyway, because mobile wallets can't do any sort of verification that the transactions they receive are valid until those transactions are confirmed on the blockchain. Mobile wallets either check the header of each block to find out whether a given transaction was confirmed by the miners (which means waiting for at least one confirmation, and hoping that a miner isn't the person trying to scam you) or they just ping other people's nodes to check the validity of each transaction they receive. As a result, mobile wallets can be sent invalid transactions by any scam node that connects to them, and the mobile wallet user won't know the transaction is invalid until the scam node disconnects from them.
A bitcoin node checks every transaction it receives and verifies whether the coins being spent are real, which it can do because it has a copy of the blockchain that it has constructed by downloading each block and doing the math to make sure each block follows the rules of the bitcoin network. This is why it is important for merchants to run a bitcoin node. If they don't, and they accept unconfirmed transactions as payment, they can easily be scammed.

bc1 is almost 10% cheaper but there are a few exchanges that don't recognize the format yet. So check if your exchange can send to bc1, and, if it can, use that. 3-style addresses are generalized script addresses; bitcoin wallets can encode them to use any bitcoin script, and segwit is just one option. Their ability to do any script does have this side-effect though: there's a bit of overhead in them, making them slightly more expensive than a pure segwit-only address like bc1.

Here is his argument against bitcoin: 


He's wrong. If you use the modern privacy tools that have been built for bitcoin, no one can track your transactions or know how much money you have or even know that you own an address that you just paid them through. Bitcoin is now more private than zcash or monero. Wasabi wallet and joinmarket wallet provide advanced modern privacy for large payments (or any payment on the base layer) and any lightning wallet provides advanced modern privacy for small payments (or any payment on the second layer). 
Moreover, with the growing availability of Loop Out transactions, second layer privacy is now bleeding onto the base layer. Lightning + Loop Out means no one can assume that you ever owned or had control over the coins they've received or the address they've received them from, because Loop Out transactions don't come from your wallet -- they come from the wallets of lightning node operators, who are simultaneously reimbursed via lightning in a trustless, anonymous manner. And, since the recipient of a transaction can no longer assume that you own the wallet that paid them, it's useless for them to check the history of the sender's wallet to try to find out information about you -- because what information can they learn about you if it's not your wallet they're checking? Bitcoin is much better at privacy than the tiny altcoins which try to mimic it because it has more developers creating better privacy solutions.

They charge payment processing fees and hold people's bitcoins for them. These are both less than ideal because it reduces the merchant's financial privacy and also their ability to control their own money.


I agree. It just like like a regular payment enabler such as Paypal. In my opinion, that is precisely what makes utrust less than ideal. Ideally, merchants should process their own payments and hold their own money. If they want fiat money, they should accept fiat money, or trade bitcoins for it.
BTW just because I think it is less than ideal does not mean I think it is worthless. In my opinion, it is best for a company to accept bitcoins and hold them, second best if they accept bitcoins and immediately turn them into dollars (like Utrust does), and it's not even *wrong* if they ignore bitcoin altogether -- though it does make it difficult for me to pay them.

True. But running a node is a lot easier than running a DNS server. It used to be outlandish to think that every home would have a modem. Now, most do (at least here in the first world), and a big chunk of homes also have routers. If we get to a point where most people think of "connecting to the blockchain" as just as important as (or even part of) "connecting to the internet," then bundled packages will have a market, where you have a full node installed right into your modem and/or router. I don't think that's so outlandish. Certainly not impossible.


It's not an utterly ridiculous thought, no. But it only addresses the technology side of the equation, not the social side. Operational cost is not what keeps most people away from running a node, though it is a factor. Other factors include: starting/running a full node is currently difficult; it requires ongoing management; and most bitcoiners don't realize the security vulnerabilities of relying on someone else's node. If we overcome those problems, I don't think the operational cost will be a serious issue. Once people think that running a full node is as important and as easy as running a modem, they'll factor the operational cost in the same way they factor in the cost of broadband.

That criticism is more valid for Breez than it is for Phoenix. Phoenix doesn't lose money by opening channels to you because they don't open the channel until they've received a signed lightning transaction from you reimbursing them for the cost of the channel opening fee. Breez does lose a few cents when they open a channel to you, but that's not an unreasonable cost to pay in order to obtain regular users. Many popular apps spend a lot more money than that on each user. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if, in the future, Breez moves to the "prepaid channel" model that Phoenix uses. "Losing nothing" is a lot better than "losing a few cents," and there are reasons to expect that channel opening fees will rise someday.

I like the idea of an immediate financial incentive for running a full node. That said, this particular implementation idea has several problems. Perhaps the most important problem is: who's going to front the money? It would be nice if someone was rich enough and generous enough to reward do-gooders on a scheduled basis. But good luck finding someone to do it. There's also the problem of how easy it is to trick this implementation. Less than an hour after starting a system that rewards nodes for giving it block information, someone would write a script that pings the owner's node for the requested information, and then they'd spin up a thousand instances of that script in order to collect the rewards while only running one node. If you have one node, you can make it look like you have a thousand if the only proof you're giving is information about the blockchain.
TLDR: I want an idea such as yours to happen, but your initial idea for it is too problematic to work.

Labelling your transactions doesn't reduce fungibility. Do you think your privacy gets hurt when you write a note-to-self saying "I got $50 on Thursday for painting John's fence"? It's simply a good idea to keep track of your sources of income. You'd be wasting your money if you coinjoined the money you got from painting John's fence, because those coins don't need coinjoined.


Bitcoin is already more fungible than monero. Monero transactions have an anonymity set of about 10, and it can't scale much higher without growing too expensive to use. (And monero can't currently be used with lightning because it doesn't support publicly auditable 2-of-2 multisig.) Using an onchain bitcoin wallet such as Wasabi wallet or Joinmarket wallet already gets you a higher anonymity set than monero can provide, or as does using any lightning wallet. Plus bitcoin is more scalable than monero.


If done in a centralized way, that is bad for privacy and bad for security. If done in a decentralized way, that's Joinmarket wallet or Wasabi wallet.

That message doesn't mean anything significant unless there's a soft fork planned or you're using a very old version of Bitcoin Core. When there's a planned soft fork, miners signal their support or non-support by putting a message in each block they mine. Bitcoin Core tells users if there are messages in the blocks that it doesn't understand.
Imagine if you were running a very old version of Bitcoin Core that didn't know how to deal with the message that means "I support segwit," and you were running this node around the time that the Segwit upgrade happened. During that upgrade, most miners put a message in the blocks that said "I support segwit." Your node would see that message and say "Unknown block versions are being mined! It's possible unknown rules are in effect." That would be expected, because your node wouldn't know about the Segwit block version, and that rule was going into effect at the time.
When no soft-forks are planned, miners put whatever data they want in the blocks, and sometimes they'll put data in them for personal use or business use that are of no concern to the rest of the network. But Bitcoin Core will still warn you about them, because it doesn't know when a soft fork is planned or not. But there's no soft fork planned so it's nothing to worry about right now.

They don't know that. Info about your private channels can be shared with people whom you select, who can then route through it. This is one reason why it is possible to shard the lightning network into private sections and public sections. A corporation, for example, might have a private network within their business, and all outgoing transactions would ultimately go through one private channel to access the public network. Your counterparty only knows that your node wants to keep some information private from other people -- but they still don't know if your node is routing payments for people on a private network or making direct payments for an individual.

People have been working on it. Joinmarket was an important predecessor to Wasabi, and some think it's a superior wallet because it's typically faster, by up to an hour. But Joinmarket has one problem: the person who sets up the coinjoin can tell where his own inputs went, which is information he can use to narrow down the anonymity set and thus gain information about the other participants. Wasabi doesn't have this problem. The developers of Samourai Wallet are also working on a Private Send feature, and have forked Wasabi's open source ZeroLink protocol to make it compatible with their mobile wallet. So there are plenty of devs working on privacy solutions.

I'll give it a whirl. Can you point to a single example where a lightning channel had trouble getting its closure transaction confirmed? All channel closures are publicly viewable on the blockchain, so if it's happened it should be easy to give an example. I'll wait.
In the meantime, here are some of the protections that are already in place to prevent the scenario you're asking about from occurring: Lightning channels have weeks-long timelocks; when was the last time the blockchain went for two weeks with a full mempool? Lightning channels also generally have a channel closure fee that's about three times as large as the next-block fee at the time of the channel creation. When has the mempool *ever* remained above a triple feerate (pick any starting point) for two weeks straight?
Also, the channel closure fee can be modified through interaction between peers in order to increase it when the mempool starts rising. Your node should begin renogotiating with your peer well before the mempool gets above a triple feerate. And if your counterparty proves unresponsive, all three node implementations have a default behavior of force-closing unresponsive channels. This is partly in order to prevent fees from rising above the triple fee rate without renegotiating with your counterparty.
Moreover, CPFP is an option if all of the above safeguards fail. Either counterparty can bump the fee using CPFP if their triple feerate is still too low. As a consequence of all these safeguards, I am not aware of a single instance when a channel closure transaction has had trouble getting confirmed. Please just point me to one. I'd be very happy if you changed my mind.

When your phone goes offline you can't send or receive payments on lightning, though you can still receive payments via an onchain transaction. (But your phone won't *know* you received it until you reconnect.)
If you're disconnected for less than 2 weeks, there should be no problem, because Eclair uses a 2-week locktime for all payment contracts and your counterparty won't know you're offline anyway. If you're approaching 2 weeks of not being connected your phone will prompt you to connect to the internet.
When you get back on the internet, your phone will automatically connect to the blockchain and the lightning network and resynchronize. The syncing process runs in the background and should only take a few seconds.
If you've received payments over the lightning network, and you're going to be offline for 2 weeks and your counterparty knows you're going to be offline for 2 weeks, he can steal the amount of money you've received, because Eclair wallet doesn't support watchtowers yet.

If you can't find a successful route it will return an error and won't send the payment. "Not enough capacity" is one possible error.


Pretty much, and you have to specify an amount. There are two other required parameters, but I'm not sure if LND will automatically fill those out with default values or not. That's one reason I'd like to test it. This is the command you need to type in on the command line: lncli sendpayment [destination] [amt] [payment_hash] [final_cltv_delta]
But replace [destination] with a node id, [amt] with some number of satoshis that you want to send, [payment_hash] with a random number, and [final_cltv_delta] with a value between 0 and 144 (I think that's the maximum number of blocks an LND node will wait for a counterparty to come back online before force-closing a channel, or something like that).
Destination and amount are two things that can't safely have default values, so if you don't type those in I think LND will just give you an error. But payment_hash and final_cltv_delta are different, I think. Each node has a random number generator built in so it should be able to come up with a payment_hash on its own if you don't specify one, and final_cltv_delta has a default value which you can modify in your configuration files, so I think it would copy your default and/or configured value if you don't type one in. But that's why I'd like to test it. It seems to me that this will either ping your destination node with the payment details and ask them to send back an invoice fulfilling those details, or else it will do a Sphinx send. So whenever you get your node online, if you're still interested, dm me and we'll try it.

BIP8 was not UASF. The concept of a UASF never had a generic BIP, but there was a specific BIP for activating Segwit fia UASF: BIP148. If we wanted to create a generic UASF BIP that could be used with any softfork upgrade, we'd need to come up with one.

In terms of scaling up transaction speeds, lightning is currently in the same ballpark as centralized solutions, but not up to par. Maybe 8 seconds instead of the 4 seconds it takes to do a standard credit card transaction. An exception is if you have a channel directly with your counterparty, in which case lightning blows centralized competitors out of the water with a total delay time of 0 seconds (rounding down for the time it takes for the speed of light to carry data from your node to the recipient's node).

Correlation is not causation. Their argument is that single parenthood is a poverty indicator, and birth control reduces single parenthood, therefore birth control reduces poverty indicators. You seem to be taking this a step further and saying *not* using birth control is *sometimes* harmful. (That's the impression I got from your post, but perhaps that was not your intention. Sorry if I put words in your mouth that you did not mean.) But in fact not using birth control never harmed anyone, and single parenthood is caused by having sex while single, not by choosing not to use birth control.

Right. I suspect that part of the reason they don't currently support lightning is because they're currently an escrow service where the buyer makes the initial deposit into the escrow. It's not really possible right now to deposit directly into an escrow multisig with lightning (at least, I'm not *aware* of any way to do so). There is an equivalent lightning technology that can replicate what Purse does -- called hodl invoices -- but it's only recently been made available in LND and I'm not sure what the Purse team's stance is how quickly they can deploy new technologies in production. But if they end up using hodl invoices it will be awesome, because it will allow them to do a fully non-custodial escrow service over lightning.

He gets it from his node, in a database called the mempool. A bitcoin node is the software that powers the bitcoin network. The most popular implementation is Bitcoin Core (bitcoincore.org). When you run a node, your node connects to other nodes on the network and, among other things, it asks them for the latest transactions that have been broadcast on the network. It stores these in a database called the mempool, and if another node connects to yours and asks yours what transactions it knows about, it will tell it using its mempool data. The website you're asking about merely accesses the mempool in his node and puts his latest mempool data up on the screen.

Their project looked kinda cool, so I went to the extensions page. There, I found that lightning won't be enabled til Wednesday. Wanting to see what it looks like in action, I installed it anyway. It told me I had to create an account or give it access to my Google account or Facebook account. I didn't like the sound of any of that, but I thought, "Well, maybe if all they want is an email and don't need any other info I can create a throwaway email." So I went to guerrillamail.com and made a throwaway email and gave that to them. Nice, they didn't ask for any other info, they just wanted to confirm an email address, so the throwaway email worked great. Next I went back to the reddit thread where I first heard about them and saw a link to some shady info about them firing their CTO when he tried to protect their users's privacy. Their CTO (who is no longer with them) said that *as soon as you install the extension they have access to any sites you visit and can log anything you do on the internet from that point forward*. He strongly recommended uninstalling their extension immediately -- I suspect that they intend to make a profit by selling user data. So I uninstalled it right away. Use bitrefill instead -- you can still pay for stuff on Amazon with lightning and get a 2% discount for doing so, and they don't ask for anything other than an email, which can be a throwaway account.

Even on bcash more than 5% of doublespends go through if they offer a mere 100 sats per byte and are broadcast within a second of the original transaction. So there are plenty of nodes configured to relay doublespends. Not "unlikely" at all. It's very easy to doublespend, especially if you know just one node that relays doublespends.

No, I'm not making stuff up, though I might be wrong about what I think I know. I say you reduce the average size of transactions because a coinjoin tx with 93 participants (for example) has a fewer number of inputs, outputs, and signatures than if all 93 participants broadcasted a standard transaction. For example, the transaction mentioned in the OP was 21,349 bytes, which, divided by 93 participants, means each participant's transaction averaged out to less than 230 bytes. This is 8% smaller than a standard bitcoin transaction of 1 input + 2 outputs, which is ~250 bytes.
By combining 93 transactions into 1 you reduce the average size of transactions for the simple reason that 1 coinjoin tx with 93 participants is smaller than 93 individual transactions that are not coinjoined. This also helps clear out the mempool by being more space-efficient. If a coinjoin with 93 participants is an average of 8% smaller than 93 standard transactions, then those who join a coinjoin help save 8% more space in the mempool, which makes it smaller than it would otherwise be. The more coinjoins, the more space is saved in the mempool, by ~8% each time, making it easier it is to clear out relative to how it would be if coinjoins were not used.
Being smaller in size also means coinjoins are cheaper, because the cost of a transaction is a function of the number of bytes times an amount of satoshis picked by the user. By combining transactions with 93 other participants, you're splitting the cost. Dollars for donuts, a 100 sats per byte coinjoin transaction -- where your "share" of the bytes is ~230 bytes -- should cost you less money than a 100 sats per byte standard transaction -- where your "share" is ~250 bytes -- as long as each participant pays for their share.
That explanation seems to me like it involves several assumptions that I'm not sure are true, but I hope it's clear that I'm not trying to just make stuff up.
**EDIT :: I checked my assumptions, and I was wrong about this assumption: "a coinjoin tx with 93 participants (for example) has a fewer number of inputs, outputs, and signatures than if all 93 participants broadcasted a standard transaction." According to [this article]( those values are not reduced in a coinjoin. However, for each participant except 1, you do save 10 bytes per participant, so, for 93 participants, that saves 920 bytes, which, in this case, is a bit more than 4% of the total size. So I was right that you save some significant data, but it's not as much as I thought. The rest of my comments still apply, except swap 4% in for 8%. Coinjoins can save you 4% or more on transaction fees, 4% or more in mempool space, and reduce the average size of transactions by 4% or more. And if we get Schnorr signatures that will increase dramatically, as explained in the link I pasted in this edit.

We can't exactly stop people from using Ethereum as a sidechain (no more than we can stop them from using other sidechains) but there are risks which potentially affect all bitcoin users, not just sidechain users. It boils down to part of what you said. As the volume of sidechain transactions grows, the security of that sidechain becomes more and more important. With an unsafe blockchain like Eth, that could become a terrible problem. Personally I think it would be fun to swap between bitcoin-pegged tokens on various sidechains as long as the swap is instant, non-custodial, cheap, permissionless, instantly reversible, and as long as the sidechain is not under attack while my coins are on the sidechain. (I'd also want to be sure the mechanism for pegging out wasn't under attack while my coins are on the sidechain.) But the more time your coins are on a sidechain (especially Eth), the shakier those assumptions become.

The earliest bitcoin software created new public keys automatically using a pseudorandom number generator.

The cause of single-parenthood is never "I didn't use birth control." It's sometimes caused by a divorce, and more often, it's just acting irresponsibly without exercising much forethought.

I wouldn't be surprised if easy access to birth control resulted in more people having risky sex, because the way it is marketed is "99% effective" but that's only under factory level conditions, not when a condom has been in your friction-filled wallet for a week. And also because people who have easy access to birth control are less likely to carefully consider the possible consequences of sex before doing it.

No, one wallet can store hundreds of thousands of keys. They usually create a new key whenever you've received money using the last one.


You'd only have one wallet and it would have a bunch of keys in it, but only the first two keys would be used so far. The wallet would display your total balance as 1 btc, and in the backend it would know that 0.5 of that is in one key and the rest is in another. When you want to send money to me, you'd use your wallet to say how much, copy-paste my address, and hit Send. Your wallet would create a new transaction with two "inputs" -- which are "from" addresses, i.e. both of your public keys -- and one "output" -- which is my address. Then it would broadcast that to the network.
Typically you'd also include a miner fee, so unless you set the fee to 0 you'd need to have slightly more money in your wallet than the amount you're sending to me, to cover the fee. My wallet -- which is connected to the bitcoin network same as yours -- would almost immediately display that I've received an "unconfirmed" transaction. At some point your transaction will be mined and added to the blockchain (how soon depends on how much you paid using the fee -- the higher the fee, the faster it gets mined, and the average is 10 minutes), and then in my wallet the money would change from "unconfirmed" to "confirmed." And then I'd smile and be very pleased to have another bitcoin in my wallet.

If you're running a full node such as Bitcoin Core with its default settings, then your node is constantly asking its peers for data on any unconfirmed transactions they have, and it's logging those unconfirmed transactions in an internal database called the mempool. It's also "serving" the mempool, i.e. when one of your node's peers asks your node what transactions are in its mempool, it will send back a list of all unconfirmed transactions it knows about that have not yet been included in a block. You'd only *not* be serving the mempool if your node is running in "blocksonly" mode, which some people do to save bandwidth; you can check your bitcoin.conf file to check if "blocksonly=1" is in there, but you'd probably know because you'd have had to set it up that way.
So what you can do to make sure your node is online is run this query in your terminal on a regular time interval: bitcoin-cli getrawmempool
If you run that, you should get a json-encoded array of unconfirmed transactions. If you run it again later, you should get a new list, with new transactions, and possibly some of the old ones cleared out (if a new block was found). The mempool only stores unconfirmed transactions, so whenever a new block is found most of the unconfirmed transactions on the network get confirmed and your node will automatically remove them from its mempool.
You can use this raw mempool data to determine whether your node is online or offline. As long as your node is online, your mempool should receive new unconfirmed transactions about 3 or more times per second. Query your node for raw mempool data at regular intervals and simply check if the output is the same or different from what it was the last time you queried it. If your node goes offline, it will output the same array twice in a row, because while it's offline it can't receive new unconfirmed transactions, nor can it see any new blocks that are clearing out the mempool. As long as your node is online it should output a different array whenever you query it for raw mempool data, and thus as long as its output is different from what it was the last time you queried it, you can be sure it was online at some point during that interval, because it got new data.
I hope that helps. :)

I agree with most of your post, but I don't think it's nonsense to speak of "the" mempool. I'd guess that most nodes have over 95% of the same transactions in their mempools. At that point, if you're just speaking conversationally I think you can defensibly say things like "the mempool is full today" without speaking nonsense. If you scratch the surface, that sentence is technically incorrect since there's not just one mempool, but that doesn't make it nonsense imo.

With ransomware, the bad guys often have somewhere around 50 addresses that they're using, and yes, they reuse those addresses.

I imagine most crypto-savvy websites do so because it's trivially easy. But I'm sure some websites reuse addresses. It's a bad idea for privacy, but you can't *force* people to make a new address every time when reusing one technically still works.

It's safe to accept an unconfirmed tx, just not for a product. You can let it sit in your mempool until it's confirmed before you give your customer their product. That is what merchants should be doing anyway (unless they have grounds to trust their customer), because RBF is a simple flag to make transaction replacement easier; you can push through a doublespend even without RBF if you send the doublespend directly to a miner, or to a node which relays all doublespends.


I'm not a C++ programmer, so I can't say for sure, but after checking the Bitcoin github I found an instruction set called [txmempool.cpp]( Among other things, this set includes instructions for what transactions to relay and what transactions to remove from the mempool. If I understand it correctly, RBF removes transactions from the mempool whenever the following conditions are true: there are two conflicting transactions, one pays a higher fee than the other by a certain amount, and the RBF flag is set to true. If the above three conditions are true, a standard Bitcoin Core node will remove the lower-fee transaction from its mempool and relay the higher-fee replacement transaction. So if you wanted to forward all doublespend transactions, and not just RBF transactions, all you'd need to do is remove one line of conditional logic -- the last one of the three I named above -- and your node would relay all doublespend transactions so long as the doublespending tx's fee was higher than the original's by a certain amount.
BTW there is very good evidence that many nodes are set up to do this, as Peter Rizun's experiments indicate. He documents his research in [this video]( and found that doublespend transactions go through about 5% of the time if the fee is high enough, even without RBF set to true, and they go through even more if they are sent through at about the same time as the original transaction. Such doublespends can only happen if there are a significant amount of nodes which are set to relay doublespends regardless of RBF status.

The value of your bitcoins in dollars divided by the current price of bitcoins in dollars equals the number of bitcoins you have.
In your case:
32.21/5221 = 0.00616932 btc
Or 616932 sats. A lot of the industry has started using satoshis (sats) as the base unit. E.g. lightning wallets use satoshis by default.

The problem isn't storage, it's bandwidth. Pruned nodes solve the storage problem but you still need an amount of bandwidth that is proportional to the size of each block. Also, for miners, every second you spend downloading someone else's block is another second you spend not mining on the latest chain while at least one competitor is. This is bad for miner decentralization. Imagine blocks are 25 megabytes and it takes a miner 10 seconds to download and another 20 seconds to validate. In that case, he's lost 30 seconds, which is effectively a 5% reduction in his hash rate. Then, if he does find a block after losing 5% of his chance, it will still take him 30 seconds to upload his new block to the rest of the network. That means he has lost a total of 1 minute of time out of only 10 available -- essentially a 10% reduction in his hashrate. The more blocks grow, the more centralized mining gets, because it effectively increases the hashrate of the most recent miner (since he gets to work on a new block for a longer time while everyone else is still downloading and verifying his last block).

From the podcast, at 34:47 -- "How do you handle the multi-sig 2-of-3 with lightning? -- There is no multisig on lightning. We figured that we're just going to start in the most simple way possible. That is, we have our own lightning daemon running and our own channel opened, and the funds go through us. But of course it's still not exactly [like] holding lots of funds in your own wallet, because they're only there for the lifetime of a contract. As soon as the contract is completed, the funds go to the buyer, so it's still better than actually holding funds in your own wallet. Though, I would admit [that] it is slightly less secure than our current onchain implementation of multisig contracts."
That answer sounds ambiguous to me and I look forward to the blog post that they say is forthcoming and which will explain this in (hopefully more) detail. They could be describing a custodial arrangement, and the phrase "they're only there for the lifetime of a contract" suggests a custodial arrangement very strongly, at least to me. But they might be trying to express that they're using hodl invoices, which I think would be the best way to do this. With hodl invoices, the lightning funds are not held in custody, the contract that pays the money to the client is simply not forwarded until the client confirms that he or she is online. With that arrangement, there's a truly trustless escrow. The escrow partner (in this case) never has custody of the *funds*, only of a *contract that pays the funds to their client.* The only things they can do with that contract are (a) pass it on or (b) not pass it on, in which case the contract would timeout and consequently autocancel. They can't hold funds hostage like 2-of-3 escrow partners can. I hope that's what they're doing, but it sounds unlikely, since he says whatever they are doing is "less secure" than 2-of-3 multisig. Hodl invoices aren't less secure than 2-of-3 multisig. If anything, they're more secure, because the escrow partner can never hold funds hostage or collaborate with a malicious counterparty to steal your funds.

If the blockchain doesn't contain the balance of each address, how do you verify that someone hasn't sent you fake coins? In bitcoin, wallet software is designed to trace the history of each coin they receive back to the moment it was mined and ensure that the miner who mined it followed the rules of the bitcoin protocol. (Or, if they are a mobile wallet, they typically ping the wallet creator's node or the electrum network and ask them to do it for them.) In your proposal, is there any public record of each coin's history to check against to ensure it's a valid coin?

Almost all bitcoin wallets support the BIP21 invoice protocol, and/or the BIP70 invoice proposal. Both invoice proposals allow a cash register to display a QR code that contains both the *amount requested* as well as the *address to send it to.* When you scan that qr code, your app fills in both fields, so that all you have to do is hit a Confirm button. That's about as simple as what Apple Pay and Android Pay do.
Also, Android and Apple both have low-level NFC capabilities that essentially make NFC data work similarly to URL data. For example, when you hold an Android or Apple device up to a Bitpay point-of-sale device that supports NFC, the point-of-sale device will send your phone the text "bitcoin:" followed by a BIP70 invoice. That text prompts your phone to look for an app associated with that prefix -- and most wallets associate themselves with that prefix at installation.
So in short the ideas you're proposing here are good ideas, and in fact they've already been built into most bitcoin wallets and point-of-sale devices.

Onchain? No, I doubt it. But including lightning plugins for current wallets? Yes; in fact, we can already surpass 1700 tps by using lightning. There are over 1000 lightning channels already, and each one lets *each participant* do over 16 transactions per second ([proof]( depending on how fast your cpu is (and how fast your internet is).
Think about that for a moment -- bitcoin can theoretically do a bit more than 24 TPS *for the whole network,* but lightning lets us do 16+ TPS *for each participant.* And there are thousands of participants already. The network is incredibly fast and it's still in beta. So yeah, as lightning plugins and dedicated lightning wallets get more and more adoption, the whole network will continue to grow its TPS rates. Even now, when lightning is still in beta, we can already do over 1700 TPS with it because it has over 1000 participants and each one can do 16+ TPS. I don't think we'll ever hit those numbers using standard onchain transactions and waiting for miners to mine them; but there's no reason to do that when bitcoin was built with smart contract functions precisely so that higher-level applications could leverage the blockchain for enhanced speed and security.


It sounds like a good idea to me. But I think it's addressing something different from the real bottleneck for onchain TPS. I don't know how often you've used onchain transactions, but I use them all the time, and they typically show immediately in the recipients wallet, they just show up as "unconfirmed." Then they sit there and wait for confirmations from miners. The CDN idea is an attempt to get transactions and blocks to move through the network faster, but it doesn't make transactions or blocks *confirm* faster. Network propagation is already super fast though -- CDNs could improve that, but that's not the bottleneck. Confirmation speeds are the real bottleneck, and bitcoin is intentionally designed to keep confirmations happening in 10 minute intervals, we're not trying to speed that up. CNDs aren't a bad idea, but if you think they'll help things confirm faster, that's not really what they're designed to do.

There are a lot of buzzwords in that article and some of them leans toward self-contradiction. In particular, it describes its "decentralized" solution as essentially "let the masternodes on our blockchain run everything." (That's a paraphrase, not a quote.) Masternodes are centralized. They are even *more* centralized on a new blockchain where hardly anyone is running *ordinary* nodes. I can almost guarantee you the only ones running masternodes on that network right now are the developers themselves -- and that means they have privileged control over their network. I don't recommend using their software unless and until their network gets larger and more decentralized.

You can make a wallet that does that if you like, but some people will prefer to store the whole history of the chain, and you can't really force them to delete it. The Bitcoin Core node software already has an option called "pruning" that lets you delete every block from before a rolling checkpoint. Most of the people who use that setting have low storage requirements on their machine, but you could make a wallet that does it by default if you wanted, and then bake in a checkpoint at which to start validation.

Good point. I think it would be relatively easy to write an extension that would "skin" the moneni lottery to look like the powerball. As part of that extension, you could "skin" the numbers to make them look higher, and reveal the winning number digit by digit. All you'd need for the mathematics is to use some multiplier in common.
Moneni allows for many many tickets in each raffle, but it has a minimum of 14. Now let's do a low example: if there were only 15 tickets in a given raffle, numbered 0-14, you could first add 12 to each number (so they would be 11-25), then multiply each number by something like 3456789. That way, your available ticket numbers would be things like 38024679, 51851835, 65678991, and so forth. Presentation is key to making a lottery funner. High numbers like these -- where you reveal the digits slowly, in pairs or even one by one -- are part of the appeal and part of the draw.
Another part of the draw is to make the thing run on a repeating schedule. If you show a display that's pulling out new winning numbers every 45 seconds or so, it makes people want to get in on the action for the potential of an instant win. Currently Moneni doesn't run their lottery on a schedule, though, so I suppose for this function we'd either have to ask the developer to reprogram it or program a new lottery.

There's another lightning extension -- bitlum (it's custodial though) -- which doesn't ask for that many permissions. But as a result, by default it requires you to copy-paste lightning invoices into the extension. However, there's a setting you can turn on to let it read lightning:// prefixes so you can just click them and not have to copy-paste them -- only if you try to turn on that setting it asks you to give it read/write permissions across all websites first. I'm guessing that's where the permission is coming from in Joule as well.

Eventually you may be interested in reading the Bitcoin Development [mailing list](
Here are some answers to your questions about the developers:


Random people from around the internet. They mostly gather in bitcoin discussion groups on IRC and Slack, and most of them participate in the Bitcoin Development mailing list. Each developer typically downloads the contents of the Bitcoin github page, works on an individual project (such as an improvement proposal), and then tells people on those discussion groups and mailing list when their code is ready for testing. Others download it and test it; and after enough of the big-shot developers in this space agree that it's good enough software, there are two or three people who have access to edit the Bitcoin github page, and they'll merge it into that repository. At that point, it's up to node operators whether they want to download the new version or not. Developers can't force anyone to run new software -- node operators make that decision.


By writing good code and communicating well with the other developers. The "selection" happens entirely naturally -- if you talk often with the others, show them your work, write good software, and don't be a jerk when you get feedback, you're likely to grow in esteem and end up getting some of your code into the Bitcoin Core github page, which is the source code that ends up in most wallets and node implementations.


Node operators. People who run a node on the network decide which software to download and what upgrades to implement. Bitcoin doesn't have an auto upgrade mechanism -- everytime someone changes the github, the people running the network have to decide whether to run the new software or not. Upgrades happen as more and more node operators download the new upgrade and start running it on the network.


Correcting that weakness is why we need good communication and testing among node operators. They shouldn't blindly trust the github page. They should test the software on the testnet first and gradually shift over if the upgrades are good and don't introduce vulnerabilities created by bankers.

I think his point is that bitcoin doesn't actually need the internet to operate. It needs some way to communicate a short message to miners. This is *usually* done through the internet (simply because the internet is fast and -- typically -- accessible), but it can also be done by satellite, ham radio, mesh networks (e.g. GoTenna), text messages, or even physical letters. They can't block every avenue of communication. A transaction is about 300 bytes, small enough to fit on a piece of paper, and all you need to do is get that transaction data onto the network somehow. Mail it to that one friend of yours who *does* have a working node and you're golden. They can't stop it.

The guy who wrote that post assumed that only one channel can be opened per transaction. That is false -- batch transactions are already popular among exchanges and coinjoins. In order to create many lightning channels per transaction, we merely need to help such service providers add support for the lightning network. The puzzle pieces are already in place to open dozens or even hundreds of lightning channels per transaction, which is two orders of magnitude more than the assumptions made by the guy who wrote that post.
On a related point, channel factories are a particularly efficient proposal for creating batches of lightning channels via a single transaction. The proposal relies on the fact that creators of lightning channels merely need a valid bitcoin address from their counterparties; the address they connect to doesn't have to have any funds in it, nor does it have to ever have been seen before on the blockchain. Lightning is very much an off-chain proposal, and therefore it is possible to send someone a lightning payment (which they can subsequently spend via lightning) before their bitcoin address has ever received any money onchain. As a result, the amount of onchain transactions it takes to *open* a lightning channel is zero; it only takes an onchain transaction to *close* a lightning channel. Channel factories haven't been coded up yet, but there's nothing stopping us from creating them, and onboarding people to the lightning network before they've ever received any funds onchain. The future is bright. Batching ftw.

Oh I see lots of contradictions. One is that blocks are not only 1MB. They can be just under 4MB now. Another is that with current practices we can onboard 1 million people a day, so it would take about 1000 days to onboard 1 million people. "Years and years" sounds like a lot more than "less than 3 years." Also, even during bull runs, we've only ever had a maximum of about 50,000 new wallets open up per day. So not nearly enough people even Want to open a bitcoin wallet -- we haven't reached the kinds of numbers that might put a strain on the network.

Here's a talk Gregory Maxwell did in November 2017 (after Segwit) about improvements in block propagation:


Part of the reason people say 7 TPS is because they assume that each ledger entry is one transaction. With segwit about 4200 ledger entries can be made per block, which (assuming each block takes about 600 seconds to mine) is where the number 7 "transactions" per second comes from. (4200/600 = 7.) But in reality many ledger entries are batch transactions. With modern batching techniques we already routinely include hundreds of transactions in a single ledger entry, and like I said a standard block (with segwit) can include about 4200 ledger entries. (Actually they can't hold 4200 batch transactions, because those are of a larger size than normal transactions, but they can hold 2100 or more batch transactions. The limitations depend on how many transactions are in the batch.)
We're also about to start testing a Schnorr implementation on the testnet, and Schnorr will allow us to compress the size of batch transactions by up to 40% (by combining all the signatures into one) so that we can fit even more of them in each block.


Some of the assumptions you made regarding TPS are incorrect. Some of those assumptions, when corrected, bring your number lower; others, when corrected, bring your number higher. I'll start with the assumptions that bring your number lower first.


It is very difficult to get a block up to 4MB and still have it be valid. If everybody starts using segwit we expect blocks to average around 2.4 to 2.6 megabytes, with standard deviations a few decimals higher and lower. Anything over 3.3 MB would basically be an outlier, unless something changes. With the way transactions are created right now, in order to reach 4MB in a block you'd have to specially craft your transactions to purposefully give them an outrageously high amount of witness data, far more than they need. The actual transaction data -- the stuff that says what address is paying what amount to whom -- still needs to be 1MB or less; but the signature for each segwit transaction (and some other metadata, which together with the signature is called "witness data") can be separated from the rest of the transaction, and that witness data can be allowed to reach up to 2 or 3 megabytes, since it doesn't need to be served to old nodes. If you tried to fill a block up with 4MB of standard transactions, without specially cramming them with absurd amounts of witness data, there would be no way for nodes to serve only 1MB of that to the remaining old nodes and still have them be valid. So it's very impractical right now to get a block all the way up to 4MB.
That said, the potential TPS is actually higher than 18 TPS. Earlier I mentioned that batch transactions aren't counted properly by people who say bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions per second. If we account for batching transactions, by my math we can get up to 24+ onchain TPS without even adding Schnorr. I explain why in [this post]( In reality, 24 onchain TPS is probably significantly above what we'll ever see unless we do a blocksize increase; I got to that number by assuming that a batch transaction was specially crafted under optimum conditions to absolutely maximize TPS, and that an entire block on the blockchain was devoted solely to reaching that number. That's unlikely to ever happen. But we can expect that people will begin to use batching transactions more often once Schnorr goes through, because Schnorr creates opportunities to create wallets that automatically incentivize people and even reward them for using modern batching techniques. So while we'll probably never get all the way to 24 onchain TPS, we can approach it using Segwit+Batching+Schnorr. (And that's not including lightning, which is already available, and can do thousands of TPS using bitcoin's smart contract functions.)
Maybe once we've approached 24 TPS and have everyone on lightning we'll finally be ready for a blocksize increase. But by then, perhaps we won't need one.

They get more and more widely adopted as businesses upgrade their bitcoin core software from 0.15.x to 0.16.x or higher. Some businesses may also have to update some other backend stuff on their site; for example, if a site lets you withdraw to a bitcoin address by typing your address into a form, they might have designed it with a script that throws an error if your address isn't recognized as a bitcoin address as of the time the script was created. If a business uses a script like that, they'd need to upgrade it as well as upgrading to Bitcoin Core 0.16.x or higher.


The only difficulty should be hitting an "install" button, doing some testing to make sure everything works, and fixing any problems such as outdated scripts on your website's backend.

No. Block size has been replaced with block weight, which is ~4MB.


All nodes accept segwit transactions because it's backward compatible. When an upgraded node sends a block to an old node, if there are segwit transactions in the block, they often push the blocksize over 1MB, so -- in order to keep the old nodes happy -- they strip out the witness data for those transactions before sending them to the old node, that way the amount of data the old node receives for each block is still under 1MB. (But it's almost a moot point now because there aren't very many nodes left that haven't upgraded.)


A number of upgrades that improve block propagation speed have gone through since segwit. But also, "segwit has bad effects on block propagation" is not the same as "segwit *slows down* block propagation." Think of it this way: if you compare the block propagation of two networks, the one that is larger and has more implementations of the node software is likely to have slower block propagation, because network communications take longer on a larger network where people are running pieces of software that aren't identical in the way they do network communications. In other words, smaller networks are faster. If segwit resulted in some nodes getting orphaned, that means the network got smaller, which would have good effects on speed -- but that's only one metric. Being faster doesn't mean everything's good. We don't *want* the network to be smaller and we don't *want* nodes to get orphaned. If segwit broke some nodes or made them slow, that was a bad effect, even if it made block propagation faster.


The solution requires more than that, but some of the things you mentioned can help a lot. (Changing the block generation times wouldn't help though.)

tldw: two of the times he's used the app there was an error that resulted in him being able to spend more money on the app than he deposited. It happened once when he deposited 200,000 satoshis to BlueWallet and was somehow credited 400,000 satoshis instead. BlueWallet's LNhub apparently gave him an extra 200,000 from the general pool of funds that they store *all their users'* bitcoins in. He was able to withdraw all 400,000 to another lightning wallet, thus withdrawing more than he deposited.
Another time he was using BlueWallet and successfully sent several hundred thousand satoshis from it to one of his other lightning wallets, but BlueWallet didn't display a reduced balance. It did send the payment, but the display told him his balance was the same as it was before. So he created a second transaction for about the same amount and tried again, and it went through a second time, only this time it reduced his balance by the correct amount (and it apparently took it from the general pool once again, though I don't think he specified in the video, so it might have just taken it from his remaining balance). When he checked his other lightning wallet, both payments had gone through, so he essentially withdrew double what he'd tried to -- again.
He reported both bugs on Github and he says Bluewallet has been very responsive. He thinks they will cover whatever losses their users may have experienced as a result of these bugs, but they might not -- I mean, they do warn people that it's beta software and you could lose your money due to bugs, so that's sort of the price you pay for using unfinished software.

In that case you are essentially storing the balance in the form of a hash to show that it hasn't changed since coins were last validly added to it. Yes, you can do this. Monero does something similar, I believe, storing a hash of the balance instead of actual value of the current balance.

In case someone wants to know what math I used to come up with that number (and what assumptions I'm making), here is my thinking:
Let's suppose you can get 4200 standard (unbatched) ledger entries per block. This is a rough approximation of the maximum that can be achieved with Segwit to my knowledge. Each transaction typically has 1 input, 2 outputs, and 1 signature. So your total transaction data in a block of 4200 transactions is: 4200 inputs, 8400 outputs, and 4200 signatures. Outputs and inputs are all about the same size, and although signatures are significantly larger, I'll assume for purposes of this approximation that each signature is about the same size as an inputs or an output.
If you created a block that took advantage of batching in the absolute best way possible, it would have one "batch" ledger entry. A batch transaction can send bitcoins from 1 input address to as many output addresses as you can fit in the block, and only requires 1 signature to do so. So, instead of 4200 inputs, 8400 outputs, and 4200 signatures, you could have 1 input, 1 signature, and as many outputs as you can fit in the remaining empty space. Under the assumption that all these data types are the same sizes, that means you've removed 8398 pieces of data that are the same size as outputs, so you can fit an additional 8398 outputs into this one large batch entry. Which is essentially double what you could do before. That means the theoretical maximum is 16798 transactions in one block. Since each block takes (on average) 600 seconds to mine, that's about 28 transactions per second.
Note that Schnorr would not compress this any further, because Schnorr's scaling advantage is that it aggregates signatures, but in this (theoretical) best case scenario, there is only 1 signature to aggregate. So Schnorr wouldn't help here.

That number is false because it counts each ledger entry as only one transaction. With segwit about 4200 ledger entries can be made per block, which (assuming each block takes about 600 seconds to mine) is where the number 7 "transactions" per second comes from. But in reality many ledger entries are batch transactions. With modern batching techniques we already routinely include hundreds of transactions per ledger entry, and like I said a standard block (with segwit) can include about 4200 ledger entries. (Actually they can't hold 4200 batch transactions, because those are of a larger size than normal transactions, but they can hold 2100 or more batch transactions. The limitations depend on how many transactions are in the batch.) Thus the number you gave is off by two orders of magnitude.
The number you gave is also false because Schnorr will allow us to compress the size of batch transactions by up to 40% (by combining all the signatures into one) so that we can fit even more of them in each block.

One way you might discover a vulnerability on the testnet is if someone tries out an exploit on it. For example, when the 2018 CVE bug was discovered, Gregory Maxwell created a transaction on the testnet creating new coins without mining and showed that doing so would both disrupt the network and crash a lot of people's nodes, but it would be accepted as a valid transaction by most nodes. People on the testnet were able to provide feedback about what their node's log report said when it crashed and/or what versions would/wouldn't accept the forged coins as valid. All of this data was helpful in finding the causes of and solutions for the bug. Running a testnet node helps developers find and test vulnerabilities without putting real money at risk.


There are some test conditions already, but there could always be more of them, and more structure as well. We need developers working on that too. The really scary thing about the 2018 CVE bug was that any miner could have exploited it on the mainnet at any time between 2017 and September 2018 and it would have caused the same disruption that ended up happening on the testnet when Gregory Maxwell finally tried the exploit. The developers had created the vulnerability accidentally, it went unnoticed by node operators for over a year (both on the testnet and on the mainnet), and finally it was another developer who discovered it and disclosed it responsibly. But the main Bitcoin software was vulnerable for over a year to an exploit that could have created new coins and crashed a lot of nodes. The only nodes which weren't vulnerable were those which had waited patiently and not upgraded their software for almost two years, and those which were running a different implementation of the bitcoin protocol, such as bcoin. This is one reason why more test conditions need to be in place and we shouldn't just blindly trust the github page and the developers there, good as they are.

How do you set up lightning payments? I have three guesses:
- First guess: They run a custodial lightning wallet for you on the site and you can withdraw from it at any time to your personal lightning wallet
- Second guess:  When you're setting up your page there's a place to type in your node ID with a step-by-step tutorial for giving the site RPC access so it can tell your node to generate a custom invoice whenever someone selects the lightning option
- Third guess: They convert all lightning payments to onchain payments and send them to the same onchain address you specified for receiving onchain payments
Are any of those guesses right? Or do they do it some other way?

A lot of it could be automated if there were widely-adopted protocols for it. E.g. you could make sure all your friends have a wallet that supports "batch-to-one," the batch creator could specify how many participants there are and what the total fee should be, then put all the smartphones close together so they can communicate via NFC. The phones would automatically craft the transactions according to parameters obtained from the batch creator's phone, then ask their respective owners to verify with a thumbprint pr a pin, and off you go.
Doing that for all the people in line at a counter would be harder. They probably wouldn't all want to touch their phones together, so you might have to do internet communication, and if one person in line cancels (or has a bad connection, or didn't get on wifi, or is in airplane mode, or etc.) you'd either have to start over or set up the transaction so that it can go through even if a certain percentage of people don't pay. And then the person at the counter would have to be trained to identify the non-conformists and get them to pay separately. That's a lot of pain points. Better to get them all using lightning so that fees are almost nil.

Right. Pull transactions are difficult. It wouldn't be too hard to make a wallet that can do recurring "push" transactions though. That's another possible solution to the recurring payments problem. Multisig addresses, as you suggest here, are another way to do it.
One thing to note: if a user has to confirm a "pull transaction," it's not really any different from a "push transaction" that requires confirmation first. You could make a "recurring push payment" function that notifies the user just as easily, or perhaps more easily, and even put a "confirm" button on that notification, that way they have the option to stop it from going through. In general I think "push" payments are likely easier to program than "pull" payments -- because they don't involve additional network communications -- but both can theoretically be done and both have useful properties.

True that. I have yet to see an ethereum program that can't be done better in a wallet app instead of on the blockchain. And there are so many benefits of doing that sort of programming via wallet apps instead of on the blockchain -- wallet apps are faster than blockchains, the programming languages are better known, and they are more scalable, just to name three advantages.

The tampering we want to check for is: did he manually increase his balance by tampering with the code in his wallet rather than receiving legitimate coins? If changing that value would cause the hash of the wallet to no longer match its corresponding hash on the blockchain, then it follows that you Are storing the balance on the blockchain, in the form of a hash. (I believe Monero does this btw.)

This post is a starting point toward why we need a blockchain. You can indeed store the information for every wallet you ever might have to deal with, including its past states and current state, and verify that the rules were followed whenever a transaction occurs, and -- when interacting with someone -- they can use cryptography to prove which wallet they own. When you do all that, you've created full node software with a blockchain as its database, one which stores all the information for all wallets on the network. This is what bitcoin does.


Some of that is somewhat similar to what the lightning network does. It allows you and another person to interact with each other's wallets in such a way that, if the two of you exchange money, you only store your current balances on your own wallets until, at some point, one or both of you decide to record the new state of each wallet on the actual blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:56:25


Checking the transaction rules involves checking where the coins came from. To do that, you need verify that the balance is what it was at the address's creation (or at the last point when it received coins). That means the balance has to be on the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:48:50


Probably not, but let's try anyway.


True. 


It's not ready yet. We shouldn't scale the blockchain until the network is ready for mass adoption. Lightning isn't ready, nor is the base layer. All the proposals to bring on mass adoption right now involve getting everyone to run a wallet on their phone, not a node in their home. This means that a comparatively small number of full nodes would be securing the network for all the phone wallets. This is an enormous security compromise with potentially catastrophic effects for the whole network. Phone wallets need to be connected to a secure and large network of economically relevant full nodes. We need to keep the ratio of full nodes to phone wallets high -- that's the real scaling: scaling up the ratio of full nodes to phone wallets. We should not try to scale up the size of the blockchain until we scale up the number of full nodes.


No one is opposed to increasing the blocksize when the network is large enough for a capacity increase. But it's not. Those who want to scale now don't seem to realize the dangers of putting everyone on a phone wallet. Phone wallets do not validate the rules of the bitcoin network, they merely hold private keys. Instead of validating the rules, they trust third parties to validate the rules, keep them connected to the network, and give them valid information about what transactions have been sent to the user's wallet. Usually, these third parties are either the wallet maker (who runs a full node that all of his users' wallets are connected to), the electrum network (which is currently under a denial of service attack because it is a weak point in the network), or the miners (in the case of SPV wallets).
All of these methods of running phone wallets are open to a variety of attacks. Remember when the majority of the miners wanted to break off and form a separate network (segwit2x)? That is just one demonstration of the insecurity of SPV wallets, which trust miners to give them valid information. Relying on the electrum network is also increasingly difficult because of denial of service attacks and the sybil problem. DoS attacks on electrum servers are designed to overload the cpus of the volunteers who run electrum servers with requests for information. The result is that "real" users have a hard time finding a server that can actually give them information. There's also a high prevalence of scam servers which refuse to relay transactions but merely tell you to visit scam sites and download a coin-stealing malware. Since it is easy to set up an electrum server, many scammers are doing so, which is a quintessential sybil problem. Then there's the option of just using a wallet that connects to the wallet maker's node. This is the most common type of wallet, and it's insecure because the node operator for that batch of wallet users then controls what network his users are on and what rules he's validating. A wallet operator who controls his users' connection can feed them false data or censor their transactions. And none of this is even factoring in the privacy situation, which is abysmal on phone wallets, with rare exceptions.
All of the above reasons are why our scaling priority needs to be: help more people run full nodes. That's the only way to give the network a secure foundation for the future. Getting everyone to run phone wallets is not a scaling solution, instead it creates massive scaling problems and security vulnerabilities. A big reason for keeping the block size low right now is because the network is not ready to scale and won't be until running a full node is easy enough that there's a high ratio of full node operators to phone wallet users.

Can you provide a link? I heard about chainlocks from Andreas Antanopolous and he didn't mention this feature, and I'd like to know more about it. (BTW thanks for your contribution! Have an upvote.)


First, that article doesn't say anything about 2.8%. Do you remember where you got that percentage?
Second, the guy with the corrupted database lost his funds because he accidentally used an outdated backup (user error, not a protocol bug). And anyway, that's not what the OP asked about, he asked about whether transactions can be reversed, and the fact is that bitcoin transactions that use the lightning protocol cannot be reversed.
Third, the risk of user error surrounding backups has been greatly reduced due to two relatively recent upgrades: static channel backups and watchtowers. Both of these are available to mainnet lightning users now, and weren't available when that guy was doing his experiments. (Also, you probably wouldn't blame Dash if a user accidentally loaded up an old, empty seed phrase without backing up his new one, so you shouldn't blame lightning because a user accidentally loaded up an old, outdated backup which he should have replaced with his new one.)

Slight correction: bitcoin needs to \*grow\* its ecosystem of defi. It's important to point out that bitcoin started doing defi with the release of Joinmarket in May 2015 -- before ethereum was even a thing. Joinmarket is a dao where participants sell the opportunity to do a coinjoin with them (in short, participants sell coinjoins) to other participants to help them enhance their privacy. That's a financial application -- in which any participant can stake their bitcoins and make some money -- and it's decentralized. There are other defi applications on bitcoin too. Routing nodes on the lightning network stake bitcoins in payment channels to provide a financial service (faster payments/routing) in return for a fee. Bisq stakers take a fee for providing liquidity to users of the Bisq decentralized exchange. And submarine swaps allow users to stake bitcoins (for a fee) to act as an "offramp" from the lightning network to onchain so that users can use the lightning network in a backward-compatible way without closing their channels.
So bitcoin already has defi, and has had it for longer than ethereum has been a thing. But it does need to grow -- I agree with you there.

It can be automated, but right now it's mostly not worth it. I'm not aware of any non-KYC service that accepts 0-conf. If a service does KYC on their customers (like most bitcoin ATMs) they'll catch you if you scam them through a doublespend attack. As for merchants, services like Coingate, Globee, Bitpay, and BTCPay Server all require at least one confirmation by default. A merchant would only change that if he understood the risks and thought it the risk of doublespend attacks was slight enough that it was worth it to change the default settings. There are probably too few merchants who do that to make it worthwhile for someone to develop an automated doublespending wallet.

You know I had to correct you on that one ;P Lightning wallets are real bitcoin wallets. Coins are locked to your own private keys (just like any other bitcoin wallet in that regard) and can only be spent with them. The main difference from other bitcoin wallets is that lightning wallets are all multisig wallets (because the protocol relies on multisig) and other parts of the protocol require the use of a different encoding when making a lightning payment.


Yes, but there's one other thing you'd have to be aware of: mobile lightning wallets always use private mode by default, so if you just typed in their node id your phone would not be able to find them on the network. It would say something like "Peer not found." This privacy safeguard means that your friends would have to use their phone wallet to "reach out" to *you.* To facilitate this without them having to do any work, you can do the work of constructing an "incoming payment channel request" using the lnurl standard -- you can learn how to use it [on github]( Then, once they've downloaded a lightning wallet, all you'll need to do is give them the link you created (or the qr code), and have them click it or scan it. That will connect their wallet to your node, and you can then use the openchannel command on LND with the push_amt flag to simultaneously open a channel to them and send them some money.
BTW the website lnbig.com [already opens channels]( to lightning wallets for free, so (for now at least) you can just point them to that site and then send them a payment. This is one of the privileges of being an early adopter -- other enthusiasts will often offer very useful services for free. Eventually, services like that ("liquidity providers") will only open a channel with you if you pay them something (or, in a more long-term future, it might become a standard part of other paid-for packages -- like your ISP might do this for you as a standard part of your regular internet service).

I like what Hodl Hodl is doing, but I just want to point out one thing that irks me about the "decentralized" description they give to themselves. Their exchange, while generally non-custodial (lightning being the only exception), is permissioned. You can't post trades without an account, and you can't create an account without their permission. The trading portion may be decentralized (unless your trade involves the lightning network), but the rest of their platform is not.
Note that this criticism does not mean "I don't like Hodl Hodl." On the contrary, I like them. I like them better than an exchange like Coinbase, but not as much as an exchange like Bisq.

In particular, Shift Cryptosecurity (makers of Bitbox) strongly criticized twelve word backups, and the Casa team talked about their plans to make twelve word backups unnecessary by making everything work through 3-of-5 multisig. That way, you can set up multiple devices, throw away the twelve word backups, and -- if you lose one of the devices -- you can still recover using the others, without any twelve word backups.

It depends on your needs and wants.
If you need it to look simple, use Wasabi Wallet. It's not \*super\* simple, but it's probably the simplest looking mixer available until Samourai Whirlpool comes out.
If you are handy with a linux terminal but not ready to use the lightning network, use Joinmarket. It runs entirely on the blockchain but its interface is difficult.
If you're okay with linux and you want to go one step deeper, download LND and loopd, run both of them over a Tor connection, use "Loop Out" for all outbound transactions, and use "Loop In" for all inbound transactions. This is the most private option available for sending/receiving bitcoin at the present time, because it leverages the privacy features of the lightning network so that they sort of "bleed into" your onchain transactions.

They're not safe at all. Why would they be safer?


No, but that makes it a lot easier. If you doublespend without using RBF, Bitcoin Core nodes will only relay one of the transactions (whichever was the first transaction one they saw), which makes doublespends more difficult. But there is other popular node software -- such as Bitcoin Knots and Bitcoin Unlimited -- which relay all transactions, including doublespends. Those implementations tend to "seek out" other doublespend-spreading software to make sure that miners see them and can put them into blocks. As long as the doublespend makes it to one doublespend-spreading implementation, it is likely to make it to the miners, whether or not RBF is enabled.

Because 1 private key = 1 bitcoin address, which leads to [address reuse]( Address reuse has two main security risks: it reduces your privacy and reveals your public key, which makes your wallet more susceptible to a future quantum attack. Instead of using 1 private key, you should use a wallet that has 1 recovery key, which is a 12 word backup (sometimes 24 words depending on your wallet). Recovery keys make it simple to restore your wallet (including all private keys) if you ever lose your phone or computer, and they are easier to use than a private key because random words are easier than random numbers and letters. Moreover, wallets that use recovery keys also auto-generate new addresses for you every time you send or receive bitcoins, so they boost your privacy and security.
TLDR: use a 12 word recovery key (or a 24 word one) instead.

Copying the blockchain to a new hard drive is ridiculously easy, I did it a few days ago. You just plug the new hard drive in, copy the data directory, and tell your node to use the new one. Reboot, and you're done. You can now safely remove the filled-up hard drive.
So, no, most nodes will not need to go down (except for a routine reboot) when their 1tb hard drive fills up. Their owners will just switch to a new hard drive.

Yes. If someone gives out products or services for unconfirmed transactions, you can scam them by this method. See, for example, [this group of scammers from Canada](


0-conf is a disaster if you give out high-value products or services in exchange for them. If you're selling someone your car, have enough patience to wait 10 minutes.
But it's not so bad for low-value products. Who's going to go through the trouble of manually constructing transactions just to steal a $2 cup of coffee? And even if someone does scam your coffee place just for the lulz, you can just refuse service to him in the future (or even take him to court to get your $2 back, if you're mad enough).
0-conf is also fine if you're just asking your friend John to pay you back for dinner. You trust John, so you're not worried he's going to scam you and run away to Vegas. In that regard 0-conf is sort of like Venmo -- it's reversible, so it's best used among people you trust.
But anyway there's a bigger point to be made here, and I can make it in three words:

You do. If you don't like this upgrade, don't install it, or just start using a different wallet. This is a change to that particular wallet, not to the consensus code. Any wallet maker can still maintain or integrate support for BIP70. (E.g. Electrum still supports BIP70.) The Bitcoin Core wallet devs decided not to. They shouldn't be forced to maintain features that they don't want, just as you shouldn't be forced to use wallets you don't want.

It's because he picked round numbers for block times, block halvings, and satoshi divisibility. 10 minute block times, 4-year block halvings, 8 decimals of divisibility. Do the math and that means the halvings occur every 210,000 blocks, and can only happen so many times before we're halving "down from" 1 satoshi. At that point, since partial satoshis don't exist on the blockchain, it just stops the block reward altogether. So 21 million (actually a few sats less than that) is a result of choosing certain values for block times, block halvings, and satoshi divisibility, and those values happened to be rather easily understandable, round numbers.

Yes. Let X = the price at which you bought it, Y is the new price, and Z is how much you bought.
Here's The formula: (YZ) - (XZ) = how much you would have made or lost.
For example, if you bought 0.5 bitcoins at $10000, and $8000 is the new price, you'd plug in  ($8000\*0.5) - ($10000\*0.5) = -$1000. You lost $1000.

(That took a little less than an hour.) Afterwards, I plugged the SD card back into the raspibolt and booted both machines (the raspibolt and the new server), and they happily synced the blocks that had been found during the last hour with no issues.

It's true that the overwhelming majority is Core. But doublespend-relayers tend to connect to one another, so you've only got to make it to one. Scammers simply tell their wallet to connect to a doublespend relayer that they know.


Bitcoin Unlimited explains why they do this on doublespend.cash: "If you are accepting 0-conf payments, it's in your interest to detect double spend attempts. ... Bitcoin Unlimited detects double spends relayed to it and then forwards them to other nodes, so they aslo can detect them."
Most developers don't believe in "security by obscurity," i.e. trying to keep doublespends a secret for as long as possible. Doublespends are a known thing, and unconfirmed transactions are risky on *every* blockchain. Merchants should try to detect them, and so they should run a node that connects to doublespend networks like Knots or Bitcoin Unlimited, so that -- if someone tries to scam them -- they're more likely to detect it. That way, if they don't detect a doublespend attempt, they can have a little more confidence that the unconfirmed transaction won't be doublespent (unless the scammer is colluding with a miner, or plans to doublespend after leaving the store). And if he does detect a doublespend, he can say, "Sorry, I've got to wait for a confirmation on this one." (Or: "Get out of my store, scammer!")

After the funding transaction confirms it's in the complete control of the purchaser. But before that, there's a brief period -- about 10 minutes, typically -- during which Zap controls the bitcoins and could theoretically double-spend them. That's true of all exchanges though, until you withdraw; this just automates some of the process of buying/withdrawing so that you have full custody of your coins in a lightning channel only 10 minutes after you've bought them (on average). And in the meantime, you can still spend them, though during that brief period -- if you do spend them -- you're trusting Zap not to doublespend them.

A regular user would need to learn how to construct a transaction manually, meaning they'd stop being a regular user (because regular users don't know how to do that). The procedure involves selecting an input (a coin in one of the sender's addresses -- interestingly, an input is also called an unspent transaction output, because it was once the "output" of another transaction and it hasn't been spent since then), a new output (the recipient's address), a change output (one of your own addresses), an amount to send to each output, and a fee.
Then you construct a nearly identical transaction, except you have to make sure you don't include the recipient's address and that you increase the fee by a lot. Then, broadcast both transactions, e.g. through coinb.in. The recipient's wallet will tell him that an unconfirmed transaction has been received by his wallet, but that transaction will likely never get confirmed, because the one with the bigger fee is likely to get selected by the miners and included in a block. That will render the "lower fee" transaction invalid, so it will be dropped.

They run the user's phone number through an algorithm which is kept secret by their server. That algorithm generates your private keys. Keeping that algorithm a secret is very important to their business model; if it becomes publicly known, then randos on the internet will be able to recreate your private keys by typing your phone number into it. So their whole business model is a security risk; with other companies, if their server gets hacked, the thieves get some of your data. With these guys, if their server gets hacked, the thieves get the algorithm that lets them steal the money of anyone who they know is a user of CoinText.
When a phone number matching yours sends a text to CoinText's server, they run that phone number through their algorithm in order to create your private keys (or recreate them if you're using their service again later), and then they can move any coins you have locked up with those private keys to someone else.
They make a big deal about not "writ[ing your] data to [the] disk." They are relying on you trusting what they say there, as well as trusting that their servers never get hacked. Moreover, assuming it's true that they do not *currently* write your data to their hard disk, they *could* change their code at any time and *start* storing your data (including your private keys) in order to take custody of your money. So use at your own risk.

It's a payment protocol where your wallet is given a url instead of an address, and then it has to contact that url with a GET request, at which point the merchant's server will give it an address and an amount to pay. This payment protocol was added to Bitcoin in 2013 in order to automate the process of typing in an address and an amount, because humans often typo that information, which is a costly mistake that is rarely made by machines. Also, the developers figured it would be nice to have the "lock icon" indicating security when your device looks up a url instead of an address.
However, there was a simpler way to do an equivalent thing using BIP21, and the only merchant who really uses BIP70 (to my knowledge) is Bitpay. And BIP70 introduced a significant security risk, because the "lock icon" is provided by SSL certifiers, who are a trusted third party. (Imagine if bitcoin got deplatformed by the SSL people and then any time you tried to pay a Bitpay invoice you got a message saying "This transaction is not secure!") Anyway, most bitcoin wallets don't support the BIP70 payment protocol, and it was deprecated a few versions ago in Bitcoin Core. Now they are finally removing it altogether (though other wallet makers can still use it if they want).

@_date: 2019-09-08 17:19:46
"Possible"? Anything is possible.
"Economically unfeasible"? Usually. Rolling back 1 block can be done by a large miner (especially if they have 51% of the hashrate), but it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and there would be a high chance of failure. You should only worry about a rollback attack on your transaction if it would be worth it to the attacker -- in which case, you should wait for more confirmations.
Also be aware that about once a week there is a natural "single block reorg." This happens when two miners on opposite sides of the world each mine a different-looking block within a few seconds of each other. Due to latency, it is possible that nodes "closer" (physically) to one miner will see that miner's block first, and then the network has to come to consensus on which block will be the "real" one added to the blockchain. The "losing" block becomes an orphan block, and if there are any transactions in that block that were only mined by that miner and not by the "winning" miner, those transactions will no longer be confirmed. If that happens, an attacker whose transaction got "unconfirmed" would have a new opportunity to reverse it, even though it (temporarily) had one confirmation. If you're a merchant and you're worried that such an extremely unlikely scenario might happen to you, you should wait for two confirmations.

Fake news. "Lightning Sucks" is not a quote from the creator of lightning. What he said was, "Profit is a bug," by which he seems to have meant that it was a mistake to suggest to people that there's a way to make significant money by running a lightning node. Running a lightning node offers incentives like instant transactions and low fees, and the cost of operation is low. Therefore, a bunch of hobbyist node operators are running nodes on the network, which makes the "for profit" nodes (the ones that charge non-negligible fees) unnecessary. People route around them to go through the hobbyist nodes, who are interested in this because they \*save\* money, not because the \*make\* money. That's why he said that profit (as a marketing tool for lightning) is a bug -- he didn't say lightning sucks.

Unconfirmed bitcoin transactions can indeed be reversed. That is why confirmations are important: you can't be sure you've got the money until the payment is confirmed on the blockchain.


It's an issue if you give someone products or services without a confirmed transaction. Just wait for the transaction to confirm before giving someone your product or service.
BTW there's a notable exception to all of this: the lightning protocol. If your bitcoin wallet supports the lightning protocol, any payments made using that protocol are irreversible even without being confirmed on the blockchain.

I sometimes do bug testing and issue reporting to the real software developers, and I sometimes write hobby software for my bitcoin/lightning nodes, but I don't know the languages that the "real developers" use (C++ for Bitcoin Core, C for c-lightning, Go for LND and Neutrino, and Scala for Eclair). I know Javascript, a little PHP, and a little Bash. The only "complete" software I ever wrote was merchant software; I could put products on a webpage, create a unique invoice for whatever the user selected, check the status of their payment, and -- upon receiving a confirmation -- give them a receipt (and store it for the merchant). But I never started a store, so it was really just a hobby. I started to write an interface for a noncustodial bitcoin web wallet but it was only half-completed when I lost interest. I also wrote a half-completed racing game that I was going to call Blockchain Racing, before -- again -- losing interest.
Recently I'm experimenting with various forms of noncustodial staking to see if I can make my bitcoins "work for me." E.g. I can put them up for sale on Bisq, make them available for coinjoins on Joinmarket, make them available for private onchain transactions via Lightning Loop, and I can take a small fee for all of those services without giving anyone custody of my coins. I'm going to see how much profit I can make from this (basically bitcoin's version of decentralized finance) and then hopefully do some youtube tutorials in case anyone else is interested.
I also listen to a LOT of bitcoin podcasts.

If I understand it correctly, this will be superior to Sphinx Send because you can actually prove that you made a payment to a given node, paid it a certain amount, and that the payment was successful. \[\[EDIT: CDecker corrected me below. I was wrong.\]\] I believe Sphinx Send omits the "proof of payment" part. Sphinx involves sending someone a payment without getting an invoice first; this new method, which I'll call the "pay them in fees" method until there's a better name for it, does involve getting an invoice -- because you *create* one -- and thus you also end up with a proof-of-payment corresponding to that invoice.

I basically agree with what you say, except it is my understanding that there are important exceptions to the phrase "the federation can steal your coins at will." The "advertised" way to get bitcoins onto Liquid is to hand them over to the federation, who will then issue you liquid coins. If you do this, they can keep your bitcoins and not issue the liquid coins, or refuse to return your bitcoins when you want to withdraw. That's what I think you mean by "steal[ing] your coins at will."
However, there is another way to get coins on Liquid without using the federation. This is by receiving them from other people who already have Liquid coins. The federation cannot know what addresses belong to whom on the liquid network (except the addresses that they've issued coins to in a regulated exchange), nor can they censor transactions once coins are *on* Liquid.
The only censorship the federation can do is (1) not issue liquid coins to people who try to onboard via the federation and (2) not give bitcoins to people who try to withdraw via the federation. If you exchange your own bitcoins for liquid coins via anyone who already has coins on Liquid, then Liquid can't even know about it (due to confidential transactions being a thing on Liquid), let alone censor the transaction or steal coins from you. And if you withdraw from Liquid without going through the federation (by directly trading your liquid coins for someone else's bitcoins on the bitcoin network), the federation can't do anything about it or even know it happened.

Your node is probably downloading the blockchain. (I'll show you how to check in a second.) When you ssh into your pi, the pi won't do anything automatically just because you logged in, but the processes you created by following the Stadicus guide should be running in the background. You can check to see if your node is downloading the blockchain by running this command: 


That command is if you're running on mainnet. If you're running on testnet, use this command: 


If you run that command, you should see the following output (or similar) every few seconds (multiple times per second if you're just starting):


You should also occasionally see messages like this one:


And this one:


All of those outputs indicate what your node is currently doing. "UpdateTip" means it downloaded and processed a block. Eventually there will be 500,000+ updates that look like that, though you'll only see the most recent ones. The part that says something like progress=0.862591 is important -- it tells you how close you are to finished downloading the whole chain. When progress = 1, you're done. When it equals 0.5, you're halfway done, and so forth. BTW your node will begin by downloading the chain very quickly, and you'll rocket through the first 40%. But it will really start to slow down and come to a crawl around 65% and you'll only be doing like 5% per day. That's normal -- blocks were mostly empty for the first several years, so they take like no time at all to process. They only started having a significant number of transactions between 2014 and 2016, and now they're full consistently, so each block takes about 10 seconds to process nowadays (on a Raspberry Pi that is. On a normal computer they still only take a tiny fraction of a second).
The "Connection reset by peer" message means somebody who was connected to your node disconnected from it. Peers on the network switch who they're connected to all the time. One reason they do so is to save bandwidth -- if you're downloading the blockchain, one peer doesn't want to serve you all the blocks, because it takes a lot of bandwidth, so after serving you maybe 100 blocks, that peer will disconnect and your node will find a new peer. So you'll see a lot of "Connection reset by peer" messages.
The "pre-allocating" message means your node is preparing a data file so that you can store more blocks.


You should download the full blockchain before you continue with the lightning portion of the guide. If your node doesn't have a fan on it, definitely get a fan, even just a desk fan to circulate the air, and point it directly at your node. You don't need to keep it there forever, just while you're downloading/processing the blockchain, but if you don't have a fan on your device it will overheat because raspberry pis have a very small processor. When I set my node up, I didn't put a fan on it, and it went fine at first. I downloaded and processed 90% of the blockchain with no issues. But then it started overheating and turning off, and eventually the data got corrupted and I had to start from scratch and redownload from block 0. It was awful, and I made sure to get a desk fan the second time. Now that it's done downloading the full chain, I don't need a fan on it anymore, because it only processes blocks once every 10 minutes (on average), but in that initial blockchain download you'll definitely need to keep your device cool.

Knots is synchronized with Bitcoin Core but offers network activity graphs and charts (think stuff like Johoe's Mempool, except trustless). It also uses full RBF instead of opt-in RBF as its default transaction replacement policy. This means that -- by default -- it will relay any doublespend transaction so long as it pays a higher fee than the original, whereas a Bitcoin Core node will only relay a doublespend if the spender flagged the original as a potential RBF. Knots also exposes configurable options better than Bitcoin Core. For example, if you don't like the default replacement policy you can set it to whatever you want using a simple button in Settings, whereas with Bitcoin Core they don't expose that option so you'd have to actually dive into the code to change the transaction replacement policy. And it gives users the option to accept only smaller blocks if they want to support that, though its default blocksize policy is the same as Bitcoin Core's.


It's not. Their big sell is "more stuff in the Settings menu." The option to do microsize blocks is just one option, and it's not even the default.

What types of messages are you seeing when you type that command? (While you're replying, if you think something might be sensitive info, feel free to redact it by saying things like "log2work=[shortNumberHere]" and so forth.)


That shouldn't matter, bitcoin updates are backward compatible so you can run basically as old a version as you want. Some of my peers are as old as version 0.14, and I'm running 0.17. Downloading a new version of Bitcoin Core gets you all the latest features but it's not required to participate on the network.


The reason it takes longer than you would expect is because it doesn't "just" download a 200GB file. It downloads the first megabyte, processes all the transactions in that, then the next megabyte, processes all the transactions in that, etc. (Well, that's simplifying, since blocks are usually not exactly 1 MB, but my point is that it downloads one block at a time and processes all the transactions in that block before downloading the next one.) As the blocks get more and more transactions in them, your computer takes a longer time processing each block, so it might download 1MB and then not get around to downloading the next block for up to 10 seconds.


Because *downloading* is not the thing that overheats the pi, it's that while it's downloading the blockchain its also processing the transactions, and it won't get a break until the whole thing is processed, so the processing unit is constantly running at maximum. The pi has a processor the size of a smartphone cpu, so it shouldn't run that much for that long without doing something to cool down. Your computer should have a much more powerful processor than your pi, because it's designed to handle bigger projects, so your computer should sync the blockchain in a lot shorter time period.


That's good. Feel free to ask any questions at any time.

If you want a bigger block size, use a coin with a bigger block size. You're free to use what you want, and we're free to use what we want. Let me ask you: what is the reason why you don't use bch coin? If it's because their protocol is clearly centralized and controlled, that's precisely a consequence of them trying to scale up quickly, through dubious block size increases and other hard forks, which were so fast and so broken that many of the node operators on their network couldn't keep up and just stopped running the software. As a direct consequence, there are only a few people in control of that whole network. That pathway -- the one that has lead to bch being clearly centralized and controlled, and dropping in value -- is the precise reason why we won't do that in bitcoin. Let adoption remain slow -- if we try to scale quickly, we'll turn into the bch network. And no one wants that.

Right, and if there was enough community support to add more decimal places, the bitcoin network could do so via a hard fork, or via some exotic soft fork proposal. E.g. if we ever decided to make extension blocks a thing in bitcoin, I believe that additional decimals could be added to any transactions that went into them, and this would be backward-compatible because old nodes would never even see the extension blocks or the transactions in them. I'm sure there are other exotic soft-fork methods that could give us additional decimals, but that's the first one that comes to mind.

Yes, they are private, though they still do give some information to your peers, and some of that shared information can be further masked by using private channels.
First things first, a lightning wallet does not ask for any of your personal information when you run it or at any other point. You just download an app, hit a button, and there's your wallet. When you connect to other people, there's no prompt that says "Tell us your name and social security number before you connect." At no point are you ever asked to give anyone any personal information. Nonetheless, depending on how you configure your node (such as whether you use public channels or private channels, see below), other people on the network may be able to find out some things about your node.
A desktop lightning wallet typically creates public channels by default. A public channel tells the world how much money it contains, but not how much of that money is yours. Channel balances are typically split between you and your counterparty, and only you and your counterparty know how much belongs to each other. Public channels are useful for people who are running routing nodes so that people can find a route through the network to send a payment from their node to someone else's node using publicly available information, and nodes are incentivized to broadcast public channels in order to collect routing fees from the public.
A public channel also broadcasts your ip address to the whole world, unless you run your node over tor. Your ip address is a form of personal information that some people can (usually) identify you with. E.g. your internet service provider and/or the government can look up who owns what ip address. If you look up a random lightning node on 1ml.com, you'll likely see an associated ip address after the " symbol, and the government or an ISP could use that information to identify the node operator. But since all three major lightning node implementations offer tor support, node operators may simply opt to run their nodes over tor, and then the government/ISPs can't obtain the node operator's real ip address because they would only see a random tor address that could belong to anyone.
If you don't want the network to know your ip address or how much money you have in your channel or that you even Have a channel, you can create a private channel, and your node won't tell the rest of the network about that channel -- only your counterparty will know you have it (and how much money you have in it). Other people won't be able to route payments through your private channels unless you share your private channel information with them. Mobile wallets typically create private channels by default, partly because a mobile device isn't always connected to the internet or even powered on, and so it wouldn't make a good routing node. Private channels can send payments, and they can receive payments by giving the sender a "hint" about a node they can route to who knows how to get the payment the rest of the way to the recipient, but they cannot route payments unless they give people who want to route through them information about their channel and its balance (which effectively makes it a semi-public channel, known to some users but not to all).
When it comes to sending an individual payment, your counterparty doesn't know who originated that payment (it could have been routed to him from 200 hops away and he'd have no way of knowing) or where it's ultimately going (the ultimate recipient might be 200 hops away too). He can't even know how much money is ultimately going to the recipient. If your node asks your counterparty's node to forward 2000 satoshis to one of his other counterparties, that payment might be a multipath payment where the ultimate recipient is actually getting 5000 satoshis but two other people are routing the rest of the money; or it could be a boomerang payment where only 10 of those 2000 satoshis are staying with the intended recipient, and the remainder are going back to the sender through some other path.
In short, routing nodes do not know who sent a payment, where it's going, or how much is going there. They only know how much money they are being asked to forward from one of their counterparties to the next, with no information about who originally sent the payment or where it's ultimately going.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:58:35
Most people will make their channels private, not to prevent abuse, but because they're on devices like smartphones that can't do routing reliably.


Correct, but many people want to run public channels because you make money from routing payments. If your friend routes 10,000 payments through your channel, you should earn at least 10,000 satoshis from him, which means you can now afford to open a new channel using the fees you earned.

- Takes them weeks if it's an international transfer

- They store your private info in a big centralized database that hackers get greedy for

First, you don't have to run your own full node to have a non-custodial ln wallet. Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for Android is non-custodial, and so is Eclair, and neither one requires you to run your own full node.
Second, it is my humble opinion that eventually the masses will run their own btc and ln nodes. Or at least I think it is possible to get to that point by building nodes into popular "set-it-and-forget-it" hardware like modems and wifi routers.
This is particularly relevant for merchants, because no cryptocurrency network can be secure unless most of the merchants who accept it run a full node.

KYC is an abbreviation for "Know Your Customer." It refers to a set of laws in the USA that says that companies who process financial transactions must collect and store personal information from their customers and use it to screen for bad actors. They must also hand that information over to the government if the government demands it. All regulated bitcoin apps have KYC requirements (including Square), meaning you have to give them your personal information (such as driver's license and social security number) in order to use their full set of services. However, it's perfectly legal to use unregulated bitcoin apps (such as an open source wallet or a decentralized exchange), because nobody involved with those wallets/services is processing transactions, so the makers aren't subject to KYC rules.

I haven't developed anything using WebLN, so I'm only going off what I've read and watched in videos, but I believe one of the major differences is that WebLN eliminates the need for buttons and links in certain scenarios. For example, if you went to a webpage where you need to pay to watch a video, that page could open up your wallet as soon as the page loads (before you've clicked anything), prefill it with an invoice, and ask you if you'd like to pay however much it costs to watch that video. WebLN can also ask your node for its Node ID to check if you've paid for a month of access to some service. For example, if Netflix used WebLN, you wouldn't need to give them your email or your credit card number; they could tell if you've paid for the month by checking your Node ID, and if you haven't paid, prefill an invoice and ask you if you'd like to. I don't know all of the functions built into the WebLN standard yet, but those are two of the functions I'm excited about, and I'd like to see the standard gain greater adoption.

There's not currently any js implementation of the underlying technologies.

These tools aren't magical, so you'd need to do some cleanup and optimization, but getting the underlying technologies in the Javascript language would be an important first step.

Bech32 is cheapest, followed by p2sh segwit, followed by legacy. The only benefit to using legacy that I'm aware of is that that address type has a standardized method of doing "proof of reserves" -- i.e. you can sign a message from a legacy address that proves your ownership of it (and any funds associated with it) without revealing the private key. There are methods of doing the same thing with segwit addresses, but none of those methods are standardized so it's hard to find wallets that support them. There is a bitcoin improvement proposal to create a standardized signing method for all address types, but it hasn't received enough feedback yet to get merged into the bitcoin protocol. So, for the time being, legacy addresses are the best addresses to use if you need to do proof of reserves. E.g. some exchanges do that to prove that they still have control of their users's funds.

We could also benefit from a method to trustlessly outsource the job of finding part of a route to a third party. There is currently a proposal for this called trampoline payments. If/when it is implemented, a mobile lightning wallet won't need to keep a graph of the full network and run a path-finding algorithm on that graph; instead, they'll just need to know one path to any trampoline node, and the trampoline node can then find the rest of the route to your ultimate destination (or to another trampoline node, and so forth). And trampoline nodes can't even find out your identity or steal your money, though they can decide not to help you find a route unless you pay them a fee first. This could result in a parallel fee market for routing payments, one where trampoline nodes compete to give you the lowest price for the fastest route in order to earn your fee. This will be a big help toward solving the routing problem on mobile devices by outsourcing it to people with bigger computers, trustlessly.

A true SPV node doesn't connect to the node of its creator, it connects to random peers just like a full node, except it only downloads/validates block headers, not full blocks. Most mobile wallets aren't true SPV nodes but "thin client wallets" which only hold private keys and simply ask the wallet creator's node (or the electrum network, or a block explorer) to validate everything, including blocks and headers. True SPV nodes are kind of slow at doing the initial synchronization -- they can take up to 15 minutes -- whereas a thin client wallet can be up and running in milliseconds. As a result, thin client wallets are the most popular type of mobile wallet.

You can transmit checks and money orders without being a money transmitter because those types of contracts are not a form of value, they just tell one person what service they can use to withdraw value from another person. That's what lightning nodes do, they transmit payment contracts -- not a form of value in themselves, but a pointer to the real source of value, the blockchain.


That is not an apt analogy because routing nodes do not even need to have any funds on their node and are non-custodial. The bike messenger would commit fraud if he wrote a check from an account that has no money; but, like a lightning node, he can deliver payment contracts. Lightning nodes can swap payment contracts between peers without ever having any form of value on their node or holding anyone else's value on their node. This podcast with actual lawyer Peter Van Valkenburg goes into much more detail on the requirements of money transmission laws and why they don't apply to lightning nodes (or any other bitcoin node):

You'll validate it even if you set it to only store 1MB. Your node will start with the first megabyte of the blockchain -- from 2009 -- validate that, then discard the data and validate the next megabyte, and so forth, all the way until it gets to the latest block. So it doesn't matter how much you set it to -- it will validate all the transactions eventually, including yours.

No, C can send to A. [Here's]( a recent transaction from a native segwit address to a legacy address. All address formats can send to each other, all address formats can receive from each other. There are some wallets that haven't upgraded to support the native segwit address format, but the problem there is not the address format, it's that the wallet is outdated and hasn't upgraded to support all of bitcoin's address formats. If you import your backup phrase into a wallet that supports native segwit addresses you can send from any address to any other address with no problem. Note that even if you're running an old wallet, it can still \*receive\* from native segwit addresses. Wallets don't care what addresses they receive from. (In reality, the address format is discarded at the time of sending, and the sending wallet directly uses the public key + a signature, not the address, which is just an abstract way of encoding the sender's public key. So the receiving wallet never even needs to know what address format the coin's previous owner used.)

Correct, I have not yet lost any money due to a lightning payment failure, despite the fact that they aren't all that rare. When there's a payment failure no funds are sent, you just get an error message instead of a proof-of-payment. The closest thing to an exception was a forced channel closure resulting from a failed payment where my counterparty thought my node was offline for too long, which meant that I paid the closure fee sooner than I had wanted to, before I could use that channel much. I paid about 50,000 satoshis (if I remember right) for that mining fee, and it really wasn't worth it because I had only made one or two payments through that channel, which means their average cost was significantly more than they would have costed if I had just paid onchain.
I wouldn't have cared if the channel had been used a lot, because then I can mentally count the cost of the fee as an average of all the times the channel was used. But since I had opened the channel recently, and suddenly my counterparty closed it on me before I had done much with it, it was no fun. I suspect the force closure was due to my node being offline for several days and not responding to pings. The only way I know of to "avoid" such a situation is to have a reliable internet connection and make sure you connect to peers that are also reliable -- and even then, your counterparty is allowed to close your channel with him at any time.

Not for small payments or instant payments. Not unless you use lightning. Also, lightning works too.


[That's probably why it's the second most common form of payment at Bitrefill]( It's probably also why there are more nodes on the lightning network than on any altcoin. 


First, all cryptocurrencies have fundamental algorithmic problems when it comes to scaling. This one is no different, except that there are well-known routing solutions for small-scale and medium-scale networks. You're right that there is not yet any known large-scale solution.


Lightning couldn't become centralized even if there was one hub that connected the whole network. Look up [the definition of centralized]( -- it involves control. Even if there was one big lightning hub, they'd have no control over payments, therefore lightning can never be centralized.


For BLW, you can use a watchtower or take the risk of getting your money stolen. For Eclair, the app just sends up a notification if your phone has been offline for two weeks.


I think they will because they will lose money otherwise.


First, that won't be for hundreds of years, and who knows what storage technology we'll have by then. Second, the blockchain can never be too big to store in a home node because you can run it in pruned mode and only keep the blocks that are relevant to you.


That's not a solution, it's a problem. SPV wallets are first of all inherently scammable because they don't validate the rules of the bitcoin network. Also, they do not solve the need for instant payments. SPV wallets do not make confirmations come faster.


I agree with the first half of your sentence. But why would they use other cryptocurrencies when all of them are even slower and less safe than bitcoin?

A p2sh address is a script address, i.e. an address where the funds can only be spent by executing a script written by the user's wallet. Segwit is just one example of a script that p2sh addresses support. Because p2sh addresses are designed to support \*any\* bitcoin script, there's a bit of overhead in them in terms of how much data there is in the address once you "unpack" it for spending using bitcoin script. Native segwit addresses, aka bech32 addresses, don't have that overhead because they don't support \*all\* bitcoin scripts, just segwit scripts. As a result, bech32 addresses are significantly smaller (once compiled to bitcoin script) than p2sh addresses are, and therefore it costs less money to put them on the blockchain. That's the only real difference between them.

If they are only accepting 0-confs temporarily they will likely be fine; you could do some analysis to estimate the likelihood of getting scammed by a 0-conf scammer over time and then adjust your behavior to match whatever likelihood you're comfortable with. For example, if 10% of 0-conf transactions were successfully doublespent per block, then you could estimate that if you only accepted 0-confs for a 10 minute period you'd only have a 10% chance of getting scammed. There are other parameters to consider (like how low the fee was on the 0-conf transaction and thus how many blocks it is likely to wait before getting confirmed), but it would be possible to come up with an estimated likelihood of getting robbed and only give away your product for a 0-conf if it has a low likelihood of getting doublespent. And otherwise, just tell the customer they'll have to wait for a confirmation before you'll give them their product.
Alternatively, use a second layer solution. You mentioned that they are waiting to have "enough of a float" to use lightning. I think you're referring to the incoming capacity problem; if so, remember that plenty of incoming capacity can be purchased from a liquidity provider like Bitrefill's Thor service for a very small fee. So there's no real reason to wait for incoming capacity before using lightning if you're a business.

Bitcoin fees aren't a percentage of what you send. They are an absolute value chosen by you, the user. Technically they are optional and you could set your fee to 0 satoshis per byte, but your transaction is unlikely to get mined (or even relayed to a miner) unless you choose 1 or more satoshis per byte. So the practical minimum is 1 sat/byte.

TLDW: the video's theory is that Adam Back is Satoshi because he has compared Satoshi to John Galt, a character from the book Atlas Shrugged who tried to maintain his privacy while still playing a lead role in rescuing society from a heavy-handed surveillance-state. The video documents instances of Adam promoting both Satoshi's anonymity and his notoriety. He promotes Satoshi's anonymity by vocally opposing efforts to identify him, and he once promoted Satoshi's notoriety (says the video) by trying to get him a dedicated Wikipedia page.
Then the video argues that if Adam WAS Satoshi AND thought of himself as sort of like John Galt, we could expect to see him promote Satoshi's anonymity and notoriety simultaneously because, in the book, it was important for John Galt not to be identified, but simultaneously important for him (and his ideas) to become well-known. That's the entire case the video rests on, and to me it is obviously a complete non-sequitur. All the "evidence" fits together just as well if Adam is not Satoshi but just thinks of Satoshi as sort of like John Galt. And it's not really evidence anyway.

No cryptocurrency is ready or stable.


You don't need to run a node to receive lightning payments, you can use non-custodial wallets such as Eclair or Bitcoin Lightning Wallet. Also, when it's a merchant who's saying "I don't want to run a node," the solution is not "then use a mobile wallet," it's education. If you don't run a node, then it doesn't matter what cryptocurrency you're running, you're trusting others not to cheat you. For small amounts that's probably fine, but merchants (especially) need to know that the only way to avoid being scammed is by running your own node. That's true for all cryptocurrencies, not just bitcoin.


That doesn't completely defeat the purpose. One onchain fee gets you thousands of lightning payments to anyone on the network. That's a pretty good deal.

No, unless the company itself tries to steal from you, which is super unlikely.
If you really want to speed up the transaction you should import your recovery key into Electrum (where your funds will show as "unconfirmed"), craft a new transaction spending the unconfirmed funds to one of your addresses, and give that transaction a very large fee. Miners will mine the low-fee transaction to get the high-fee transaction. This method of speeding up transactions is called "Child Pays For Parent" (CPFP).

Yeah the "going nowhere" thing is probably why amp has already been successfully tried on mainnet.


There are well-known routing algorithms for small-scale and medium-scale networks. Lightning wallets use one right now, which is why they work at small scale. There are also algorithmic solutions for large-scale networks, but they rely on certain things existing, such as "network highways" that are designed to accommodate large amounts of traffic across the network under the assumption that the network's "fringes" will all just connect to the "highways" and route through them. As you mentioned, trampoline payments work well with building out such a network.


It does mean that amp works and has been successfully used on mainnet. It also means that devs are working with it, which suggests that they are working to make it better. At least, that's what I think it means. What do you think it means?

First, in practice, you don't. For example, Bitrefill started accepting lightning payments without having a single public channel. People who wanted to use their service connected to them and started sending them payments, and pretty soon they were routing more payments than anyone else on the network, even though Bitrefill never had to put any money on their node. 
Second, people can find you on the lightning network even if you have no public channels. Go to 1ml.com, sort by channel count, and scroll to the nodes that have no public channels. Your node can be a fully functioning peer on the lightning network without having any public channels at all; you can be found, and -- if someone opens a channel to you or you open one yourself, such as a private one -- you can even be paid, without ever having any public channels.
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:10:36
It is difficult to get metrics because the network has very strong privacy built-in, and no one can see what has happened to other people's payments. I will say this: in my personal, anecdotal experience, about 10% of my payments experience some sort of failure, and one time I made a payment but did not receive the service I payed for. The site I was using -- [lightningconductor.net]( \-- acknowledged the payment but said there was an error preventing them from following through with their end of the deal, and their customer support never answered back even though I emailed them and provided proof of payment.
The payment failures are largely a consequence of the tech still being in beta, and we're all opening issues on github and working hard to make failures happen less often. The good news is, I've never ever lost money due to a failure of the lightning network, unless you count "losing money" broadly enough to include "one time I had to pay a mining fee due to a forced closure during a payment failure."
As for theft, we just need to make people aware of bad services that don't deliver what you've paid for. And if the value of the stolen money is high enough, there are legal measures that can be taken too, such as lawsuits, but I'm not suing lightningconductor over $10.

In my experience the fees are pretty comparable, but, if I was going to put $600 in bitcoin, I would do it on Cash App. I've saved up to $5 before on fees, but the real draw for me is that they let you withdraw instantly to your own wallet. Well, the first time isn't necessarily instant, because you have to do KYC and it took them a day to clear me, but every subsequent withdrawal is instant. Whereas Coinbase (just as one example) holds onto your coins for at least 6 days after you buy them before you can withdraw them, even after you've done all the KYC stuff. The one thing I am not wholly on board with about the Cash app is that they hide their fees by mixing it into the exchange rate and then *claim* they charge no fees. But you end up paying about the same amount you would on a "real" exchange to get the same amount of coins, so the fees are really just hidden in the exchange rate. I'm not on board with saying "There are no fees" when really, there are fees, they're just hidden.

He also asked for "why." the reason why you need to sign with the specific address private key (and not the "master" private key) is because all bitcoin addresses, except script addresses (the kind that start with a 3), are generated from a unique private key that only generates that one address.
What a wallet uses a recovery key for (that's the twelve word thingy that your wallet users should write down) is, it hashes it a bunch of times using sha256, and then it uses that hash to generate new private keys automatically. The hash of the twelve words is sometimes encoded as a "master private key," but that can't be used to sign transactions, it's only used to generate "child" private keys which are the things you really use to sign transactions. A standard wallet will create a new private key for each transaction. In short, the recovery key is only used to generate a bunch of private keys. Each address is subsequently generated from each private key.
Transactions from a given address need to be signed using their corresponding private key since that's what each private key is *for*. But note that if your wallet generated a private key a while ago and then "forgot" it due to memory constraints, you could regenerate that private key using the recovery key in order to sign the user's transaction.

There are already clients that stay in sync with the bitcoin network but rebroadcast replacement transactions whether or not the rbf flag is set, and those clients also network with each other to forward replacement transactions more effectively. Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT client does this, as does Bitcoin Unlimited. Versions of these clients exist both for the BTC network and the BCH network, resulting in it being super easy to broadcast replacement transactions on both networks whether or not RBF exists. Luke Dashjr's popular Bitcoin Knots implementation also makes this a configurable setting, though his client only exists for the BTC network.
