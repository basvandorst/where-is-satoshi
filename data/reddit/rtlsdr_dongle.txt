Oh, cool - thanks for the info!
I'm not in Canada and I was hoping to just pick up a few of the new releases (so not quite $500 :P), but it's good to know anyway.

Looks pretty awesome, I like the design. Would make a good addition to my collection.

Yes, this is ridiculous. There is a large swath of websites utilizing bitpay that have become unusable due to bitpay **requiring** BIP70 payment URI -- which they came up with, isn't officially even a BIP since they didn't go through proper channels, and decreases your privacy.
I also abandoned what I would've bought and instead went somewhere else to pay. Do NOT support these practices. If business are no longer receiving money because of bitpays ridiculous practices then they will move to a different provider or hopefully just accept BTC directly themselves.

If that's what you did with the OP ciphertext, you should move the coin ASAP, they will most assuredly get found. You're not really proving anything. This is coming from a guy running full nodes of many coins with full tx indexes; I reckon I could write a script and let it run and have it found in the relative short term (and I'm sure someone is), feels wrong to see you lose your money this way though...

Why? What qualifies the a shop as big or small?
It's a nice filter but I think by default I'd stick to all.

huh, damn that's good info about bitrefill, I had no idea.
Good info on localbitcoins too, I didn't know about that at all and I used to use them all the time! I'm gonna give it a shot right now in fact, are the amazon codes legit? I see people with 100% rating and it looks pretty good

You know looking at it from that angle I can sort of see your point.
I didn't actually click onto a lot of those stores but I see what you mean with those examples and I might actually say defaulting to only big stores is a good thing. 
Though, you might think of altering the qualifications. It looks to me like at least some of those "big" stores don't even fit the criteria, e.g. both [bitfodl]( and [ludvigart]( rank worse than 1MM but appear there.

This isn't the case, unfortunately (I just asked alexa and she didn't respond that way).
Someone uploaded a video with a custom response (probably using the blueprints feature as the article details) and then thenextweb wrote an article on it... I wish that was the real response, but the real response is actually similar to that of bitcoin (it's different when asking about any altcoin other than bch though, such as litecoin).
"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system, it is the first decentralized digital currency as the system works without a central bank or single administrator"
"Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency and worldwide decentralized payment system that works without a central bank or government."

alright, thanks for the info. A site like gyft would be sweet, but I may still give it a go on localbitcoins.

Actually, neither of those companies will even attempt to sell you an amazon gift card right now for bitcoin, but I don't know why.
But any other gift card you need and it's bitpay only BIP70-bend over if you want it- bullshit
