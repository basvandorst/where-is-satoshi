The only thing that concerns me with this survey is that 34% of bitcoin owners have never bought anything with bitcoin... in comparison to a centralized currency, bitcoin is seriously lacking. Is it because bitcoin is deflationary, or is it because too many are using bitcoin as an investment?
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:22:29
You must be very dumb to margin buy bitcoin

What are you talking about? I actually do not understand what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:22:45
Of course. I never said anything about the FDIC working with bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be unregulated, which is a bad thing and a good thing

Etf of bitcoins that can be bought for 0.2 btc each, at a minimum of 50000 shares (10000 btc). Allows big market movers to invest in btc via winklevoss.  Don't listen to people saying this will be a liquid stock- this won't be an easy sell due to the ipo

They're not really accepting BTC, they're using it more as a payment method. If they held the BTC instead of selling it at market value the second they got it, that would be really accepting BTC

You think financial institutions (which are extremely greedy) would want to pay more tax on an investment, when they could have had it before with no tax. If anything, it's driving big money away (which isn't a bad thing).

How is that good? We just lost 42% in 30 days mainly due to a country banning it and the largest exchange creating a shitstorm because they can't make any excuses up.

No, he's not. If he accepts them (in this case, you wouldn't see the pending next to his name) then he is an owner of bitcoins. Technically, TipperCoin is the owner of those coins.

@_date: 2014-03-22 16:27:00
It acts like a commodity/payment system.
Commodity: Price is fluctuating way too much for a currency. Look at a 2yr of btc/usd and euro/usd. 
Payment system: All bitpay does is convert it. No, Overstock doesn't really accept bitcoin. They just use it as a payment system so they can get more money/press.

About 9 months ago (can't recall the exact date) something extremely similar happened where everyone boycotted gox due to exchange lag, that should have been the signal to get out of it. People (unless gox closes its doors) will keep using gox

I have become more conservative of my market views. Reading on people being hacked/losing their wallet keys, the Mt. Gox situation where most people (a few notable cases that are contrary to this, I am aware) lose all their savings has affected my thoughts on free market economies. Am I against free markets? No; I just feel that there should be some regulation in place in economies so consumers can have a sense of safety in the system (an example of this is the FDIC). Am I against bitcoins? No; I just don't agree that bitcoin can be a "world" currency for all people. Bitcoin works for people to transfer money over the internet in an efficient manner where the old system of banks just cannot compete with.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:19:05

With Bitpay (or similar services) which TigerDirect, Overstock, Reddit use, the money is automatically converted. 


Exactly. That's why I consider it for at least currently, a payment method.

I doubt any country that has its own currency would like to be paid in bitcoins. How would they know who to punish, even without a mixing service being used?
@_date: 2013-07-24 03:40:19
Same thoughts here. When I learned he was closing this, looked like a classic sham. And seriously, who trusted this guy? I've been following bitcoin closely for a while and never thought these people because this would obviously be the result. Too bad it hurts bitcoin reputation due to the way the SEC worded that article.

@_date: 2013-03-16 13:55:57
Yes. But think about that taxes are necessary for a country &amp; government to function. If bitcoins became the majority, most governments would go into a deeper deficit than they are already in. It's a lot more than what I said in the original post. Think about the water supply, electricity, NSA, TSA, CIA, FBI, government museums.

I have 3 bitcoin which I'm planning to sell at $550. I bought them at $40. Do I hope bitcoin gets to $1000? Sure. Is is unprobable? Yes. Odds are it will drop/crash in a month. It is extremely overvalued right now
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:03:05
Look, I love bitcoin. It's a great concept of virtual cash. I'm not bashing it but suggesting to new users not to buy right now as it will go down. Let's be realistic; the price rise is all speculation. If you want to see it consume trillions of dollars of fiat, go ahead and believe that.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:55:06
Going to say what I said to hardfork. I used it to sell before the last crash and made a lot of money. Wasn't sure what to do with the next rise and drop. Now I've connected it and I'm guessing that it will drop but not crash.

@_date: 2013-03-12 03:18:57
I _needs_ to happen. It makes sure everyone can handle what is going on to fix issues. Also seeing the price rebound after a crucial bug shows trust and power in bitcoins. Also, better now then later.
