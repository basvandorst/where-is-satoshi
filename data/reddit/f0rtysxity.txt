I’ve never had an issue w them in ten years. Neither has any friend coworker acquaintance or family member. On the other hand I’ve lost money to a crypto exchange. And had funds frozen on a crypto exchange. And lost money twice because of a lost seed phrase. 
If you think the pitch to win people over is “PayPal can freeze your funds” then good luck to you!

I can’t read Italian but I hope your point wasn’t that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi but that gold and Euro are essential ponzie schemes as well. A small fraction of gold gets used in electronics but it is primarily a store of value due to its limited supply and durability. The Euro can always be used to pay tax obligations in Italy but it is primarily a medium of exchange. 
All three primarily have value because we believe someone else will accept it as something of value in the future. Which is like a ponzie scheme in a way. Not unlike a ponzie scheme.

He’s got a good point. The only possible replies I’ve found are
a) the moral argument (if he is a vegetarian or brings his own bags to grocery store) - Bitcoin separates the US Government from their ability to inflate the monetary supply. Google Modern Monetary Theory, inflation tax, or watch Big Short. 
b) the scaling argument - because Bitcoin is programmable there will come a day where it will transact faster than PayPal. 
or c) the financial argument - Bitcoin is the most scarce and durable resource we’ve ever seen and therefore the best store of value. In theory its value shouldn’t be tied to the dollar or stock market which could make it valuable as a hedge. In theory it should be worthwhile owning some as a small percentage of your portfolio. I say in theory since it hasn’t been tested in this capacity yet.

The moderators use the platform to promote BCash. A fork from Bitcoin. It’s disingenuous since the forum is labeled r/btc not r/bch.

Bitcoin is a living changing developing blockchain. 
BCash is a money grab. Changing one element wasn’t revolutionary. 
So I’m the big picture yes. 
And in the smaller picture BCash isn’t going to scale any better. It has no traffic. Any blockchain is cheaper right now since there is relatively little traffic. 
Do you actually believe BCash is the way forward?
And are you not getting paid for your comments?

All good points my friend. Did you also take into consideration that he owns bitcoin.com? And r/btc?
A little disingenuous no?
Roger Ver tells people that a coin with almost identical technology but little in term of future development is “the real Bitcoin”.  
We can also take his intentions into consideration. I doubt he has any intentions on developing BCH in the furniture. 
Is a bit of a scam. Yes. And then the market manipulations which are illegal in regulated markets. 
Yes. I’m comfortable calling it a scam. It’s a step up from BitConnect.

If you are a newcomer then Coinbase is the easiest and safest. They aren’t true supporters of the cause and the more you read or pay attention the sooner you will migrate away from their services.

I guess there is no rights to a name. But the bitcoin chain has the users in mind and a higher sense of purpose I would imagine. While the other attempts to use the goodwill and reputation from their work for personal profit.
Besides increasing blocksize I haven’t seen anything from the BCH camp to address long term scaling issues. Manipulating markets, setting up mislabeled wallets, promoting his product and deceiving people on r/btc and Bitcoin.com are worthwhile additions to bitcoin. 
Maybe the ends justify the means. And Roger Ver isn’t the total scumbag my gut tells me he is. And he is doing this because he’s got a long term solution to bitcoins scaling issues. He’s reinvested all his $$ into hiring coders to address those needs and he just isn’t telling anyone about it since he enjoys a surprise. 
If so I’ll owe you an apology.

I used to be very upset for the people getting scammed by BCash. Every friend I’ve had who has entered has eventually asked me about it with the intent of possibly buying. So We can imagine the underhanded marketing campaign is finding success. But at least Roger Ver is working hard to con some people for a few extra pesos. Meaning this scam won’t implode and disappear one day like BitConnect. 
BCash should slowly die out over the years. Meaning anyone who got conned can always leave for the better currency when they grow the wiser without too much damage being done.

change one variable and say you have amazing tech
get the bitcoin community invested in your scam since they ea receive a number of coins equal to the number of their bitcoins

Fair enough. It's a little funny actually, I purposely made my first projects more straight forward and less abstract because I understand I have no history making art. And having no history I haven't earned any credibility. And having earned credibility is one way an artist might get viewers to reflect on their work beyond a first impression.
So I appreciate you sharing your first impression with me and giving me a second chance.
The reason I used US Dollars instead of British Pounds is because the US Dollar was currency of the financial crisis in 2009. The US Dollar through the failure of the subprime loans of the US housing market and the US Dollar through the financial policies of the Federal Reserve. The US Dollar is the currency that created and recovered the financial crisis.
We can also assume that Satoshi Nakamoto didn't mention the headlines from a British newspaper because he/she/they were interested in discussing problems solely found with Britain's financial policies. More likely he was using it as an example to highlight a global problem to which Bitcoin could be a solution.
The US Dollar is the world's reserve currency and Bitcoin aspires to be the first world currency.

1. owns bitcoin.com - promotes bcash
2. works with r/btc - promotes bcash
3. call bitcoin - bitcoin core (gets offended when someone calls bitcoin cash bcash)
4. lies to people telling them bcash is the real bitcoin
5. lies to people telling them that bcash has superior technolog. Bcash has increased blocksize - a short term scaling solution at the cost of greater centralization.
6. pays shills to promote bcash on social media
7. manipulated the markets to pump bcash price up 
8. is gay. and isn't honest with himself about it.
He's created an fork from bitcoin that has contributes nothing in the form of innovation, technology, or development. Says his fork does. And get's newcomers to invest in what they think is a developing, significant, useful currency.
He's a POS. And the fact that he sold his reputation and good will for more money, when he already has more than he can spend in one lifetime is sad to see.

I'm not sure what your financial situation is but I could recommend one of the following:
a) Be part of the revolution.
Learn about it. If you believe in the product and want to be part of the revolution then you don't worry about the price fluctuations.
b) Store of value. 
Because Bitcoin is deflationary (relative to inflationary fiat currency) and because it appears the stock market may be due for a correction Bitcoin could be a safe place to store value.
c) Gamble.
No need to ask any questions. It's not too late. Just put some in. Let it ride.
Good luck and have fun!

Lol. They think you threw your money away but when it goes up again and is back in the news one or two of them will get interested and ask you about it. It's kind of comical and the people who do are usually unexpected.
  
At least that's been my experience. How do I deal with it? I'm a little older so I'm not in as vulnerable position. 
  
But I've observed in myself and others that if you are in it for the revolution then it doesn't matter what the price does and what people say. If you are in it as an investment which is fine as well, then maybe you should listen to your friends and family and put no more than 10% of your savings into Bitcoin. Maybe 10% into gold 30% cash and 50% stock market? (You could also familiarize yourself with the terms: uncorrelated asset and inflationary hedge.)
  
As for the revolution I'd recommend:
  
Homo Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harrari (must read)
The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean A
and any video by Andreas Antonopoulos
There is maybe a third more simple angle you could take. Point out that investing in Bitcoin has helped you save. A lot of people, myself included, have a hard time putting money aside. Ask your friends and family how much money (percentage wise, never good to talk about absolute wealth with people) they've put aside over the last six months. It's a challenge that a lot of people can relate to.   
Anyway. Good luck with it!

1. [
2. I was taught this as well. Because bitcoin is non-inflationary many bitcoiners are fans of Austrian Economics. Austrian Economists believe savings is the driving force behind an economy. They are also libertarians believing in a limited Federal Government. Contrasted to Keynesian Economics which believes spending is the driving force behind an economy and that an inflating monetary supply drives participants to spend.
There are examples of economies working well with a fixed currency (gold standard) and a fiat currency. Curious though is that the Swiss, one of the last holdouts, went off the gold standard around 30 years ago.
Also curious was trying to find out which system works best is a shit show of misinformation. I'm not an economist and was able to finally bow out from this mess after reading Nassim Taleb. He believes macro economics is a shit show muddled by political interests. He said exactly what I had been thinking.
One thing worth looking up is "inflationary tax" as a contributing factor for the decline of the middle class in the US over the last 50 years.
5. True. But at the very least your reddit shit poster circle jerker is many orders of magnitude less powerful than a bank. So if don't have time to try and find the "truth" then picking sides should be a relatively easy decision.
6. Good question. Many years from now people will look back at us as savages for the animal holocaust we participated in. Then again how can they judge us when they will have delicious baby back ribs grown in the lab/factory as an alternative? Also there are plenty of examples of inferior products winning out vs inferior ones: Beta vs VHS, AC vs DC current etc. 
Here is an very brief inspirational video clip which helped me answer this question:

Argument: It consumes a large amount of energy at a time when energy production involves air pollution and speeds up global warming. 
Reply: True. However, because mining operations are mobile and as a business incentivized to find the cheapest energy available they end up in places with surplus and renewable energy. * I’d research that a little more. I’m not sure about it. 
Also revenue from an inflation tax is used to fund programs that are not popular with the citizenry. Traditionally war. And wars are among the worst environmental pollutants. 
Argument: It’s a ponzie scheme or confidence game. 
Reply: True. But so is gold and the dollar. All are used as a store of value or medium of exchange with the understanding that someone else will accept it in the future as something of value. Gold and the dollar have a longer history of use which is very valuable. But to say that they are somehow different is false.  * And if anyone says gold has industrial use ask them if they have positions shorting gold. If not tell them to stfu since only a small fraction of gold’s value comes from industrial consumption. 
Argument: Quantum computing will break Bitcoin’s encryption. 
Reply: Andreas Antonopoulus pointed out that the US let ships sink during WW2 because alerting them to the danger they were in would have let the Germans know the US had cracked they messaging code. The value of stealing coded messages from the enemy was worth far more than the lives and goods on a few commercial ships. 
Similarly the first country to develop quantum computing won’t signal to the rest of the word their accomplishment by breaking Bitcoin transactions and stealing Bitcoin which would cause the value to plummet anyway. 
I’m also going on the assumption that if the network is compromised it could be forked from a pre compromised date and reestablised after it has been encrypted to match the power offered by quantum computers. But I’m not sure about this and haven’t heard anyone in the know discuss it.

I use a Trezor but basically my bitcoin is in cold storage. So any wallet could have been used to establish the seed phrase.
Then I wrote down the seed phrase in a pattern mixed in with other possible words ([bip39 word list]( I have a copy of this list in a safe deposit box and at a friend's house. Examples of a pattern would be the second column or even rows etc. Then I shared my pattern with my wife so she along with a third party (friend or lawyer) could gain access to the word list. 
I also have a small amount on my phone from a different address/wallet.
I'm pretty happy with this solution and would recommend it. For mainstream adoption I believe a 3rd party custodial wallet option like CashApp is the way to go. At least for newcomers.

The only thing BCash brings to the table is the name Bitcoin in Bitcoin Cash. And an active PR campaign from alleged reputable sources such as bitcoin.com and r/btc to mislead newcomers in the confusing world of crypto currencies into believing that BCH is potentially Bitcoin.

I went to La Sirene a restaurant in NYC that accepts Bitcoin. I feel like you have realistic understanding of what it entails. It was a labor of love from the owner which I respect and appreciate. The bill came out with a QR code and I paid the bill. And then they texted him asking for a confirmation but he was busy or asleep so we just left. 
But the space is small enough that I can’t imagine anyone dine and ditching. 
On a plus side the employees seemed excited I knew about bitcoin and 2 of them seemed to know a lot about it as well. 
So totally impractical but still totally cool.
Good luck with the restaurant and be sure to find ways to let the community know. I always try to support businesses who accept Bitcoin. Where are you located?

Good question which I’ve been curious about myself too. I’ve come to the conclusion that because the question addresses issues of power present in society today, the information is intentionally convoluted. 
Conventional wisdom says that a small amount of inflation to incentivize spending is healthy. At least that’s what I learned growing up and people I discuss this with bring up today. 
Then again Austrian economists say that economic health should be measured by savings rather than by spending (Keynesian or Friedman). 
There are examples of both economies (gold standard vs fiat/inflationary) running well. (Pre WW1 for gold standard.) 
Governments are motivated to accept an inflationary model since it gives them another means of taxation - inflationary tax. So their objectivity on this debate is questionable. 
As I said earlier I don’t have an answer. But for me there is enough reasonable doubt over the inflationary/fixed discussion for me to say let’s give it a go. The fact that it would weaken our government (which no longer represents the interests of the people) and financial institutions by eliminating the inflation tax makes me even more enthusiastic.

The poor are living hand to mouth. So they don’t have currency that is losing value in their bank account. 
Wages rise roughly with inflation so when your grandma says she remembers when a soda cost 5 cents she forgets to tell you that she earned 25 cents an hour. 
It’s money that you are holding that loses purchasing power to inflation.

I don’t know enough about everything. But I’ve read up enough to trust a core team of developers who have been working on this for a long time over the 2 guys and Roger Ver working on BCH. It’s not possible that BCH was created for short term profits??? That makes perfect sense to me. You thinking Roger Ver and 2 random coders can do it better than the guys who’ve been working on this like it’s a cure for cancer for the last 5 years doesn’t make sense to me.

I guess we are arguing on two different points. 
One do you really trust someone to be random when they make their one investment? Almost certainly someone will have their judgement colored by the markets highs and lows and try to time the market. DCA eliminates the pitfalls of human psychology messing up your investment. 
The other point is the reduction of variance which can also stress people out. That’s why they have health insurance. Even though it’s a bad investment financially it reduces the swings.

I believe there are legitimate concerns for Bitcoin and I don’t think you’ve hit any of them lol. Bitcoin is the most decentralized blockchain which makes its base layer inherently slower than the rest. The blockchains that are faster are more centralized and more vulnerable than Bitcoin to a physical attack on their computing power. 
There is also the threat of quantum computing being able to break the blockchain’s encryption.  
I believe the last line of defense with all these types of attack is creating a fork from an pre compromised record of the blockchain, forking it, and implementing updates after the vulnerabilities have been patched. It would be chaos and many transactions would be rolled back. It would then be up to people to choose to continue using bitcoin given that cost or return to their government fiat or gold. 
And if that can’t be done then Bitcoin will be donezo along with all other crypto currencies. But 10+ years in and Bitcoin is still doing fine. 
A bigger concern is the lack of privacy. 
My rule of thumb is to ignore any shill who believes the only way their project can succeed is by stealing value or users from Bitcoin.

The posts on here that talk about how they bought on the dip are fun, but somewhat misleading. If 100 people buy bitcoin one or two are going to, through randomness and chance, nail the dip. The rest who missed, for the most part, remain silent. 
So responsibly I want to accept my falliblility and my weaknesses and dollar cost average.

“At the expense of the rest of us” assumes that the rest of us are in the middle class. The middle class have proportionally the highest percentage of their wealth in the form of currency. I saw one chart that said around 45% (real estate 45%). While the upper class has around 5%. And the poor have no $. 
So the middle class is paying the inflation tax.
We can even take it farther and add that the government then uses those funds to run social programs for corporations which have lobbied their way into our governments favor. 
So. Actually yes. The rich are becoming richer at the expense of the rest of us. Even the most hardcore advocates of capitalism agree that we aren’t really running capitalism in the US. Rather State Capitalism or Crony Capitalism. And that it’s a problem. 
But why social programs for people are vilified so vociferously compared to the programs run for corporations is truly a testament to the power of propaganda.

Increasing block size is not a long term scaling solution for bitcoin. Roger Ver knows this. He also knows that the core development team know more about blockchain than he ever will. In fact most of us know this right?
The only people I know who have bought BCH are people who “day trade” it. 
I welcome the uncertainty. Bitcoin and blockchain needs to be tested. I just feel bad for newcomers who end up purchasing Bitcoin Cash. If you believe Bitcoin Cash has a higher purpose than being day traded and bilking the uniformed newcomer than you are doing it wrong.

Original intent is not a vindication of current intent. Bad actors rarely if ever start out with bad intentions. Most always bad deeds are done by opportunists who show their true colors when there is a situation they can take advantage of. If you believe that r/btc, [bitcoin.com]( and bitcoin twitter are not being used to intentionally deceive newcomers into thinking that bitcoin cash is bitcoin then you are being dishonest.

Nike supporting Kaepernick is just a PR move too. Doesn’t mean it is void of any meaning.

I'm not sure if goals are the right way to ask the question. But Bitcoin is a new currency that cannot be censored by existing governments because of its decentralized nature.
Although it is not a better dollar or payment system yet, it is a better gold or store of value. One of its goals is to become a better payments system than fiat currencies because it can be used worldwide without the friction caused by the exchange process from different local currencies or the reliance on 3rd party banks.  
My own personal goal for Bitcoin is that it becomes the world reserve currency, reducing the power of nations and facilitating the creation a global identity. A global identity might help the human race attack global problems like global warming and the development of artificial intelligence. Bitcoin isn't the answer, but it is a welcomed step in the right direction.

Coinbase took years to implement SegWit. During that time they added BitcoinCash. The most simple explanation, even though this is only my conjecture, is they had financial incentives from Roger Ver and Co to do so. 
Scammy is not the right word. And you can’t say Coinbase hasn’t been extremely helpful in promoting Bitcoin by being the first easy on-ramp for newcomers. But then again you can’t also say they are true supporters of the cause. 
Last week it was made public that a lightning payment platform refused to take money from Roger Ver and Co to add Bitcoin Cash to their platform. They understand that although they are losing out on some profits, they would rather make the more ethical choice to not validate a scammy currency. 
And of course people are going to say Bitcoin Cash is not a scam. But it is. I’m all for other crypto currencies but until Roger Ver gives up r/btc and bitcoin.com and finds another slogan besides “the real bitcoin” we are going to have to call it what it is: a strategy to confuse uninformed consumers with their name while adding very little in the way of development and value. 
So when Coinbase intentionally promotes and thereby associated themselves with Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin for short term financial gain some will offhandedly call them a scammy company. 
I agree with you that in an ecosystem with legitimate scams and scam exchanges to accuse Coinbase of being a scam is an inappropriate and misleading accusation.

You are involved in a ponzie scheme to some extent: bitcoin only works if other people believe in it. Then again every monetary system is a ponzie scheme on that level.

Here is my solution for long term storage needs:
1) use SquareCash App to purchase Bitcoin
2) download a mobile wallet (Edge or Bread for iOS) and write down the 12 or 24 word seed phrase.
3) send Bitcoin from Square to wallet
4) delete wallet (and SquareApp)
5) rewrite your seed phrase intermingled with other candidate words in a pattern. 
For example: you could have a page of words and every other word makes the seed phrase. 
6) Tell one spouse, parent, relative, friend the pattern. Have another spouse, parent, relative, friend keep a copy of the coded seed phrase. And you keep a copy of the coded phrase yourself. 
If you have any questions, criticisms or suggestions please comment!

Pyramid scheme is the wrong word. So is Ponzi scheme and Confidence game since they all involve an intent to defraud someone. 
But your parents are right. Bitcoin doesn’t have any intrinsic value. They are wrong however because this also implies that they believe the value of gold comes from its intrinsic value. The demand for gold in electrical components is a very small fraction of its value. Gold’s value comes from its scarcity and the fact that someone else is willing to pay 1000/Oz for it. A pyramid scheme according to your parents. 
The US Dollar also doesn’t have any intrinsic value outside of maybe being accepted by the US government to pay tax obligations. But it’s difficult to describe its value in terms of a pyramid scheme since our entire frame of reference is based on the US Dollar. It’s like trying to describe to someone that if we consider the Earths rotation, the Earths orbit, and our galaxy’s movement we are moving at millions of miles per hour even as we sit still. But since everything around is also moving at that same speed from our frame of reference we are all sitting still. And since everything on the planet can be equated in terms of the US Dollar the worlds reserve currency it appears from our frame of reference that the US Dollar is not a pyramid scheme (according to your parents). 
But it wasn’t always like that. Used to be the British pound, and before that gold coins, sea shells, stones, tobacco leaves, glass beads, cattle etc. 
Sea shells were an effective pyramid scheme until one day it collapsed. The Venezuelan Bolivar was a successful pyramid scheme until one day it collapsed.
Pyramid scheme isn’t the right word anyway since there is no intent to defraud. Yuval Noah Harari uses the word “story” or “myth” instead. Billions of people around the world share the story of the Dollar. How many share the story of Bitcoin?
Edit: so to answer the question: there is no easy way. Lol.

The pattern doesn’t need to be complex. And it is an alternative way to split ownership or responsibility.

I used to use Bread. But they took forever to implement SegWit and whatever type of SegWit version they have now is not compatible with some exchanges. Gemini and Bittrex cannot send Bitcoin to Bread’s SegWit address. It’s SegWit address is not recognized. 
I’m recommending Edge now:
Edge - Crypto &amp; Bitcoin Wallet by Airbitz Inc 
SegWig adapted and AirBitz has always had a great reputation. Someone said they are anti lightning network. Can’t confirm. But whatever. Will move to another wallet then if they don’t develop. 
The biggest drawback is that Edge doesn’t let you import your own seed phrase. So if you have your backup phrase already written down in some safe area and don’t want to go through the hassle of rewriting then Breagwallwt with a legacy address would be my second choice.

Let’s say there are 100 units available. And 90 are being held and temporarily “out of circulation”. Someone sells 100% of circulating supply. In our currency scenario then you could have a price drop of 10%.

I haven’t read your response but I would mention, if you haven’t already:
- he’s right. Mass adoption in the US is not happening anytime soon. But in countries around the world with even less stable currencies adoption has a different timeline. 
- inflation isn’t just about promoting spending. Google “inflation tax”. It’s also a means of providing additional taxes for government hidden in ways from its population. Did he notice additional taxes he paid to bail out our financial institutions in 2009? Nope. The prices of goods just went up as the dollar supply was inflated. And 2% on average (2.5% this coming year) is significant. He should ask his parents the cost of a movie when they were younger. 
- he is right again. Volatility is an issue before it can be used as a currency. Right now it’s a hedge against the depreciating dollar. Like gold. 
I wouldn’t try too hard to convince him. All in good time.

And I don't agree that it's not ready for the mainstream. Coinbase is easy enough and its functionality as a store of value like gold2.0 is there.

Andreas Antonopoulus posted an insightful video on this recently. About Bitcoin adoption I believe. It’s been said before, but he has a wide and solid understanding of the space.
To summarize he suggested not wasting time trying to convince new people to adopt bitcoin. It’s a waste of time. And the payment network isn’t developed enough where it is better than Visa or PayPal. So why would someone living in Europe or China or USA start using it? 
The best way was to catch a few people who bought in on the boom/bust cycle. He’s been through this before. Price goes up. People get excited. Buy. Price goes down. They lose interest. Sell. And a few of those buyers stick around. And then next time a few more. 
He also pointed out that buying and hodling at this point is still very helpful. It stabilizes the price and reduces volatility which is necessarily. 
Onward and upward.

It can’t be confiscated or frozen by your government or financial institutions. So it won’t make you free. But if you don’t need to worry about your wealth being confiscated it will give you the option of a wider range of actions ie more free.

The book has definitely given me a lot to think about. The connection between sound money and prosperity seems almost too amazing to be true. But I haven't found any counter evidence except maybe that things aren't always as simple as they appear.
His criticism of Keynes comes across as far too vitriolic and personal to be taken credibly. He doesn't do himself any favors in his repeated vilification of him. I'm in Saifedean's camp, so I kept reading and enjoyed it. But I've picked up books where the author's viewpoint differed significantly from my own and stopped reading after 30 pages when they compromised their credibility with arguments against differing viewpoints that contained personal attacks and demonization.
Also he goes a little too far with his long vs short timeframe argument. At the end of chapter 5 he says artists with longer timeframes were superior and should spend years mastering their craft like Michelangelo. Why would anyone invest that type of effort into mastering realistic painting style that says very little to our zeitgeist? That's like spending 30 years mastering glass blowing. You might make a living at it, and earn Saifendean's respect, but you won't be saying much of anything to anyone.
I'm in his wheelhouse and enjoyed reading the book immensely, but the certainty with which he talks about art, which I'm pretty certain he knows very little about, and the manner in which he vilifies his opposition don't strengthen his arguments.

Ah. Everyone’s favorite point to make. Unfortunately the relative wealth invested in stocks from the middle class is minuscule compared to that from institutions and the upper class. 
I’m ok with people in power abusing their position to steal from others. It’s been going on since the beginning of time and there is no evidence to suggest that we wouldn’t be doing the same thing given the opportunity.
But don’t tell me the theft isn’t take place. It’s insulting and disingenuous. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:19:30
If you are in the US I believe your Bitcoin is insured up to $200k. So it should be safe to keep them there. There have been many cases of theft and fraud from exchanges in other countries.
I recommend Cash App for purchasing but there is an around 2% markup/down in price which constitutes their fee.

Lol. Ummmm. Nothing like the comic irony of signaling that you have low IQ by erroneously calling someone else low IQ.
No matter how much you made per hour, the point is if you stored your wealth in us currency it’s value has been debased over the years. 
You could have stored it in the oil. And you’d still have that much oil today. You could have stored it in copper. And you’d still have that much copper today. (Assuming your product didn’t corrode or decompose.)

It wasn’t meant to be a real world example but a theoretical example to illustrate a point. I’m still not convinced that’s not how it works. 
More extreme. 
If there is only one share representing the value of a company and you sell it the difference would be far more dramatic than of the company consisted of 1 million and the sale of one share.

It’s just hard to time these things. The next financial collapse has been discussed for the last 10 years, since very little or no reform has been implemented since the last crisis. That means that while we’ve been holding cash waiting for the sell off, stocks have been on a great run. Or fiat has had a dismal run. 
But I’m with you. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:46:19
I’ve been buying a little. It could definitely still go down. 
I’m putting the floor at $200. 
You don’t have to spend it necessarily to promote adoption. Buying and holding is helpful at this stage. When the lightning network is in place and it makes sense for vendors to accept lightning payments financially (not just morally) then I’d suggest participating.

We can all agree that sealing or destroying other people's property is wrong but I don't agree with you if you say that corporations are people. Legally they may be. But there are a lot of smart and educated people saying the Citizen's United ruling which granted corporations personhood is immoral and criminal.
And don't come in here and say if it's legal it has to be moral. Beating wives and owning slaves are two of the most obvious examples of acts that were at one time legal in the US but clearly immoral.
Watch the movie Robin Hood and get back at me!
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:10:42
Mmm. I think companies are always trying to maximize profits. It’s safe to assume that there hasn’t been any real profitability to accepting Bitcoin and that won’t change in a recession. 
That will change with with lightning and improved payment software. Bit that takes time and is independent of the economy. 
Real Estate and Car Agencies are accepting Bitcoin. Catering to the Bitcoin millionaires where it makes sense. 
I think more interesting will be if bitcoin will be seen as a safe haven and means to avoid the inflationary tax (which includes money printed for bailouts) or if it will be seen as a speculative asset that people give up on in order to make rent.

1) Be part of a global community. Important if we are ever going to address global warming and technological disruption. 
2) Invest money wisely. Either to make money or not lose money depending on your perspective. 
3) Opt out of the US Dollar. The 2008 Financial Crisis was an insult and has yet to be addressed. Bitcoin gives me an alternative for the first time. 
4) Be culturally relevant. 
Mmm. That’s all I have for now.

After Cryptokiddies froze the entire Ethereum network I’ve come to accept that other blockchain projects beyond Bitcoin as gold2.0 are still many years away. That’s fine. But couple that with a funding strategy that pays for new projects up front through selling pre mined tokens through ICOs and you have a project that is years in development which also poorly incentivized their developers beyond the short term. 
Some projects like ADA NEO and ETH (I’m sure there are others) are tied so closely to their frontman’s reputation that they seem more likely to stay motivated over the long term. 
There are also some other projects like ZCash that are continually funded by a tax on miners. These might also be a worthwhile investment.

It's a nice touch to see the chains from the pens connecting the different continents.  
On a more serious note FantasticEchidana4 you should reconsider your point of view. I'm not sure how to discuss morality but I'm pretty sure somewhere in the discussion is a weighing of the positives versus the negatives.

I’ve never had any issues with Gemini but then again have never had to use customer support. The support I’ve tried to use from Coinbase is very poor. And Bittrex took 4 months to reply, but at least they replied. So based on my limited experience I think the name of the game is avoiding support. 
I don’t think there is anywhere where you can buy with PayPal. At least a year ago there wasn’t. The process unfortunately is to move from PayPal to bank and then to exchange.

You’ve heard of traders discussing “Technical Analysis”? It’s a whole system established by traders to take advantage of and prosper on psychological tendencies of normal investors like ourselves. 
(And there are also traders taking advantage of traders taking advantage of normal people like ourselves.)
Studies have also shown that we are just bad at timing the markets.
Dollar cost averaging is a way to avoid all of these pitfalls and be more gentle with your own stress levels. 
Then again if you want to add a little gamble you can just buy in one lump sum and be done with it. 
I’m optimistic on Bitcoin long run 2-5 years. But what it does between now and then is anyone’s guess.

Settling gambling debts and overstocked.com. It’s not ready to be used as a payment solution yet. I used it at a restaurant once but it was more of a statement than a solution. The payment went directly to the owners wallet who wasn’t there and they had no way of verifying that I had paid since he wasn’t responding on his phone. 
Besides settling transactions with your friends, and maybe making a big purchase, holding seems to be the best use case at the moment.

BCH was never created to compete with Bitcoin on that level. It’s succeeded as intended: by using the Bitcoin name and brand to steal money from newcomers. 
Will lightning help Bitcoin compete against PayPal, credit cards, and your local currency for day to day transactions is the better question.
