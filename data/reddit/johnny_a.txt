You should talk to your synagoge president about how bitcoin is the most honest measurement of value that we know how to make. Discuss bitcoin with him in the context of these verses:
Leviticus 19:35-36 “Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length, weight or quantity. Use honest scales and honest weights, an honest ephah and an honest hin.”
Deuteronomy 25:13-15 “Do not have two differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light. Do not have two differing measures in your house—one large, one small. You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.”
Proverbs 11:1 “The LORD abhors dishonest scales, but accurate weights are his delight.”
Proverbs 16:11 “Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are of his making.”
Proverbs 20:10 “Differing weights and differing measures – the LORD detests them both.”
Proverbs 20:23 “The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him.”
Ezekiel 45:10-12 “You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah and an accurate bath. The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both. The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.”
Amos 8:4-7 “Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, saying, ‘When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?’—skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: ‘I will never forget anything they have done.’”
Micah 6:10-11 “Am I still to forget, O wicked house, your ill-gotten treasures and the short ephah, which is accursed? Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?”

Legitimate short selling works this way. 
Person A has 10 bitcoins and Person B wants to short bitcoins. Person B borrows 10 bitcoins from person A with a promise to repay those bitcoins plus interest over a fixed time period - like a month. Person B believes that bitcoin will drop against the dollar so sells the bitcoins for dollars. If bitcoin drops vs. the dollar, they purchase 10 bitcoins at the reduced price, repay the loan, and pocket the difference. If bitcoin rises against the dollar, then Person B is on the hook for the difference. If Person A is able to pool enough assets to do this on a large scale, then they are able to offer interest on bitcoin deposits by pursuing some variant of the 3-6-3 rule. (Pay 3% interest, charge 6% interest, golf at 3).

When advocating bitcoin to the clergy, you may want to point out the multiple biblical injunctions to use honest weights and measures in all business dealings. Fiat operates on a shifting (dishonest) scale, while one bitcoin is always one bitcoin. 
Leviticus 19:35-36 “Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length, weight or quantity. Use honest scales and honest weights, an honest ephah and an honest hin.”
Deuteronomy 25:13-15 “Do not have two differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light. Do not have two differing measures in your house—one large, one small. You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.”
Proverbs 11:1 “The LORD abhors dishonest scales, but accurate weights are his delight.”
Proverbs 16:11 “Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are of his making.”
Proverbs 20:10 “Differing weights and differing measures – the LORD detests them both.”
Proverbs 20:23 “The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him.”
Ezekiel 45:10-12 “You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah and an accurate bath. The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both. The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.”
Amos 8:4-7 “Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, saying, ‘When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?’—skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: ‘I will never forget anything they have done.’”
Micah 6:10-11 “Am I still to forget, O wicked house, your ill-gotten treasures and the short ephah, which is accursed? Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?”
