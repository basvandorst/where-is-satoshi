The reason ISIS is getting more coverage than some warlord in Sudan is they've made explicit threats towards the west, and are also killing off western journalists.

My standard of anything privacy or anonymity related is this:
If the cops or the government is against it, I'm for it.

Hold on, my cat threw a slumber party and didn't invite me?

I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:17:05
Because by telling you I make less money.

Good luck enforcing that
