That's why I switched to [Electrum]( it autoconnects to servers maintaining the blockchain so no need to download and scan the whole thing yourself.
I was using Armory because it had so many features, but Electrum has a very nice simple GUI and all the more advanced functions too. I love being able to see my balances and such as soon as I open my client.

No, coinbase requires very little info at first. You can send and receive BTC from your coinbase wallet

Also running Ubuntu. 
Was able to install and open to login screen.
I clicked on "New User?" in the bottom left, and Im getting an error with registration. Says I need to refresh the page
Is there somewhere on the web I can go to register?

Even on the webpage I am still getting "An error occured, please refresh the page"
