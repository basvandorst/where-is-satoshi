@_date: 2016-08-11 17:53:05
DONT USE COINBASE ( bitcoin nazis ). Why would you use them , don't you know this is stupid. And yes you money is probably fine , but the reason they are holding it is because they are investigating it , hoping to seize it. DUDE wake up!

MY position is that we all be friends 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:33:05

btc is not about centralization

PERIOD 
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:15:22
if it bounces back , yes .
otherwise it will just pass threw to the place you wanted it to go originally . bear in mind , it could be another 6+ hours
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:55:53
well hes stupid to say such a thing since its impossible , i mean really how does he plan on doing this , what a loser.

@_date: 2016-06-24 21:13:18
learn how to use BTC first, then start criticizing it.
BTC is not at fault because you don't know how to use it
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:46:32
quadrigacx By far is the BEST.
the only problem is .... really really long wait till you can get an account verified with them for security reasons . but once you do you'll be happy.
otherwise i can sell you some coin ( im in Toronto )
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:44:02
i wouldn't keep my coins with coinbase. no way 
the only thing that coinbase is good for ( and this is arguable since there service is the worst ) is buying btc
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:04:43
how do you want to pay?
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:40:30
btc is not wasteful , this article is.
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:21:27
yah and now coinbase , scheduled maintenance set for today 
@_date: 2016-06-15 04:50:00
Send them an e mail with this link , and post this exact same post on other sites . And again send them the link .
keep doing that until they start to notice that your Trolling is gonna give them a bad reputation in turn losing customers. maybe then they will actually start doing something to help you 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:38:40
fee is too low.
Rest assured your btc is safe.
have patience.
next time if you dont want this to happen and dont know how to pay fees properly . Just use a wallet like blockchain info and this will not occur
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:32:02
I agree ,The  Btc uncensored was a great show , even Chris De rose was  unsuccessful at winning an argument .
Its great to have these members in the community that expose the difference between the  reality of BTC and what is just plain out right Farce.
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:59:45
I disagree QuadrigaCX is awesome. obviously you don't have an account with them because your claims are are not true.
because if you did have an account with them you would clearly see you balance in CDN   
stop your trolling , who you working for GEMINI?
@_date: 2016-06-19 06:26:07
the problem was resolved . thanx for your help .
i was never on Tor ( just to let you know ) . the problem started on my phone actually. Once i tried to log in, the App re set and requested that i pair my phone , which i tried doing . Thats when i noticed the . onion on my pc browser. i then asked my son to enter into his wallet from his phone and the same thing happened.
anyways ... after reseting the router and my browser ...it was all good and no btc stolen
@_date: 2016-06-30 06:34:30

your a nobody! just another 15 year old rediter.
so STOP dissing the Important roll and contribution of  James D’Angelo.
Cuz you NOBODY
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:25:25
Peter Todd should come out more and integrate ( as he lately has been ) and play a stronger roll in the community.
His voice and opinions should be followed ... face it , the community lacks knowledge. Peter Todd is by far  one of the most knowledgeable in this space .
Sometimes its best to just shut up and listen to the experts. 
for the good , and for the future of BTC

good for you , dont EVER vistit
@_date: 2016-07-01 07:18:54
In my opinion any integration along with coinbase is simply  a bad move. They are left and right censoring btc users and now restricting withdraw amounts .
coinbase has become the central bank of btc. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:23:13
Satoshi Tango is really good
the only problem is the debit card they give you is in USD funds
@_date: 2016-07-25 05:03:27
The thing you guys have to realise about him is he gets paid to do his you tube show. Coinbase, the guys from JAXX wallet, and Bitgold. So the guy does nothing but spew shit in honour of his sponsors. So he's not that much of an idiot because he's making money.But he is an absolute idiot for the stupid comments and analogies he makes.
Im glad you posted this , people have to be warned about not falling into his pump and dump propaganda
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:42:15
long , i recommend you use a different platform.
Coinbase has now applied withdrawal limits ( losers ).
and they block you for stupid reasons . to me no difference between a bank
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:40:25
There DOING US ( CANADIANS ) A FAVOR .
Coinbase are the Nazis of BTC

Quadriga Cx is Great , no BS .

well look I'm just assuming he is getting paid because he does this non-stop promoting for Coinbase ( as if coinbase is even good ). Bit gold and the Jaxx wallet . Apart from the Jaxx wallet why would anyone promote these guys for free ???
Anyways the point is the guys a tard!
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:51:02

its not like im rippin the guy off if he sends me half the money that someone mistakenly sent to him.

look, guys, i hate to break it to you but , btc is a monetary / trust transaction ledger system. Its not an investment.
Use BTC for what it is . Don't look at it as some "get rich quick system".Take advantage of what it provides for you other wise you may become disappointed 
@_date: 2016-07-01 06:00:42

WHY Do the Coinbase Nazis have any say for this community anyway? They should be completely BARRED from this shreddit. Coin base has no Problems with BARRING CANADIANS, regular subscribers to their 1984 service And has no problem with rating their clients to the FBI .And there whining about an article that Theymos has supposedly censored!
(The BITCOIN NAZI probably just didn't know how to post the article).
This is a disgrace . we as a community should VOTE to keep in Theymos and as a community have ANY MEMBER OF COINBASE BARRED!
let's make the vote boys!
