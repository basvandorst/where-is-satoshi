I mean, it’s how I know how bitcoin is doing. It’s much healthier than standing over your portfolio all day.

Having trouble finding a specific article I had in mind, but [this article goes through some statistics of the average American.]( . The one I was looking for goes into more details, like having more than you owe puts you in something like the top 20%.

Halving means that half as many Bitcoins are awarded for mining. Traditionally there have been pretty significant upswings around halving because it’s about to get twice as hard to produce Bitcoin. 
It happens at pre-stated intervals based on the total Bitcoin created since it’s inception.

The obvious takeaway here is this baby controls the markets, and we should be making sure it stays happy and giggles for minutes on end.

This cartoon demonstrates exactly why Apple hasn't gone that route.
The lightning cable has been around for 4 years now, and unified the ecosystem while tablet manufacturers were still making their own proprietary system so they could efficiently charge tablets, which MicroUSB wasn't capable of doing. Hell, the Surface 3 still has it's own proprietary charger if you want to be able to charge quickly.
It's also the reason that you see the iPhone being used in SO many enterprise custom systems like in Science and Medical industries. The lightning connector was designed with ultimate flexibility in mind, something the analog cables weren't capable of doing on the fly. They saw the need for that flexibility and developed it while everyone else was bickering over what the standards would look like. 
It's why USB-C is basically based on Thunderbolt, which is in it's fourth year now.
How many people do you know that actively hook their phone up to their monitor or TV every single day? Or even once a month? I ponied up for the lightning to HDMI adapter so I have it, but I've honestly used it twice, and only because Airplay was acting funky. 
Does it suck shelling out for those adapter cables? Sure. Do the majority of consumers ACTUALLY need those cables? My guess is no. So why increase the manufacturing costs and fundamentally alter the design of the phone when it comes down to most people just don't need those features?

1. I had not heard of you
2. I think it's neat that it looks like it solves some of the trust issues with purchasing bitcoin quick and locally, though I'm not sure that it's great at marketing that - it's all very financial, where Bitcoin is also sort of a mix of tech.
3. Guess I partially answered this on 2, but wanted to add the browser detection waiting period is sort of annoying 
Good luck, thanks for dropping by! Might have to give it a shot sometime soon.

I didn’t know that fact off the top of my head, but just knowing the sheer size of those tracks figured it had to be up there. That answer was fresh from Google this AM. Makes sense when you think about it. The largest NFL stadium (which isn’t even a permanent location for the team) is the Colliseum in LA and holds 100,000. The largest permanent home to an NFL team is Met Life which holds 82,500. 
By comparison, the Indy 500 is the largest sporting arena in the world, holding nearly 500,000 people and has over 257,000 seating capacity. There are over 30 in the US, and over half hold more SEATED CAPACITY than any other sports stadium in the US. That doesn’t even begin to touch standing capacity and tailgating.

You don't think we saw a correction this past week?

It’s the number one spectator event in America, and make up 85% of the top 20 attended sports.
