Even just looking at it from a pure investor stand point, it breaking 10k is a massive deal. There is now more interest in it than ever. The volume being traded the past couple days is impressive in itself.

Nay sayers are to scared to ever make the attempt to be great. If you lose so what you lost. Pick yourself up and get back on the horse. Those people were too scared to show up to the race. Inevitably you'll always end up further than they did even if it's not with bitcoin.

I'd totally eat a couple bull testicles on video if someone threw me enough to finish my mining rig that can't be that bad can it ? Better yet i'd dip them in ghost pepper sauce first. Like I get it, it has a gross factor to it but how bad could it really be ?

Get a load of this normie! I bought at 300 sold at 257 like a real man. Then bought again at 10k thinking of buying a mining rig and relive those moments of watching command prompt talking to me.
