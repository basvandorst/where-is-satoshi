Carl probably wishes Shane was still alive .seems Rick grimes (his shitty dad)  is bad luck for the young lad , shot in face , shot body , had to kill his moms and has to wear that stupid hat. He’s probably glad his dad fomo like an idiot on bitcoin when it peaked .

Rick Fomo’d like a boss I hope he kept his btc in ledger cause once the grids back on he can start his own Mt.gox v2 exchange.

Don’t forget taxes too . Also the mining nodes in china wasting a shit ton of electricity to get that kfc order transaction into the blockchain ledger

That’s because of the hormones they put in the chicken and you probably want to check your cholesterol. Their blockchain could block your arteries

Watch your going to see is people are going to diversify. Throw some money in cryptos

The avg person doesnt have 500USD in their banking , let alone have a fraction of a bitcoin

60% dip on bitcoin is only 150 billion dollars. 20% dip on the Dow is trillions and companies start layoffs and we go into a deep recession.

You got me I live in my parents basement.  Actually I like stock I trade on fidelity, E*TRADE , usaa. 
I like to trade alts cause the swings are much better then  boring blue chips .

So if BTC transaction happens before the pizza gets to your house do you get a discount

What fanatics you talking about ?How many people lost trillions on wall street games with the help of our US government. Wall Street hating cryptos cause people are putting money in cryptos instead of fb or gm

Looking at the S&amp;P 500 PE it’s actually pretty good it’s only under 16 . Plenty of growth in the Fortune 500 companies it’s made my fidelity account look good . Can’t say anything good about my E*TRADE portfolio, its ugly.

Stock market tanking  as well, could see another 1000$ dump on the DOW
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:22
Gdax , lol can’t make shit on gdax with limited coins they have . 
Trade the alts on shitopia , shitbtc, and binnance bro. You can get some nice swing trades on those exchanges 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:03:49
Watch when the Dow goes back below 20k and s&amp;p gets back below 2000. That ruins lives . This btc correction hasn’t ruined anything. Just makes people buy more.  We’re talking trillions of markets cap gone 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:45:25
I guess I should of said 1000 point drop on the DOW
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:28:17
So how many jobs will be lost on the btc correction, none. Jobs will be lost in a stock market correction 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:35:34
Hmm Gm filed bk years ago leaving people who spent the entire life working for the company watch there gm stock evaporate. Bear sterns goes out business, Enron , world comm, lemhman brothers etc..... blue chips look good now cuase they outsourced most of their labor to slave factories they’re running lean. Wait until they can’t keep up with their earnings. They will just furlough more people and continue to outsource and play we’re too big to fail card

Ok nazi grammar dude, were you born in 84?I bought my 1st home in 95 when I was 21 . I know how company operates especially in the defense contracting world . I know what it’s like during sequestration times . I know the uncertainties if I’ll have a job tomorrow during cuts. 
I got into cryptos this 6 months ago cause I like the tech and I like the way it trades. Some alts I hold long term cause of their blockchain tech, others I trade shitcoins cause of their volatility . Easy profits. 
Hell I even got into mining just recently just to see if it works .

Eventually it will rise again . A lot of swing traders are playing on this bearish market. Every time it up ticks the trader sells and buys again on the dips . New money will becoming soon once Coinbase , bitstamp , other exchanges can get the infrastructure up to speed. Robinhood could be a game changer. If Robinhood becomes a success, expect to see E*TRADE and others to get into the action
