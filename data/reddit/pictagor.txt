Haha nice. I would love if more people make more crypto-themed games, be it platformer, match-3, puzzle or even RPG. There are definitely more fun ideas than I have time to make.

Haha those are supposed to be bugs though. In my game, crypto defenders will fight against various blockchain threats like bugs and hacks.

That's awesome! I have yet to start integrating SFX into the game so it's great to see music/sound effect makes the scene more alive! Let's connect as I'm interested in some OST in the future.

I'll think about balancing shooting speed against each crypto's actual transaction time : )

Thank you! Much appreciated. Hope you find this interesting.

Made this animation for an indie game I'm working on, "Crypto Against All Odds". It's like Plants vs Zombies but with crypto defenders fighting against FUD (bugs, hack, 51% attack, ransomware, etc.). If anyone is interested, you can follow me on Twitter [ for more updates.

Thanks for the explanation about the details of how that works! I’ll keep that in mind as I keep tweaking the game!

Wow. Didn’t expect this. Thank you!

Well I don't disagree since I only put together the scene in about 10 minutes using assets from a game I'm currently developing called [Crypto Against All Odds]( It wasn't mean to show off skills or anything. More of a quick fun gif since I was excited about the recent BTC pump.

Thanks! I think I’m following you as well. Will check out more of your work.
