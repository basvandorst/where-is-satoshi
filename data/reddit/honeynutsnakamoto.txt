Yes, they are still what I recommend to anyone new to the market. Even using GDAX can be difficult to a newcomer and GDAX  is soooo user friendly compared to any other crypto exchange I have used.

Using any service such as Coinbase is not decentralized in the first place. Gemini,Bittrex, Binance, Poloniex ...  the list goes on...are all centralized. They are your bank. Like the ones you already use for your fiat. No difference. They're FDIC insured too, like your fiat bank. They hold your money for you until you want to use it. They hold it and make money off of it. They shut down your account if they don't like the transaction you made. Sound familiar?

I'd love to switch to something else from Coinbase/GDAX but the free sends out of GDAX keep me there. I really don't hate Bcash as a crypto but to offer full support for it and not support Segwit for BTC is most certainly NOT what many of their customers wanted. They know that. They can spin it any way they want. It's just squeezing people out of BTC by overcharging them on fees. Not cool Coinbase, not cool.

Bitcoin Cash is a good SHORT TERM solution. I'm a long term holder, not a trader. Doesn't make sense as a long position. like Monero better as a long. Totally my opinion ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:43:55
There is no difference between selling and exchanging. You are trading one thing for another thing and the two values are relative to each other. We say we are "selling" something when we trade it for money and we say we are "exchanging" something when we use goods, commodities or trade stocks/currencies. If I "sell" my Bitcoin for USD I am exchanging it for fiat currency because, for whatever my reasons are, I would rather hold the USD. If I'm buying a loaf of bread with my USD I'm exchanging the fiat for bread because, again - whatever my reasons are, I would rather hold the loaf of bread. So why bother using money? So we don't have to carry loads of shit everywhere we go to make exchanges with people. Your ideas of "sell" and "exchange" are formed by the system you are accustomed to which is likely a first world nation with a stable and generally safe monetary system. Think outside of your system and you'll suddenly find yourself feeling less like a cog in a machine! :)

You expect the "we want it now" crowd to remember something that happened almost 6 weeks ago? Maybe go to the stock market for that. Most crypto investors can't remember what happened two days ago.

And by your logic we would also say that gold and silver are not money because they are generally used as investments and not as an exchange (your words) for goods and services. Does that make sense to you? Sounds like double talk to me.

I don't think Bcash itself is a bad coin. It's technically sound. The problem is it's strongly associated and influenced by some very powerful but also very bad people within the crypto space. For example, the fact that Bitcoin.com exists as a site to try to trick newbs into buying Bcash when they're looking to buy Bitcoin, that's shitty, no two ways about it. I'd exit the crypto world before buying into something like that.

For the record I think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are possibly the most revolutionary invention of my lifetime. (second to the internet maybe?) They will revolutionize personal banking and investing. I'm very pro crypto. I just think people are expecting them to be something they can't be right now. An investment and a currency at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:10:53
I agree with you that people aren't spending their Bitcoin on goods and services but it's still money. They're not spending it because it's value is volatile not because it isn't money. That's the real reason that no cryptocurrency in their current form will replace fiat anytime soon. No one wants to spend money that is constantly fluctuating in price. It's not a problem that is unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:08
I realize that you're using the terms money and currency synonymously. They aren't the same thing all the time. One USD is a form of money and is also currency. One ounce of gold is money pretty much anywhere in the world but it's probably not currency. Gold is definitely not currency down at the corner store but it's still money. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:00:35
We could talk about paper gains vs actual gains in that sense but money generally means how much wealth someone has. It can also refer to currency.

That was the point of the article. You can't really compare BTC with companies based on market cap because BTC is not a company and holds no assetts.

I've been able to send to my Ledger Segwit wallet out of GDAX since I got my Ledger in October. Don't know if that is the same as any other Segwit address. I tried to send LTC from Coinbase to a Segwit address and that wasn't supported but the BTC withdrawal to Segwit has always worked for me.

Does Gemini use Segwit? I'll definitely sign up if they do. I thought it was still in the works. I send out of GDAX so it's zero fees that way. I can send to Segwit addresses from GDAX as well. That's what keeps me at Coinbase. If that changes I'll move my business elsewhere. I don't hate them but I also have zero loyalty to them. Just looking for good UI/cheap fees and trustworthiness.

Black Markets economies are usually very inefficient because the consumers options are limited and there is little to no competition. Markups on products are exorbitant as well. It's the cost of doing dirty business. It's not fair to blame that on BTC.

Interesting. I'll be paying attention to that. Millennials are the largest portion of the population nowadays, edging out the boomers a couple of yrs ago. I keep reading how they are the most fiscally responsible generation due to coming of age during the great recession of '08. The great depression generation was previously the most financially responsible but the majority of them are dead now. I personally think the baby boomers are the least financially responsible generation because they never had to be. They lived most of their lives in the golden age of the U.S. economy. I have hope that millennials will turn this ship around. Statistically they save far more for retirement than the preceding generations. Most people believe the opposite is true but that's not what the data shows. I'm a Gen X'er and I'm often surprised at the terrible financial decisions my generation makes! Gen X and Baby Boomers are the worst money managing generations alive today.

The WSJ  did a comparison of market cap vs assets controlled by particular companies. Bitcoin has a huge market cap but has $0 in assets or holdings. Interesting metric. Not very meaningful in the world of cryptos but interesting nonetheless.

I view greed to be a negative thing. I also think it's very easy to call a person greedy because they are interested in making money. I desire money because of the independence it gives me. I value my independence/freedom above many other things. I realized long ago that without  your own money, or someone else's money to fund your pursuits, obtaining independence is very difficult. There's a theory in psychology called Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It attempts to describe and organize people's motivations. It basically says that you can't achieve certain things in life without obtaining others first. For example, you may not be able to ever be in a fulfilling relationship if your basic needs aren't met-like hunger, thirst,safety,shelter. When I was poor I rarely concerned myself with anything beyond my basic needs. I couldn't. Life was a constant struggle. Finding enough money for gas/food/utilities meant sacrificing everything else. Making more money brought me out of a constant quest for survival and has allowed me to enjoy other parts of life that I used to think I would never get to experience.

Yes, gladly. Understanding this stuff changed how I approach investing and how I view the world economies. There's a great article called When Bitcoin Grows up: What is money? By John Lanchester. Just Google search it. It's from the London review of Books and you can read it for free. Probably the single best thing I've read regarding money. There's lots of stuff out there but start with that. It's really long but enjoyable and kind of mind-blowing.

I'd like to think that as well but realistically I'm sure there will be cash outs in both BTC and bCH. People are going to be receiving some huge profits even if they do only receive %25 of their holdings. 
All in all it will be another obstacle to price increase but not an insurmountable one.

You held through a 3 year bear market, all the while not knowing if Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency would ever be widely used or popular? A 3 year time period in which it seemed cryptos could disappear into obscurity any day and these scaling issues bother you? In the biggest bull market crypto or any living person has ever seen? You've come through all that and now you're ready to jump ship? If that's how you feel I respect that but it's sure hard to believe.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:38:13
I can understand where you're coming from and unlike others in this sub I do respect your opinion. This is my view, when it comes to being usable as a currency, price = utility. I have never looked at any crypto as a usable currency (I know, sacrilege). People don't spend and don't want to spend appreciating assetts. Especially rapidly appreciating ones. If you thought, in a month, your USD would be worth 5x what it is today you would never spend it, right? Unless that was your only option. The only way any crypto has a chance at mass adoption, as a currency, is if its value is stable. Either the value must be set, like tether, or the value must become so large(high liquidity like the USD) that trading doesn't move the price very much one way or the other. People trade in the multibillions on Fiat every day and we see very little change in value in these markets, percentage wise, compared to cryptos.
Edit: Let me ask you this. Are you buying Bitcoin Cash because you want to use it as a currency and you like the low fees and fast confirmations? Or are you buying it to hold because you think the low fees and fast confirmation times will make it more popular, causing to increase in value and overtake BTC in market share?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:52:14
I think that's great! Never stop the hustle. I understand that. Personally I enjoy the quest for money more than I actually enjoy obtaining it. It always makes me feel that I have a purpose. It sounds silly but everytime I pay my mortgage I think, that's one more month we can live in our house. Nothing makes me feel better than knowing I did it myself. I made my way in this world  by starting out with very little. I can't tell you how many nights I went to bed tired but couldn't sleep because I was so hungry. I don't want to live that way again and I know I don't have to because I have the power to change that. It's easy to look at someone like you or I and call us greedy. Say all we care about is price, etc..  It's not what it's about, not to me. It's about freedom and THAT is what I see in cryptocurrencies. Also why I love BTC vs BCH. BTC is freedom, BCH is greed and deception built off of the backs of others.

I really agree with you. Not trying to shill but that's why I have begun to appreciate Monero. It feels like what BTC used to be. Like it picked up where BTC left off once it became incredibly popular. Being involved with Monero feels like being in crypto in 2014 again. I don't know what will happen with the market but at least I feel like I'm part of something that's changing the game. You know, how it used to be.
Edit: I still hold more BTC than any other crypto(I'm not a fool,lol). All it takes is one solid technological upgrade and BTC will blast off again. Remember before Segwit? Everyone was saying the same things. Then the NYA happened and holy shit- suddenly BTC was brand new again! It's a very fickle market and I'm pretty convinced that most people investing in it have SERIOUS short memory deficits.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:44:57
That's what money means to you. Not a bad definition but what your actually describing is currency. Money can be anything that is valuable/holds value or gives wealth. For example: Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world because Amazons stock gained a lot of value in fiscal quarter 3. His wealth is greater than &gt; 90 billion USD. Now he can't walk down to McDs and buy some nuggets with that stock but that doesn't mean we say Jeff Bezos has no money! In fact we say he has more money than any other living person on this Earth.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:03:14
That's a damn good question that I don't know the answer to.  Lol. I think some want a currency and some want a store of value but I think the people who want a form of currency still want it to quickly appreciate in value which would make it useless as a currency.

The Bitcoin market has been behaving as a risk-on asset so you would expect it to crash if stock markets crash. 
It's never existed during a US market crash so I'm just guessing and I'm very interested to see how it behaves. It's a pretty flexible asset so I think it could initially crash as markets crash and investors want to exit to cash then at some point become a hedge asset like gold as markets continue to drop.

Hedge funds are not legally allowed to hold their own assets once the value of their fund exceeds X amount of USD(Don't remember exact amount). 
They are required by law to use a 3rd party custodian. So yeah, no keys no coin etc.. but this has nothing to do with retail investors. So the chill the ef out people. This is a good thing for growth of the crypto space especially if you want to see Bitcoin become a mainstream asset class.

Trading on any confidential information is insider trading, in a regulated market, which cryptos are not. And Bloomberg terminal is not confidential information. I *think* that's what people are trying to say happened here, which it didn't. 
You're right there are a lot of crazy accusations of market manipulation on Reddit. On the other hand I've most definitely seen what could be considered spoofing on every exchange I've ever used and I'm sure there is more than that going on.

I frequently buy things online with BTC. It's my preferred method of buying precious metals. It's faster and cheaper than paying with credit card or money order. 
I've never been able to buy anything with precious metals. I've tried. I can sell them for penny weight or trade them at a dealer. 
Another problem with metals is they are not divisible. Sure you can spend an American Silver Eagle at the grocery store. It's legal tender and it's worth exactly 1 dollar. The 1 oz of .999 Ag its made of is worth about 17x more than. 
I can only speak from my real world experience. Who told you no one accepts BTC? That's just not true.

I would say that's an accurate description of Bitcoin.

I would bring them some clothes, receive BCH and convert it to BTC. Scammers get scammed. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:43:59
It's a basic strategy. If I hold a large amount of BTC, for example, this is how it's done. 
If market price of BTC is 8,OOO USD I decide I'll put up a huge limit order to sell BTC below the majority of sell orders on the book, say 7500 USD. So I put in a limit order to sell 200 BTC at 7500 USD. You see this on the books and think "Geez, my 0.1 BTC sell order at 8.1k will never get filled. This 200 BTC order at 7.5k will have to fill first" 
So you and hundreds or thousands of other people start to undercut my order. You change your order to sell at 7.49k and then someone undercuts your order and so on and so forth until market price is low enough that I cancel my huge sell order and buy up all the orders below me. Not only did I force you to sell at a lower price but I pushed the market price back up to 8k by buying up all of your small orders at market price. 
Do you understand that? I don't mind explaining this stuff to you but don't accuse of me of not knowing how markets work. I'm just trying to have a real discussion. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:20:37
Yes, I agree. And I do think Bitcoin is a good store of value. I can't currently agree that it is a *better* store of value than gold at this point in time. 
I do think it will be better eventually and I think BTC is taking plenty of  market share from gold.  
I can't ignore the fact that gold has proven itself to be a great store of value over the course of thousands of years despite me preferring BTC over gold. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:08:33

I don't hate the wealthy or the poor. Everyone makes their own decisions.

I disagree. Volatility, up or down, is still a bad store of value. If you hold BTC as %10 of your portfolio and BTC price skyrockets and becomes %90 of your portfolio you need to reallocate your asset distribution because you suddenly have way too much exposure to BTC. It really skews your risk. 
Being a good investment and a good store of value aren't necessarily the same thing. 
A good store of value needs to have a stable price.

I don't think wanting to make money = greed. There is this cognitive bias that always occurs. If you're too money focused you're greedy. The reality is having no money means your life will be much more difficult. My friend always used to say " I never worry about money, until I don't have any." I love the technology involving cryptos. I think it's revolutionary. I also love the unique investment opportunity they provide. If the prices drop to nothing then I'll still love the technology aspect.  I lived very poor for many years before I finally "made it". You know how I got there? By trying to make more money. I even went to college, got a degree, got a job. Do you know why? So I could make more $. Now I  own a house and support my family. Guess I'm a greedy bastard.��

Yeah sure but the arbitrage is catching the difference when it exists. The GDAX/Gemini arbitrage was a money maker for 2017 especially if you were trading any kind of volume.

I wouldn't make a long term argument. It might be but you're talking thousands of years vs. 10 years.

I believe you're defining store of value as what will increase in value in the future. I call that an investment.

Amen to that!(short memory) I think BCH is a solid crypto for sure but it will never see my money. I don't like the toxicity I see in some of the main players in the BCH camp AND I don't think it's that revolutionary. Does anyone remember the last two BCH pumps? If you're getting out of BTC and into BCH to hedge against BTC that's stupid- to put it bluntly. It makes no sense. BTC and BCH price basically have an inverse relationship. One goes up the other goes down. You'd be much better off to sell BTC for cash then buy back in on a dip. Buy BCH because you believe it will succeed but don't do it simply as a hedge against BTC. They are very tightly correlated, inversely proportional assets.

Sorry that bothers you but cryptocurrency is freedom of money, censorship resistance and if that means someone wants to invest with it then so be it.
It really bothers me that people think cryptocurrencies are a financial revolution but only expect people to use them in a particular way that *they* deem suitable. 
Are you telling me how to use my money? Because if you are you've already gone astray.
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:18:20
Very good point. I should say as long as BTC has value it has utility, even if that value is fractions of a cent. As you pointed out if it's value is $0 it doesn't have utility. 
While it is most certainly possible its price could drop to $0 I don't *think* it will and I only say that because extreme scenarios are rarely the reality in investing or anywhere else in life, but you're not wrong.

A serious reply to your question is: I don't think we've seen the end of short contracts effect on BTC price. 
IF we are to believe that large institutions are buying into this space THEN I'm quite certain that they have not fully scaled into their positions yet which reinforces my sentiment on short contracts. Thinking we'll see BTC below 6k but not below 5k.

If you follow the rule "only invest what you can afford to lose" you'll be fine. Take this rule seriously, it's the most important one. 
No one knows what the future holds so your guess is as good as anyone else's. Don't take peoples advice on what to buy as they are likely making recommendations based on their own personal agenda. If you find something that interests you, do some research on it 
If you were to invest in only one,  Bitcoin is the one you want. This is only my opinion so you should probably do some research on that.

If you're goal is to exit USD then there is nothing wrong with hodling forever. 
If your goal, as an investor, is to profit then it's a really good idea to periodically take some profits because you don't know what the future holds. This is true for any market, especially a very volatile market like cryptocurrencies.
You can always reinvest your profits if you so choose. I'm just here trying to give people good advice despite the fact that I'll be downvoted for saying these things.

It's likely that the most revolutionary uses of cryptocurrencies haven't been discovered yet."

Bitcoin is still an investment. The fact that it does not return dividends makes it a speculative investment.

I'm sure some will disagree but gold has no more intrinsic value than Bitcoin. I don't consider making jewelry to be intrinsic value. That is something that is desirable but not useful. As far as industrial uses there are better metals than gold available. Gold *and* Bitcoins intrinsic value are as a medium of exchange and store of value. I would argue that BTC is a far better medium of exchange and better store of value in some aspects such as portability and storage. Gold is less volatile and has more trust because it has been used as a medium of exchange and store of value for thousands of years.

Ethereum I have mixed feelings about. Not a big fan of the hard fork to get out of problems thing. ETH is really awesome in other ways. It's great to use as a currency.

Yes, you are right. It's a combination of factors that add up to market dominance. Of course Bitcoin is technically obsolete to many altcoins. It doesn't matter in the least until the entire crypto market stops moving with the price of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:49:50
Bitcoin is totally reliant on intersection with fiat and traditional banking in the first world. If you're fiat is nearly worthless and you don't have a bank that's not relevant to you. You forget about mining which is how BTC is obtained in 3rd world countries. Yes M-Pesa kicks ass. M-Pesa(for those who don't know) is a P2P mobile payment system that is hugely popular in Africa. M-Pesa is proof that cash based(unbanked) economies have a HUGE need for P2P digital payment systems (India for example). So let's say you live in a cash based economy where your fiat is worthless. What good is M-Pesa to you then? If only there were a globally recognized currency that could be paired with a widely used app such as M-Pesa. 
I've got nothing against using Western-Union, as long as they are the cheapest and fastest. Why do you think their money transfer rates have become so darn affordable recently? How long do you think they can keep that up? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:57:59
I would like your insight into the credit card side of cryptos. I believe one of the reasons prices have been down is the quick stop to CC buying of cryptos that recently occurred. I think a fair amount of the upward price pressure in December was caused by credit card purchases (amongst other factors). What's your opinion? Any other insight you have regarding CC/cryptos would be greatly appreciated.

I DO believe BTC has inherent problems but I also believe Rome wasn't built in a day. I totally agree that things that rise %1000 in a year are not suitable as currencies. I try to tell people this all the time. I don't think a single crypto that exists is suitable as a currency in a developed economy. No one wants to spend something that might 10x in a few months, unless that's your only option. Like if you live in Zimbabwe. That's a great example by the way. So what would you use as a currency if you lived in Zimbabwe? Serious question, please answer. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:13:13
Why do you think people only want fiat? You only want fiat if you can trust that your fiat will retain it's value. Do you think people in Mozambique villages don't have mobile phones or access to sites like LocalBitcoins?  According to the interwebs about %63 of the world's population has a mobile phone while %20 of the world population remains unbanked. These stats are exactly why M-Pesa is so successful. It's not very hard for me to imagine that same tech making use of crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:42:13
I never said it was a currency. It's a speculative asset just like gold. Little intrinsic value, no price floor. If you're whole aim is to convince me BTC is not a currency don't waste your time. I already agree. I think you're just having trouble wrapping your mind around the concept of what money is. Currencies should be stable to function properly. Money supply needs to be flexible in times of crisis or prosper. Are you just trying to argue that BTC is not usable or cryptos in general are not usable as currencies?

Cryptocurrencies could be used as a stop gap for people who have access to them. That's all I'm saying. Not just BTC. Any of them.  That's a possible temporary solution. Please don't describe the problem for the 10th time in a row as a response. I can read.

I think we do agree but just because BTC doesn't fit the definition of a currency doesn't mean it can't be used in similar ways. I think of BTC/cryptos as a hybrid type of product. They have strengths and weaknesses compared to traditional means of exchange. Instead of trying to argue with you I'd like to know what you think the utility of cryptocurrencies are? Do you believe that they only function as a speculative asset?

I plan on buying more if BTC goes sub 2k. Other than that I'm going to hold what I've got left and try to build my position in MJ stocks. 
Edit: To clarify I hold a small amount of BTC that I actually use to buy things online with. A spend and replace kind of thing. I'm not necessarily convinced it will drop below 2k but I also have no interest in it as an investment above the 2k price in this market. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:18:23

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:11:12
The one that retained the name Ethereum. This is kind of a trick question though. The decision to hard fork after the DAO hack was made by a small group of people. A centralized decision certainly. That's the direction ETH chose to go and I don't invest in ETH anymore because of that, however, trying to say Ethereum classic is the true ETH is just confusing to newcomers and I also think ETC is more centralized and has much less going for it than ETH does. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:03:40
This is total BS that they block this, on the other hand, in many cases it's probably not the wisest move to go into credit card debt to buy crypto if you're paying %16 interest on average.

If Ver was a good man, a man with integrity, he would have let Bitcoin Cash develop on its own merit. Instead he constantly tries to promote BCH by trying to "kill" Bitcoin and belittling its community and developers. 
I would have already invested in BCH if not for him. Instead I'll never touch it because of his actions. Not a project I want to be part of and it has nothing to with block size or decentralization or fees.

Oh sure, but that's insanely risky. If you're on the wrong side of one of those that could financially ruin you. Not worth the risk in my opinion. I'm a conservative crypto investor which I realize is an oxymoron.

Absolutely and I don't think it was a scam either. They were using their credit card legally in a manner consistent with their card agreements. I think their are two sides to every story. It's a shit move for financial freedom and I would vote against it if I was allowed to but it will also save a lot of people from making a bad financial decision. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:53:36
You're agreeing with what I'm saying mostly. I don't think it's fair to compare the ETH/ETC situation to the BCash situation. BCH is outright trying to scam people. I think it was good what ETH did because it restored millions of dollars to investors. It was bad because it just sends out the message that your code doesn't have to be that strong, if it's buggy we'll just hard fork. Nothing "wrong" with that but I don't put my money into ETH because, historically speaking, it has been buggy and people have lost millions of dollars more than once. Yes I realize it was the dapps that were buggy but that's what ETH is all about. A decentralized PLATFORM to build dapps on top of.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:52:01
Also I think it goes against the ideology of crypto and financial freedom. Aren't you supposed to be getting away from the banking system? Not going deeper in debt to it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:18:01
Without Bitcoin, cryptocurrency also has no security. Everyones trust in this great blockchain technology is subconsciously based on the fact that the BTC blockchain has never been hacked. Would blockchain really be so revolutionary if it couldn't be trusted? Of course not.

I don't think crypto will get rid of banks or replace the fiat system. I definitely think they will force banks to operate more efficiently and offer more competitive products to consumers and investors. It's much needed competition to wake up the brick and mortar banking industry. That's just the US. Countries with less stable banks and economies will see greater benefits.

Sure, it is, but so are 100's of others which don't have such a contentious history and team behind them.
