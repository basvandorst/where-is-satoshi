How can it be classed as a scam when it's still an active site that pays out, as long as you have followed their rules and are patient for withdrawal?  
No, of course I wouldn't stand by the statement if proven wrong, but neither you or I can confirm either way - so currently, it is not a scam.

Care to be exact as to what claims were dishonest so we can discuss them?

Please tell me the reason the US Govn. confiscated from Mtgox? This should be interesting...

Where did I say that? 
But, sure... Anyone can make money if you know what you're doing.

Great find, thanks - I'm going to add that to post. 
So, maybe just withdraw under 3 BTC each time. Fun times ahead.

Thanks for trying to school me but you have no idea of my background on this subject matter, I am fully aware of all situations.
I haven't once advised anyone to store money in MTGox, nor have I said it'll be safe to use them - of course we all know it could go missing tomorrow, that's your choice - just like your wallet could if you're not cold storing.
Simply put - I'm annoyed at seeing all these newbies posting about how funds are stuck in MTGOX, because quite simply they haven't followed rules at some point in time, or they haven't researched from other people's posts...

It says on every page about verification. I didn't trade before I was verified. I.see your point but that's user error in my eyes.




Updated the post, thanks.

I was under the impression coinbase was for people "over the pond" only. I'm going to look in to trading there.

Well, Joe Bitcoin has a perfectly easy operation here. People fund a 'website' which is nutorious for bad public press, the website runs itself in terms of each trade relfects price and any withdrawal is automatic (albeit queued). 
The only involvement I can see, other than back end web administration, is support queries. I may be very wrong here so please do correct me.

Do you have a bad story to share?
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:48:10
Sorry, didn't see the /s. 
You can make thousands. Send your coins to me for tripple return.

As already noted, it's advised not to.  Mtgox tend to hold Fiat currencies for many weeks/months/forever due to their banks allowing only x transfers a day.  You'll also need verification which can take ~20 days and 2 forms of ID.  Don't be fooled by greed, if you must insist on mtgox, get verified and dump a small amount of btc In your account, make some trades for profit and then send btc to a wallet to test withdrawal. Do not use Fiat in there.

What a ridiciolous statement.  What was the point of this post?
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:36:09
Your claim is based on...? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:09:34
This is the kind of post I was hoping for. I too have had no issues (famous last words).
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:18:45
JUST SENT YOU 100,000 BTC TO TEST BUT DIDNT WIN OH WELL HERE I GOT TO BYE

Although good news, it's only for the courses involving digital currencies.  I wonder how many people will study these.
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:22:02
I think once you've started the process it is simply a waiting game. I doubt, from what I've read, that Support can assist you too much as it's "in the system". 
Did you pay any fee (additional) to MTGox for a larger withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:12:54
Well, as with anything you put money in to you should research the company. If you'd done your research you would have no doubt discovered ~20 days verification. 
I think the problem is people jump in to a quite advanced situation, without thinking of the possible worst case scenario outcome.

Agreed, but that won't happen because many businesses worldwide rely on idiotic public members who fail to read/understand small print. Unfortunately MTgox is no different, there's profit to be made from low IQ. 
I can't recall exactly as I'm verfied, but I'm sure every single page I clicked on - even to deposit BTC, it showed a yellow block of text re: verify?
@_date: 2014-01-27 13:49:35
Withdraw small ammounts of BTC from MTGox and sell on localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:02:28
Awesome, did not know of this option. Is this proven and for all countries?  Any note on the increased processing time?   It doesn't add up with their claims of "X fiat allowed by banks per day", unless of course 5% will manually change their release queue...

No airing time? I don't want to watch BBC nonesense for X time.

How do you link your bank account, it says US only?
