The channels are time locked, they will close periodically and have to be refreshed to stay up. So if you both aren't rebroadcasting to keep it up it will close. Plus shit crashes all the time and needs a reboot.

Sure, I realize other currencies are like that. My preference though is having small purchaces being closer to a few whole number units. I think it makes more sense by dropping off trailing zeros for better "at a glance" price differentiating.

I think Andreas Antonopoulos has the right idea where the everyday unit to use would be where normal small purchases like a coffee would fall somewhere in the 1-100 of the unit range. No one wants to deal with fractional math (BTC) or really large numbers either (Satoshis)

No you're still wrong. ETFs are an asset mix of stocks or bonds or tracking an index which is a mix of stocks. It's value is based on the underlying assets, not a currency. Why anyone is listening to your "advice" is beyond me
