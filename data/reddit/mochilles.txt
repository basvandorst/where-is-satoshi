You think there is a finite supply of weak hands?

Are you new here? Bad news makes the price go down, good news makes the price go down a little slower.

To eliminate central points of failure or compromise.


Evidently you overlooked the part where I wrote "People pay a small network fee which goes to the securers of the network, whichever proof or algorithm that might be."

You realize this isn't inevitable, right?

Against profits? No, not a thing. Who do you think runs the country?

Don't worry. In a few years Apple will tell you what you need.

How is it easier and nicer? It couldn't really get much more nice and easy than with credit cards.

Bitcoin is an asset the government doesn't want, isn't interested in, and wants to get rid of as quickly and efficiently as possible, hence the auction. The US government provides no end-consumer FOREX services and they certainly won't start with Bitcoin.

The okaying isn't quite as catchy as the goxxing.

What would anyone buy bitcoin *for*?

There are approximately twelve homeless people in Denmark. And even they have iPads.

There is no such adjective as "world wide" it's "worldwide". A World Wide Ledger would be a Wide Ledger for the world, which makes no sense. If anything it's Worldwide Ledger. 
The phrase "world wide web" was a deliberate error to force it into the catchy acronym www.

Shorter alphabetical-only names cost significantly higher network fees to register. Consequently most people will only be able to afford something like "Mochilles24601" thus removing a large element of this problem. Additional address domains can qualify the type of receiver. For example, "u.Mochilles24601" would be cheap and denote a private user, whereas "c.Barclays" may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and represent a company. Fee structures are hardcoded into a future release and fully decentralized. Further, a type of temporarily centralized sunrise period where companies can register their trademarks on a new sidechain core release from the bitcoin foundation prevents widespread abuse at inception, before being adopted by miners.

You make an important secondary point, which is that there's no *inevitable* reason why Bitcoin will *necessarily* succeed at anything at all. It could be that the entire architecture is too archaic compared to more modern implementations to achieve anything robust for business. People talk about Bitcoin as if it's a foregone conclusion of not *if* but *when*, when the reality of the situation is very far from that.

It's a scam scam. The kind of scam that won't even let itself scam you, because the scam itself is in fact a scam. Scamception, if you will. There are multiple levels, but you wouldn't be able to pronounce them.

Definitely buy an asset that's been in a constant downtrend for 14 months.
