i think the point is here, this will be the main use of BC in the next few years
"if you’re in some place where you have no real, good asset value store and you’re uncertain about the banks, you’re uncertain about the government currency, then Bitcoin can provide a useful asset store for you."
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:18:14
what is that "free 20k satoshi" link?
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:13:28
Of course :) they will probably give you a 100 back if you agree :)

thank you, very generous

like a said in another reply, this is easily avoided just making more receipts.
you have a customer that want to make 1200 euros purchase in cash? You make two 600 euros receipts
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:56:37
Italy did the same to avoid tax evasion, i think they limited the amount you can pay in cash to Eur 1000 per receipt.
So what do you think merchants do if they have a customer that wants to make a 1200 euros purchase in cash?
That's right, they make two 600 euros receipts :)
Edit: corrected amounts
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:24:31
very nice thanks

not a fan of him, but if it was Justin Beaber instead of Mike Tyson, this would have been huge.
Can you think about all the teenagers following him, suddenly talking to their parents because they want some Bitcoin?

He said only on Jiahn's fork.
If the fork does not happens, he does not have to do it 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:16:17
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:27:20
that's an interesting service, does anybody used it? how it is?
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:04:05
Where are you from? In Italy there is no mandatory health insurance
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:18:24
of course if you ask Abramovich he will tell you the same :)
i just wanted to state that in italy and a lot of other european states $25K/year is overall not a bad salary. I have a lot of friends that make less and have a house, family etc.
EUR 25K in europe is way more than $25K in the US
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:05:22
thanks a lot! very generous
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:08:46
you need to realize that 25K in europe is a good salary: those are net numbers (taxes already paid) and healthcare is free.
most of my friends in italy make 1200 euro/month 
EDIT for all the nice people who downvoted me: i am not saying he does not deserve more. I am just stating that in europe a salary of EUR 25K overall is not a bad salary. You can live quite well with 25K euros/year. Healtcare is pretty much free, and the 25K are after taxes
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:24:47
AFAIK Paypal don't cover any digital item.
So you could probably sell 1 US cent, and give bitcoin for free as a gift to whoever win the auction.
In this way, you will send the 1 US cent in an envelope with tracking  so in case the buyer reverse the payment you will have proof you sent the item.
If you do it this way, i also doubt a scammer will buy from you
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:06:27
i agree, i was just saying that EUR 25K/year is overall not a bad salary (at least in italy and most european states). 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:14:12
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:25:38
I currently own "only" 1 BTC and I have it on coinbase, i do not use the exchange, how do you suggest me to store it? Wallet on my PC, Trezor (maybe overikilled for this amount of BTC), paper wallet, keep it on coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:24:07
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:24:50
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:42:51
i stated is was NET salary (after tax)
@_date: 2016-07-22 12:43:12
what a noob, he did not hide his identity at all! lol you accept bitcoin, and you use a wallet created on coinbase...you could have used paypal!
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:23:29
you got lucky, i was scammed the other way around (paid and never received the coin, not on ebay) and paypal said they do not cover virtual goods as they do not have any way to track it, and that was it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:28:41
he lives in Germany, or at least that's what i understood from the article. he does not live in the us where i agree with you, 25K is nothing. But in europe where healthcare is free is not a bad salary overall

We're seeking a strong developer experienced **with Ethereum**and blockchain architecture to be a part of
team tasked with building distributed application. Our ideal candidate has built and released distributed
applications, has worked with the Ripple, R3, Ethereum and/or Bitcoin blockchain, and has experience with Solidity,
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:17:42
what is exactly the selling point of not knowing the creator and the fact that he has not moved the coins?
I actually see it as a not selling point, from an investor point of view
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:41:40
i guess they need to know where to ship it...or not?
