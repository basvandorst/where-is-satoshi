This is HUGE for Sweden! Klarna is the biggest payment processor by far here, it's basically Sweden's own Paypal. Almost everytime you shop in a swedish web shop you're given the option to pay through Klarna. This is really amazing, and I'm soooooo happy that I'll finally be able to purchase things from Swedish retailers using btc. I'll be able to buy my comp-sci course literature using btc in the near future, how great isn't that?

I don't see how that's relevant. You asked about the efficiency of bitcoin and I replied. Whether it's good as a long-term store of value is yet to be answered, but after that savings in fees and time I decided I wanted to be part of this new idea somehow. 
I also state in the post that I was up a few percentages at the time. I never said I bought all my bitcoin at $950, so the downward trend actually hasn't hurt the value of my bitcoins that much. It's still down, but nowhere near a 66% decrease. 
It doesn't really matter what I write though. Considering that you're going through my posts shows your troll-like nature. Have fun roaming the Internets.

I managed to save about $100 in fees and one week's waiting time when transferring money from one country to another. How's that for efficient? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:29:01
I bought in at $950. I've kept buying and have sold some during this time when I've been low on cash. But despite the current price, I'm still up about 7%. Bitcoin is my second savings account where I stash cash I don't expect to need for a long time. If I'm in the green when I need cash, I'll sell off some big, otherwise I'll take it from my regular savings account. And I always buy back what I've sold when I have enough spare cash.

I didn't have anything invested in bitcoins but continued to follow it for two years before I bought in. I followed the news not because I was interested in making money out of it, but because I saw it as an interesting experiment and hoped it would succeed. I bought in so that I could help it succeed (and yes, hopefully save some money for the future through it). I just thought it sounded like the best way to do international, safe and cheap purchases. I've always liked the concept of one global currency, but the EU and euro has showed that it's hard to do. This seemed like a better option.

I wouldn't be so sure of that. If Satoshi sold **all** their bitcoins, then those bitcoins would finally have a definitive answer as to what happened to them. I think it would be good if there could be proof those bitcoins somehow were taken out of the system, because as long as we don't know if they're still accessible, they can potentially cause such a crash, and I'd rather have that sooner than later.
Now as to cashing out and getting the money out without revealing their identity, that would probably be another issue for them. But I really do see those old bitcoins as a potential threat to adoption.

The only issue here is that we can't know how bitcoin will be used in the future.

No one is forcing a  fork. Classic is giving miners a choice to fork. If miners don't want a fork, then there will not be one. There's alot of bitcoin users that believe a 2mb block raise is needed now, and we'll soon see if miners believe the same thing. I'm all for civil discussion on the topic, but I don't see why some supporters of either side always go for this kind of fear mongering.

More advanced != Better. 
As can be seen by all the issues ethereum has had recently. Bitcoin will get ETH-like functionality in the form of sidechains, for those who wish to use it. That mitigates the risk to the sidechain while making it easy to transfer value between chains and is IMO a much better solution for advanced scripts/contracts.

No, I get what you are saying, but I don't see how this was comparable to the bitcoin bug you were talking about earlier. That bug was fixed because it changed the fundamentals of the network. This bug is not in ethereum itself, but on a contract. I should have worded my other post better.

This article is shit. Not just because it's poor writing in terms of readability. 
Riksbanken is investigating the possibility of a national digital currency, the article makes it seem as if it actually planned to launch one now. These are two very different things. The investigation is planned to be presented in late 2018. I don't know about you, but I like the fact that they're investigating this. It shows that they are interested in digital currencies and it will show why a national digital currency will not work any better than bitcoin. Swedes rarely use physical cash these days, so it's not strange that they are exploring options. I would bet most people in that survey doesn't even know about eKrona, I mean I didn't until this article, and I follow the crypto space and Swedish companies related to it. 
Second part to show what a crappy source of information this is in the last part of the article. Sweden has a population of almost 10 million, not 5 million as the article suggests. 
I'm not in support of the​ eKrona and a long-term hodler, but I can't stand the vomit that is produced by these shitty -coin/chain "journalists"

First time I bought bitcoin was to transfer money when I moved between countries. Bought at Localbitcoins with one bank account and sold the same way to the other bank account.

You most likely didn't pay taxes on your gains and the sales got reported to your IRS. If you want to avoid that tax, it's better to use your bitcoin to purchase goods rather than fiat. But this boils down to your own idiocy which is reflected in your refugee paragraph. You tried to circumvent capital gains taxes and got busted for it. You have no one to blame other than yourself.

@_date: 2015-02-23 14:05:14
That's really cool. I can't do that (we only have chip and pin and very few places offer nfc). Doesn't that mean that if someone gets a hold of your wallet, they can use your card though? Is there any other layer of safety precautions taken?

You're right. Either I was typing my answer as you posted (on mobile atm) or I missed it. Good point. 
Edit: sorry, I didn't read the username, kudos to you for the idea.

They do not have merchant solutions that pays out in SEK, which mean there will be some money lost due to the exchange rate. I'm not sure how much would be lost, but I think it would be equivalent to btcx fee :/

While I am a supporter of SegWit, that way of interpretating people's arguments is very childish. It's incredibly obvious that what is meant is a block size increase in addition to what SegWit provides. Misinterpreting it on purpose does not add anything of value to the discussion. You're arguing semantics, not arguments or ideas.

I tried contacting safello back when I first proposed this to my boss, and they said they were working on it, but they still don't have a merchant solution.

Exchange rate fluctuations wouldn't be an issue with merchant solutions, what I was asking for was a merchant solution that resells the bitcoin for fiat as soon as the purchase goes through (which is what btcx offer,  but with large fees). Taxation wouldn't be an issue as there would be no capital gains or loss for the store if the fiat price was locked in at the moment of purchase. Again, I would really like our store to just take btc directly and keep them as is, and I will look into the possibility of getting part of my pay in btc, but I'm still looking for that merchant solution so I can give my boss options. You all provide really good advice on this, thanks to all of you for your inputs.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love it if the store took btc and didn't convert it. But at the moment, that's not a realistic solution. Partly because of the last bubble still being in the back of people's minds, and partly because of the small margins our shops operate on (we have to undercut all large grocery stores on all our products) . If something happened price wise, he'd lose confidence in my judgement. 
Maybe I could convince him of your idea sometime in the future, but I need to ease him into it, and I believe merchant solution for POS btc-&gt;fiat is the best way to do this. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:10:32

So? It's a scenario in where no one looses. The positive side is more merchant adoption and more education for potential bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:04:15
Yeah, I personally wouldn't mind that, but it would be an extra hassle and unfortunately I don't think accounting would be okay with that. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:32:44
You have 50$ in savings. You should not be buying bitcoin but save that small amount as an emergency fund, and try to increase it. Once you've done that you can start thinking about investing some savings. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:26:41
No, I really don't think that's the case. I think it's more about the whole forking off due to investor interest that is the issue here.

Yeah, that sort of necessary for a decentralized currency. You can't force people to use it, you need to tell them the benefits and risks , and hope they come to the same conclusion. 
I care about the price, butiker I care even more about being able to transfer money from my uk account to my swedish one without losing 15% in fees and poor exchange rates 
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:28:37
I'm just waiting for my paycheck to buy some bitcoin. I haven't been able to afford it since I first started learning about it before the april correction, and I won't really have money to invest. But I've decided to stop smoking and put that money into bitcoin instead, that way I won't feel that bad about losing any money since they usually would just go up in smokes anyway.
I don't really care if the price is $500 or $1000, I'll buy either way because I believe in Bitcoin as a concept. 
And I won't buy because I want to make money from it, I want it to be able to buy goods online without all the hassle of waiting 5 days for my Swedish bank account to clear international transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:27:59
This. So much. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:06:42
Well I bought 1/4 of a coin through my UK bank account on localbitcoins, and was hoping to sell it straight away through localbitcoins and get the funds to my Swedish bank account. I do have paypal connected to my Swedish bank account, but involving paypal would still make this process take two or three more days, and selling the .25 coin would just take a few minutes.
I'm probably going to have to sell at a loss, but this loss will still be much smaller than the fees and exchange rates that HSBC would have added had I transferred the money directly to my Swedish bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:33:42
Through national bank transfer. That would only take a few minutes no matter what bank the buyer would have (as long as it's Swedish).
Nah, I can't really afford it. Especially not with the price dropping so quickly. I really need this money in my bank account tomorrow, so I put in an order on localbitcoins from a local buyer and am hoping they'll respond swiftly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:31:31
Wow, thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:41:55
Yeah, I should have checked this subreddit before I did it. It's the only one I ever visit anymore, but I still don't think of checking it before buying -_-

@_date: 2013-12-06 21:33:28
Yes. This is the message I'm getting:
 &gt;"The advertisement is not currently running, because your LocalBitcoins.com wallet does not have enough bitcoins to automatically fund the escrow in the case the buyer responds to this advertisement. You need at least 1 BTC and advertisement minimum limit."
And I have set the limit below what I currently have in my localbitcoins wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:36:38
Well I would prefer keeping my newly bought bitcoins, but I can't actually afford it. I will still keep the bitcoins I bought a few weeks ago though, this is just me using bitcoins as a mean of funneling my fiat money from one country to another quickly and with smaller fees.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:08:26
The whole "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" motto for this sub speaks pretty well about how much people inform others about the risks.

Will be giving $10 each in bitcoin to my two nephews, my parents and my girlfriend as well as ordinary presents. It's a such a small amount that they won't be mad if the price goes down and it's not enough to buy any good presents. It's also small enough that they probably won't cash it out, but good in case prices goes up or bitcoin go more mainstream.
I'll also make copies of the paper wallets in case they lose them and will try and purchase as much of my christmas presents as possible in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:39:23
I know, I was just hoping to be able to sell it a market price and not very much below it (which would happen if I sold to buyers and didn't have my own ad up). Even if I did sell to the buying advertisments I'd make less of a loss than using bank transfer, but it's still a substantial cut for a smaller amount of money.
I guess I'll have to do cash then.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:03:32
Awesome! I was hoping to be able to purchase some christmas presents with bitcoins =)

Could only choose Australia, US or UK for shipment at first when signing up, but this can be changed to wherever afterwards. In case anyone else gets a bit confused.
