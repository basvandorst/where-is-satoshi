I didn't know Coinbase offer $50,000 per day. Thank you.

After reading your "article", I did not like the way in which it was portrayed.

Not even close to a census (publicly) yet
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:19:40
Satoshi Square or not, I would not go with $60,000 USD. Any thoughts on  dealing with Coinbase?

Most people need to purchase a qualified plan that covers the “minimum essential benefits” which includes things like maternity and newborn services, emergency care and prescription drugs. There are some notable exceptions: Grandfathered plans, most employer, COBRA or military plans. If you have Medicare you’re also excused from paying a penalty and the same is true for most Medicaid policies. Anyone under 30 can still carry a catastrophic plan that offers bare minimum coverage.


If you are asking a "limit" on your annual income in order to apply, then no there is not. 


In most, but not all states, anyone who has an income that is less than 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or FPL, will not have to buy health insurance and will not pay a penalty.
The FPL is defined by the government as the minimum income threshold required for basic needs such as food, shelter and transportation. If you make less than 100 percent of the FPL, health insurance is considered unaffordable for you but you might qualify for other types of government assistance including some health care programs.

I don't see your objective/relevancy with this site.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:02:51
It seems necessary to support the community later down the road 
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:47:08
Either way you're right

"Perhaps I am understanding it incorrectly, but if the client has a mobile wallet installed to their phone, can they not just scan a QR code of our address, enter an amount, and wait for us to verify?"
You are correct. I am not sure if Bitpay is need needed in this instance. If you are looking to PAY bills directly in BTC then bits2bills.com would be better suited.
