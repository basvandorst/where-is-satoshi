Try buying a coffee with Bitcoin. Oh wait you cant BTC is a store of value because fees and TX times are too high and company are deciding to no longer accept it.

Well Instagram is owned by Facebook, who makes a profit, and Youtube is owned by google, who makes a profit, so neither are bubbles.

What would happen if there was a huge influx of people buying and holding USD? The economy would crash. A currency is designed to be spent, not held. Im not an economist, but its pretty clear to me that this whole "hold hold hold" mentality is not healthy for btc.

The only way bitcoin would scale that far would be for it to become centralized which would make it essentially the same as fiat.

It usually helps to be backed by a government and over a billion people who accept the USD as a currency.

Either Bitcoin truly Fixes scaling issues or it dies. This whole "Store of value" idea is bull and once the "BUY AND HODL" train slows down the price of BTC will fall significantly

Bitcoin was created as a decentralized currency, however due to scaling issues the BTC is not only becoming less of a currency and more of a store of value, it is also becoming more centralized. The Idea of BTC was that 2 people would be able to trade exchange BTC without the need of a 3rd party like VISA or MasterCard, but with increased centralization from Coinbase and Lightnight network this is no longer the case.
The folks over at think their currency has fixed the scaling problems.

Ironically Bitcoins solution to the scaling problem is more centralization.

To me it seems like newsweek pulled the article/info put of thin air to get free publicity, theres a good chance that isint the guy who made bitcoin.

I was under the impression bitcoins couldent be tracked, i dont know much about them, someone care to explain?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:08:11
Nope, the bitcoin whitepaper calls it a peer to peer electronic cash.

Well BCH is faster and cheaper to use.

If patents did not exist there would be no incentive to spend money on R&amp;D because another company would just Reverse engineer your product and sell YOUR product on on the market within weeks.

The fundementals have not changed, the users have. Bitcoin grew so fast in the past year because it was a get rich quick scheme for most people
