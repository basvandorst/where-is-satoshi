Commercial miners are paying for their gear too.

No, but if commercial mining currently makes a profit while paying for electricity, using free electricity seems like it'd be a winner.. Perhaps even with last generation mining hardware.

There are similar instruments already available. Xbtprovider on NASDAQ OMX and bitcoinetn in gibraltar. More will keep appearing on venues around the world. Its time

Deposit to a shared wallet exchange and then make 10 withdrawals

Basically you can only withdraw to one btc address that you define at account setup. Changing it requires going through verification again. Its impossible to withdraw to any other addresses. IMO it sucks tbh

Might be interesting if circle could send to abra and vise versa.

Heh well btc-e is usually under market by a few % in any case I don't think there are many options.. Some localbitcoins sellers will do it, but probably at an even higher premium.

It will work, but still be slow

Wire transfer. Not available for us residents though

Signaling for segwit on litecoin starts tomorrow.. Maybe after its working there it can happen on bitcoin too..

Maybe they would be replaced more frequently if there were a reason too...

There will be limits to how much heat anyone needs and thus limits to how much "free" electricity is available at any one installation, but the efficiency is what is important and having a 100% headstart is pretty good.
