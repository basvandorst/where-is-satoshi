Yeah . . . this was one of the worst posters I've seen.

Doesn't this just mean use is falling?

Just make up some story about it having a "10 year key" where it can't be sold for 10 years.   Problem solved.

Any good way to back up ones passphrase with cryptosteel?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:16:27
I mean . . .just don't invest more that you can afford to lose in any cryptocurrency and youre good.  Itd be silly to get ride of your prefork BCH though.   hodl

What specific tools and method did you use to stamp the steel plate?  I've been trying to do that, but perhaps my poor results are due to using too thin of a plate.  (I think I started with .030", and now I've tried ~.1".

Either it is pretty silly, or I'm getting old?   Maybe both

First of all, I feel a bit like this:   But oh well, ha.
I empathize with that view a bit, since it seems at first like governments aren't involved with Bitcoin and if you invest in it without their help, why should you be taxed on it?
But that's not true:  think of how many ancillary roles that support the Bitcoin network that governments play.  Regulating and enforcing electrical grids to run the computers, running institutions such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the US (which per many Reddit posts helped many people with issues with Coinbase, for example), regulating and incentivizing large internet service providers to build internet infrastructure throughout unprofitable rural areas, organizations such as the FCC setting as wireless spectrum and creating mobile internet networks that your phone runs on which you can spend Bitcoin through, the bazillion investments and inventions that led to the internet to begin with, the FAA, NASA, DOD, COTS etc. in the US that are playing key roles helping companies such as OneWeb and SpaceX launch their huge satellite internet constellations over the next couple of years . . . I'm sure we could come up with 100+ reasons easily in an hour that Bitcoin is "supported" by Governments with.
So I don't think "theft" is a fair word.  Yeah, taxes suck if you don't take some time to think of exactly how many things your government does for you on a daily basis, but if you do stop to be thankful that you're not drinking milk with melamine in it, they hurt a little less.

And they're guaranteed to be supported indefinitely?

Cool, thanks.

I don't know enough about segwit, so perhaps silly question, but could I lose my coins if I choose the "wrong" one?
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:25:59
My examples are from the US since I'm American, but no matter your country many of those examples (wireless spectrum regulation, electrical grid, and I'd bet you can come up with many others) certainly apply.
Anyhow, I just wanted to plant the seed of thought there, no need for us to come to an agreement today.  :)

Dude, who do you think built your road?   Wrote the regulations which made the car safe?  Wrote the standards for the properties of the gasoline you'll be putting in it?   Created the training standards and tests for you to get you license?   Will clean your entrails off the road if you slide off a snowy road into a light post?
Pay your damn taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:44:40
You made this.

I took a gamble on a new company and just submitted an order.  Looking forward to it!  I've wanted something similar to cryptosteel, but that I could also add an (obfuscated) version of Passphrases and/or PINs as well.  
Will let you all know if I have any trouble receiving it!  
I tried the whole punching-into-metal but I want to maintain the ability to easily destroy a written-down passphrase.  It turns out it really IS hard to melt a plate of stainless steel when you want it gone . . .

Do not remove.  
Relevant conversation.

Copy that, good analogy.  Thanks.

That it was a conspiracy?   Nah dude, I work on spaceships and rockets.   400,000 people worked on Apollo, I've met many of them.   I believe it's one of mankind's greatest achievements, and is a good example of what can be achieved when you commit the equivalent of the department of defenses budget toward one goal.  (About 4% of the US GPD.)
If you're curious I can't recommend enough the HBO miniseries (by Tom Hanks) called "From the Earth to the Moon".   The episode "spider" is my favorite; my time at SpaceX felt a lot like that one.  Also "A Man on the Moon" by Andrew Chaiken.  And DEFINITELY go see a Saturn V in real life; there are three left as museum pieces (mostly hardware from canceled Apollo 18 and 19 missions.).  They are so freaking incredible.  The one at Kennedy Space Center has the most impressive display.

Is this a joke?
