And yet here we are, with Bitcoin being the most widely-used and accepted cryptocurrency in the world. This announcement will only increase its market share.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:06:07
How is this a FUD campaign of any stripe? I smell a bitter bagholder...
@_date: 2014-10-07 02:27:10
Yeah, I think Counterparty has quite neatly stolen first place today. Best of luck to the NXT guys though - looks like they're gonna need it  :P
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:29:53
It will be; it's going to integrate with Counterparty which is built on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:11:17
Ah, TIL :-) I remember looking around for an answer to that question but don't remember finding one - maybe I just didn't understand it at the time. I was still pretty new to crypto back then. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-07 03:34:22
You keep saying NXT is trading millions weekly, but millions of what? Dollars? If it's so huge and successful, why are there no service businesses around it, like BitPay? Why has Overstock chosen to move forward with Counterparty? I think you're underestimating Counterparty, and it certainly sounds like you don't fully understand it. But by all means, continue screaming into the aether that NXT is the true scion of crypto 2.0 without examining why everyone seems to eschew common sense and go with another platform. I'm beyond certain that nothing I say will make the slightest difference to how you think.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:20:45
It does. A Counterparty transaction is a Bitcoin transaction; the blockchain, just like a real-life ledger book, has "space in the margins" of transactions. This is where Counterparty stores its data.
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:15:19
Unfortunately, they don't.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:06:34
Well thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:09:02
The Counterparty team have confirmed no such thing, the title is horribly misleading. Taariq operates a business that uses Counterparty, and this was said in the Counterparty "public" Skype chat.
@_date: 2014-10-07 07:52:14
Precisely so. It's curious that so many people don't take it into account when talking about their platform of choice dethroning Bitcoin (and now, Counterparty).
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:09:36
Yes, it is, because Dogeparty is a fork of Counterparty... That's where they got the "-party" in the name. So it's more like Dogeparty is the same thing as this :-P
Edit: and the burn happened back in January when Counterparty was released.
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:44:15
Ah, I thought you meant uses other than mining, sorry.
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:54:31
Well, back then Bitcoins were worth a lot more than they are now... Most people viewed the burn with a lot of scepticism, because nobody knew who the devs were and it just kind of had to be taken on faith that they didn't have the key to the burn wallet. I'm not sure you would have burned if you had the chance. Source: I knew any the burn, and didn't take part for those very reasons.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:19:22
That doesn't make this FUD. Ironically, your trumpeting about Counterparty becoming worthless eventually (which is by the way based on absolutely nothing but wishful thinking) is the dictionary definition of FUD. It would be funny if it weren't so depressing.
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:53:29
To build on what said, Overstock have been working with regulatory experts like the former chairman of the SEC to make sure they play by the rules. They've got a raft of securities lawyers on board, and they're working with the current regulatory bodies to clarify how existing regulations affect what they're trying to do. By all accounts they have a lot of government support on this.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:19:37
A shame for who, exactly? This wasn't a decision they came to overnight - much research was done, every platform was considered, and the one that best fit their goals was chosen.
There are some applications that coloured coins (as I understand them) are better suited to - collectable card games like Deckbound for example. However, for the decentralised exchange/asset issuance route that Overstock is looking at, Counterparty is superior. It's more featureful and flexible than coloured coins.
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:40:16
Overstock and the Counterparty team have been working directly with the SEC and other regulatory bodies to make this happen. It's got a lot of support in the government, actually.
Why do you think they would announce anything without doing their due diligence to see if it would get shot down first?
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:47:41
This needs to be higher. Just goes to show how little focus the Counterparty team are putting on marketing...
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:54:46
Network effect. Bitcoin is too deeply entrenched to be replaced any time soon.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:14:17
This is something I'm happy to be wrong about :-)
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:29:02
I think they went bankrupt.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:21:47


... what?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:55:30
As says:


This is exactly what you and other detractors don't seem to get: they're leveraging an existing network of billions of devices. People will connect because there's a chance to earn some small amount of money that they wouldn't otherwise earn, for doing *nothing*. At any one time there are hundreds of millions of computers, probably with 100GB+ of unused disk space each (on average), powered on and connected to the internet. Sure, you'll need more redundancy than a centralised solution, but that won't be a problem because of just how much bloody space there is available; all you have to do is tweak a variable in the software. And as for cost, the beauty is the similarity to mining. If there's a glut of space, prices drop and everyone's got cheap cloud storage. If nobody's sharing drive space because prices are too low, prices rise and incentivise other people to join the network.
As to why you'd want all of this P2P, there's one huge advantage that's worth any other sacrifices made: nobody else can look at your data but you. Nobody can prevent you access to your data. Celebritygate, or the fappening, or whatever you want to call it as an example, would never have happened. Storj is helping to usher in an age of truly secure cloud storage, and that's pretty damn exciting.

I've always found the rates on Local to have crazy high margin compared to what you'll find on many exchanges, but ice only really looked in Sydney proper. What area are you looking in?
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:10:18
[Independent Reserve]( is great, they serve a number of different currencies and even automatically fill orders across different currencies (i.e. your buy order is in AUD but the cheapest sell order is in USD, their system will match you with the USD orders first). They have a deal with some FX company to get really good exchange rates, which is how they do it. The site looks good and works well, and their brokerage is pretty reasonable. I think the sign up and verification process is less laborious than some others I've used (*ahemBitStamp*). Plus they have a *lot* of security options for your account.
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:39:10
Oh, you want to play that game? Why would you trust a gigantic, faceless corporation over a friendly local you've probably run into down at the pub, or at your local Bitcoin meetup? Coinbase's only interest in the technology is how much money they can make off it, they have so many customers you're just a number to them, and they are beholden to the whims of their government. Once you sell them your bitcoins, they can freeze your account whenever they like; they're no better than PayPal. You have a lot more control over the situation when you transact with another individual, in person.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:18:00
Yeah, they moved to the UK; their blog said it wasn't about the GST, but it totally was.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:23:57
Coinbase is terrible, there are more and more horror stories from users posted here every day. But even disregarding that, they're a centralised service and so you should not trust them. Local Bitcoins is OP's best bet.
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:21:33
You have a lot of agency over whether or not you get shanked. The guy you want to buy bitcoins from is only willing to meet on a forest trail twenty minutes outside of town and oh, hey, could you pick up a shovel on your way? Don't go, and buy from someone else instead. It's a marketplace, you have a choice, unlike with Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:14:54
I thought all that stuff happened after that investor bought it off him? I seem to remember a forum thread where Zhou was talking quite candidly about assisting the police with an investigation... I think he ended up paying back most or all of the BTC that was stolen, too. This was quite a while back though, my memory could be failing me.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:53:28
Yes, and a very important one. It means that if someone's Bitcoins get stolen it's (very likely) their own fault, and one person being compromised doesn't put every user of the platform at risk.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:46:14
I was indeed, thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:26:02
~~CoinJar has nothing to do with Zhou Tong...~~
Looks like I was Zhou *Wrong*

You have to accept that you may not break even in a year, or ever. Nobody can predict where the market's going to go, so the advice to only invest what you can lose is sound. But don't let that stop you from getting into it for fun, the learning experience, and being part of something bigger! Those are the reasons I started mining over six months ago, and I got lucky and have made some small profit. But even back then people here were saying not to buy mining hardware and that smalltime mining is dead and pointless. Those people are either misguided, or greedy (i.e. they know that more people hashing means lower returns for them and want to prevent it any way they can, such as by discouraging newcomers).
If you can't afford to drop any cash on mining hardware unless it will make you a return, don't. Do what you're comfortable with and enjoy yourself :-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:50:32
A lot of people here will tell you it's too late to start mining. What they mean is it's too late to start mining if you want a large return relatively quickly. These people miss half the point of bitcoin - we need as many people as possible hashing on the network. If you're in the US you can snag a few block erupters off amazon for $10-20 each. Plug them in, sign up with Bitminter, and start hashing! It's never too late. There's a certain feeling I get when I check my miners after a long day at the office - I don't think I'd get that from mining on CEX or just buying the coins. Plus, if btc goes down, you can mine other SHA based coins instead with the same hardware :-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:24:53
The question is not just why - governments have a vested interest in controlling currency, after all - but how? Unless you can muster the muscle to track every transaction in the blockchain by associating wallet addresses to IP addresses (and even that isn't 100%, as the RIAA/MPAA/copyright troll court cases have shown), it's impossible. If banks started offering bitcoin accounts you could do it a lot more easily, but then people would have to use them. Or you could try to impose regulations on merchants that accept bitcoin, which might work to some degree... But as far as the law is concerned there's no way to prove how much or little cash flow comes from business-related btc transactions.
