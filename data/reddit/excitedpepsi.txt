I unsubscribed over there this week.  Complaining about this place is all they ever do
I don't have a dog in this fight but it was getting old

Yeah.  I don’t post much but isn’t there some way to tag it as nsfw.    Merely saying the word nsfw in the original post does nothing to keep that image from auto loading on reddit mobile.

Well.  You just described most redditors.   They just want the government to be involved and taking a big slice off the top also

That’s the kind of thinking that results in  me buying at the ath then watching it crater.   Then two weeks later new ath.   Repeat

I have a scheduled buy on the 23rd.  So it will be fine until then

wow you've combined something reddit likes, being total marks for global warming propaganda, and something hates, government.

harder to find than a bitcoin ATM.

They would be a good reason for the excessive fees 
This is just taking advantage of people who don't know another way to buy easily
Gax I'd have to wait for money to clear before the purchase unlike coin base 
Perhaps I should look at Gemini.  
I'd rather have everything in one place (yeah. I guess wallet is the answer to that)
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:32:06
sure.  the one at your bank takes deposits
The free standing ones in the mall, the gas station etc, like this one generally dont.

The default normal way you buy bitcoin, and receive the price at the moment you order.
Or you select your USD wallet on coinbase, and select deposit, in which case thats what you did.  you now have money in cash (once it clears) can can buy at that point.
this is why its so frustrating when people say "just buy on gdax".
In a rising market you could make far more money by purchasing that day (and pay a fee) instead of buying it next week at a higher price.

that's weird.  the website lists buy only.  
scroll down to north america and see the difference between US and Canada
if you've actually sold, and done so since they lost the ability to work in Canadian money, then I believe you.  But these articles I'm reading makes it more likely you see a menu in the app because its easier for them to not remove that in the app.  but it wont work
Here's a reddit post  that says you cant sell coinbase in canada and lists some alternatives.
