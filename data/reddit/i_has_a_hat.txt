I still hate how 2x fell through. I really think it would have solved a lot of problems and ended all this animosity that has sprung up in the bitcoin community.
Everyone knows blocksize increases are not a long term solution, they're only short term. But we needed a short term solution while long term ones like segwit and LN were being worked on, I think that much at least has become pretty apparent in the last few months. 
Its like this perfect middleground was made that everyone could be happy in and then both sides decided to bomb the shit out of it.

God I am excited for vertbase. USD/VTC trading pair with the ability to perform atomic swaps between BTC, LTC, and VTC in the future.

I meant the 2x agreement, where blocksize would be doubled to 2mb while segwit and LN were implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:59
Everyone keeps saying that, but wont it run into the same problems as segwit with slow adoption?

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:00:42
So maybe I don't fully understand it, and if thats the case I hope someone can let me know otherwise, but isn't LN likely to run into the same problems Segwit is having with adoption? Currently only around 10% of bitcoin transactions come from a Segwit address, adoption has been slow and too gradual to significantly lower transaction fees.
Won't LN run into the same problem? Especially considering the extra steps it takes to start up a node and open a channel? Or does the tech involved somehow avoid this issue?

Except for other cryptos. Unfortunately BTC can't be replaced yet because the crypto markets lack the infastructure to support that change. Most exchanges are set up with BTC pairing primarily, with other methods of purchase taking a back seat. 
Right now, Bitcoin is gold. I know people hate using that analogy but FFS its literally what we've turned it into. We have made it into a store of value by TREATING it like a store of value. Every other coin has two ways people view its worth, its price in fiat, and its price in satoshi's. By making that a standard of comparison, we have effectively said that Bitcoin will remain as the digital "gold" of the crypto world. The baseline that determines what everything else is worth.
It doesn't matter how high the fees are or how long it takes, people will keep using it as a standard because now its been established that way. Buying and selling real gold in the real world is certainly much more difficult than just using fiat, and even though most currencies are no longer backed by gold, its still seen by most nations as being the most default store of value there is.

Here's something I'm confused about. Won't increasing technology allow non-commercial miners to profit? AMD just released a new software package specifically for mining. There are new processors and cards being made that can chew through blocks at a fraction of the time.

A lot of new people are getting in because they see your slow-ass strategy of "start with a savings bond and work their way up to crypto" as having a very big possibility on making them miss out on the bitcoin train by the time they're ready.
 Look at it this way. 3 years ago people were saying the *exact* same things they're saying now. "Its too volatile", "Its not good in the short term", "dont get into it unless you know everything about it" and everyone who listened to those things lost out. Everyone who ignored them, said "fuck it" and threw money at it seems to have made the right decision.
So why would (or even should) anyone listen to your advice now?

Teaching yourself a subject is pretty much entirely useless if you dont get that expensive piece of paper certifying that you learned it.

LTC has been fairly steady at just under $50. If you moved all your BTC to LTC when it hit 4400 yesterday and converted it back when it was 3900 a few hours ago, you would have a net gain in your amount of bitcoins. Im not talking about using LTC as a long term investment, but rather a holding area for when BTC dips. 
Edit: took a look at the LTC price, looks like it dropped a higher % than BTC, so never mind haha

USD is still the best and will be for a long time. Yes its going fluctuating too, but it is the most recognized currency in the world. Give a comparison in USD and almost anyone can understand the value. But in gold? Silver? Not many people know the actual value of those offhand. So saying something like 1 BTC is worth 10oz of gold is not a very helpful measurement for most people.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:54:05

Oh OH! Let me try! Starting from the top we have:
The Cryptonerd - The only one who halfway understands how the tech actually works. Got in super early and is now pretty much set for life.
The Whale - Follows the Cryptonerd but with much more capital to back him up.
The Noobie - Fresh into bitcoin, the noobie follows the tracks of cryptonerds and whales but is still in the process of learning things and trying to do his own research. Only holds a small amount of coin for now.
The Anon/anarchist - Eagerly looks forward to the day bitcoin takes down big banks and big government. Obsessed with privacy. All of his bitcoin is stored on various paperwallets which he has buried in several different locations that only he knows. Buys exclusively through ATM's despite the fees because he doesn't want to use exchanges.
The "Totally Legit" Investor - Very familiar with Tor and the Dark web. Frequently receives unmarked, inconspicuous packages. All his harddrives are set to wipe themselves in an instant in case of seizure. Has recently been exchanging his BTC for XMR. Is frequently shown as a typical bitcoin user by the media.
The Doomsayer - Is in a constant state of panic. Sells and jumps off at every dip or stagnation period which causes him to regret not holding when it eventually rises. Sees every dip as a sign of the end of bitcoin and every rise as nothing but a pump &amp; dump. Frequently goes on forums and calls other people fools for not selling.

Ok, enough of this. Suggesting a hardware wallet is NOT helpful. Many people don't hold enough to warrant spending $50+ on a device, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY **even if you order today, you are not guaranteed to have it arrive before the hardfork** you freaking dingus's! The delays on these things are known to be pretty lengthy.
On top of that you guys treat any other kind of wallet as super unsafe and any exchange as "OMG GET COINS OFF THERE NAO!!!11!" when the exchange itself (especially in the case of insured ones like Coinbase, and no, their insurance doesn't ONLY cover your USD wallet) is often much safer than a wallet on an already infected PC, that goes double if you set up 2FA.
That being said it is important to get your coins off the exchange before the upcoming hardfork, many have still not given out the Bitcoin Cash from the last fork. I still don't know what wallet's would be viable to use however, because anytime the question comes up, the only answer is "Just get a hardware wallet, lolz"
