Amazon turns a profit for a lot of other people though.  They still control a huge online sale marketshare. Smart investors know to get in bed with companies that ship through Amazon because they save a ton of fucking money on shipping.

realistically, Apple products are priced perfectly.  stopping bitcoin on their phones will maybe cost them .05% of their business at the absolute most.  Apple has been trying to make mobile payments more accessible so don't be shocked if they announce a way to use iTunes money to replace some functions of bitcoin

i don't think you know what selling out means.  They did a soundtrack. okay? They released an album based on replicating the 70's- early 90's and took 5 years to do it using as many different producers as they could.  if they sold out, wouldn't they be releasing a new album every 2 years like most artists?
They released a single. 40 days before their album came out. Releasing 1 single is incredibly few in this day and age before the album. it got radio play because people liked it thats how things work

lol if they wanted to make "mindless garbage for the masses" they would've brought in relevant EDM producers and gotten big name features and not used a vocoder.
disliking a group is not a reason to spout nonsense about them.

He's generally right. This type of price gouging while scummy is hitting tax payers not the individual patients. I don't know if the car poop shit is right though

I know won't it stabilize though?

Is selling it in pieces on eBay a legit option? I'm seeing .05 go for sometimes 70-80 on there. If I break what I have up and sell it 8 times I can get 600+ right?  Or is there a catch to using eBay I'm not seeing other than inconvenience

smart choice.  They have your name and your IP address.  The IRS would hound you for it if you converted it to USD and they would alert authorities not worth it
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:53
That .4 cost me like 30 dollars so yes considerably less

No way to prove sale?
I think I'll hang on at least through tomorrow and then sell with bitstamp if it looks stable after this next hearing
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:25
Yeah that just materialized out of literally nowhere 300 bucks as a college student is some pretty great money
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:15:32
I've got .4 much less but still i wasn't ever going to use that just too lazy to cash it out for at the time 30 dollars.  Now I'm waiting for it to get me a "free" xbox one
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:00:13
