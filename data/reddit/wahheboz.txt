Please don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say any of that, please reread my comments. Plus your last sentence makes no sense.

Where did I do that?

That's obviously not true with BTC

This thread is extremely misleading, especially for people who don't really understand how the LN works
That's like saying that you went to the movies, and after buying a ticket from the cashier, entered the movie theater by showing your ticket to the security guard at the door, and then you claim that the movie theater is p2p b/c the final interaction was completely p2p

Do you not know that you have to open at least one lighting channel *on-chain* to begin to use the LN? So how can LN be more p2p than Bitcoin if you must use Bitcoin in the first step to using the LN? You're talking as if you can use the lightning network directly p2p without the Bitcoin blockchain.
If that's the case, why don't you start a new token called the lightning network (TLN) and do an ICO while you're at it?

Haha exactly what I mean. You're making the LN seem better than Bitcoin itself instead of being a supplement to it. Why don't you use the LN without Bitcoin in that case and see how well that works?
The p2p nature of Bitcoin is the fact that you can send a payment to someone without the need for an intermediary like with the case in credit cards for example. Not the fact that you only *interact* p2p with the recipient in *one* step of the process, in *one* specific case (where you have a direct open channel with that recipient).

The statement that Charlie makes about the LN being a more p2p system than Bitcoin on-chain. It makes the LN seem much more P2P and valuable than it actually is.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the LN has no value. I'm just saying that it has a lot of limitations of its own that Charlie completely disregarded in order to make his point.
