We’re either shooting down to 9.5 or up to 11 in the next 2 hours boys trade with caution
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:14:13
So did we see a double top? And if so what could that mean for the coming months?
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:47:17
We’ll probably hit 9k tonight and 8k by the end of the week.
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:47:09
It could be better invested. DCA your way into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:13:25
People see a small jump in price and automatically assume a bull run is in place. No lol. We are in a short to mid term bearish trend might see 10.5 k at the most and then we’ll continue down to 8.6k which will be around the bottom. Just stack up guys and be grateful you’re still in Bitcoin before the majority.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:59:24
We’re gonna have a small rally to 11.25-11.5k range then down to 9k and on further to 8k. Just buy in 2 weeks brothers.
Edit: unless the feds give us our proper respect and we will see some genuine growth.
@_date: 2019-08-02 01:25:00
Here comes 9.7k
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:50:05
What hardware wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:57:22
I mean how am I supposed to know the full extent to how this happens?  Someone gained unauthorized access to my account and took my BTC as I’ve already explained.
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:21:33
I think ultimately you’re right about that.  Although, I would be able to pay back most of my student loan over the semester with my income by living frugally.  Not gonna lie, I was subconsciously looking for some confirmation bias but your advice is definitely something I needed to hear.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:14:05
If we can stay above 11.7k and get over 12.2k in the next day or two things will be looking good:)
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:31:19
The 100 day MA is at around 9k if we go below that we’ll go quite a bit lower than 8k most likely, so yeah nice job picking a pretty irrelevant/random number out to predict.

@_date: 2019-08-10 06:25:36
Any second now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:47:31
Wow! Great analysis!
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:15:22
They’ll learn man give them a break.

Some invest more than they can afford, some are gamblers,and some are overly emotionally attached.  Not many can HODL comfortably.
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:50:20
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:30:13
I thought it was from early April? Or am I thinking of a different prophecy?
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:26:28
Not too sure what your last sentence entails. All I know is that somehow someone transferred my BTC to my coinbase pro and then to a BTC address within 1 minute.
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:38:32
There’s almost 10,000 of us online right now. Haven’t seen that in a while.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:12:48
Yes we shall educate them
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:56:47
I’m okay with either. If it goes down I’ll stack more .  If it goes up I’ll be happy with where I’m at.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:49:44
Thank you good sir! You’ve been on a tipping spree as of late.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:02:03
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:52:21
I contacted support they have disabled my account for now and sent an email saying they will be conducting an investigation within 10 days.
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:46:55
I am extremely excited to share the journey with you guys here on reddit and all fellow Bitcoin hodlers/traders.  The future is bright my friends.
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:29:26
I understand that no one can predict the future with Bitcoin especially because of how volatile it is.  I was just hoping to get some educated guesses at the very least.  I know most of us aren’t professional TAs but I like to hear what you guys think!
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:49:39
Thanks I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:50:59
Doesn’t no one?.. think you got it mixed up bud.

“Do not pray for easy lives.  Pray to be stronger men.”
The great John F. Kennedy
Bitcoin has made me a stronger man now and regardless of where we are price wise in the future I will be stronger then as well.
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:41:15
I’d like to hear from some of you that have been involved in Bitcoin for a substantial amount of time about where you guys think the price could be in December.  I’ll probably get downvoted but I’m considering investing a good portion of my financial aid and student loan refund right now with the hopes of selling that portion in December with a 50-75% return at the least.
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:59:52
My feelings aren’t hurt whatsoever.  From what I’ve heard, according to the Department of Education, once the cost of attendance has been exceeded and I have received my refund it is fair game.  No money trail, audit, or report.  If I am wrong then I am wrong.  No need to be a dick about it.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:37:13
So I’m guessing since your predictions are always right you bought at 19k with complete certainty that we’d be in a bear market for the following year.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:49:33
HODL NEVER FODL where my HODL boys at?!?!
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:49:24
Bitcoin is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get ;)
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:38:22
It’s a hell of a ride. Enjoy!;)
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:25:52
Wow you’re pretty cool man! Maybe you’d like to reveal what your profession is? I’d bet I could name 100 careers that would make yours look like a fast food job as well.
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:43:41
BTC phone home
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:01:33
I think we wake up tomorrow and it’s 9.7 but hey who knows your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:02:11
But we’re going down right now..
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:52:57
Going all in right now defeats the purpose of DCA
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:35:27
I second that what
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:54:28
I checked my account this morning and a transfer of my bitcoin was made to my coinbase pro and from there it was sent to a BTC address. I have no idea how I was hacked.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:14:52
Today my coinbase account was hacked and all my btc was stolen. I only had a little over .1 of a Bitcoin but this is still a lot for me. I worked very hard to accumulate what I have in the past 3 months and made many sacrifices to my budget to be able to do this. I know this is solely my fault for being ignorant and not getting an offline wallet. I am not looking for pity, just to be able to vent and receive any advice whatsoever.  This shit hurts man but I guess I learned my lesson.
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:49:47
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:33:58
I won’t cry if bitcoin dumps today
I don’t get angry at the fees I have to pay 
I don’t get angry when my mom says stop 
buy the dip and go straight to the top
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:49:58
Legend in the making
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:33:44
Why? What’s the point of belittling me?
