Please can we stop giving this hack Ran Neu Ner the time of day.
His analysis is weak and blows both ways. It's not uncommon for him to promote to contradicting opinions within a matter of days e.g. He shunned Bitcoin as a bubble that was inevitably going pop soon only to say that Bitcoin was a long term buy n hold two days afterwards. Another occasion saw him deride ICOs as the largest scam mechanisations in history only to later praise them as a means of fund raising.
He's also a firm believer that selling less BTC at a USD gain is a profit.
He has no firm opinions, terrible analyses, if any at all, of the coins he's shills on his poorly produced TV show, and on top of all that he's a blatant bcash shill.
Stop allowing new entrants to be seduced by false prophets whose primary agenda is to profit off of them.

Not angry so much as appalled. 
He's an unknowledgeable hack. That's all there is to it but it's harder to convince people of a scam's nature than it is for the scam to seduce said person.
He's a snake oil salesman who dumps his bags on his audience too. 
Gotta cleanse the community.

Your bribery excuse is clear misdirection. India's economy was struggling and faced great turmoil. The "bribery" excuse was just the justification to exert ungodly power of the populous and the excuse doesn't even hold up.
Loads of bribes are given in forms of jewellery or food.
And yet they didn't delegitimise jewellery or food - couldn't if they wanted to tho
Loads of bribe money was used to buy good or was invested in stocks or bank accounts. 
And they didn't delegitimise stocks or bank accounts - and they could if they wanted to. 
And now that this clearly untrue "bribery" excuse has been made, what's to stop bribes being made through several low denomination notes? The excuse is a paltry attempt at a blatant coverup.
Your patriotism is misguided. 
There's no point defending central banks, fiat and the governments that wield that power. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:49:19
I do. But you're equating financial systems with economic ones. And you're infantilising third world citizens by implying they need paternalistic institutions to look after them. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:43:05
Lost their farms too - they would have left but they had no realisable way of holding onto the assets they'd need to survive a move.

But a private company decides how much inflation-tax you pay, whereas income tax etc is democratically determined and subject to discourse and change. 
Plus income tax goes directly to public services, while inflationary printed cash goes to the govt.
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:46:58
�� 
All most every country in the world has a private central bank, all of whom don't have to listen to anyone from the government. And even if we pretend what you're saying is true, the public gets no say on whether to bail out corrupt bank a that have robbed the public to the tune of billions of dollars.
Inflation taxes all wealth. 
The reserve bank prints money and lends it to the government. 
The new money reduces the value of your money. The new money is in the government's wallet.
That's how it's a indiscriminate tax that doesn't serve a deliberate purpose opposed to income taxes etc which go into infrastructure.
Your thinking is simplistic and is far too precious about the banking system. Inflation is a tax on all wealth even that which is invested in productive venture.

That's the end goal. No point celebrating how much fiat my crypto is now worth, rather how much I can buy with it - next value proposition within crypto if for businesses to make it their preferential currency of trade.

I understand what you're saying. But that would be the third world's fault for not adopting BTC now - that's not a fault of the currency nor the protocol. If third world nations wanted to get in they could do so easily. 
In fact most 3rd nations are adopting BTC and will continue to do so considering with increased pace  as the incentive to leave draconian fiat systems is higher in these nations.
I mean a Greek or Venezuelan who's seen the financial system's full might and knows personally how destructive it is, is far more likely to earn, save and spend in BTC than an American or Brit who has no immediate reason to fear their financial system. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:25:13
Bitcoin is a way out of a great deal of duress for third world citizens:
Access to your money whenever you like.
Access to your money wherever you like.
Remittance tax is removed.
Remittance fees are drastically reduced.
Your money is immune to inflation.
Should you need to leave the country your money is easy to carry, store, hide and access.
Your money is free from the clutches of Govt.
In South Africa tax on money leaving the nation is 80% - that's not what their law says but it's what it imposed.
In Greece and Cyprus the government, banks and other institutions can seize funds from your bank without your permission.
In Greece you can only withdraw a nominal amount each day from your account. 
In Mozambique, Colombia, Venezuela and other nations that faced civil war large swathes of citizens had to 24hrs to leave thus abandoning their accounts.
In Mozambique and other places, the banks were seized and patrons lost all claim to their money.
All fiat systems have the power to do what any of these nations did. 
Honestly, stop clinging to your predatory and exploitative institutions. 
Income inequality is an economic fault not a financial one - hence you had economic inequality in bartering times and in gold's time. The third world is systemically oppressed by financial institutions and the like through the fiat system.

The banking system that has worked for "thousands of years" is different to what we employ now. 
Gold standard banking meant that the amount of money one had was directly proportional to what one could afford to buy. 
Abandoning the gold system means that earnings can soar without gaining any value. 
The Gold Standard guaranteed your value, the fiat currency is a façade of no integrity that can be reproduced at will. 
The use of fiat currency has allowed for US financial institutions to sell financial instruments that are worth 500 times more than the nation's GDP.
I can't make a $50 bet that I'll earn $5 - it not logical, and in a closed system of that comprises $10 a $50 bet shouldn't be possible, but it is thanks to the fact that I can print money freely. 
Don't believe that Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic, Venezuela, India, Argentina, Brazil, Greece and Cyprus's financial collapse was a once-off. 
Financial collapse is built into the fiat currency system. Collapse isn't a bug but a feature of deliberate design.

I never said India's economy collapsed, I said to look at what had happened there. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:23:36
If you held those notes and weren't able to change them in time (as many people couldn't) then you lost your wealth thanks to an action of the govt.
This control is granted exclusively by fiat money.
Even under the Gold Standard the govt could try decommission notes but it wouldn't matter because that note still had a gold value and as such would be traded regardless.
I never said that India's economy collapsed, I said don't think that what happened in India was a once off that couldn't happen again. 
The government dispossessed thousands of people by using their monopoly on the control of money to nullify their citizens' wealth.
No matter how you twist what happened is not alright.

Huh? What are you guys on about? Surely holding your keys on a Trezor or Ledger means they're not on an online service?

There's prominent mining groups in Johannesburg, Buenos Aires, several Chinese cities and New Delhi.
First world citizens will adopt Bitcoin the same way one adopts an iPhone.
Third world citizens will adopt Bitcoin the same way one adopts gunpowder.

Agreed. Loss in value to the citizenry will be remembered in times to come the same way we view feudalism.

Do you have a source for that?
Um ya you're argument sound nice but can you cite a reference? _SOURCE_ do you have a source ?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:34:49
Ugh. Those stats are way off and rightfully so, those stats are nearly impossible to track accurately but this is not the point.
The point is that **the government has the power to delete your money** through the fiat systems.
The point is that the Indian Govt and any world govt could at any moment for any reason delegitimise your wealth. 
How is this not getting through to you.

They decommissioned their two largest denomination notes only a few months ago.
