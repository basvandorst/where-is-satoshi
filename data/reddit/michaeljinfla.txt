That's like saying you stayed at a Holiday Inn last night.

I started late - November - and I didn't even buy a full coin, had some extra money I didn't mind losing.  I have almost one coin now plus ETH, LTC, XRP, IOTA, TRX and XVG.  I'll be at a full coin next week.  Never invest what you can't afford to lose.

I am having trouble buying Ripple using my gatehub wallet.  I think I am doing everything right but it keeps coming up with an error.  Any help or tutorial is appreciated.

As someone who stayed at a Holiday Inn, I disagree with the twizzlers.  Cheetos only.

Is that 10 BTC or 100 right now?

No one's going to ask?
What's "updog."

I must give you all my expert opinion.  Days and days of experience.  I believe it WILL go up or down now.

I hold a little litecoin, a little ethereum, and a little Ripple.   Very little of each.  How much should I hold of each.  AND is there another one out there I should get into now and HODL?
Thanks to this form for all the help.  Makes the confusing a little less so.

You obviously don't understand the economy.  Each dollar is backed by a percentage of trillions of dollars of debt!

I thought they were going to adopt RPX in January?  If they do, Ripple will have the same immediate growth.

Thousands IN bitcoin or Thousands OF bitcoin?  Huge difference but still F'ed up even for NY.

I'd feel good if I could go a day without checking.  Would be a lot less stress!

You can gradually increase your limits but it is dependent on what type of accounts you link it to.

I've been trying to figure out the same thing, but was looking at $22k.

He's absolutely right sell everything you own and buy more BTC!  I've got gold and silver in a safe that hasn't appreciated in years!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:55:28
Perfect.  I was able to get it done very quickly.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:11
The dip gave me an opportunity to buy just a little more BTC.  Thanks!

Awesome job!  That's what investments are for - to provide a better life for your family.  Not just hookers and blow!

Always invest only what you can afford to lose.  Plus, on most exchanges you can place a limit order to sell before it dips too low and you lose your original investment.

Ask the people of Greece if banks are safe.  Or Venezuela.

I keep waiting for Sean Penn to appear in the thread and fix it.  It is socialism - it is the very definition of socialism and it failed.
