A bloom filter, rather than txid truncation, is likely optimal for this purpose. 
If Bob is missing any transactions, he could potentially even request from peers just those transactions that would fill his missing filter-bits. If he's racing to build on the new block before having all transactions, the bloom filter also lets him know which transactions he can't safely include in his next-block until he's sure they're not in Alice's block.
*However,* either the 8-byte-prefixes *or* the bloom-filter might open the door to other kinds of miner gaming. 
Consider a miner Alice who creates two never-broadcasted transactions, and then wins a block that includes those transactions. Other miners may respect the block, and even build on the block, but never be able to reconstruct the full block – if Alice never shares those transactions. 
And yet, any other extant transaction that *might be* the hidden transactions – same 8-byte prefix or set-bits in the bloom filter – is risky for other miners to include in followup blocks. If Bob includes such transactions in a superficially-valid block... Alice might then reveal that it was already in her previously-established block, invalidating Bob's later 'win'. (While Alice keeps transactions secret, only she can confidently mine blocks containing transactions which collide with her secret set... and she can design the secret-set to collide with any transactions she chooses.)
Perhaps this could be addressed if miners only speculatively build on not-fully-understood blocks for a very brief time window, but more incentive/timing-modelling is necessary to be sure.

It may be the case that miners can observe enough suspiciousness to deter strategic secrecy; I am generally optimistic that such things get worked out. But since there are new states to the game, it needs a deeper look. 
Looking back, I see that I was grossly overestimating how easy it would be for Alice to create certain kinds of confusion, like matched prefixes. Still, even a single missing transaction puts Bob and others into a dilemma, because they likely have short-term profitable strategies (try mining a runt on the partially-unknown block) that also reward Alice's secrecy advantage (while she's the only miner with full knowledge). The behaviors that arise could be more complicated than the 'never trust' or 'speculatively trust for only N seconds' kinds of simple policies you've suggested.

But consider instead, what if the ecosystem were hardened for 'fork-tolerance'? 
What if exchanges and custodial wallets committed to the idea (with policy and software and UI) that in the event of any shared-history forks, customers retain the right to control what happens to their balances on both sides?
What if major full-node clients were able to track multiple chains simultaneously? (Perhaps, offering to fallback to a lower-resource lurking SPV mode on secondary-chains-that-might-die-but-you-still-want-to-keep-an-eye-on?) 
What if the fork was preceded with an official technique for cross-chain atomic transactions, such that the client could deterministically report on the de-facto exchange rates between sibling chains? And maybe even interchange units via anonymous P2P transactions? ("You currently hold 10 BTC &amp; 10 BTX. Press here to convert to 15 BTC &amp; 0 BTX. Press here to convert to 0 BTC &amp; 20 BTX.")
Every holder of ur-Bitcoins would then have an understandable portfolio of coins in the offspring chains. While many have speculated that the sum value of the different coins "must" be less than that of a unified coin, if the two coins better specialize for different uses, and both persist indefinitely, their combined value could appreciate beyond the value of a unified coin. Preparation and flexibility in software (and thought) could make that happy outcome more likely.

But many miners *will* build on Alice's block, even without all the transactions, because (afaict) that's likely to be the profit-maximizing strategy. They just can't risk including colliding transactions – a set defined by Alice. 
But more generally, by withholding a few transactions, Alice can *simulate* exactly the same issues that can exist with large, slow-to-propagate blocks. If the problem with large blocks is that certain centralized players are advantaged, I'm not sure this truncation (or bloom-filtering) proposal really helps... because those same players can make these new abbreviated-blocks spend an arbitrary amount of time in that advantageous partially-propagated state.
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:30:04
Waiting until it's fully-validated also gives Alice an advantage, if she's withholding some private transaction details. All other miners are waiting for those details, "expected any second now", but which only come when Alice decides to release them. 
So under the policy you propose – continuing to mine on the older block, because the new block isn't yet trusted – only Alice is mining on her newest block, because only she knows for sure that it's valid, and she chooses exactly when to let others catch up. And yes, she can also design the withheld-set to maximize the confusion/prefix-collisions/bitfield-collisions that others must analyze. 
Meanwhile, if such not-yet-fully-understood blocks are *usually* valid, because they're often the result of blameless different pending-txn perspectives, then the moralizing policy of "should never trust" will fall to the self-interest of: start building on this ASAP, rather risk wasting work on a born-loser competitive-sibling block. 
It's a new mechanism for propagation gaming, and so needs more careful modeling...

The *microbitcoin* (aka µBTC or 100 satoshis) is a good-sized unit, but an awful name. Unfortunately 'bits' isn't much better.
We should make up a distinct name; I've proposed 'zib' for this unit. It's based on the ideas that:
* microbitcoin (µBTC, 100 satoshis) is a good-sized unit but awful name/abbreviation
* 'bit' is nice phonetically, but has too many confusing collisions
* a contrived but intentionally-similar word like 'zib' can yield most of the benefits of 'bit', without the negatives
* 'zib' can surpass 'bit' in a number of dimensions, including but not limited to...
    * distinctive abbreviation: 'Z' or unicode Z-with-slash, 'Ƶ'
    * more usable as an action verb: "Please zib me 10,000"
    * friendly to the upwards SI prefixes: "1 bitcoin is 1 megazib" makes sense, "1 bitcoin is 1 megabit" fuzzes my brain (and maybe yours too) because of all the other extant uses of 'megabit'
I don't expect a rapid groundswell of support, or official endorsement, as the need is not yet acute, and that's not necessarily how practical language evolves.
I do hope that more people become aware of the 'zib' coinage as an available option, so that as other terms are tried and run into problems, 'zib' is remembered and considered as a potential solution.

First, several things have already been suggested for "bits": mBTC, µBTC, even (occasionally) satoshis. There's no one likely to clearly win. 
But also, 'bitcoins' itself is sometimes casually shortened to 'bits', as in 'millibits' or 'microbits'. 
Any, if 100 satoshi is a 'bit', then the most natural meaning of the compound word "bit-coin" is "a coin of 100 satoshi"... when in fact "bitcoin" already has a widespread, hard-to-change denominational meaning of a value a million times more. 
'bit' is catchy and of the right length, but fighting all those conflicting meanings (and more related to the 'bits' of software and info-science) if trying to be *the* definitive name for a most-commonly-used unit. 
'zib' was the result of a search for a nonsense word, free to accept new meaning, that had most of the benefits of 'bit', without the semantic conflicts. 'Zib' can mean 'µBTC' and nothing but 'µBTC', by gradual non-conflicting use, while other proposed terms require displacing other uses...

The bigger problem is that indivisible binary-digit 'bits' are important to understand in relation to Bitcoin's implementation and security. Satoshi counts are stored as 64-bit integers; there are 160-bit hashes all over; there are 256-bit encryption keys. 
256 bits is a reasonable amount of ECC security... but 256 bits is a trifling amount of value. 
64 bits is no money at all, but 64 bits stores more than the total number of satoshis than will ever exist. 
A millibit (already often used as an abbreviation for millibitcoin, 1/1000th of a bitcoin) would be the same value as a kilobit (1000 bits). 
Yes, people can work it out, but it's an extra speed-bump on understanding and clarity. OK, colloquially... but problematic pedagogically.

Metric prefixes are easy and logical for the mathematically-inclined, who are early Bitcoin adopters and overrepresented in online forums like this, sure. But not for the great masses of other people, who have a more tangible, non-numerical understanding of amounts. 
As just one example of how even dollars &amp; cents can confuse people, the "Verizon Math" episode is pretty funny:
These are customer-support people, and their managers, who deal with billing issues every day. Yet the shift of units and decimal-places from dollars-to-cents and vice-versa causes a mental-lockup. Engineers, scientists, and accountants/businesspeople are precise with decimal-shifts and multiple-related-alternately-prefixed-units – plenty of other people aren't, and may never be.

Eligius has always been accepting of low-fee transactions ( and non-standard transactions (apparently it was Eligius that mined the 2,609 in MtGox losses from malformed transactions a few years ago). So it's probably just a formalization of that offering. 
I would have expected all the major mining pools to offer guaranteed/no-fee transaction-processing to major exchanges, just as mutually-beneficial favors. "Hey, you create/distribute a lot of Bitcoins; we help people liquidate as necessary... let's make each others' lives a little easier." Apparently, though, that isn't common. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 04:41:27
It's a great idea to prefer much smaller units. It avoids long-decimals with lots of leading-zeros and makes most transactions deal with whole round numbers.
The microbitcoin, 100 satoshis, works really well as the *size* of such a new unit. It turns satoshis into 'cents', ensuring there will (probably) never be more than 2 digits after the decimal point in common usage. It makes everyday transactional values be round thousands of units – not super-familiar to the dollar/euro world, but proven workable in other cultures. 
But, 'microbitcoin' and all the µ/mu/micro words for this unit have problems. They're said in conflicting ways and easily confused (especially as abbreviations) with the 1000x different m/millis units. 
So people have looked for a new word. 
'Bits' sticks out as a familiar option – it's right there in the word _Bit_coin – so many have latched onto it, as a cute and breezy word that could work.
But, using 'bit' as the name has a ton of problems. It conflicts with the quite-different 'bits' of binary math – that give Bitcoin all its desirable security and efficiency properties. 'Bit' brings with it the same implication of 'trifling almost-ignorable size' as does 'micro'. As a unit, it is confusable with 'bit-coin' itself (a much larger amount), and with words already seeing some use (like 'millibits'). The abbreviations for 'bit' are essentially the same as those for 'bitcoin', ensuring more confusion when amounts are written compactly. 
Personally I think the safest course is to make-up a word as a new synonym for 'microbitcoin', that's just as short as 'bit' but without meaning/abbreviation collisions. A made-up word can be very unique in sound and symbol. 
I've proposed 'zib'. 
    0.001      BTC = 1000    µBTC = 1000    zib = Ƶ1000    = 100,000 satoshis
    0.000001   BTC =    1    µBTC =    1    zib =    Ƶ1    =     100 satoshis
    0.00000001 BTC =    0.01 µBTC =    0.01 zib =    Ƶ0.01 =       1 satoshi
You can think of ZIB as standing for "Zib Is Bitcoin" – it's just a different unit. Currencies usually have multiple synonyms for units, and subunits that sound completely different from the main unit – the varied sounds help clearly communicate shades of meaning for different needs. For example:
    dollars/bucks - bits (1/8ths) - dimes (1/10ths) - cents (1/100ths)
    pounds/quid - shillings (1/20ths) - pence (1/100th; formerly 1/240th)
    yuan/kuai - jiao (1/10ths) - fen (1/100ths)
I propose Bitcoin usage try:
    bitcoins/coins/BTC - µBTC/mics/zib (1/1,000,000th) - satoshi (1/100,000,000th)

There are a couple of distant relations from 'zib' to 'bit' and 'bitcoin': it's a similar word to 'bit' in size and sound; 'ZIB' can be thought of as standing for "ZIB Is Bitcoin".
Most of the problems with 'bit' (as µBTC) are that it's *too* closely related to 'bit-coin', leading to conflicts with existing usages, including other bitcoin-unit definitions for 'bit' that already 'won' prior discussion threads. 
A contrived word like 'zib' has the best chance of achieving unambiguous usage, by incremental adoption. (Something like 'bit' requires people to drop existing usages, all at once, or else conflicting usages constantly require re-clarification.)
I don't expect mass adoption of 'zib' on any rapid schedule. I expect people to try 'bit', and get frustrated with the extra confusion it causes, or extra explanation it requires. (This will be an especially large problem in software interfaces.) 
Then it will be more clear that a new word is needed, and 'zib' will be available, clearly defined as one thing in one place. People may even find it better than 'bit' in some ways – offering the unicode character 'Ƶ' (Z-with-stroke) as a compact currency-like abbreviation, and saving more syllables in slang usage by being more verb-able to mean both the amount and the network-send. ("Can you zib me 5,000 for the cocktail?")
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:05:11
The microbitcoin-sized unit (whether it's called a zib, ubit, bit, or whatever) has plenty of room for Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin would have to go up in price more than 2,000x for the microbitcoin to reach parity with the US dollar (and the satoshi with the cent). 
If that happens, microbitcoin-sized units will still work... and the system might start looking into introducing sub-satoshi divisibility. But adopting new terms for such a changed world would be OK at that time. We'd probably know who Satoshi is, because he'd own all of North America, and might name the new 1-millionth-of-a-satoshi after his real name.

Back in January, the idea of defining 'bit' as 'millibitcoin' narrowly won a poll on Bitcointalk, leading some to describe that as a new 'official' definition:
But now 3 months later, 'bit' should mean 'microbitcoin', something 1000 times less? 
Also, some people are already using 'millibits' to mean 'millibitcoins', and 'microbits' (or 'eubits') for 'microbitcoins'. 
If now starting to use 'bit' to mean 'microbitcoin', then 'millibit' (1/1000th a bitcoin) and 'kilobit' (1000x a 'bit') will be referring to *the same thing*. Also, 'bit' and 'microbit' refer to *the same thing*. Also, 'microbit' can potentially mean two different things, one millionth of a bitcoin (used now), and one millionth of 100 satoshi (currently not representable in the protocol but possibly useful in the future). 
If 'bit' means 100 satoshi, then "bit-coin" would naturally mean a "100 satoshi coin". But of course "bitcoin" already means 100,000,000 satoshis. The meaning by natural-composition, and the meaning with this new term, differ by a factor of 1 million. 
For computery people, 'bit' has a strong meaning of 'indivisibility', and fits into larger groupings of 8/16/32/64. Adding a new 'bit' idea, into a system where the classic meaning is very important (Bitcoin cryptocurrency), where the new bit is divisible-by-100 and grouped-into-millions, is a recipe for nonstop confusion. Some examples:
"Next, we'll want to import this 256-bit private key you got as a gift."
"Only 256 bits! It should have thousands of bits in it!"
"In the world of computers, there are 8 bits to a byte."
"Then why does my wallet take up so many megabytes? It's got 80,000 bits in it... shouldn't that just be 10,000 bytes?"
"This movie is too expensive, but I've got 2 megabits at home."
"Do you mean we should download it over your 2 megabit connection or you have 2 megabits of Bitcoins?"

Another word for microbitcoin/100-satoshi, that doesn't overlap with the base-2 'binary-digit' *bits* that Bitcoin is named after.
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:22:24
You might like the idea of a 100-satoshi/microbitcoin unit size. You might also prefer a short one-syllable word like 'bit'. But still, you might find 'bit' a tad confusing, because of its overlap with the natural abbreviation of 'bitcoin' and other important nearby concepts (like the indivisible 'binary digit' of computer science). And, just 'b' as an abbreviation is fragile in usual currency contexts (prone to misinterpretation). 
So, you'd want a word that's a lot like 'bit' in size and sound, but sufficiently distinct for precision. 
The made-up word 'zib' works well. It's just as short and similar in sound. (It drops in sonically/linguistically everywhere 'bit' also works well.) A plain 'Z' is more distinct as an abbreviation, *and* there's a unicode Z-with-stroke, 'Ƶ', that works a lot like a '$' or other stroked-currency symbols. 
So if you like a lot about 'bit', but just not exactly 'bit', consider using 'zib' instead. It's available and helpful.

Trust markets to suss things out! 
Each deep-pocketed loser knows their bid, so knows the winning bids are higher. 
They're each likely to accumulate on the market, at least up through their own bid price, expecting a pop when/if the winning price is revealed or deduced. 
So, there's a good chance the highest losing bid is just below the range Bitcoin has been trading for the last 24 hours ($640-$660). The winning bids will be anywhere from that range to significantly higher... but will only be a lot higher if the winner massively miscalculated. 
Wild speculation: the winning bidder put in bids for the lots ranging from 650 to 800. 
Notably, the announced process, at least as described on the public page at  may not have been completely clear about what should happen if a winner won multiple bids (to consume their deposit), but then was reluctant to close on them all. (For example, what if the winner of all 10 lots came back and said, "I just want the 5 on which I bid the least"?) Time to clarify that – and have the winner perhaps rustle up more wirable funds – might have caused the delay in official announcements yesterday.

Bitcoin ATMs are at best a transitional technology, for shoehorning the new into old forms. 
In that way, they're a bit like those old acoustic modems, for doing computer networking over voice lines. Sure, they're better than nothing. But as soon as possible, you go all-digital, skipping the weird adapters. 
If Bitcoin becomes widely accepted by merchants, every cash register is a "cash back" ATM. (Like with debit-card purchases, just overpay the merchant, getting paper cash back.)
And barring draconian enforcement against individuals, everyone with a little extra BTC they can send from their phone is a potential dispenser of small amounts of BTC for cash. 
That makes me think the true "ATM"-like role will be  filled in a far more distributed way, via mutual location-aware matching apps, rather than via heavyweight fixed-location physical devices.

So someone who has 49% mining power against a 51% cartel is... still excluded, right? I thought so. 
And when the person without mining power – without a tomato farm – wants to send off their transaction for free, but the going rate (as sensed by the planned reference-client transaction-fees estimation system) is much higher, they are excluded from having their transaction complete for... hours? Days? Weeks? Years? 
Yes, I thought so. 
Miners are able to charge for their services, so they're (slightly) more like tomato farms than lighthouses, and your comprehension of Bitcoin is warped.

From my quick scan of the stratum protocol, it still looks like the pool server dictates the range that the miner is supposed to muck with – so could push parameters out that would cause an honest miner to quickly find a known solution.

Anyone who's confused can see it all cleared up in my explainer, *[The powerful 'bits' of Bitcoin!](
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:00:06
My hunch is that a term that has multiple pronunciations, or that needs a separate spelling ("you-bits") to clarify pronunciation (that it's not either "uh-bits" or "myu-bits" or "moo-bits") will be harder to bootstrap into wide and consistent use. 
I also think any reliance on the µ-as-"micro" meaning bring problems, because the "micro-" metric prefix is less familiar to people, means "so-small-you-can-ignore", and is sometimes confused via the "m" with "milli-". 
For those reasons, and others, I think a made-up word that's like "bit" but without its other problems works best... my proposal is 'zib' as a synonym for µBTC, but some other one-syllable available word could work, too.

@_date: 2014-04-26 22:14:39
Yes, 'millibitcoins', 'microbitcoins', and long-decimals are all a mess. A slang term that's easy to say, easy to abbreviate for the 100-satoshi-sized unit is the answer. My proposal is the made-up word 'zib', with supporting materials at zibcoin.org. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:49:28
I'd say, give it time. Most people aren't dealing with the awkwardness of "millibitcoins"/mBTC and "microbitcoins"/µBTC in normal usage yet. Only when they do will they consider other options, and 'zib' will be a well-documented option to try.
There isn't any singular authority for bitcoin standards. The reference client (bitcoin-core) team of course has the most influence, and de facto standards-setting power, but moves gradually except in cases of emergency or overwhelming consensus. 
They recently considered the issue of possibly-defaulting the client to "µBTC" units. There was a lot of support, because of the problems with decimalized BTC values, but not sufficient consensus to make a change at this time. (Some thought mBTC better, others noted the dev team doesn't have expertise on such usability/terminology issues.)
Looking at those discussions, and realizing it would take a while to converge on any plan, and all existing proposals had problems, is what motivated the zibcoin/zib/Z units proposal. 
People can just start using these terms in their own discussions and projects, and that'll both test them out, and promote their utility. As more people see it, it'll either catch on or not, making the decision of more conservative projects to add it easier. It doesn't require a quick definitive decision (or groundswell), just availability and attractiveness over time. 
There's also a thread at bitcointalk that promotes the zibcoin/zib/Z units idea in the style of a fly-by-night altcoin:

Surveying the full network about a transaction isn't that useful when it's what the subset of *miners* do that matters, when choosing what goes in their blocks. 
I expect major pools to someday offer visibility into their pending transactions, and perhaps even out-of-band ways to ensure a certain transaction is preferred. When 90% of the hashpower has reliably promised that your transaction-of-interest will trump any others using the same inputs, you've got 90%+++ chance of immunity from even intentional double-spends.

Try changing any other character, or changing the last character more significantly. 
I have a hunch that if there's any checksumming happening at all (maybe there isn't), there's a last bit (or few) of the printable address that's "slop" outside the checksumming. That could mean there's a little "wiggle room" at the end where two of these printable Base58 representations are really of the same hash, and thus "the same" as far as Bitcoin is concerned. 
It's a little harder to think about Base58, because it's not a base that's an even-power-of-two, but let's think instead of the perhaps-analogous situation of representing one byte (8 bits in base-2) in Base32.
Base32 fits 5 bits into one printable character. So if you wanted to represent byte 0 (0b00000000) in Base32, you'd have one character for 00000 (first 5 bits) and then one character for 000xx (last 3 necessary bits and 2 extra bits). 
Usually, canonically, you'd set those slop bits to 00 as well, and the (RFC4648) Base32 representation would just be "AA". But what if you set them to 01, 10, or 11? Then the representation could be "AB", "AC", or "AD". However, in each case, if you're only pulling out full 8-bit bytes on the other side, the one full byte you get in all cases is still "0b00000000". 
if changing one of the middle characters gets you the expected validation error, but changing the last character by just one symbol does not, the same thing is likely happening here. If the checksum is overlooking the difference, a raw send will be oblivious to the difference as well - no risk of Bitcoin loss at the protocol level. (But, other systems built atop Bitcoin might be using the Base58 addresses as keys and get confused.)
@_date: 2014-03-20 08:57:40
I agree moving ASAP to a microbitcoin-sized unit (just under another name) would be best... but the recent discussion on the core-dev list on a similar issue didn't reach consensus around µBTC. Some devs are happy with an era of mBTC, because they've just nudged their users that way, and think it's working alright, and think another transition won't be too bad if/when ever necessary. 
As a North American, I don't say the letter 'Z' as 'zed', but I can imagine saying either 'zee' or 'zed' as a verb, as in "I'll zee you 10,000" or "I'll zed you 10,000". Do Z=zed speakers find that usage plausible, or unnatural? 
I know it's an uphill battle; these comments and the essay/website/threads are putting the option out there for consideration, along with some demos of use and rationales for why it could work well. People hitting problems with 'microbitcoin'/µBTC/'bits'/'mics' will think about it and maybe try it, especially if there's a place they can link to that explains it. Language (and especially English) is funny, there's no final authority other than usage, and decentralized open-source projects are similar. The best test is just to be bold and try, and see what sticks.

Can you be more specific about what you mean by that kind of soft-fork? 
AFAICT, if older software doesn't understand new transactions, it will reject blocks with them, and continue issuing old-style blocks among similarly non-updated software, resulting in a blockchain fork. Only upgrading their software to match the majority would discard this runt chain, and rejoin the updated majority. And I thought that was the very definition of a 'hard fork', a transition where those who don't upgrade are left behind. 
Do I have the soft/hard distinction wrong?

'Toshi' is problematic for the microbitcoin (100 satoshi) unit. You usually don't multiply a value by 100 by dropping a leading syllable like 'sa' (satoshi to toshi). Also casual shortened names, dropping leading or trailing syllables, very commonly refer to the *same* thing:A burger is also a hamburger; a 'brella is an umbrella, etc.
The case for promoting a new microbitcoin unit would also make satoshis, and only satoshis, the 'cents' - no value would ever have more than the two-digits-after-the-decimal that's very common with traditional currencies.

@_date: 2014-03-19 06:09:01
Lots of problems with 'bits'. I listed some here:
To reiterate a few of the major problems:
"Bit" has been alternately proposed to mean mBTC or µBTC, with no clear winner yet (or likely). 
People already tend to casually truncate "Bitcoin" to "Bit", especially when prepending metric/SI prefixes, as in "millibit" or "microbit". You've then got multiple things all going by "bit", or some people using "bit" and "microbit" for the same thing. 
There really isn't any precedent for a system where "bit" would mean one thing, and appending "-coin" to it ("bit-coin") would mean 1 million times more of it. 
But mostly:
"Bit" already has a strong meaning in this very Bitcoin context - the "bits" of computers and information science. They're the digits of the hashes or transaction IDs. They fit 8 to a byte, not 1 million to a "bitcoin". They are a base unit of information, not further divisible into 100 satoshi. 
To a crypto/Bitcoin programmer, "9700 bits" would be how you represent a number up to 2^9700, or describe the per-second throughput of a rather slow link (9.7kbps), or measure other forms of information/entropy.
Repurposing words across contrasting contexts works OK... overloading them in closely-related contexts means you're fighting activated-meanings, increasing confusion.

I'm sorry, you may want to explain your question more clearly, then. Or perhaps read more closely, without presuming any answers?
To summarize in slightly different words, the answer was (1) exploration projects of new bitcoin-related possibilities are productive; (2) to whatever extent bitcoin is adopted, it serves the same good-project-enabling function as traditional monies – and a little more (or else people would keep using the traditional monies); (3) there are some people who have reservations about traditional money, and whether that's rational or not, for them bitcoin motivates production and commerce moreso than alternatives.

It's a joke combining the exhortations to "HODL!" ("hold!") with the concept of "proof-of-solvency" (where an exchange/wallet service proves it has enough BTC for all its customer balances).

I suspect pools would adapt. The work-assignment process could be adjusted to make it easier to catch cheaters. With enough core/community support, the process could even be changed to make withholding attacks impossible... though I wouldn't bet on that given a general suspicion of pools. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:29:36
That's an interesting idea. I can't quite imagine the exact sequence of bugs/errors that could result in total loss unnoticed over a long period. But, bugs are by their very nature surprising, and combined with the apparent carelessness of Mt.Gox in other QA/accounting matters, who knows?
But another variant of this theory could be: they think they've lost massive amounts, but they've just lost track of the mutated transactions... and the amounts are still in the blockchain, if they haven't discarded (or casually compromised) the keymatter. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:08:55

I don't think BitPay has any agenda other than, as has said, that they think the microbitcoin/100-satoshi size unit is ideal for representation and Bitcoin adoption, and they're considering the name 'bits'. 
It could be a mixed impact for companies with 'bit' in their name, if 'bit' enters the popular economic mind to mean exactly "100 satoshi". After all, that 'bit' is currently worth less than 1/20th of a cent. If bitcoin appreciates in value 200x, to USD$100K per bitcoin, a 'bit' will still be worth less than a dime. 
So to the extent people understand 'bit', intuitively as a tangible value, it will mean 'less-than-a-penny' or (maybe someday) 'dime'. A company whose name means 'penny-pay' or 'dime-pay' sounds like a vending machine company, or micropayments-only company, or purveyor of only cheap things, which isn't really the image most payment-companies shoot for.

Yes, that's one of the problems with bootstrapping 'bit' to mean a specific new value; it makes a bunch of existing words read funny. Some 'bits' advocates are also pushing the idea that the '-coin' suffix can mean "times-a-million", almost like the 'mega-' metric prefix. Maybe – that's also a little weird. Using the metric terms is unambiguous but a mouthful, which is why making up an new precise term (with easy/unambiguous abbreviations) could be such a win.

People said the much same thing about whether anyone would adopt a random binary-math currency from some random anonymous programmer. 
We're living in a special era of change where novel concepts and words are needed faster than ever before, and can spread from anywhere. 
It's kind of a rookie naming mistake to jump onto the most obvious thing, like 'bit', or think familiarity dominates all other concerns – concerns like clarity, or avoiding negative conflicts with a word's other connotations.
But in fact multiple words can circulate, and as people see words in different contexts over time, the right ones will see use in the right situations. There's a bunch of places, like explaining the science that backs Bitcoin, where reusing 'bits'-to-mean-100-satoshis is really, really bad. Zib/Ƶ might be mainly used there, among the technically-astute who still need a better word that 'microbitcoin' (and all its derivatives).
Zib/Ƶ might stay in that subcommunity, or possibly spread outward because of the more compact &amp; unambiguous abbreviations it offers. Eventually the cachet of using the "new, precise" word might make it seem like the cool choice in a wider group. ('Bits' sounds diminutive, common, imprecise, discardable.)
It's hard to say – these things take a long time, and are determined by the real usage and utility of words rather than any poll or impatient "forum logic". It's an experiment like Bitcoin itself!

Many here and elsewhere have testified that friends' interest in Bitcoin subsides when they realize the cost of "one whole bitcoin" is hundreds of dollars. It's not rational, but it fits with approximate, folk understandings of money that are very common. 
Similarly, it's much easier for people to communicate (and remember) the difference between 1,000 and 10,000 than 0.001 and 0.0001. They tend to lose track of those places-to-the-left of the decimal point, but intuitively understand round, countable values in large groupings ("thousands" rather than "ten-thousandths"). 
And, there are people for whom the dollars/cents transition is hard, even though they deal with these units every day. (The classic example is "Verizon math":  )
You might be right that for now, and quite a while, these people aren't crucial to the success of Bitcoin. They have so much more to learn, and if they don't, they'll be reliant on other rules-of-thumb and simplifications that haven't been figured out yet. 
I tend to think it's never too early to make things easier for people with different, more auditory/kinesthetic and non-mathematical ways of understanding the world.

Agreed that 'microbitcoin' or 'micro-btc' or 'uBTC' or 'eubits' are all problematic.
'Bit' is also problematic, though. 'Bit' has a colloquial/archaic meaning in the US as 1/8th a dollar. (as in, "Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar" = "25¢, 50¢, 75¢, $1")
'Bit' also already has a strong meaning in the context of bitcoin: the bits of the binary representation underneath the protocol. And as a proper prefix of 'Bitcoin', 'bit' will often be assumed to be an abbreviation. If 'Bit' = 100 satoshi in familiar meaning, then the literal meaning of 'bit-coin' would be a coin of 100 satoshi... not 1,000,000 bits (that would be a mega-bit, literally, per the SI 'mega-' prefix) or 100,000,000 satoshi. 
Also, 'bit' brings with it the connotations from information-science of being 'the most basic unit' (which, if 100 satoshi, a uBTC 'bit' wouldn't be), and from computer-practice the idea it's 1/8th of some other significant unit (which a uBTC 'bit' isn't either). 
In a far-enough domain, all these mixed connotations wouldn't be a problem... the word would just have a different meaning contextually. But all these other conflicting meanings are very, very close to the money/info-science/computing domain of Bitcoin itself. Reusing 'bit' for another unit in the system is a recipe for mucho user confusion, possibly of the money-losing type. 
I'm convinced the '100 satoshi' unit is the right one for handling decimal-place and human-folk-calculation purposes... but some colloquial name other than 'uBTC', 'micro-bitcoin', or 'bit' will have to be devised and win organic acceptance...

Cryptocurrencies and the rising importance of crypto security for average folks means more people than ever will need to understand indivisible computer 'bits'. Mixing those fundamental units with tiny-currency-values splittable-into-100-subunits just makes every discussion, with learners and people fuzzy on the concepts, that much harder. It's an unnecessary speed bump. 
An easy fix is to have another word for the 100-satoshi 'bits' that can be used when you want to be clear. Sure, people can use 'bits' a lot when the distinction isn't important. But when it is, you want a distinct word.

Hey! I wrote that post!
The longer proposal is at "Ƶibcoin: Your New Favorite Altcoin" - 
I don't think zibcoin/zib necessarily makes the whole bitcoin system easier for newcomers to understand, on first explanation. In fact, it adds another thing to remember, 1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 zib. 
But, it makes everyday values ($1-$100) easier to talk about in whole numbers – instead of tenths/one-hundredths/one-thousandths of a bitcoin. Examples of real commerce values won't appear in the "point-oh-oh" world of trifling fractions that many people habitually disregard.
So after the one extra thing to learn, the big round numbers are easy to mentally tally, and the "zib" term easy-breezy (compared to "microbitcoin")... making the whole system seem a little less alien.

You've seen or heard people talking about "millibits" (for mBTC), right? During the period of bootstrapping "bits", what people have been calling "millibits", and what are now "kilobits", will be the same unit... but in standard SI "milli-"something and "kilo-"something are a million times different. 
Also, what do you think of the risk that if "bit" is freshly defined as "100 satoshi", then "bit-coin" would naturally read to most people as "100 satoshi coin"? So some of these mass-adopters will say, "I'll send you 100 bit-coins" intending 10000 satoshi... but others still read that as classic bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:30:35
Yes, but "bit" already means "binary digit" inside the "Bit-coin" system. (That's what Satoshi named it after!) So it's not like reusing a word that's clearly different in some totally-separate field... "bit" is already a crucial part of Bitcoin's architecture in its computery-meaning.

Even if he's not intending to rip you off, you don't want to deceptively report someone else's unreported income as your own - likely a sign of money laundering or at the very least tax evasion. Nor do you want to be in the unlicensed money-transmitter/currency-exchanger business. 
If the USD can be transferred to your account, and you can transfer USD to his account... why can't the initial transfer just go to his account? He should find a Bitcoin buyer/exchange that can do the direct USD transfer, to his account, rather than routing it through you.

Bitcoin-QT (the official Bitcoin Core full-node wallet) offers coin-control starting with version 0.9. (It has to be turned on in settings.)
From a quick look (but no serious use), it seemed easier than I would have expected. It shows the addresses at which you've received coins, which can be expanded to show available 'outputs' with amounts, and already-associated change addresses (from prior spends). You can also specify your own change address, if desired. 
I didn't see a way to group addresses into disjoint sets thst never mix (if allowing auto-selection).

It's a good sign on the steady road to broader awareness and wider Bitcoin holdings – but don't expect a big bang in the price, for a number of reasons:
(1) It's been known to be in the works for a while, so its expected benefits are already largely priced into going Bitcoin rates.
(2) People already aware of and bullish on Bitcoin, and holding a desired amount of Bitcoin, may use the ETF to rotate their existing holdings into a brokerage/retirement account - for example, for tax benefits. So the 'sell' and 'buy' pressures will be balanced. 
Just view it as a new, easier way to have savers/investors mix Bitcoin into their portfolio, incrementally making Bitcoin thinkable to more people as they hear about it, watch it, and finally decide to move. Another stair step, not a new rocket-ship. 
As a cautionary factor, though, recall that the Winklevosses are most famous for claiming to have been taken advantage of by their 4-person startup's sole contract "tech guy". Will they choose a better "tech guy" this time?

"256 bits?!? It should have hundreds of thousands of bits in it!"
"My new smartphone has a 64-bit processor!"
"It only cost 64 bits?"

"So my wallet with 80,000 bits in it has 10,000 bytes? Cool!"

Make up a word, like 'zib', and it works well, like how it works for Doge. With 'bit', it's hard to adopt.

I don't see how that follows. Assume a protocol where miners only work on time-ticks and ranges (perhaps very large, tens-of-seconds or multiple-minutes ranges) that they are told to by the pool. 
The pool is still sending small, occasional job-instructions. The miners are still running open-source software that implements a published protocol. But the pool can choose to sometimes send out "charmed" jobs (once they've got one real solution) that would lead any honest miner to the same, already-known-to-the-pool, real solution. 
These might look a little older than other jobs... so a pool sending such tests would do well to dictate, but also jitter, other job times as well. A bad-faith miner running many redundant participants could detect the test, if it's repeated to many miners... but at first it looks like the discovery they're trying to suppress, so any lag in returning the 'win' may hint at their bad-faith. Also, the pool could ration/allocate/lag the tests, for maximum probing efficiency. 
No closed-source or giant bandwidth required.

"Now we'll import your paper-wallet 256-bit private key."
"Huh? My key should have 100,000.00 bits in it!"
"I'm holding in my hand a one bitcoin paper wallet."
"Hmm, one 'bit' is 100 satoshi, so is your one-bit-coin worth 100 satoshi?"
"For computers, each byte is 8 bits, and 1 kilobyte is 1000 bytes."
"Great! My 80,000.00 bit wallet should fit into 10 kilobytes, then!"
Each of these is relatively minor... but will keep coming up whenever people scratch just a little below the surface. While few people *need* to know the internals, the ecosystem *will* need a constant stream of people graduating from being a casual user to being Bitcoin/crypto/comuter-literate... and redefining the 'Bit' (binary-digit that Satoshi named the whole system after) as something else just puts extra speed-bumps in front of people trying to learn.

In Microsoft, the 'micro' refers to 'microcomputer', which was a positive connotation in context (compared to giant computers). Tiny isn't positive for money. 
Right, 'µ'/'u' *should* be used, but 'm' is a constant attractor-of-errors. Even those familiar with millis (as in millimeters or milliliters) encounter micro less often, and in techie contexts (microorganisms/microscopes/microwaves) where the literal magnitude (millionths) isn't central to the meaning... but the idea of tiny/invisible is. 
It looks to me that millibit/mBTC is getting fair uptake among early-adopters, with some people acclimating to it, and could work OK for a while... it's the next wave of less-techie people trying to adapt that I'm more worried about. And also those already acclimating to mBTC later trying to change to an even smaller unit, 'micros', that's easily confused with 'm' BTC. 
Right - 'dollar' isn't verbed. But this is a chance for a term that does *better* in useful ways that traditional terms. Bitcoin is both a unit and a transfer technology, so a one-syllable action-verb that captures both would be powerful. (It's helped PayPal that people say "paypal me the money", and Skype that people say "skype me", etc. You can *almost* use "bitcoin" that way, but the the starting/ending sounds aren't quite right for action-verb use. "Zib" or even just "zee" are more like send/say, and easily fall into that active role.)
This is the first you've heard of it because the public proposal is less than 48 hours old, and 'zib' is a made-up word to serve a specific purpose! It takes a long time for new terms to be tried and spread, and to truly evaluate how well it works, and how memorable/natural it might be after a few encounters. It might only start to appear relatively beneficial after people wrestle with millis/micros confusion for a while.

Then where do the extra bitcoins for miners come from? 
There are no 'digits of precision' to satoshi: they are an integer count. Digits of precision are sugar in the interface: the math and the network only deal with integer counts of satoshis.
By the bitcoin "constitution" (initial system design), there will be 2,100,000,000,000,000 (2.1 quintillion) satoshi in total. 
(a) If I control X satoshi before your fork, how many will I have afterward? (b) How many total satoshi will ever be in existence after your fork?
If the answers aren't exactly – (a) still X; (b) 2.1 quintillion – then your proposed fork breaks a couple of the key sources of perceived value in the system, so any claims about the value after the fork are crazy-speculative.

OK, you are confident people will learn and become handy with milli/micro, and adjust their senses of magnitude... whereas I see evidence that these lessons are barriers to initial adoption  – and a bunch of other people are testifying to that as well, as seen when these topics keep recurring. You're relying a lot on context, which can be fragile, especially among people just starting to understand a new domain. 
People drop the "per second" from internet speeds just like you've dropped the "coin" from "millibits"... but 'megabit' (and 'gigabit') are already out there in common use. 'Millibit' and 'microbit' are going to seem trifling in comparison... which deters initial interest in starter amounts. 
I do agree 'bitcoin', 'millibitcoin', and 'microbitcoin' will always get wide usage as full and precise formal terms, because they're clear and logical for those with math/science/engineering mindsets. And, some will drop the 'coin' for 'millibits' and 'microbits'. It's just for all the folks for whom those terms, and factors-of-1000, aren't already familiar or easy to learn, that we'll need other new words. 
As an example of how much trouble many people have even with the cents-to-dollars unit-shift, which is only a factor of 100 and uses two well-known related units intimately familiar to all adult Americans, there's always the famous Verizon billing call: 
(Call reps, supervisors, managers – all gainfully employed people in a business centered around precise metered billing of minutes and kilobytes, in dollars and cents – all are befuddled by the difference between 0.002¢/kB and $0.002/kB.)

Sure, but lots of same-domain semantic collisions – as is the case with 'bit' in the realms of money and computer protocols/networks – are a problem that's not present with 'bucks' or your other examples. (“What do you mean, my 256-bit private key? My key should have tens of thousands of bits in it!”)
Also problematic, when precision is important because people don't like to lose money, is the already-conflicting alternative uses (bit as casual truncation of 'bitcoin', bit=millibitcoin, bit=microbitcoin, bit=atomically-indivisible-like-a-bit satoshi). 
I have no doubt 'bit' will get some usage, it's catchy. I just expect it'll hit a low ceiling for uptake, as it starts bumping into other top-of-mind meanings, and there's no glide path for one meaning to win.

Many Bitcoiners think a new unit, one-millionth of the current "bitcoin", will help make pricing and initial purchases for everyday commerce easier.

I did not use gold as an example. (I used tomatoes and legal services as examples of why your "mining a block yourself makes it nonexcludable" argument is nonsensical.)
Similarly, I didn't bring up 'excludability', but rather the potential for cartel or government-dictated transaction embargoes and address blacklists – a different concept, though perhaps distantly related to the same mechanisms that make goods excludable.

My proposal is the made-up word 'zib', chosen to be similar to 'bit', but without the potential sources of confusion. 
The case is mostly the same as that for 'bit': the microbitcoin is the right-sized unit, for attractive amounts and a well-placed decimal point, but 'microbitcoin' (and all its derivatives, like 'mics' or 'ubits') have problems as terms.

This touches on some of the reasons that a new made-up word, 'zib', can work better than 'bit' for the 100-satoshi-sized amount, while being just as short &amp; breezy.
'Kilozib' and 'megazib' work fine as SI-prefix-derived modifications: there's no conflict with existing informational/computing units. 
'Z', and especially 'Ƶ' ([z-with-stroke]( works fairly well as a super-compact currency-indicator: Z1,000. In comparison, everything that's b/B-related overlaps with both existing Bitcoin practices and bit/byte-unit abbreviations.
(Perhaps, people could adapt to using just the 'µ' [greek *mu*] as a compact microbitcoin indicator: µ1,000. 'Micro-' still confuses and belittles, though.)

Miners can't "kill" people with transactions they don't like. That's not the exclusion mechanism. 
Rather, they withhold the good/service unless payment is provided. That's the very essence of economic good "excludability", and it is evident in how Bitcoin has behaved so far, and how the core team wants transaction fees to float with recent miner receptiveness.  
It's a bit confused in the Bitcoin case because "miners" are an amorphous, interchangeable group subject to a new kind of  governance different from traditional firms/actors. But someone cursing and yelling is unlikely to understand such subtleties.

That isn't consistent with a working order book. With working order matching, any unfilled bids at higher prices (like 506.23) mean there would be *no* 'lows' below those bids (500-506.23). Preventing that from happening is its "one job". 
Clearly, there's a bug that deprived some sellers of the best price, or buyers of Bitcoin made available at a price they were willing to pay. The OP is plausibly one of the people so deprived, depending on how random/arbitrary/dysfunctional the matching was, and the amount of trading that occurred under the OP's bid.

Great arguments for "microbitcoin" as the right-sized unit (even if 'microbitcoin' is a bad name). 
But, "bits" is still a mess for a new name. 
If "bit" = 100 satoshi, then "bit-coin" naturally reads as "100 satoshi coin". 
People starting to learn the internals will sometimes think a "256-bit key" only holds 256 bits, or that 80,000 bits need 10,000 bytes to store them, etc.

It's fairly uncommon to use SI prefixes for money. (Sometimes you see 'K' for thousand, but not mega- for million, or milli- for tenths of a cent, etc.) That's because most people think of money as countable, tangible items, rather than scientific continuous measurements (where SI prefixes dominate). 
Pushing the SI prefixes on people who are mostly tangible/kinetic/auditory in their way of understanding the world – not abstract/mathematical/scientific – will run into a lot of resistance. The 'milli-' and 'micro-' prefixes are especially easy to confuse, and 'micro-' mostly means to people "so small I can ignore it unless using a magnifier". That's not a helpful connotation for taking microbitcoins to the moon...

This is exactly why I searched for the word 'zib', and about 6 weeks ago wrote up the rationale:
"Ƶibcoin: Your New Favorite Altcoin"
..and made the reference/FAQ website...
Obviously, Bitcoin needs a new base unit, something at the microbitcoin/100-satoshi size. But also obviously, existing names, and especially those derived from the SI 'micro-' prefix, have problems. 
If all existing/truncated candidate words have problems with how they're said, how they're abbreviated, or how they're understood, contriving a totally-made-up word offers a way out. 
The new word can be as short and sweet as desired, and adopt one unambiguous meaning from the beginning. While a new word faces initial unfamiliarity, it's very common for the subunits of currencies to have different-sounding names. For example... 
* dollars - bits (1/8ths) - dimes (1/10ths)
* pounds - shillings (1/20ths) - pence (1/100ths; formerly 1/240ths)
* yuan/kuai - jiao (1/10ths) - fen (1/100ths)
'Zib' was a lucky find when searching for free one-syllable words that sounded a lot like 'bit', retaining the bit/bitcoin 'b' sound. It fits anywhere 'bit' does. It works better as a verb: "we'll zib 10000 to you" vs "we'll bit 10000 to you" (or "we'll bitcoin 0.01 to you"). 
It can be thought of as a recursive acronym for "ZIB Is Bitcoin", reminding people that it's still a unit of Bitcoin. 
The 'Z' letter symbolizes finality, as in "the last currency unit you'll even need". It has a friendly currency-like unicode symbol, 'Ƶ' (Z-with-stroke; may not show up for you yet if browsing Reddit in Android). But even if that symbol collapses to a plain 'Z', or changes case, it's relatively unambiguous. (Forms of 'b' are more fragile.) 
Also, it turns out that in 1951 the Soviet space program snatched up a stray dog to fill in for a missing dog named Bolik. That replacement dog, named "[ZIB]( after the Russian acronym for "Substitute for Missing Bolik", returned from a successful mission. Since a lot of cryptocoin fans want to send a mascot purebred dog to the moon, what better mascot could there be than a common mutt who got closer to the moon than any of us?
Every other word for microbitcoin has other speaking/writing/understanding problems that will recur for the lifetime of the term. The contrived word 'zib' only has the problem of initial unfamiliarity, which goes away after a few uses. Please give it some tries, and see if it solves the friendly-name/decimal problem better than the alternatives.

Yes, the complaint is contingent on that low actually reflecting some trade that occurred at 500. 
If any such trade happened, it should have only happened after all higher bids were filled. If any such trade happened, some seller with a higher standing bid missed out on the higher price he could have had. (And, some buyer got a better deal than the market was supposed to have offered.)
It isn't necessarily the OP, though he's in the class of people whose bids were skipped to make a less-favored trade, so it might have been him.

Simple fix: adopt 'zib' as another synonym for 'bit'/µBTC. It fits well with the XBI ('xibi', said like 'zibi') abbreviation, too. People who like 'bit' will use 'bit', and those that find it confusing/unclear with use 'zib', but they'll be mutually-intelligible. 
So I like 'A' with the added proviso that 'zib' can be an approved secondary word for the same transactional unit.

No, rivalry is when a good/resource is 'used up' (or otherwise degrades) with each additional consumer. 
When the provider has the power to withhold a good or service, that's excludability. 
Bitcoin is designed to allow miners to withhold their transaction-verifying services, in return for payment, and when the core team talks about a method for autodiscovering the going market rate for transaction-processing, they are affirming and enhancing that excludability.

I think we need a new shorter/catchier name for the 'µBTC' unit ('µɃ'), and I've proposed 'zib'/'zibcoin', with the available symbol 'Ƶ'. Then Ƀ0.00164-Ƀ0.164 can be written Ƶ1,640-Ƶ164,000.

The most popular clients, web browsers, apparently don't use OpenSSL. 
But, lots of utilities (wget, curl, etc) and languages (python, ruby, etc) do use OpenSSL. So scripts that make outbound HTTPS connections are vulnerable... and since some tools automatically (or are configured to) follow redirects, even an innocent request to an HTTP URL might be attacker-redirected to an HTTPS URL of their choosing... which then heartbleeds the client.

As was noted in the recent "mining monopoly" scare, a cartel with 51% hashpower *could* try to raise fees or freeze-out certain transactions. Wouldn't the government's unpopular (among Bitcoiners) seizure of SR bitcoins be a good target for such righteous enforcement? An assertion of independence?
If the USG then has to 'mine' their own transaction – by overpowering the a preexisting cartel with its own new, added hashpower – wouldn't that be both (a) a helpful tax on their misbehavior; and (b) another interesting development in Bitcoin's distributed legitimacy? They're not just seeling coins, they're helping power the network and process transactions! 
"...that its use cannot be restricted in any sense whatsoever" - ? You may have a rude awakening in store when you realize how the current Bitcoin design, without either hypothetical improvements or massive and costly obfuscatory effort, makes transactions very traceable, and related-balances legally-blacklistable, in such a way that authorities could only ever dream of with paper cash.

Only if you have 51% mining power willing to respect your block. Otherwise you could spend $millions on hardware and electricity, and publish a valid block, but still never make it into the main chain. Miners might ignore your block because you've broken the cartel's tacit pricing agreement, or because laws put them at risk if they handle your transaction. 
And note even for a successfully-self-mined transaction, that you're then buying the "transaction publishing" service from hardware/electricity vendors. They are selling you excludable goods/services that are the only way for you to publish your transaction. The composite act of getting a transaction publish: still excludable. 
You could plant your own tomatoes, with enough soil and sun and water and time. That doesn't make tomatoes a non-excludable good.

I agree 100% that a smaller unit, that lets 'normal' folks talk about bitcoin in whole numbers (ideally *large* whole numbers) is a good idea. (In fact, you can read my own examples of why long-decimals, or the 'millibitcoin'/'microbitcoin' terminology, don't work for most people at  .)
The problem is with 'bit' as that unit. The point of showing that thread is how many different usages, and proposed redefinitions, of 'bit' already exist. If a thread at Bitcointalk three months ago says, "bit is millibitcoin", and a thread at Reddit says, "bit is microbitcoin", and other people are still very happy to be using "millibits" to mean something that would be "bits" or "kilobits" under other (conflicting) definitions, then which one wins? 
In fact it's worse than that: none of them *can* win. The whole point of a new term would be ease and clarity for everyday usage. You need a term that requires *less* explanation, and has *less* chance of money-losing miscommunications. 'Bit' is already too overloaded to achieve that.

But transactions with tiny output amounts can and are 'excluded', indefinitely! And loose mining cartels (which agree on policy, even if not run by unified management) can 'exclude' any transaction indefinitely! And how would prices rise when transaction volume increases, as the core team intends, if there wasn't some power to "exclude" non-payers? 
Also, regarding blacklisting, governments could require registration of all public keys, at penalty of deeming any amounts that they find out about – and they have many tools far beyond some hobbyist's ability to use mixers – as 100% forfeit-able! Extra architectural (or political) work would be necessary to foreclose that threat. 
BTW, "rival but nonexcludable" goods are not called "public goods" but "common goods" (or "common pool resources", and often need some sort of institutionalized community or state management to avoid destruction-from-overuse.

Rather than another 'blockchain', let it be a   key-value store, p2p-replicated via a dynamic hashtable (DHT). 
But, only allow insertion at keys with a proof-of-Bitcoin stake. EG, you have a spendable balance at transaction X / pubkeyhash Y, you can store some data proportionate to that balance at a corresponding DHT key. When you spend that balance, the DHT association expires. (It's a lease based on the Bitcoin tx0 set.) 
That may be enough to deter abuse/economic-imbalance: it requires a valuable thing be held like a deposit (the tx0) for the duration of the storage needed. 
If it isn't, then nodes in the DHT can be incrementally compensated with actual Bitcoin for storage... perhaps via some lottery process. (Reliably proving you've been serving up your assigned content gets you a chance of intermittent, random rewards drawn from the pool of all people who've requested inserts.)

For a logical/scientific/mathmatical/computery person, µBTC makes perfect sense. But having many ways to say it – ew-bits or yew-bits or microbits or microbitcoins – and its easy 'm'/'micro' confusability withe millis are problems. And, the less-mathematical masses, for whom shifting decimal-points and powers-of-1000 are *not* easy, will have a hard time with them. 
Catchy colloquial names for the µBTC/100-satoshi unit are what's needed. 'Bits' is one. 'Micros' or 'mics' might work for some. 'Zib' is another 1-syllable proposal, a unique and available word. 
Multisyllable words like 'microbitcoin' with conflicting abbreviations are a tougher sell for the less-numerate.

I'd grab the standalone HTML file from the bitaddress.org github project instead, to run locally (and have a perfect archive of the version you ran - you can even check and record its local hash).
You could also use acid-free paper. And, since your printer ink might not be ideal for permanence, you could hand-write the private key values alongside the printed values, using an archival-quality pen ('pigma' is a popular brand).

The history of Bitcoin is just a few years, and its future potentially unbounded.

Thanks for the pointers! 
IIUC, during the soft-fork overlap period in which both pre- and post-transition software is operating, and the new functionality has been switched 'on' by vote, the oblivious/older software *can* be misled to recognize transactions and blocks that might be invalid under the new rules, repeatedly as long as they keep appearing. 
But, given the previously-established (super)majority hashpower committed to the new interpretation, any such nonsense blocks will soon be superceded by a longer blockchain, which is also acceptable to the laggard nodes, using only the new interpretations, from the upgraded majority nodes. So, despite arbitrarily-many future short periods of confusion/divergence (until they upgrade), old-software-nodes are in each instance expected to rejoin the main chain. About right?  
(Their status on the upgraded network seems vaguely similar to that of SPV nodes, reliant on the preponderance of hashpower for trusting the things they can't properly interpret themselves.)

(1) DO NOT CONNECT THE PC TO THE INTERNET. Any connection/software use could put it at risk of compromise, as it hasn't received necessary OS/software updates since then.
(2) BACK UP THE RELEVANT FILES. As others have mentioned, any 'WALLET.DAT' file will be the most relevant. This alone will be enough to discover and control any Bitcoin values. You'll probably want to make a few backups to fresh, store-bought USB keys. 
(3) PROTECT THOSE BACKUPS. A 'WALLET.DAT' of that era would not be protected by any passphrase-encryption, so any person/software/malware that can see the file, even for a moment, could scrape out the 'private keys' that control the Bitcoin balances, and spend that money. So also keep the USB key backups from any internet-connected computes, until you're confident of a recovery/spend/sweep plan. 
(4) DELEGATE TO A TRUSTED EXPERT IF POSSIBLE. If you have a fully-trusted friend/family-member with some Bitcoin and internet-security expertise, you may want to have them drive the process of research/recovery. Whether it's them or you, the next few steps would likely be...
(5) DETERMINE THE RELATED PUBLIC ADDRESSES AND AVAILABLE BALANCES. Once you have backups, and with the PC still unconnected from the internet, you could try launching the old software. Its interface might show any amounts mined/received alongside the public addresses. Another approach would be to find some trusted software tool for scraping private keys out of a WALLET.DAT, and bring the tool and WALLET.DAT to a highly-trusted or ideally never-internet-connected computer, let that software tool get the private keys and display the related public addresses. Then, bring *only* those public addresses to another internet-connected computer, and check an online public source (like blockchain.info) for current balances of those public addresses. 
Only at this point do you know what you're dealing with in terms of economic value, so you know how much effort/security to devote to next steps. 
(6) REMAIN DISCREET ABOUT HANDLING/REVEALING THOSE PUBLIC ADDRESSES. With them, anyone can look up the magnitude of the values you control, and you could then become a target of other scams, technological and social. But, alone they're not enough to spend the values. 
(7) FURTHER SECURE (AND POSSIBLY SEPARATE) THE PRIVATE KEYS. If there's a lot from early mining, it will helpfully be broken into ~50BTC chunks, each controlled by a different private key. So you could create separate backups of each private key – on new USB keys and hand-written in archival-quality ink on acid-free paper – for long-term secure storage for any amounts you'd like to continue to hold. 
(8) TO SPEND/SELL/REDEEM, BRING INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE KEYS TO A NEW WALLET. When you want to redeem a chunk, you'd bring just one of those old keys to a well-secured, updated, internet-connected computer for "sweep" into modern, up-to-date wallet software, at which point it could be transferred via the usual mechanisms to a buyer/exchange. (If the amounts are very large, you might want to continue to keep the private keys always on never-connected computers, and use an even more-involved process to ever transfer small amounts away. Look up ["offline armory"] for more details on this ultra-paranoid mode of operation.) Note that the buyer/exchange may then notice that they've just received some coins traceable to long-dormant early mining, and suspect there are more where they came from, so you may wish to prefer highly-trusted/reputable counterparties for any sales. 
Good luck with your unexpected find! Perhaps you could (still anonymously) write up more details of what you find and how you choose to proceed, *after* you've taken all the steps to understand, secure, and (where desired) liquidate it.

Many are seeking a word that's easier to say and type, and less tied to the metric multiplier prefixes. 'kilosatoshi' is 5 syllables – even more than 'microbitcoin'.

'Bits' risks confusion with the binary-digit bits upon which Bitcoin's security and efficiency is based. Major connotations of the dominant sense of 'bits' – "small, approximate/unspecified parts/amounts" – work against the rigor (exact counts, precise decimals) that's beneficial in financial matters. The abbreviations for 'bits' (and the word itself) conflict with abbreviations and variations for the full 'bitcoin', including some slang already in use (like 'millibits'). 
Ditching the milli/m/micro/mu/µ stuff is good: those are confusing to laypeople. Going straight to 'bits' is problematic. 
We can (and should) make up a word that means just what we choose it to mean - neither more nor less. It doesn't have to be congenitally-joined to the 'bit' or 'coin' words: those wells are over-pumped already, and real currencies have lots of very-different-sounding names for different units, used in different contexts. 
(My proposal is using the made-up word 'zib' for the 100-satoshi unit, but I expect many words and abbreviations will circulate.)

Bitcoin has an emergent, distributed governance. Miners, developers, and users all have certain levers to apply to influence its evolution. Some of these levers are positive inducements – many win if Bitcoin stably grows in utility and value. Some are negative – groups can launch various kinds of 'spoiling' attacks against others they perceive as bad actors. Some are mixed: the credible threat of forking the code, network, or community. 
I recently read some interesting thoughts about how a culture of rules can emerge even without official rulemakers or formal property rights, in the context of how most pick-up basketball courts work. See:
I don't agree with all parts of his analysis. (In particular, an insurgent group that ignored the standing rules, and by barging-in spoiled a series-in-progress by the 'classic' rules, wouldn't just be ruining the value for all, they'd also likely trigger a fistfight – so there is in fact an understood risk-of-violence enforcing the culture.) But, I think it's an interesting example of reasoned-order arising, without anointing some people/institutions as "the governors". Governance without a government.

'Millibit' is OK, for people of a certain outlook/education, for a while. I think it has problems long-term. 
Ideally you'd want to eliminate *any* "point-somethings", for the foreseeable future. But your example is already a "nine-point-seven millibits", and if Bitcoin goes up by another 10X, it becomes an "oh-point-something". 
Anything 'milli-' sounds quite small – especially among people who know millimeters/milligrams/milliliters. So you're trading one signal-of-insignificance (long decimals starting with lots of zeros) for another signal-of-insignificance (milli-means-tiny).
Because of the leading 'm', and the similarity to 'million', the 'milli' prefix is often confused with the 'micro' when both are in use... as has already begun. 
By shortening "millibitcoin" to "millibit", you're making "bit" into a de facto abbreviation of "bitcoin". (By the logic you've taught your 8-year-old, 1000 millimeters equals a meter, 1000 millibits equals a 'bit'.) That implies a "bit" is a full bitcoin (100,000,000 satoshi). That's a bit weird for all the people who want 'bit' to mean 'millibitcoin' or for 'bit' to mean 'microbitcoin'. It's also strange for computer scientists for 'bit' to refer to something divisible into millions of pieces. It will create more confusion when people (like your son) really try to understand the bitcoin internals – 256-bit keys, 160-bit hashes, 64-bit integers, zero-bit partial-hash-collisions, certain kilobit bandwidth requirements to run a full node, and so forth. 
'Bit' as 'binary digit', an indivisible unit of information, is a really, really central idea for the digital/networked/cryptocurrency era. It's so important Satoshi named his invention after it! Adding another meaning – something that divides and totals up differently – inside the Bitcoin system tramples that homage. 
Yes, at recent exchange rates, someone who wants to buy $40 worth of Bitcoin can get 0.088 BTC. Millibitcoin is a little better: they can get 88 millibits. But it still sounds small, and possibly related to a really slow internet connection. ("Don't I want at least 10 megabits?") 
My suggestion, which is to use the microbitcoin-sized unit but with a new made-up name 'zib', lets that person making their first $40 purchase get 88,000 zib. (As a comparison, $40 could also get you DOGE 86,100.) 
People have cognitive biases which make it hard to imagine buying one full anything for "0.088" of something else. They can imagine buying some stuff for "88" of something... maybe even 88 things for 1 each! But they can imagine buying lots of stuff for "88,000" of something... look how easy it is to divide-up and still have a large number left! (Silly, yes, but a real mental effect.)

People *are* used to the decimal system. The number of "open, unprejudiced minds" is very small, even assuming good-faith effort.  So, a numbering system relying on blank slate minds, rather than decimal-trained minds as they exist, faces immense transition costs. Ambiguity and confusion in mixed/transitional contexts can even kill.
I can't see your glyphs, so I'm not sure what sense of 'inverse' you mean. Reference resources (like the Wikipedia page or Bitcoin Wiki page) don't include clear canonical/modern renditions of these glyphs. Reference sites I've checked for the Unicode code points you're reusing don't, either. 
From the 'clock' and 'compass' illustrations at Wikipedia, it seems you may mean some sort of stylized reflection or rotation of the decimal 1-7 glyphs? If so, that also seems unwise – the 6/9 congruence is already a problem in decimal, occasionally causing miscommunication. 
On a personal note, looking at Nystrom's "Tonal Watch, or Clock-dial" image at Wikipedia actually creates a mild optical-illusion-like sensory clash for me, because shapes amenable to alternate interpretations appear in close arrangement, like a necker-cube or faces-vase-silhouette. That's fun at times... but not when communicative precision is important, as say in finance or engineering.

It's obvious that expressing everyday values as "0.0097 bitcoin" is a problem: people don't handle tiny decimals very well, and are even used to considering such monetary values as disregardable rounding errors. 
So, many want to move to a different canonical unit in discussion and pricing, and the microbitcoin(µBTC)/100-satoshi-sized unit sticks out as a really good size. It's one millionth (1/1,000,000) of a classic 'bitcoin'. 
It expresses everyday values in thousands – that '0.0097 bitcoin' is instead '9700 µBTC' – which has proven workable in many cultures. It makes the smallest bitcoin unit, the satoshi, into a 1/100th 'cent'-like value familiar to people from the precedents of dollars/euros/etc. And, it's got lots of room to grow before units ever need to change again - each bitcoin would have to be worth more than $1,000,000 before satoshis are larger than cents. 
However, 'microbitcoin' and terms derived from micro/µ(greek *mu*)/u (the metric prefix for 'one-millionth') all sound a bit geeky and rely on the same understanding of tiny fractions that makes tiny decimals a problem. So people want a new term. 
'Bits' is familiar and has an obvious phonetic relationship to 'Bitcoin', so it's really popular as a new word for 'microbitcoin', especially on Reddit. 
Many others dislike 'bits' because as a word, it obscures via a contradictory meaning the binary-digit 'bits' that are central to the information-sciences (crypto, hashing, networking) that make Bitcoin work. It also risks confusion with existing abbreviations of 'bitcoin' (like 'millibits' or 'B'/'b'), and makes words like "bit-coin" read like "one-bit-value-coin"... when of course a "bitcoin" is worth a million times more than a "bit". 
(I've proposed another short made-up word which you can find in my posting history.)

Everything is wrong with that assumption. 
The market value in USD (etc) of all currently-held bitcoins is not a constant. It depends on expectations about the usefulness and future value of having a bitcoin. 
That a currently-held bitcoin balance is X% of all bitcoins that will ever exist is an important part of how people value them. That the bitcoin balances can't be taken away is another. Your proposed fork breaks both those reasons for valuing bitcoin, so people holding bitcoin for those reasons won't like your fork. They'll either ignore it, fight it, or – if it "wins" – tend to hold less new-bitcoins, because they don't have all the same scarcity/inviolability properties as old-bitcoins. 
I'd expect the value of everyone's 1/10th holdings to continue to decline, rather than expand to match the old market-cap.

Probably a transient issue with CloudFlare's ongoing certificate rotations. 
CloudFlare has a deal with a CA, where CloudFlare actually gets and holds certificates for their customers. It's slick when it works, but when first turning on the feature can be a little wonky. The turmoil related to heartbleed-openssl-bug certificate changes probably has some CloudFlare caches/customer-configs slowly catching up. 
Try again later, don't worry too much in the meantime: it's still a real CloudFlare cert - ao no harm accepting a temporary exception, you'll still have privacy- and authenticity- to CloudFlare. And, you aren't sending valuable secrets (like reused passwords) to bitcoin.it in the meantime, anyway, are you? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:25:05
That the CloudFlare proxies were patched right away is a good step, but it doesn't necessarily confer total invulnerability. It depends on other factors. 
If using the CloudFlare "Full" option – as is necessary to prevent eavesdropping between CloudFlare and the service's true source server – then CloudFlare itself is making a second SSL connection to the true source server. If that server isn't patched, and its true address is ever discovered, and it doesn't reject all non-CloudFlare connections, then it can be exploited via a direct connection, that skips CloudFlare.
How might its true address be discovered? Lots of ways! Old records from before CloudFlare was enabled. A scan of address space. The default "direct" subdomain CloudFlare's domain service adds. (It appears coinkite has wisely disabled or changed this subdomain.) 
Setting your internal server to only accept connections from the CloudFlare range is a good step. (Some active attackers still might be able to spoof CloudFlare IP addresses, though - you'd still not want to leave this unpatched.)
Another risk could be if the protected webserver ever makes *outbound* SSL connections to other hosts, such as web service APIs. (Yes, it appears this 'HeartBleed' bug can bite clients making outbound requests with affected OpenSSL, as well.) Lots of servers do that... and if the service they're contacting has itself been compromised/impersonated, they may get 'bled' at that time. 
(EDIT TO ADD: Also, it just occurred to me that outbound requests that an app thought were just plain HTTP, but follow redirects to HTTPS, could be exploited. So your innocent 'wget' to scrape a plain HTTP page might, if following redirects, get HTTP-spoofed by an attacker with a redirect to another HTTPS URL of their choosing, which then does heartbleed x-rays of your requesting-process memory!)

Nutshell: Services using the affected version of OpenSSL (like HTTPS webservers or possibly Bitcoin-Core with JSON-RPC "rpcssl=1") can leak arbitrary memory ranges (including session and certificate private keys or wallet data) in response to exploit messages. 
That allows server impersonation, or reading of SSL sessions (including the passwords/etc inside), or acquiring other in-process secrets (like wallet data). The exploitation is not generally evident in logs. 
A lot of software will need to be upgraded – and then certificates/keys on affected machines rotated, because those secrets *might* have been compromised before the upgrades.

The best option is to make up a new word. The word 'zib' is available: same general size &amp; sound as 'bit', works even better as a verb, has more distinct currency-signalling abbreviations (Z/Ƶ vs b/ƀ). 
It's OK for the various divisions of a currency to have names that aren't all derivatives of each other - in fact it's even healthy, it allows for shades of meaning in different contexts, but absolute clarity when precision is important (as is often the case for money or technical concepts). 
Multiplying the words/sounds associated with the Bitcoin economy isn't to be feared, it's to be welcomed. You can't just pump harder from the over-drained well of "bit" and "coin" words forever, that signals monoculture and lack-of-creativity.

Major web browsers aren't themselves at risk; I've been told none of them use OpenSSL. But yes, if a server is unpatched, its process memory (and all secrets it contains) is at risk of disclosure. 
So, if you're making HTTPS connections to an unpatched server, and that server has just had its SSL keys compromised by an attacker, that attacker can now decode your encrypted traffic, or impersonate the server via an active MITM. That is, HTTPS's security goals – authenticity, confidentiality – are gone. And the server has to fix their OpenSSL, and discard (and revoke?) certs/keys that may have been stolen during the unpatched period.

But if 'bit' = "100 satoshi", then "bit-coin" means "100-satoshi-coin". However, "bitcoin" means a 100,000,000-satoshi unit.
Reuse of the information-science word 'bit' also presents problems when people start trying to understand more of the internals of the system. (Sure, most people won't, but why make it harder for those who want to?) For example:
"OK, now we'll import this 256-bit private key you received as a gift."
"What? It should have 100,000 bits in it!"
"For computers, there are 8 bits in one byte."
"Oh, great, then my 80,000 bit wallet is 10,000 bytes. Cool!"

It's the right size and ease-of-pronunciation. 
The problem is it's already informally used as an abbreviation for a full bitcoin (as in people saying "millibit" or "microbit"). And, there are competing conflicting suggestions that it should be the casual name for 'miilibit', or 'microbit', or even 'satoshi'. That makes any one of those unlikely to take off as an unmbiguous usage. 
'Zib' was chosen because it was similar to 'bit' (with most of the same benefits), but amenable to unambiguous usage with one canonical definition.
There are other problems with 'bit' colliding with other monetary meanings and computer/infoscience meanings, where 'bit' already is either an undivisible unit, or something that fits 8/16/32/64/128/256 into larger units, not 1/1,000,000th. More discussion in the Zibcoin FAQ at:

During this novelty/transition period, learning it or earning it encourages exploratory projects among early adopters who feel limited by prior systems. Bitcoin works like founders' shares in a new system, helping to align interests in a very loosely-coordinated mass-collaboration project. (Inside this new playground, bitcoin paradoxically serves as not just the enabling tool/toys, but also the required entry fee, and even the dividends for success.)
Longer term, bitcoin will become better understood, and reach some sort of equilibrium with traditional alternatives. Anywhere it wins out over old monies – either in old niches, or in totally novel arrangements – it will serve the same role in enabling trade and production as traditional currencies and equities.
Through its evolution, to the extent bitcoin remains resistant to certain kinds of repossession and dilution, it will remain uniquely interesting and motivating to many people. (Note this can be true even if those people are 'wrong' in some of their predictions about the working of the larger world.) If you like the kinds of projects these people work on, bitcoin is uniquely able to incent their production.

Hey! 'Zib' is the honey-badger of made-up words for µBTC. It just keeps happening no matter the naysayers!
Unfortunately, all the 'natural associated' words (via SI prefixes or truncations or retconned-redefinitions of 'bit') have their own problems - so a distant relation can be a benefit, because it can means no more nor less than a precisely chosen definition. 
Also, as a slight relation, ZIB = "ZIB Is Bitcoin", and the 'b' is still suggestive of 'bit'. 
There are some people – especially computer scientists, cryptographers, system &amp; protocol architects, network engineers – that will always have a hard time with any base-100/base-1,000,000 repurposing of 'bit'. Honestly, it feels sacrilegious to even attempt it: the science of the 'bit'-as-binary-digit is exactly what gives us the bounty of Bitcoin. Even if only 1-out-of-every-1,024 people who use Bitcoin ever scratch under the surface, it should be easier for those talented-one-in-2^10th to grok the real 'bits', not harder. 
So perhaps 'bit' will catch on for the masses, but a certain group of people, for whom the distinction is important to their daily work, will keep using a different term (like 'zib') for clarity, and as a symbol/affectation signaling their identity. Maybe a little like how for some in the Vietnamese diaspora, 'Ho Chi Minh City' will always be called 'Saigon'.

It's the right length and catchy enough. 
But, it brings in the 'micro' implication: tiny, ignorable. It needs the 2nd spelling to clarify how it's said. The proper one-letter abbreviation is 'µ' (greek 'mu') but many will use 'm' instead. "1000 mics" will still sound to many like "1000 michaels" or "1000 microphones". And, it seems out-of-place as a verb: "can you mic me the 10,000 by Monday?"
So it could sorta work, but would face those issues, and still 'microbitcoin' is awkward mouthful as its source. 
But on each of those concerns, Ƶ / zib work better. They don't imply microscopic, and have the one compact unambiguous abbreviation (Ƶ/Z). 
Either 'zib' or 'Z' work OK as unique noun ("send me 1000 zibs" or "1000 Zs") and are even plausible as an action verb ("zib me the 10,000" / "z me the 10,000").

Millionth-of-a-bitcoin is a great size for nice round numbers - everyday purchases, and 1st acquisitions, will then be in "thousands" of units, like Dogecoin. 
But, "bit" is a problematic name that walks into a semantic blender. Bits are binary, indivisible and crucial to the workings of the system (for any who choose to learn) – that's why Satoshi named the system "bitcoin". Retro-defining "bit" to mean "100 satoshi" makes the name of the whole system (or the "bitcoin" unit) read as "100-satoshi-coin" - when Satoshi's original intent for the name was different, and 1 bitcoin is actually 100,000,000 satoshi!
So people should separate out the two questions: yes, a unit that makes the numbers easier to think about, without long decimals, is a great idea. "Bit" as the name of that unit is not. 
"Microbits", "micros", "crobits", "eubits", "mubits" have all been mentioned based on the "micro-" (µ, greek *mu*) prefix. I think we should choose a made-up word, "zib". 
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:56:45
That's an interesting derivation and reasonable resulting sound ("zub").

There's a highly-vocal comment-voting block at Reddit that likes 'bit'; whether that word has any larger consensus is still unclear. (There's a much larger constituency for the idea of a 100-satoshi-sized unit, for a number of practical and psychological reasons... the 'bit' fans are a subset of that group.)
Still, the enthusiastic/impatient keep declaring the matter settled, even though such matters of language take years to stabilize. 'Bit'-as-100-satoshis has some problems as soon as you try to use it in technical discussions, or in compact money interfaces, where precision/formality/unambiguousness can be very, very important.

Maybe. Maybe they're assuming their readers already know 'Bitcoin' as an adjective describing a category of firms/projects with no singular leader. 
A paper could run a headline in English like "Oil boss found dead" or "Bank boss found dead" and readers would understand: a boss in that field, not THE one singular boss.  
Perhaps German has a more definitive way to make the singular implication – "the boss of all Bitcoin" – and that form is used here. But "Bitcoin boss found dead" is typical and not-too-misleading headline-speak for "A boss in the Bitcoin field found dead".)

Indeed, Eyal&amp;Sirer seem willfully-blind to any checks-and-balances that involve people noticing and dynamically reacting to suspicious behavior (like big chain re-orgs, high-block-orphan-rates, transaction embargoes, etc.).
So they makes the hyperbolic claim that, against a selfish miner with 33-50% power, "no fix possible, ever". But in fact many pools over the history of Bitcoin have reached these thresholds, since the first public discussion of selfish-mining tactics, in December 2010. Several have been in these ranges since Eyal&amp;Sirer's "Majority is not Enough" paper (which explained these tactics to a larger audience) – not just GHash when flirting with the 51% barriers. 
And yet, none of them have chosen these profits. Perhaps, they recognize that detection and aggressive community countermeasures would be rapid, destroying not just those tiny immediate supra-proportional profits, but also much of their existing investment.  
So it's possible a de facto social 'fix' – the threat of mutually-destructive reactions, or forks that leave the abusers behind – not only exists but has a track record of proven effectiveness. It's just harder to write about, in TeX-and-PDFs.
I'm reminded of Jimmy Wales' observation about social software design:


Eyal&amp;Sirer think people are going to start stabbing each other with the 33%+ power selfish-mining knives, or the momentary-51%-power knives, at any second now, even though they've refrained from doing so through many opportunities over the last 3.5+ years. 
I'd say: recognize that Bitcoin isn't as trivially-mathematically-secure as some may have casually hoped, but remember the whole system is checked by many other factors, and enjoy your steak dinner without panic.

If you tell them to test a specific ordered range of potential nonces – that is, not to improvise their own randomness – then it's deterministic. (I forget if that's the way the usual pool protocols work, but if they don't work that way... they *could*.)

How have they solved the problems colored-coins can create for mining incentives? 
Namely, if tiny Bitcoin transactions ('dust') actually represent larger values of something else, it's either free-riding on the generosity of miners to prioritize tiny transactions, *or* dependent on side-incentives/extra-knowledge in mining, which could enhance economies of scale causing further dangerous mining centralization.

Sort of. See: 
Essentially, pledges are fragments of a final transaction, solicited and collected out-of-band from the Bitcoin protocol (but leveraging its features). When (and only when) there are enough valid pledges to reach the target amount, the coordinator can issue a valid combined transaction, paying a predeclared address, which lands on the blockchain. During the fundraising, the coordinator could publish the pledges allowing the public to independently verify progress. The form of the pledges assure they can only be used to complete the original transaction template. 
So, it's not guaranteeing that funds are used to do a particular real-world thing successfully - just that a fundraising target value must be reached before any money is collected, and that a declared person/entity/etc will receive the full amount when that happens (and not some other party). 
As described at the link, since the pledges aren't on the blockchain, there are still some mischief risks. A pledger could race another spend of the same funds into the blockchain, before the fundraising completes. Further refinements of the approach might remedy that (perhaps with the help of designated arbitrators).

Microbitcoins (µBTC, 100 satoshis, 0.000001BTC) are the right-sized unit for convenience, and with room for further growth. But the name "microbitcoin" is long and awful, and prone to confusion because 'm' also appears in 'millibitcoin' (1000X larger), and the metric abbreviation is 'µ' (greek 'mu').
So: a better name for 100 satoshis is needed. I've suggested the made-up word 'zib'. A full case is here:
Your 0.2BTC would be instead "200,000 zib". 0.034BTC would be "34,000 zib". 
Others have suggested 'bit', but that runs into a lot of conflicts with other meanings of 'bit' (after which bitcoin was named) and existing use of terms like "millibits" and "microbits". More problems with 'bit':
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:42:56
That would be nice, but big non-compatible terminology-switches are hard, at this point, with so much software and historical text essentially frozen. 
And, the transition period risks major mayhem, like changing the side of the road a country drives on. You need massive consensus and synchronized switchover to avoid costly misunderstandings.
A term like 'zibcoin' can be adopted gradually, and either thrive or fail on its own merits, without requiring any massive consensus-building. 
But also something to think about:
A transitional term could make the consensus redefinition of Bitcoin more thinkable. If it demonstrates the convenience of the new unit, and starts lessening reliance on 'classic-mega-bitcoin' as a unit (or the base unit of 'millibitcoins' and 'microbitcoins'). When 'bitcoin' is less used in daily price-quotes, and there grows a clear historical period between 'the era of the giant bitcoins' and 'today when we use the zibcoin unit', then it would be practical to say, "it's safe to start calling zibcoins 'bitcoins'" - because the clash with others' practice will have been lessened.

This is a total lie. The meme "zibcoin is the best altcoin" is a joke, to emphasize that zibcoin *is* bitcoin, just with the same conveniently-small units as Dogecoin. (In fact, one of the derivations of "ZIB" is "Zib Is Bitcoin".)
Part of the joke is that you can change your paper wallets just by adding zeros and moving the decimal point. 
There's a source fork (no binaries) of the Bitcoin client that just cosmetically patches the few lines needed to add "zib" as the default/µBTC display unit. 
Another part of the joke is that it's the only "100% binary-compatible altcoin" - meaning it actually runs on the bitcoin network, bit-for-bit identical in protocol and messages as Bitcoin... because after all, the protocol itself only ever uses Satoshis, and it laughs at our silly debates over UI/natural-language terms. The core protocol is totally oblivious/ambivalent to our terminology.

Problems: 
Most people say µ as 'yew', not 'mu'. Others like to say 'mics' (and I've even seen an advocate for 'crobits'). And when 'micro' comes into play, people often get it confused with 'milli'. 
If appealing to the precedent and utility of metric formalisms, then 'µBit' means something else. 'Bit' is already an international-standard unit of information, so 'µBit' literally reads as a millionth of a 'bit' (a concept that could come up in measuring entropy/probabilities) rather than a 'bitcoin'. 
'µB' collides with the standard abbreviation of 'byte' as 'B': so if appealing to worldwide conventions, it reads as 'micro-byte'. 
You could maybe get away with just 'µ', like 'µ100', with the unit implied by surrounding context, further protected against confusion because no other currency is conventionally referred to with metric-prefixes or in millionths. (This would be similar to how '[micron]( is understood as 'micrometer', and the use of 'µ' alone for microns predated the generalized 'µ' and 'µm'.)
Still, picking a new word can get all the compactness benefits of 'bit', avoids the discomfort many have with 'micro', and can become the base unit for the kilo- and mega- modifiers (with which consumers are far more familiar in the computer memory/storage/bandwidth domains). So for example with 'zib'=100 satoshi, kilozib and megazib (1 BTC) are more tangibly understood, as impressive multiples of the base unit, compared to finely-sliced thousandths/millionths.

We shouldn't be overly concerned with wealth distribution as long as (a) the wealthiest still play fair and are incented to pursue socially-beneficial projects; and (b) the poorest have opportunity and their welfare is generally improving faster than in alternative systems. 
For example, a system that is very equal, but leaves the poorest in misery, is inferior to one that produces massive inequality, but which in doing so lifts the poorest to a higher level of consumption, comfort, and safety. (That is, absolute levels of welfare among the poorest are more important than inequality.) 
Bitcoin helps a bit with encouraging fair-dealing and productive-projects by the richest: it excludes some kinds of gaming-the-political-system or gaming-the-banking-system that we see with traditional currencies. Whether it helps in other aspects of welfare remains to be seen. But it deserves a chance. 
Also note that looking just at the distribution of currency is a reductionist, degenerate, misleading indication of total wealth. Most measurable wealth is in non-currency assets: equity, creditor obligations, land, proprietary rights. Currency, especially Bitcoin, is a relative sideshow. Even as Bitcoin grows, and if Bitcoin comes to be the unit in which the value of other forms of ownership gets reported, it's the other ownership that dominates. Any windfall to early Bitcoin holders will still be minor compared to other pre-Bitcoin wealth concentrations. 
So don't worry too much about it. It's not a system for magically reallocating *everything* that existed before. It's just a system for better handing transactions and wealth-accumulation, from now on.

Yes, the 'zib-as-the-safest-altcoin' joke may have backfired. 
The more terms, the merrier, as far as I'm concerned. Real currencies, and important things, have many names with slight shadings of meaning - some more precise, some approximate, some formal, some informal, etc. An vibrant economy/ecosystem has internal variety.

Most people outside technical fields aren't intuitively familiar with 'm' as "1/1000th". Sure, they've come across milliliters and millimeters, but they've not used such prefixes with money, and they don't easily shift between scales in powers-of-1000. (The [Verizon math]( episode is a classic example of how even people with a professional responsibility for accurate metered billing can be befuddled by the much more simple and familiar dollars/cents ratio.)
The idea of jumping to a 'microbitcoin'-sized unit is that it'll be the only transition required for a long time. (If bitcoin rises in value another 10x, mBTC starts having the same decimalization problems.) 
The idea of picking whole new words is to emphasize the fact this is the reference unit-size, to base thinking upon - rather than one of many possible fractional derivatives of some much-larger unit. Also, a new word can discard the connotations of "trifling, ignorable rounding errors" that can come with "milli-" and "micro-".

I've suggested 'zib' as a term for 'microbitcoin'. It has many of the same advantages (in sound and size) as 'bit', but without the meaning-collisions. It also has a nice unicode currency-like symbol. 
Explained: 
More support, including a FAQ: 
It even works without too much confusion if people start using metric multiplier terms like 'kilozib' (mBTC) or 'megazib' (BTC).

My understanding is that RMB/renminbi is the formal name for the currency, like "official US dollars". 
In common daily usage, yuan (or kuai) are more common, and also jiao (dime) and fen (penny). 
So the common daily words, and values, tend to be shorter softer words... that's the reason why 'zib' could work, even though the currency's official name is 'bitcoin'. 
Real currencies, in important daily use, tend to have many redundant names fulfilling different roles of precision/formality/magnitude.

While 'bit' has many fans, it's been proposed at different times to mean 'millibitcoin', 'microbitcoin', and even (occasionally) 'satoshi'. It's also sometimes been used as a casual abbreviation for 'bitcoin' itself, as in 'millibits' or 'microbits'/'eubits'. 
And, for an important subgroup of the community – the computery-experts that take the crypto/hashing/protocol details very seriously – reusing the central word 'bit' to mean something else, something that's divisible by 100, something that will cause confusion with key-lengths and hash-sizes and storage and bandwidth measures... well, ick. That's like fingernails-on-a-blackboard to the gnomes that keep things running. 
So I don't think the network-effect will get rolling for 'bit'. Indeed, since this topic has been discussed for years, and none of the various redefinitions of 'bit' have yet taken off, I think that's an example of its challenges.
(As recently as January, when defining "bit" as "0.001BTC" very-narrowly won a poll at Bitcointalk, some were claiming *that* to be an "official" definition:  - but now 3 months later the same word is supposedly on the verge of network-effect adoption... but with a now-*different* definition that's 1000x less-in-value? People need precision and stable definitions when dealing with money... and 'bit' will never have that.)

'Satoshi' is a bit of a mouthful. 
Microbitcoin (µBTC) works really well as the right long-term unit *magnitude*: the smallest unit (the satoshi) is then 0.01 microbitcoin (similar to tradition currency hundredths). 
Giving prices in full thousands is easier for most people than thousandths/millionths: for an amount equal to about USD$5, it's easier to say "11 thou" (for µBTC) than "Oh Point Oh One One" (for BTC). 
But, "microbitcoin" is like "satoshi" a mouthful of awkward syllables. Also, the "micro-" prefix is in the realm of metric prefixes less-familiar to laypeople, and more often confused with "milli-", and 'micro' has the negative connotations of "trifling; easy-to-ignore; hard-to-see". 
For these reasons, I've proposed "zib" (and "zibcoin") as a new synonym for "microbitcoin". It's a distinct, easy-to-say syllable that's alse easy-to-abbreviate as 'Z' and even has an available unicode character, 'Ƶ' (Z-with-stroke,  - which may not yet show up here given Reddit's font choices).
A longer case is made at  and  
If adopted, meaningful everyday amounts, like USD$5, can then be "11,000 zib" or written as just "Ƶ11,000" ("Z11,000"). That'll feel like a more substantial gift to partner, family, or friends than "0.011 bitcoin".
There's no rush to change, nor central decision that must be made... if the word and notation turns out to be useful as Bitcoin appreciates, and more normal folk struggle with decimal values, it'll get increasing use, and soon thereafter seem natural. So keep it in mind when these issues come up.

Is the standard Bitcoin-QT client fooled by 'transaction malleability' into miscalculating displayed balances and available TX outputs? 
Or does it recognize the tampered transaction, when it arrives in a block, as having already consumed some of the locally-tracked outputs – so the client gives up on the original transaction (now a double-spend that will fail)?

Using smaller units to eliminate the leading decimals is a great idea. 
The 'bits' word has problems. Its benefits in familiarity are mixed with meaning-collisions - digital binary digits, small/vague amounts, the currency inside My Little Pony. 
It'll always be hard to use alongside technical explanations of why Bitcoin can be trusted - the strong cryptography of bit-based binary math.

Clearly many people, especially certain early-adopters here, will use/prefer 'bits'. 
Meanwhile, other people find that confusing and grating. That's OK, multiple words can (and usually are) used for important concepts, and usage ebbs and flows over time. 
'zib' (or 'xib') is a unique word that fits everywhere 'bit' does, without introducing ambiguity. It can be used interchangeably, and people will understand from context what's meant. It fits OK with some proposals for a 100-satoshi-sized currency code (XBT). It even phonetically fits in as an action-verb to imply a bitcoin-send: "zib me 6000 for lunch". 
We don't have to worry about the 'casualties' of 'bits'. If people just use what they prefer, and are multiply intelligible, the clearest and catchiest coinages will slowly grow out over time.

You're right that by making a fresh visit to an unpatched site, you send either your login credentials, or your cached cookies to the site. That makes it more likely those details will either be (a) skimmed from the site's active memory, or (b) decoded in transit, if someone can observe your traffic and has previously acquired the server's keymatter. 
So, if you expect a service to patch soon, and to avoid or successfully manage/weather any exploit attempts in the meantime, then avoiding any contact with the site in the meantime may be the best strategy.

Be careful. If your transaction doesn't confirm for days, it can be hard to re-issue with a larger fee. 
Also, at least in the past, the core client would when necessary use the 'change' from the unconfirmed transaction for later transactions, potentially creating a chain of dependent transactions, all unconfirmed – which can be a difficult wallet-state to recover from.

I know the 'zee' and 'zed' sounds... what's the third you're thinking of? And, does the likely pronunciation of 'zib' vary as well, or just the 'Z' alone-as-a-letter?
I'd expect pronunciation to vary, and even the word itself to change, where it has significant collisions inside any particular language. I've heard 'bit' is a homophone for a French word for 'penis', but I don't know if that'd be strong enough semantic-interference to cause francophones to choose another word for "100 satoshi", or if they could contextually-ignore the concurrence.  (Maybe they'll skip 'bit' for 'zib'!)
I do think 'zeds' or 'zees' would also work well as fallback unit names or alternate pronunciations whenever necessary – each is still less confusion-prone than 'bits' and small-b's.

Background you probably already know: 
A brainwallet's private key can be calculated from something a person has memorized, which we'll call the 'seed'. However, things that are easiest to memorize are also easiest to guess, or find by brute-force iteration through all the possibilities. So things like names, small numbers of english words, famous quotes, phone numbers, etc aren't good seeds. 
Still, the formulas that turn a seed into a private key *can* be fed very-bad seeds, and they spit out usable private keys... that lots of people already know. Send money to the corresponding public keys, and bots watching the Bitcoin network will race to transfer it away to their own stronger keys. 
The "empty string brainwallet":
The single letter 'a' would be a pretty bad seed for a brainwallet. But there's something even worse! It's the empty-string: no characters at all. It's a degenerate corner-case. 
The kinds of formulas that can turn any-length-string seed into a private key also tend to work on a zero-length string. So everyone knows the private key that you get from feeding the empty-string into a brainwallet-generator, and the corresponding public keys. 
The problem isn't that someone can't retrieve such funds, it's that many people can. Broadcasting a transaction that sends funds to this address (or any other 'burned' widely-known private key) is like throwing a $100 bill into a crowd, available to whoever grabs it first. Grabbing it, here, means getting your spend-transaction into the next block. 
(It's quite possible such spends usually wind up benefiting the mining pool of the next block, since they could be monitoring known private keys and can control exactly which spends win entry to their own mined-blocks.)

Bitcoin-haters might be part of the effect... but also Bitcoin-lovers for whom the option introduces a detour/delay.

By the time the original task is resumed – maybe hours or days later – the trigger for wanting the product may have waned. ("I already picked that up yesterday at the store... I don't really need that just yet... I just noticed I need to save a bit more first... [etc]")

Realistically, even Bitcoin's biggest fans and creators only partially 'understand' it.

I suspect the IRS will decide the most logical approach will be to treat Bitcoin like stock or other fund shares. (Those are fungible/interchangeable, too, and things like mutual/index funds also offer fractional shares.)
But, your main question remains. in the language of taxable capital gains, what you're actually asking is what is your 'cost basis' of the sold items, which affects the taxable gain. And the different batches bought at different times/prices are called the 'tax lots'. (Those are the key phrases to improve your searches for official references.) 
Most often, a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) rule is applied. Sometimes, this is to your advantage, as the first-in shares may be eligible for a long-term gains rate where laters shares might not. Under this treatment, you have the gains of your scenario (1), $900. But then for any future sales, your cost basis is that of the later purchase - which means lower gains (or greater decuctible losses) in the future.
You can sometimes justify a different treatment, such as last-in-first-out (LIFO), and this might offer tax benefits. But you generally need the records to indicate that this was a committed-to strategy, and that the actual units sold were the 'same' units. And, I don't believe you can improvise your tax-lot strategy from year-to-year for maximum advantage. 
Here's some example material on the web about similar scenarios with stock shares:
So the safest answer is, apply FIFO treatment, now and for all future transactions of the same security. If you wanted to try a different treatment, consult a real tax professional. (Important disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer or accountant, just someone who's investigated this issue using public sources.)

Goofy theory. Controversy is good for BI – it brings readers – so they'll be happy to print rabidly anti-Bitcoin analysis, messianic pro-Bitcoin analysis, and everything in between. Even getting things wrong can be good: the arguments and followup corrections bring even more hits. 
Controversy and criticism is also good for Bitcoin. Being attacked and argued about means more people learn about Bitcoin. Bitcoin chugging along past the predictions of doom – existence proof, social proof, longevity proof – convinces people of its value moreso than any understanding of the internals. 
BI, RRE, itBIT, Blodget, Weisenthal, and holders of Bitcoin the world over all have the same interest: more controversial opinionated coverage of Bitcoin! So you can trust that such coverage will continue at BI unabated.

Detach the printer any networks before printing. 
After printing, destroy the printer with fire. 
More seriously, it's printers/multifunction devices that have large buffers and sophisticated firmware that could be a worry. (Some devices used in high-traffic/shared-office situations even have hard drives.) These can keep remnants of long-ago printed documents in non-volatile memory for quite a while... and might already be owned or be owned in the future, especially if anyone knows they've been used to print paper wallets.

If you like Bitcoin enough to hold a long position for yourself, with that position being larger than your payments-need in any 4-day period, the Coinbase delays can be rendered irrelevant. 
For example, hold $100K in BTC. When you want to pay a supplier, send the supplier out of your stash, and rebuy at the going rate at Coinbase, at the exact same second. After 4 days, voila, the net effect on your USD/BTC/AccountsPayable balances is the exact same as if you'd been able to buy BTC for USD instantly. 
This approach is only a problem if you want to move in and out of your  BTC position rapidly (speculative trading), or don't want to hold even just 4 days' worth of payables in BTC. 
But if you think BTC is good enough for $100K in international payments per month – even with the risk of volatility it imposes on the suppliers before they can sell it – then you might not mind holding $25K ($100K/4weeks) to $100K (peak 4-day usage) worth of BTC in your own long-term account. Barring a total BTC collapse, the volatility works for you as often as it works against you... and given the long-term trend so far, mostly for you.
