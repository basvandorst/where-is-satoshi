Thanks will do. I'm going to see how it goes. :)

Hey thanks so much for the pointers. You're right, I've got a ton of work to do.

That's really cute.

Am I missing something but, didn't Ross actually try to pay to have someone killed?

They weren't dropped. They just weren't pursued. One of them was dropped/dismissed this year. It's not the same as saying "He didn't do this" it's seems more like saying "It's pointless to pursue this as he's never getting out anyway." My guess, and this is just a guess, is that if somehow the drug dealing/money laundering sentences are reduced/eliminated, they'll then pursue the other five attempted murder charges.

I think you've hit a nerve here. 
None of us would be supporting him if this were about human trafficking. But, it was about drugs, fake IDs, and pirated material. The crimes committed were largely consensual crimes from people who were smart/savvy enough to get on Tor. (Which, by the the very tech hurdle involved, implies knowledgeable informed consent.ie nobody sold rock to 9 year old kids on SR) 
I think this very fact has caused a lot of otherwise good thinkers to make a logic and moral leap of concluding that Ulbricht then committed only victimless crimes, under the rule of an unjust set of laws, and thus should serve no time. But, in reality, these same laws are exactly what we use to break up pedophile rings and sex trafficking and they are, like it or not, the laws of the land in question.

Do you really think so? He actually did everything he was accused of. Money laundering and organized crime have an incredibly high penalty in the US. I don't agree with this. But, at the same time, it's not as if he's actually innocent.

This is the first I've read about them. Thank you for the new information.

Right. So, basically, we want to free him on the basis that he's a bro?
I'm not trying to be tacky.But, he actually did appear to have done many, if not most of the things he's been convicted of.  I have watched a couple of documentaries about this. And, am far from an expert. But, he was quiet guilty of the money laundering and drug trafficking charges. And, then there's the disappearing charges of attempted contract killing for what appears to be five people total.  
Other than the murder for hire stuff, I pretty much agree with Ross. But, at the same time, all this stuff is actually illegal. And, he appeared to do these things. I'm not sure how one can reasonably petition for his freedom or reasonably suggest that he's purely a political prisoner.

An illegal site that he made 30 million dollars off of. It's not like he was selling Chong Bongs and the police were overzealous. Unless I missed something, he actually proudly did everything they assert.

In the first place, one does not justify or invalidate the other. If you are concerned with why bad banks and corporations are judged to different standard, I'd encourage you to be an advocate of reform. But, what you're doing here is playing "what aboutism". Other people acting poorly does nothing to absolve Ross from doing it himself. 
Are you asking my personal opinion or what the law says? The RICO act and money laundering laws are quite clear about this. ie Apparently, the law says yes. 
My personal opinion is that hell yes he deserved double life for the 5 attempted contract killings. But, they didn't bother to try him on that. 
And, while I totally think drugs should be legal and am very pro privacy and crypto, he broke the law and wrote many blog posts about how he was willfully breaking the law. So on those charges alone, he should get something. Not double life but something. It's not like he was trying to change the law and then the authorities went after him. He did a bunch of shit that's illegal in this country, bragged about it, and didn't quit once he made 20+ million. He could have gone to half a dozen other countries and been fine. He could have quit months earlier and been fine. From my understanding, his greed and hubris are what got him, more than anything else.  
Edit: grammar

He's in jail for money laundering and drug dealing. And, according to how US law is written, he actually did those things. My point is that this doesn't make him a political prisoner. And, the murder for hire part doesn't make it seem like was some innocent kid, who didn't understand the gravity of what he was doing.

I agree with you. But, I think it's also important to point out that everything he was actually charged with are crimes in the US, despite the fact that we disagree, and that he really was the Dread Pirate Roberts, ergo he's actually "guilty" of them.  
What gets me here, more than the idea that the US vigorously prosecuted him, is the idea that he did nothing to shield himself from the whole thing. (other than try to get some people killed) I'm a little incredulous about that. Kim.dot com at least has the good sense to change countries and location of servers. Ross had around 30 million dollars and did virtually nothing to protect himself or the site. He had to, at that point, know that money laundering etal are considered larger crimes in the US than murder. And, instead of pivoting to another country, where his behavior isn't such a problem, he stayed. What is that greed? Stupidity? Hubris? He certainly wasn't planning on being a dark web martyr. 
Maybe I'm wrong, I'd be interested in other points of view.
