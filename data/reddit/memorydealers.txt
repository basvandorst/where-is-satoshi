They tried to extort $20K from me,  and threatened to ruin my, and my family’s lives if I didn’t pay.

Summary from Coindesk:

People own their own bodies and have the absolute right to put whatever they want inside of them. Billions of people across the planet choose to use drugs every day, from tobacco and alcohol, to heroin and cocaine. They do it because they enjoy them, and they think they make their lives better.
To think that other human beings, by writing down words on a piece of paper and calling it a law, could somehow strip away this fundamental right to self ownership is insanity. The police, DEA agents, judges, and other law enforcement officers that lock people in cages for the peaceful acts of buying, selling or using drugs are the real criminals, and need to stop.

The CEO of OKWAVE is fully hooked on Bitcoin.  I suspect we will see deeper and deeper integration as time goes by.

OKcoin completely took the site off line without even telling me at all.   A lawyer agreed to take the case on contingency, but there likely wont be any news on that for a few months.

Starbucks doesn't lose any money at all.  It is a win-win situation for everyone.  The Starbucks customer gets a 10% discount,  the Bitcoin seller earns 10% on every sale, Starbucks likely gets additional sales since people can afford to buy more, more people hear about Bitcoin and get to see it in action.  Everyone wins.

Actually from my own real world experience,  most people will buy $25 or $50 worth from you at a time, because they know they will eventually use it all at Starbucks, so you only need to 2 to 4 customers per hour to earn $10 to $20 per hour.  The first customer is always the hardest, but once one person in line sees someone buying the gift card,  many others follow their lead.  $20 per hour in cash is substantially more than minimum wage.  Don't be shy,  just try it!

I would like to make a few clarifications in regards to Bitcoin store.
1.  $850K is the Quarterly target in order to stay in the best pricing tier. 
2.  If Bitcoinstore.com doesn't reach this goal,  it will continue in businesses,  but with slightly higher prices.
3. I'm aware that the site still needs a lot of polishing,  specifically regarding the searching and filtering options.
4. The goal widget on the fron't page doesn't currently update automatically,  but you can monitor our progress at 
5. I previously negotiated with the distributor to let us start off with the best price tier for Q1 2013.
Everything with the Developers has taken MUCH longer than planed.  Time was running out, so I had to launch the site before it was truly ready in order to have any chance of meeting the sales target for this quarter.
6. I think if we can hit close to $300K,  I will have a good chance of getting the distributor to allow us to continue in the best price tier since 98% of the sales will have been from March.
7.  If you are a professional Magento developer and would like to help with Bitcoinstore.com  (Search,  Filters,  data import, etc)  Please contact me.
(You will be paid in BTC)
With everyone's help, Bitcoin is well on it's way to changing the world for the better!

This issue is the same as the vulnerability reported previously by gmaxwell in relation to decoded transaction scripts but instead with the coinbase script. The vulnerability was fixed within 10 minutes of it being reported and we appreciate Haeqon's notification. It would likely be impossible to exploit because it requires mining a custom block, and since since coinbase scripts are limited to 100 bytes the exploit would have to be less than 100 characters.  In short, this likely isn't even a possible exploit. Blockchain gets thousands of support tickets, including many spam and extortion attempts. We do our best to evaluate the authenticity of each, and respond as quickly as possible. We're working 24/7 to be the world's most secure, and easy to use wallet. We appreciate the community's trust, from our more than 400,000 users.

For the record,  I caught someone red handed lying to me, and trying to steal from me. In the heat of the moment,  I made an unintentional mistake that I have since apologized for. For over two years now,  I have been spending every waking moment, and more than $6,000 a month of my own money on national and local Bitcoin advertising. I've directly spent more than $100K creating Bitcoinstore.com
If you don't like me,  I think you should come up with something of substance, rather than that I am a "twit."

I need to sell $850K per quarter in order to stay in the most preferential pricing group with the distributor.  If I can stay in this group,  I will be able to continue to directly compete on price with sites like Amazon and NewEgg.  If I don't make this sales target,  Bitcoinstore will continue on,  but with slightly higher prices.
