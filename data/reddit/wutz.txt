but now i don't want to buy them anymore because the price is too high :(

something valuable, useful. bitcoin is nearly nothing
edit: i should say nothing proprietary. someone can duplicate bitcoin, at no cost, and the new replicant will have exactly the same qualities that bitcoin has.

you are completely correct, in my opinion.
further, i think that deflation will be a big issue with bitcoin if this trend in its pricing continues, and it will become pretty worthless as a currency, as opposed to an investment. you need the monetary base to grow over time as the economic output grows over time.
maybe additional cryptocurrencies bootstrapping themselves onto bitcoin will in a sense give it that capability. the market will remove a flaw that bitcoin has intentionally programmed into itself.
maybe something like that.

live and learn i guess. you have the ability to predict these trends before they happen so you have the skills necessary to potentially do it again. just stay in it next time i guess

you sound like somebody who is eventually going to lose all his money no matter how much you make

maybe you can pay someone to go through your old hard drives again and see if they can find something you didn't?

internet forums are a great place for advice of any kind. the internet is not the seedy backroom like it used to be. plus where else are you going to get advice on an INTERNET CURRENCY, if not the internet?
