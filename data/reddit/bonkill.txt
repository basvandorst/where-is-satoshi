If anyone is interested in monetary systems on minecraft servers hit me up. I have seen and explored a ton of them. There have been a lot of concept servers which just try to add some commands and a bitcoin denominated currency. The best example I've seen is actually a black market exchange running on a hardcore server where people sold diamonds for btc over the counter. 
I run a server that allows you to purchase diamonds from players for btc (or whatever you prefer). We also accept bitcoin donations. It is a political simulation anarchy server, our subreddit is @_date: 2018-01-06 01:08:20
&lt;24hrs usually.

Then fees will probably apply
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:18:55
Yes for withdrawals I believe, not for BTC in.
Edit: checked my assumption 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:13:14
Limit orders and market orders cost no fees on bitFlyer in the US.

Short answer is no. Talk with your tax attorney about your liability.

Yes, new account

Yes. Depending on your state, there are a handful of states which can't sign up yet, NV, MN, and a couple others

Doesn't work so hot on mobile, think you could include some screenshots of the examples you link to below the demo?

Vouch, in person payments don't make much sense

Because they'd have access to the device. You can do plenty of malicious things with physical access

Old and unrepresentative survey.

I take most of my inspiration from the dumpster fire that has been bitcoin cash lately

It's mainly a community event these days. Doesn't mean you can't participate!
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:45:50
Isn't this based on the assumption that all users will want or use btc?
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:51:17
Wow first time I've heard that joke
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:39:51
the Q/A suggests that you don't print more than 21m and adjust the halving to still hit that initial mark.

Cryptocurrency is online money. It's a store of value traded on (mainly) online exchanges. Right now you can sell one Bitcoin for around $606, at multiple exchanges, all over the world.
In fact, people within the crypto space, don't even use that term anymore because it's too confusing. Digital money is the more acceptable term now.
To prove it is legitimate it needs to be opensource. 


Yeah, this is just entirely bullshit. Their 'blockchain' doesn't have transactions on it. They have no one actually using the currency whatsoever. Mining is the essentially the act of verifying transactions that occur on a network.


It depends on the mining algorithm. There is one type of model where a digital currency can use something called proof of stake, it allows people who own a lot of the digital coin to verify transactions, instead of just people contributing computational power. If this was PoW (Proof of Work) then you wouldn't need bullshit tokens.


Has your 'friend' been involved with other MLM schemes before? If so, he might not actually be an ignorant cuck. He might just be using the 'power of his network' i.e. scamming everyone he knows for his referral cut. There are a giant group of assholes out there that hop from MLM to MLM scheme. They know how to promote it, how to take advantage of people, and do it over and over again.
Your friend might be innocent, but there's nothing you can do higher up the food chain. They're in on it.


List that website by trading volume and that'll show you which coins are actually getting bought and sold. That doesn't guarantee they're legitimate, I've seen a couple MLMcoins listed on there already.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:32:37
An important fact to point out that early in a MLM/pyramid scheme people who DO know it is a scam work to promote the scheme so they get a % of the profits before it collapses.

Fairly certain they're hedging their risk
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:24:30
Are you referring to Bitcoin, BitcoinWIT, BitcoinSeg, BitcoinLightning, or another fork?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:15:48
To their regulators, not necessarily to customers imo.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:53:14
Yw I definitely copied it
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:54:57
Mainly because it doesn't make business sense not to. They're not a crypto company though, so don't expect transparency.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:53:32
When is your ico
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:24:29
Some states don't require a license to operate there. That's why CB doesn't list a license on their page but lets you sign up. If they allowed you to sign up you're probably fine.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:26:50
Look at the founding members lol, it was never about Bitcoin

The question is whether at this stage Bitcoin as a base layer is better than other projects.
I don't think it will be especially considering how slow it is to actually put forth changes to allow it to be a base layer (or have sidechains, or have faster transactions)
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:00:58
Without implementation it seems kind of meaningless doesn't it?
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:57:13
Microsoft/Minecraft recently just started blacklisting servers. They make it so you can't connect through their servers to get an authentication token to play on the blacklisted server.

Innovation has already stopped. I feel like major changes or potential innovations are just spinning off and forming their own alternative blockchain.

Way too true

Sent them a tweet [asking]( for clarification.

They shouldn't still be on 1.8 tbh
