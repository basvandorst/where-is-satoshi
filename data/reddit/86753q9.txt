Just bought silver eagles from JM Bullion. I was a platinum member at APMEX for the past 8 years. I just called APMEX and they said they had no plans to accept Bitcoin. Bye bye APMEX, hello JM bullion!

I'll send you my invoice from March 6, 2016 for the silver eagles I purchased. What's your email address?

I sent another transaction of 0.21 BTc with a .0007 fee and that is stuck too.

Thank you. I’m scared to use electrum bed use of the security issue they had last year.i have used BC.info to import with no issues. CN you think of a way my funds will be in danger if I import for just a couple of minutes? It seems that phone wallets are supposed to be insecure.
Thanks again

I have a similar story to yours. I told them to buy below $200. Then when it went to $20000 and crashed to $3000 they laughed at me even though I had made a very handsome profit. I can’t wait when it reaches all time highs again. I can’t wait. I’m good to laugh so hard!!
