I got the same message, although if I type in a value higher than $40 on the buy screen, it still says it's available for instant buy. I'm not sure which is correct I'll have to test it

Volatility isn't really intrinsic to Bitcoin. The reason for the high price fluctuations is probably mostly hype and whatnot. Once the technology becomes more accepted and mainstream, we'll probably see the price become much more stable. So instead of the price significantly changing in a matter of hours it could be more like changing over months or years

Probably worst case scenario is that some company discovers a major breakthrough in quantum computing and decides to attack Bitcoin. Although, in doing so they'd probably make the price collapse and they wouldn't make any money from the attack so this scenario is very very unlikely.

Most people don't use multiple wallets but all wallets generate a new address any time you receive coins. Helps with anonymity.

Not sure if Mycelium has an iOS app but it would probably do what you want

Not sure if this is what you mean by multiple wallets but any time you send to a wallet, your wallet generates a new address. A lot of people who own Bitcoin have accumulated it over time. Even though they are all part of the same wallet, the BTC they own can be spread over dozens of addresses. So the people who own 10s or 100s of bitcoins probably have their money spread over many addresses unless they bought it all at once or recently sent everything to a brand new address.

Mycelium for BTC on Android. Also Blockfolio, you can't add addresses but can add buys and sells to track portfolio performance for many coins

In Mycelium you can add a wallet's address rather than private key and it becomes watch only. This way you can verify that the wallet hasn't been compromised and there are still BTC in the address
