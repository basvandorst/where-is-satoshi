I know about Bitreserve ad Coinapult. The problem here is that i manage to lock a price, but at one point i still take a risk when i want to convert in fiat. I takes an hour to get bitcoins in a exchange and then i can sell them.

Dude I did some Bitcoin stuff, failed some start ups, if I learned something is that you can not do everything your self, so go find some co founders that bring the same value to this as you bring.
And second. Idea = 0. Even if someone steals your idea, you will have your vision.
If you think I can help you shoot me a message.
All the best.
