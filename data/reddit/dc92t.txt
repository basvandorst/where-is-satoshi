I'm glad they banned all the scam ass ads but it's certainly going to affect peoples perception.
I can't get ANY of my friends or family to buy any crypto at all.
They'd prefer to leave it in the dying banks making almost 0 % interest...

For some reason, the gaps always seem to fill. People said we'd never see sub 10K BTC again, but needed that to happen to fill the gap, it happened.... 
Sure seems like there's something to it...

What happened if yesterday you were having dinner and you walked in with 9500$ BTC, but by desert you had 8600$ BTC??
I guess you're dinner got more expensive.... I hope it was buffalo wings

You can buy thousands worth everyday. They will increase your limit if you keep spending X amount of $$ in a certain period of time. But you are definitely not limited to 150$ a week, no way, no how.... Not at CoinBase anyhow

You do realize that this past January you could buy 3500$ BTC and sold your BTC at anywhere from 12K - 14K just a few months ago. 3 - 4X your money in under 8 months, not too shabby...

IDK how much you have but if things are that dire, why wouldn't you have sold around 13/14K this year?? At least some of your stash to survive. After 20K, no one knew if we'd break 10K anytime again soon, but for anyone that could wait they got a 2nd chance to dump some of their bag...
If you bought it in 2014, I'll assume you'd be making one hell of as profit!!

Kidneys?? I sold a lung 1st so I could get on disability. Then I sold my kidneys and qualified for free dialysis.
It's a win win but you gotta know how to play your cards, err I mean your organs....

FOMO is a NO NO...
