Ohhh now I see why it's useful! If you move 1000btc that you had in your posssession for some time, it will have a big impact, but the same 1000btc moved 10 times during the same day will have 0 impact. The worst someone could do is move a huge amount every 24 hours, but that amount still would only be counted once and it wouldn't be as big as smaller amounts that are moved after being held for longer times.

Everyone should be responsible of the bitcoins they send since they know the transactions are irreversible and anonymous so I say : celebrate by opening a cold beer!

Open your e-mail client and search the fuck out of your old and archived e-mails for login to bitcoin-related websites, search on your computer or whatever note-taking app you use (Evernote maybe?)

Just started doing the same. It takes forever! I wish I had started mining when I heart about bitcoins years ago... stupid me!

According to the Bitcoin wiki, it could allow them to :
 * Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions   that previously had already been seen in the block chain.  
 * Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations  
 * Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks

I got 0.01 btc on brainwallet by typing a fucking obvious passphrase and I don't feel no shame in this!

I worked on a project on the MintChipChallenge, it was terrible. Mixing hardware and software, local and cloud, you needed to download and install certificates, it was complicated and very limited (windows/mac, android I believe)
It will never take off.

This is not getting nearly enough love! As a programmer who also manages a shit ton of his stuff with google docs, I love how you pull the info from blockexplorer right into the cells. Excellent work!

I like that. I wanna give you some tip but I have next to nothing :(

Yep. Bitcoins are cool and super interesting, but I have real investments and bitcoins are only "play money" that I can afford to lose.

Well since today has been crazy for Bitcoins I just opened a wallet and I'm trying to learn all there is to it. It's kind of confusing though, I don't get why I can't purchase bitcoins using paypal / credit card / online bank transfer. Anyone can shed some light on this?

I might need to give this one a chance after all, deposit by online bill pay is pretty kick-ass I think.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:34:54
I thought the mining was separate from the confirming transactions part. Thanks for clearing that up! 
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:50:16
I would say it's the same as selling your collection of magic cards on craigslist.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:05:33
You can find someone to meet in person at LocalBitcoins and have your bitcoins with no delay (other than finding a seller and organizing a meeting)
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:48:12
Do you have to fill out a bunch of forms and scan IDs and whatnot to do this? It's always that step that turns me off.

@_date: 2013-03-28 18:10:49
I'm not in the USA so I didn't know they have started trying to "regulate" it. Still, they have no way of proving that you are selling/buying bitcoins since your wallet is only random characters with no ID linked to it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:20:30
It all depends on your tolerance to risk. Lots of people would wait until they double their initial investment, take out their initial investment and let the "free money" grow.
If you want risk and don't care whether you lose it or not, because you believe the gains will be worth it, you can do it! Make sure to also have real savings and investments other than bitcoins, having all eggs in the same basket is really a bad gamble.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:58:29
I think BitCoins are "things" that you own just like you can own a website (or a domain name) or a WoW account. It's virtual, but you own it and you can sell it. If you buy a domain name for $10 and sell it for $100, do you pay taxes on that? You probably won't, unless you made a business or buying and selling websites and it's your main source of income.
Just like you can buy a bike in a garage sale and sell it for more on craigslist later on. Would you pay taxes on that? I don't think so. I think BitCoins work a bit the same way. You own BitCoins, they're not an investment, or cash, or a money-laundering thing. It's just things that you own virtually. Remember that just because right now BitCoins are growing in value a lot, doesn't mean they will always be worth a lot! 
@_date: 2013-03-25 12:30:59
TIL Bitcoins are even more awesome than I thought! Thanks for the really well-written post
*Edit : Follow-up question : Right now I have a miner running on my computer and it's generating a couple mBTC at best. If I run the bitcoin client and wallet on my computer so that it can process transactions and confirm transactions, does that mean my client will also generate some mBTC from those processed transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:55:35
Is there any service that lets you link your bank account juste like Paypal does? With Paypal, you can put your bank info and Paypal verifies by depositing two small amounts into your account. Then you can withdraw from that account. The only options I have seen so far to fund bitcoins have been with wire tranfers where you have to actually go to your bank (so not really online funding)

Forex has "solved the problem" that they faced because they use real brick and mortar institutions and these are open from 8 to 5 in their local timezones. By using different market centers around the world they can run continuously from Monday morning to Friday evening, which is fine for Forex. 
Bitcoin is NOT in this situation and therefore, we don't need to "solve the problem". Why take a solution that was designed around brick and mortar businesses and adapt it to Bitcoins when the problem it was made to resolve does not exist? 
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:08:34
It would be against the whole concept. Nobody controls bitcoins so why would we need an opening and closing time? Also, in which timezone would we do these opening and closing? Opening and closing on normal business hours in the US means a completely different thing in Europe or Asia. 
We just have to accept that trading during week-ends will be different than trading during weekdays!
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:37:05
Thanks for the tip! 
I'm still hesitating if I should buy some hardware or not.. It's not that I don't have the money for it, I just don't know if it would be a worthwhile "investment". Right now I'm pumping only 40MH/s on an old laptop (the only computer I have!)
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:08:39
I still don't understand why this value is important? It seems to me like it's a completely random way to see how much bitcoins are moving. Why would the same amount of bitcoins but older would be worth more than newer bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:22:26
Same thing for me, without banking and verification issues, I would have bought around ~65$/btc, but I just bought yesterday instead. I only bought a reasonably small amount that I don't care if I lose it. I will definitely buy more if it goes down though.
