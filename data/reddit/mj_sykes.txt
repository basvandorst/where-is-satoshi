Since I am not aware of any regulated cash-settled futures contracts for ETH and LTC, I assume this fund will buy and hold actual BTC, ETH, and LTC.  This is very bullish IMO, even though it will only be open to rich people.  
I suspect the first bitcoin ETF's to be approved in America will invest in cash-settled future contracts instead of BTC, which will be less bullish (but still good).

Square's "Cash App" is expanding the number of customers to whom they are providing bitcoin services.  I'd check them out first.

I'm sorry for your loss.
Most people have no idea how hard it was for early adopters (who paid attention) to consistently and repeatedly decide not to sell their bitcoin through all of its violent price swings and negative media attention.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:26:26
I have a similar mindset.  However, I suspect it helped a bit that even after your million dollar paper loss, the value of your Bitcoin was still greater than it was at the beginning of this month.

GDAX will pay the tx fee.  However, if you just use GDAX to avoid tx fees without making trades, they may close your account.  The good news is that the trading fees on GDAX are much lower than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:21:48
You will receive the 2X coins, but you may not have a safe way to access your your coins for a while (you will not see your B2X coins in your Electrum wallet).  If you have a Coinbase/GDAX account, this may be a rare time that it makes sense to store your BTC with them during the fork.  Coinbase will split your BTC and B2X coins for you.  Then you can safely transfer your BTC back to your Electrum wallet (and sell your B2X coins on Coinbase/GDAX).

Bitcoin banks enable non-savvy folks to benefit from bitcoin, and we benefit from their participation.  Having just one bitcoin bank poses some threat to Bitcoin (i.e., excessive influence, single point of failure), but having several bitcoin banks would greatly reduce the danger.  It's not unlike Mt Gox.

Do you really believe Jeff Garzik will keep Bitcoin as secure as the core developers have kept it all these years?  Do you think he will make more improvements to the user interface of Bitcoin than the core team?  Have you compared his lack of contributions to the bitcoin protocol to the accomplishments of core developers?
The idea that tons of people would start paying for their groceries with BTC if only transactions were faster and cheaper is just stupid.  These CEO's are not that stupid.  I want to understand their motivation.

Why so rude?  
Coinbase offers custodial wallets and even "vaults" that simulate a familiar banking experience for customers.  They enable people who know nothing about limit and market orders, or bid and ask prices, to easily buy Bitcoin.  They even have FDIC deposit insurance up to $250,000 USD just like banks.  So no, they are not like other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:31:38
If you use GDAX, you won't have to pay the transaction fee to transfer BTC back to your Electrum wallet.  However, you should use GDAX to buy BTC (you will be able to trade B2X for BTC on GDAX) and not just to avoid tx fees, since they would probably view such use as abusive.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:10:23
Are you using free ACH bank transfers?  I'd expect the limits to be higher than for instant purchase methods, and you might get lucky and catch a dip in price if you have to wait a few days.
You can also attend a Bitcoin meet-up group in your area and arrange a private peer-to-peer exchange.

Middlemen are not necessarily bad when we are free to choose not to use them.  We can choose not to use a bitcoin bank.  
Banks are not hated because they offer services to customers.  They are hated because they print debt money out of thin air and turn us into debt slaves.  They can't print bitcoins!  So let them offer bitcoin services instead.

You have ensured you will receive your forked B2X coins by controlling your private keys.  Whether or not your BTC is now more secure depends mostly on your wallet set-up, as well as the security of the exchange you were using.  If you are using a software wallet on a Windows PC, your BTC may be in jeopardy.  If you are using a hardware wallet, good job!  
After the fork, some people will likely lose their BTC when they try to access their B2X coins, by exposing their private keys to untrustworthy B2X wallets or online services.  If you have a Coinbase/GDAX account, it may be a good idea to let them hold your BTC during the fork so they can safely split your coins for you.  Then you can trade your B2X for more BTC (or USD) on their platform and send your BTC back to your private wallet for long term storage.

I would include "Cash App" as a promising new alternative to Coinbase for simple bitcoin buying and selling.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:41:48
As the biggest fiat on-ramp for newbies, Coinbase's continued support of S2X played a critical role.  They have a monopoly on bitcoin banking (since Circle gave up).
I think we should all ask our banks, brokerage firms, and investment management companies (especially Fidelity Investments) when they will enable customers to buy and hold Bitcoin in their accounts.  We need competition in bitcoin banking!

If segwit2x had been allowed to crash the bitcoin network, the value of your altcoins probably would have declined more than the value of my bitcoin.

The theory that Tether is being used to pump BTC assumes that Bitfinex is buying BTC with USDT.  These seems very unlikely to me.  Is there any evidence?
I believe Tether is being used to increase trading fees, by allowing customers to trade their BTC and other cryptos for USDT (without needing to verify their identity).  AFAIK, the only way for traders to get USDT is to sell BTC or other altcoins.  Thus, Tether could be exerting downward pressure on the price of BTC by making it easier to sell BTC.
If Tether disappears, it may help bitcoin.  I think altcoins would crash and a LOT of altcoins would be traded for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:24:05
Yup.  But if Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, or some big bank lets me buy and hold BTC with them in a ROTH IRA, I'll likely take that risk.  However, I mostly want to be able to refer confused newbies looking to make their first small BTC purchase to some company other than Coinbase!
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:52:34
Square's "Cash App" has begun to compete with Coinbase, and other competitors are likely to follow.  This will diminish the influence and risk of Coinbase.

Spam attacks conducted by a cadre of mining pools is not the best indicator of adoption:    As mining becomes more decentralized and competitive, these attacks will become more expensive and less common.
Moreover, the price of Bitcoin is a better indicator of its value than transaction volume.  Bitcoin probably needs to gain more acceptance as a digital commodity and store of value before it can challenge or replace fiat as a medium of exchange and unit of account.
It is not helpful to compare Etherium scaling to Bitcoin, since it is designed to serve very different purposes (and has a more serious scaling problem).  Even so, I am unaware of evidence that an increase in ETH transactions was caused by an increase in the maximum potential size of their blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:15:15
I suspect your questions are disingenuous and you are here to promote the agenda of big blocks and centralization.  For the benefit of newbies, here is a good video that talks about why fiat, Bitcoin, and other forms of money have value:     I recommend all the videos in that playlist.


If you believe this, then you should not be invested in Bitcoin or similar cryptos that are designed to be money.  Ethereum seems better suited to your beliefs.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:14:23
Banksters like Jamie Dimon do not belong on this list, since they are obvious bitcoin adversaries whose attacks are expected by our community.  Let's focus on the hypocritical snakes that pretend to promote bitcoin.

Increasing the maximum potential size of blocks will not increase transactions.  There are not enough Bitcoin transactions now to fill the blocks.  
Look at Bcash.  They have much larger maximum block sizes but smaller actual block sizes because they have fewer transactions.

The current volatility of Bitcoin is a serious impediment to its use as a medium of exchange and unit of account.   However, if you plan to hodl Bitcoin for a long time (as implied by the word "investment"), then it is not too volatile to be used as a store of value.  Why do you prefer to invest in assets like fiat which are virtually guaranteed to lose value over long periods of time?
I do not recommend using Ethereum for any purpose, though I do realize it has utility for folks that want to gamble on ICO's.

I have thought that a smartphone with a built-in hardware wallet might be what accelerates adoption, but securing the wallet's seed is still an issue.
In the wake of a hyperbitcoinization event, I suspect most people will rely on Bitcoin banks like Coinbase.  Though such banks could still be used by governments as a system of control like fiat banks, the control would be much less effective.  Either customers would be able to withdraw crypto to a private wallet to make censorship resistant transactions, or there will be a separate crypto-economy outside of bankster control. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:01:36
I do not understand why so many people are thanking and praising Coinbase.  They are still saying SegWit2x is an "upgrade" which may "temporarily create two Bitcoin blockchains."  It seems they still expect their B2X coin to destroy the value of BTC, in which case they will rename B2X as BTC.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:00:32
You gotta do some extreme mental contortions to think that BTC is "statist" and B2X is not.

If you buy a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet (or probably Trezor too), you can encrypt your 24-word seed with a 25th word of your choosing that acts as your password.  So you can write down the 24-word seed for backup and just remember your password (or write down a clue).  
The main advantage of hardware wallets is that they protect you from hackers/malware.

The Chinese government has absolute power to control corportions in China, and have recently demonstrated their intent to control crypto-related enterprises.  With other countries (e.g., Japan, Russia) threatening Bitmain's dominance of Bitcoin mining, China probably realizes they have a brief window to effectively attack or control Bitcoin.
The situation in America is less clear.  Although Coinbase is America's only Bitcoin bank, its power is insignificant compared to the financial, banking, and military-industrial-espionage industries whose funding depends on the government's monopoly on money creation.  Recent statements from some financial industry bigshots, including central bankers in other countries, reflect an awareness of  Bitcoin's disruptive potential.  
If the business model of Coinbase, Shapeshift and others is threatened by Layer 2 advances made possible by SegWit, how would segwit2x help them?  They certainly are not dumb enough to believe that greatly increased block sizes will cause a big increase in retail Bitcoin transactions.  
Bitcoin is on the verge of attracting big Wall Street money which could send the price into 6 digits.  How does Coinbase benefit from sabotaging this potential?  The chances that this 2x attack will harm Coinbase profitability seem way higher than it helping them.  
How does the ability to blacklist addresses help Coinbase et al., other than by making them a more effective agent of government control?
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:08:12


Financial institutions are able to engage in fraud and negligent incompetence with impunity due to their role as agents of government surveillance and control.  How many banking executives have been thrown in jail for libor rigging, fraudulently packaged sub-prime mortgages, etc?   As agents of the government, they all have a "get out of jail free" card.


Then why do you think money does not control the government?  It doesn't much matter whether governments are acting as an agent for large corporations, or visa versa.  It is a partnership.


I agree that their initial crackdown and regulation of exchanges was not necessarily "bad," and their banning of ICO's may be good.  However, I'm not convinced that their subsequent closure of all crypto exchanges was for any good purpose.  The fate of crypto exchanges in China remains to be seen.  However, it does demonstrate the government's absolute and heavy-handed power over businesses. There is no reason to think Bitmain is exempt from government control, and their actions raise suspicion.


I have little doubt that Coinbase is complying with government regulations.


There are many smart people in the Bitcoin space, as well as in the financial, industrial, and governmental institutions that Bitcoin threatens to disrupt.
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:56:19
Why would Bitmain undertake such risky attacks on the network from which they profit if not to appease government authorities?  
Why does Coinbase (and others) continue to support this new attack on the value of their customers' money if not to appease government authorities?  Who benefits from the inclusion of an ability to blacklist addresses in the segwit2x code?
