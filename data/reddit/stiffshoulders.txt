You invested more than you were comfortable losing. It is all on you that your life will be difficult now.

Look at the money that you are about to invest. Ask yourself: even if the chance of losing money is small, if I lose this money, will I accept the loss or will I actively look for a time machine to get back in time. If you're completely fine with it, invest it. Otherwise don't. It is not unfair. It is just stupid to gamble money that will get you into trouble if you lose it.
You're using your friend as an argument. Lets think about that again: if bitcoin would've dropped to 1 dollar after your friend took the loan, you'd think he was not wise buying btc with a loan. Now you're saying the opposite. If you go back in time before he bought them and had this same conversation with me, your argument, like it is today, would be: "hey look at my friend, he's taking a loan to buy bitcoin. If btc goes up after he buys it, he's smart. Otherwise he is stupid". See ? You can't use that as an argument. That is silly. Judge a man by his actions, not by their outcomes.

as for your gains, it doesn't matter which coin you sell. Think about it for a moment and you'll figure it out. 
As for taxation, at least for stocks it is usually first-in-first-out (FIFO), at least in my country. Don't know how that is for bitcoin.

If you get cancer in Finland the hospital doesn't rob you though. I got my face wrecked once and needed several stiches and glue. I got a bill for 20 euros.
