Exactly, I guess that's why it's a very small transaction. :)
Here in Argentina the "official" USD rate is 8 pesos, and the real market USD rate is near 13 pesos. Bitcoin of course is based in the real market rate, so using the card inside Argentina is very expensive. But we can use this to pay things online and abroad when we travel, without the oppressive government taking notice.

In Argentina we don't save in pesos, so yes, keeping my savings in BTC and using them with a bitcoin debit card would be great. But the fake "official" exchange rate of the peso (the one Visa legally has to use) makes that impossible without lousing money.
We already do what you are saying but without the debit card. The debit card will only make our life easier buying online when Bitcoin is not accepted or when travelling (with a regular card our government may call you if you make many charges abroad).

It added ARS (argentine pesos) using the correct rate and not the "official" government conversion. I was very positive surprised of that, I'm searching the code to see where is getting that rate from. :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:37:37
A 2000 BTC market order appeared in Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:43:10
The government, and all "official" conversions, say 1 USD = 8.5 ARS aprox. But the real rate, in the market, is 1 USD = 12.5 ARS aprox.
So most Bitcoin wallets, when using ARS, are getting bad conversions, because they take the "official" rates, that are wrong, since bitcoins are bought and sold at free market rate.
Argentina has this crazy things... :p
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:34:44

@_date: 2015-08-26 13:51:30
It's the most used wallet in Argentina because, together with breadwallet, they are the only ones that get the USD/ARS rate that defines de BTC/ARS rate fine (other wallets use a non available and non free market government rate).
I have 6 different wallets inside my Copay, some with even 6 copayers (3/6). Works great!
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:55:50
Yes, they are doing some changes, but they still work contacting them manually. They are the same guys from enBitcoins.com (pay service bills using Bitcoin in Argentina).
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:07:51
Yes, Argentinians knowing about Bitcoin are using Bitstamp with Spanish bank accounts (SEPA) for this. The rate is more convenient for sending money from Argentina to Europe, not from Europe to Argentina, but it will work both ways.
The rate is more convenient for sending from Argentina because bitcoins are cheaper here in Argentina because more people are using them as a fix for capital controls, but there are more of them using it to bring money than to send money. So we have more "imports" of Bitcoin than "exports", and that makes the market to have too much supply, which makes you having to sell bitcoins locally at lower prices, like Bitstamp - 3%. But this makes it perfect for buying here and selling in Bitstamp to send to european bank account. :)
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:09:03
It's bad for us, the ones that also use bitcoin for saving. ;)
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:26:17
Also, Circle usually works better than Coinbase for this kind of thing. Argentinians don't have SSN and Coinbase asks for that for some options. And Coinbase uses geolocation forcing to create an Argentinian Coinbase account that can't be linked to US bank accounts.

Works well. But ShapeShift is also working well now with this provider.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:09:49
Many are not updated, but they are not really fake. Most of those shops are from owners who are also bitcoiners. It should work in most of them, but sometimes an employee has no idea of what bitcoin is and they are not prepared to manage the transaction.
BitPagos is the most common payment processor here in Argentina, BitPay following (Bitcoin only, no fiat conversion from them), and others use a regular wallet.
edit: grammar.
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:20:08
Unisend.com works, but its volume is pretty low, here some options:
- bitex.la (cash, AstroPay, etc.)
- satoshitango.com (cash, banks, Pago Fácil, etc.)
- digicoins.tk (cash, banks, PayPal, etc.)
- bitcoinbrothers.co (banks)
- ripio.com (banks, Telerecargas, Pago Fácil, etc.)
- argenbtc.com (banks)
- vircux.com (Pago Fácil, Rapipago, etc.)
Make them check facebook.com/groups/BitcoinArg since they can get far better prices using p2p there. Usually prices like Bitstamp - 3%, so they can get even more money in the US than what they originally have in Argentina.

One thing that most non-argentinian bitcoiners don't know is that bitcoins are cheaper here in Argentina. Prices go from "Bitstamp" to "Bitstamp - 5%", never "Bitstamp plus something".
This is because of capital controls with a false official exchange rate (official exchange rate for dollars is 30% less than the free market rate that you find in the streets).
So many people use bitcoins to get fiat money inside of Argentina, and that is making us to have too many sellers.
edit: grammar.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:52:02
Bitcoin is precisely used to bypass capital controls. For example, tomorrow here in Buenos Aires I have to sell 35 BTC for someone wanting money in a bank account in Spain (a woman of more of less 50 years old buying bitcoins to sell them in Bitstamp and withdraw to spanish bank account). She does this regularly.
It's not something popular, but it's getting bigger. I believe that most transactions from Bitex.la are similar cases.

@_date: 2016-10-12 03:04:26
Hi, we have a modular validations panel. We have some options available now, but we will soon be adding more, like checking id cards and even importing existing CA certificates.
If you mean legally, in USA (ESIGN act) this would be an electronic signature. In Europe, where you have many categories, this would be advanced electronic signature because of its cryptographic verification.
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:33:57
Hi! Using a blockchain doesn’t change digital signature legal status, but it gives the advantage of adding certainty about how those signatures and timestamps were preserved, providing proof that they were not replaced.
Nonetheless, most platforms for signing documents provide electronic signatures, but that’s not exactly the same as a digital signature. An electronic signature could be a photo of your hand-written signature, while a digital signature solution like ours uses a mathematical scheme to demonstrate its authenticity. In short, digital signatures are more secure and enforceable.
Edit: furthermore, there are features not possible without a blockchain, [here]( some examples.

On my iPhone 5s, without being already in memory (clean startup), loading and showing balance takes 6 seconds aprox. After that scanning QR and sending is more or less without delays. It should be faster in newer iPhones.
My coworker has a LG Optimus L7 II phone with Android and its true that Copay there it's slow. But I always see her phone as the reason, since mostly everything in her phone is slower.
She used to have Mycelium and it worked fine, but we make her change to Copay (sorry about that) because of the copaying functionality and Argentine peso real exchange rate support.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:13:20
I got it, many friends too, but it was months of waiting. It works great.
@_date: 2015-10-15 23:07:15
The article is wrong about Argentina, it happens the opposite.
Bitcoins are sold at Bitstamp/BitcoinAverage price less something, usually 1% to 5% less.
This is because of capital controls. People are using Bitcoin to receive money from other countries without the Central Bank stealing part of it. So they receive bitcoins as payment from abroad and they sell them. That makes the market to have too much supply, which makes you having to sell bitcoins locally at lower prices than most countries.
It's sad to read this type of "research" that doesn't even try going to "Bitcoin-Argentina" Facebook group and reading the posts where we are selling our bitcoins at "Bitstamp - 2%".
edit: grammar.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:43:34
My picks in order of preference: Copay, breadwallet and Mycelium.
@_date: 2015-10-21 04:58:02
Works great on my iPhone 5s. It may be slower than breadwallet, but the speed is good enough.
Main advantages I see from breadwallet:
- Support for selecting the BTC unit (breadwallet only shows bits, but using bits for newbies is very confusing when most people use BTC as unit, so I never install breadwallet when teaching about Bitcoin).
- Copaying features. I had 5 different multisig wallets with different people and works great (it could be even better if it gave notifications when a payment request is made).
- Notes on payments (important when using multisig with more people, so they can know what the payment is for). But also has some use in personal wallets.
Main disadvantage I see from breadwallet:
- Not SPV.
Not sure about Mycelium, I have never tested iOS' version because it does not support Argentinian real exchange rate (Android version added it in the last release).
