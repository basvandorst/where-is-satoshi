This is the kind of delusional thinking we can get behind!

This is to economics as homeopathy is to medicine.

I must have been brainwashed in university, learning all that wacky "actual economics". If only I had spent my time worshiping Mises.

Shhhh, it doesn't matter if you can *use* bitcoin, it's the goods and services that have to become useful!

It's all a conspiracy to get you. Why is calling something homeopathy an insult?

A spurious accusation based upon nothing. When the closest te average anarcho capitalist has come to a university classroom is Mises.org, I think I'll take studying in a top 0.1% University any day.
Uni econ is a lot more actual learning and a lot less angst ridden reading of books you pick up when you're 17 because you're having a tantrum about the evil state.

I didnt "take" economics, I have a bachelors degree in it. Do you equate studying a fringe philosopher with worshiping? Or is the problem your comprehension of the English language?

Oh, no, he's central to mainstream economic thinking, Austrian economics isn't regarded as quackery by everyone economist outside echo-chamber think tanks, not at all /s
Under which module did you study Mises, quants? Macro II? Economic policy analysis, advanced econometrics? I want to know which class I missed.

I didn't attack anyone's character.
