Not quite.  It's fascinating to watch in hindsight.  He paid 2700btc for a bunch of mining boxes, some never arrived from China, and the others arrived so late that they were out of date and incapable of ever mining the coins back. Sounded like he still had a lot of Bitcoin though.  The other stories are good too.

[The Rise And Rise of Bitcoin]( would be painful to watch now.  I recall one of the guys in the documentary sold 1700btc (when it was like $4) to buy some mining computer that's probably worthless today.
EDIT: I'm rewatching it, it's actually fascinating to watch it again.

Use the George Costanza method. If every instinct you have is wrong, then do the exact opposite.  So learn to short sell instead of buy.

There's all kinds of posts and comments getting deleted.  Just scroll through the list.  Bitcoin crashes all the time, the only difference is this time it's been a long time since the previos crash.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:35:47
Protection against hyper-inflation, same fundamentals that keep commodities like gold from going to zero.  It's protection against the dollar collapse scenario that people have been predicting for years.  I've seen the same hype cycle previous times around oil and gold stocks, but bitcoin's rise eclipses all of them by a longshot.  This time is different (sort of \/s).

The top chart is a "candlestick" chart used by traders.  Pretty standard, it's like a line graph with just a bit more information about the ratio of sellers/buyers at that day/hour/minute or whatever time frame you're looking at.
I don't know what the bottom chart is called, but it's helpful to show how many bitcoins have to be purchased until we reach a certain dollar value.  You go across and see if 800 bitcoins were sold right now the price would fall to $18,900, or going the other way if 1600 bitcoins were bought the price would be at $20,700.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:25:25
The correct answer is "What's Bitcoin?".
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:29
If a sell wall exists it can also mean a trader with lots of money is short sell at that price and might have enough money to keep short selling long enough to exhaust all the potential buyers out there.  That kind of stuff definitely happens.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:26:57
PepeCoin surged 11% yesterday.

Yeah whenever Bitcoin goes down its probably the Illuminati, because they regret not buying under $5000.

There's a wall at both 19.9k and 20k that add up 1200btc:

To be fair, it did look super froathy at $9700 when grandpa invested.  Like it shot from 4000 right to 10,000 without any pullback.  Grandpa had serious balls of steel and shows us how it's done.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:19:37
It's more than one person selling their bitcoins, if you add up all the bitcoins for sale up to $20K, there are a total of 1200 that need to be purchased before the price will climb above $20K.

You need to watch altcoin prices relative to Bitcoin, not USD.  Most of them are down 5-10% relative to Bitcoin.  Bad, but not unheard of.

My first experience with Bitcoin was here on Reddit (different account).  Someone gave me a Bitcoin tip of 0.03, worth $400-ish now.  Might have been him.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:28
Yeah on a selloff there's nothing to stop the price from falling. If a big whale came in and made a huge buy order at $19,000 that would make a "buy wall" and prevent the price from dropping until all his order is filled.  This kind of stuff is routine in the stock markets and is how all the banks like Goldman Sachs manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:04:16
There are many outrageous claims being made about bitcoin's future.  Take them all with a grain of salt.  The price might not "get back to $20K in the new year".

That guy is an idiot, immediately disregard everything he says.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:56:01
If the price drops below the recent lows (11K) it's going to be a bloodbath.  If you aren't getting out, be prepared to HODL for a while.

That correlation was eventually going to break down.  The price just can't keep going to infinity unless the US dollar goes to zero.

Buyers Beware.  If a crash ever does happen, it is going to be historic.  After it spiked up to $260 back in 2013 it crashed down 77% back to $60.  That would be like crashing down to $1690 from today's price.

@_date: 2017-05-04 13:12:06
That's what's so douchy about his whole book.  He didn't have the discipline to really learn any martial arts and doesn't have the ethics to understand why using a loophole in the rules is unsportsman-like.  
And this guy is such a complete douchebag that he thinks these are admirable attributes.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:43:26
I think the developers should seriously consider changing the software to split bitcoins up into a much smaller WHOLE NUMBER denomination.  Like maybe just move the decimal place so 1btc becomes 10000 btc, or maybe just make individual "satoshis" the new bitcoins and completely eliminate the concept of fractional bitcoins.
