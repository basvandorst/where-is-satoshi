There is no proof that he is Satoshi. IF he was Satoshi, it'd be extremely easy to prove it, but he refuses to do it. This guy is pathetic.

"We're working on processing all withdrawals but as you can imagine we have a lot of withdrawals in processing and we're manually doing all of them. We'll have them processed asap." by @_date: 2016-08-03 23:40:42
He's not Satoshi

He had a desire to go public. If you want to to tell the world you are Satoshi, you better bring some proof lol

Monterrey, Puebla and Mexico City. I think there is also another one in Guadalajara but not sure about that one

There are also 3 Bitcoin ATM's in Mexico.

electricity?.. what?.. aren't they already mining anyways? couldn't they just agree that that block was not good for society?.. every miner pays for his own electricity, don't they?

I am creating this campaign to help fund my trip to study abroad. This will be a great experience for me to expose myself to another culture, take courses at Pompeu Fabra, as well as living in another country for 3 months.
I will also be conducting research on my own of decentralized cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin. I'll be focusing on transaction graph analysis and business models for cryptocurrencies services and intermediaries.

It was a simple question, don't know why you gotta act like a dick. Bitcoin transactions are not 'irriversibly' secure, you can change a transaction in bitcoin if you have enough mining power, which could be possible if all bitcoin agrees that a block or something was not beneficial for bitcoin, such as the FBI seizing coins or this guy stealing the coins.

Maybe, but not good enough to convince skeptics

This is a terrible interview

When things like this happen, couldn't all the bitcoin network get enough computing power (51%) to recover the bitcoins?.. And maybe just donate those bitcoins for charity or something.. instead of a thief having them.. Is this possible?
@_date: 2016-09-21 05:38:31
I'd say people exchanging BTC to ETH

I really like Circle as well, the only complaint I have, if any, is that the limits are pretty low.. I've already requested for a limit increase but never heard anything back from them.. I've only been a customer for 3 months or so, maybe is because of that.

I used Coinbase for 2-3 years without any trouble, until they decided to close my account and refused to give me any reason. Coinbase sucks.
