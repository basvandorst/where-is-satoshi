Hi Sam, Frenchie here. Probably best if you delete/cross out the "javascript vulnerability" paragraph. Until we've seen further evidence to contrary, it looks a lot like a phishing scam.

I run the [Bitcoin Melbourne meetup]( with the coinjar guys, +1 vouch. Nothing but the highest levels of professionalism.

Interviewed the dude, he's a core dev. "You don't know what you are talking about."

Definitely looks like google phishing on authcd's domain.
Best to report to google:

There is no javascript exploit, it was just phishing.

The Big4 (Westpac, ANZ, NAB, Commonwealth) Australian banks have it clear that they're not supportive of bitcoin in Australia.

Another link with more details, and 4 draft offerings, which are open for comment (at the bottom).

Are you kidding? The amount of traffic this will have generated will be very profitable for her employers. Scandal = page views = profit.

I am a security consultant, and I run the Melbourne bitcoin meetup with Sam Lee. We went through his evidence last night, and in my opinion there was no javascript exploit, just a phishing scam, followed up with Social Engineering.

You can apply for them now:  They just released the first 100, with rumours the next batch is coming soon...

Exchanges help with transferring in &amp; out of bitcoin, eg: YEN, USD, AUD, etc.
Someone has to deal with the existing infrastructure, to help you get your bitcoins.

I love that across 3 different comments you've received very different responses for raising a very valid point about security &amp; privacy.
You're doing good work.

There are multiple ways to redirect a web request to an unintended destination, but the easiest uses a bit of javascript.
Here's an example: 
A rough English translation:
Select every link (represented as 'a' for anchor in HTML), and when clicked, change the link destination attribute (represented as 'href' for Hypertext REFerence) to " This is executed after you release the click, but before your browser is told to follow the link, meaning that what you see isn't necessarily where you end up.
TL;DR: Runs javascript code to change the destination on the fly.

A coworking space - The York Butter Factory, Melbourne CBD.
Contacting the owner to find out exact rates, will edit when I find out.

Bad luck mate, Melbourne. It may travel up north though...

Taken today at my work. Had a play around with it and introduced a lot of new people to the concept.

Good question. Screen was what looked like a nexus 10. Creators are   on twitter (on mobile, sorry). All I can say is all transactions went through promptly all up a couple of BTC would have been bought between 20+ people.

Already done.  Birmingham, UK.
NSFW, obviously.

Looks down from  as well.

Rotating around the city between coworking spaces at the moment. Permanent home to be announced.

Edited, on mobile. Must have grabbed the news article that linked to it.

This still going? I'd love a shirt.

Check out flattr if you haven't already,, on mobile so no link, sorry

Just fyi, it's trivial to change the destination of the link on click. Looking at the link provides little guarantee it's going to the right place.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:56:07
Correct! It was pretty easy to be honest.
1. Tap start
2. Scan receiving QR code for my wallet
3. Insert bills
4. Tap send.
Confirmation time varied based off of providers. I'm still waiting to hear back which merchant was backing it.

Honestly, it's nothing to be alarmed about. If the site owner wants to maliciously deceive you, there are many ways they could do it.
This also has legitimate use-cases, e.g. append queries to a URL before submitting the link (off the top of my head).
I just wanted to be clear that while checking the link before clicking is a good idea, it's not a fool-proof system.
