Damn, I thought bitcoincore was a new spinoff genre of vaporwave and nightcore.

Bitcoin has no rivals, only imitations.

I once heard the phrase money is power.
If your money is distributed, then what is your power?

This would make someone think that Watergate was an intentional scandal.

Very nice graph. Anyone familiar with Bitcoin's previous crashes can tell, we will be correcting up to 30,000+ in the next 6 months.

As someone who has taken several networking classes and holds valid networking certifications.
This is a grand failure on the part of all autonomous route exchanges between ISP's.
Events like this prove that you need some dummy employed somewhere, to hit the nope button.


No, BGP operated per it's specification.
If you want a better internet, make better protocols, make better trust systems, or don't use ISP's that fully automate.
I've seen VSP take down a 300 node call center for 50 minutes, did almost $100,000 in damage during that time.
The minute one router says "Hey other routers! I'm smarter than you! Do what "I" say is correct!"
There really should be at least a little... "Are you sure you're smart...?"

Question: Why are companies attempting to represent digital assets with non-Bitcoin blockchain tokens? What is the meat and potatoes of the reason? (Referring to things like the 'Eliocoin' not any of the Roger nonsense.)
Why can't the types of functionality that allow for these digital assets tokens, just be a normal part of the primary Bitcoin chain?
Is this the inspiration for Gmaxwell's sidechain crew?

For those that will listen.
Satoshi will return in 2020 .
Unfortunately, I don't think anyone is going to like it.
We are all being taken for fools.
My advice, watch with careful eye, any transactions that pass through a munitions trade.
This is a little more specific than your typical gloom and doom conspiracy. I'm serious, back check large munitions trades on the blockchain between now and 2020.

No. Not sure where you made that leap.

Name as many mystery billionaires as you can.
Consider this: A nation or group without the means to stand on equal footing with one of the world's super power states.
If they were able to engineer some method, to redistribute wealth and resources in their favor...
Could their success be bought?
Hundreds of millions of Fiat dollars were wiped off the ledger, when Bitcoin plummeted from $20,000 to last low.
How many "people" lost something?
Can you find enough individuals that lost during the drop, to explain the amount that "vanished" ?
Where are the victims of that pop? Were there any?
The universal code, Q , Akashic Record , whatever you call it... It is an invisible hand, guiding those, necessitating guidance.
Shin &lt; "True"
Sato -&gt; ROT20
2020 , Munitions trade
If you choose to listen, you can hear the grapevine of infinity.
