Not that this belongs in anyway, but voting for nobody is useless (at least in America).  No one cares if you don't vote, you're not making any kind of statement, and you're doing nothing to change the status quo.  If only ten people in the US voted in the next election, a democrat or a republican would still be elected president just because of the electoral college, and the lack of a minimum required voter turnout.
We don't have a "no confidence" clause built into our governmental system.

So, I sell appliances for a living, and if you've even *touched* that world, you'd know Consumer Reports is LAW for your average uninformed person.
I say average uninformed person because the only time they take to research something is to rely blindly on Consumer Reports as their only source of information.
In all honesty, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing for these people to steer clear of bitcoin, just because they're the WASP-y, middle-agey, whitebread american who is too stupid to make their own informed decisions, and also votes in every election.  If they get involved and get scammed, they're gonna get burned bad, and they're going to blame it on everyone but themselves.  (happens all the time when they buy a shitty washer and then blame it on me instead of consumer reports).

Seems your downvote count disagrees.

I know you've got nice vocabulary going on here, but you're making a base assumption which is false.
I'm not saying that voting will change the status quo.  I'm saying that the act of NOT voting, by itself, does nothing.  Political discourse is, of course, more productive.  But you can have that regardless of whether or not you vote.
A politician only really cares if you vote IF you were going to vote for him/her.  They may publicly say, "Hey, let's get out the vote!" but in reality they don't want you walking into the polls unless it's to cast the ballot for them.  If you weren't going to do that, they don't want you voting anyway.
Again, I'm not being a proponent of voting, here.  I'm just saying that the idea that NOT voting, by itself, will do anything to change the system is just plain wrong.
(and yes, I'm well aware of the flawed and limited tenets of agorism)
Edit:  Also, if politics is the ultimate slacktivism, why do political systems always seem to come out on top of non-politically-oriented activists?

So basically what you're saying is that democracy doesn't function unless it's at least partially bought through advertisement.

Psh, joke's on you.  I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank with my $48.50 when we hit 12K again!

Bought my first $25 worth of Bitcoin this morning when it was still under 7K.  I'm rich now!
