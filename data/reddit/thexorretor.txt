There's also [transaction fees](


Transaction fees are voluntary on the part of the person making the bitcoin transaction, as the person attempting to make a transaction can include any fee or none at all in the transaction. On the other hand, nobody mining new bitcoins necessarily needs to accept the transactions and include them in the new block being created. The transaction fee is therefore an incentive on the part of the bitcoin user to make sure that a particular transaction will get included into the next block which is generated.


I don't much about Bitcoin, just applying textbook economics. As I gather, miners know if a transaction includes a fee. They could choose to mine based on the size of the fees are enough to pay for the electricity. In this scenario, the sender would have to include a sizable enough "tip" to get the transaction through. Since this would disadvantage bitcoins, it would reduce the utility of a bitcoin and hence the value.

Economic theory says that companies will cease operations when their variable costs are greater than the revenue -- in the short run. In this case, electricity is the main variable cost. If they are unable to make a profit over the variable costs and fixed costs (aka sunk costs)-- which is a higher hurdle-- they will shut down in the long run. When equipment breaks or becomes obsolete, they will cease operations.
