I sold out before the latest crash. Still not back to the price I sold. There are a few things that have come to my attention over the last month or so. You have the whales pumping it up, taking their profit. and out. They will make a few hundred on an order of 20 coins. Quick 4K in minutes. Then you have all the computer trading going on. Human beings can not think that fast. I have also experienced orders not being executed on Gdax. And yes I know about all the different ways to buy and sell without incurring fees. One more thing. Now the CBOE has option contracts. This could and firmly believe the price is manipulated. Hodl? I get it but once on paper, you lose 50%, it's hard to watch and hope that it will come back. On March 1st, I did a whole analysis myself. I write down on a piece of paper it's going down to between $X and X. Using the midpoint is the exact price in which I should have bought. If in fact, the cause of these declines is because of this Mt Cox dumping I have read about, when are the next 140,000 coins going to be dumped? 
Do I think it will ever get to 20K again? No, I don't. I think at this point let's see if it can break 12K. And that standoff yesterday at around 8.1 or 8.2... One big order out of the blue would have caused it to decline to a lower level we have seen since 2-2-18. So I will wait until I feel comfortable again at the next entry price. I've bought on bulls and bears. The one fellow on here said he buys once a week since 2012. That's great and makes sense if you started back in 2012. Let's say someone started in Nov. 2017 to date. Do the math and see. You would have x coins and your B/E point would be 30% higher than today's current price.

SoloadsCa is correct.
In order to even hit 11K, it needs to drop to between 5K or 6K. 
November 12. 2017... $5,600
February 6. 2018.......$6,048  volume over 18Bil
The current Sell Walls:
9130 - (164) BTC
9100 - (103)
9000 - (214)
8900 - (129)
I saw a buy wall at 120 coins get gobbled up in 1 second and proceeded to go lower by another few hundred points.
Check CoinmarketCurrency for historical pricing. 
Last Volume in trading was 4 billion??
The robots are taking over trading! Be smart folks.

The best thing about Bitcoin is that right now whatever price you buy at, it will go either up or down. I bought at a high of $11,729. It dropped to around $10,200. The major cause 0f these crashes is PANIC. That is the only reason it has such extreme dips. Plus GDAX should do a better job executing the trades to the penny. As all of you have seen, the trading board should not sit for 5-10 minutes. This fuels an explosion. Plus they are executing trades at higher and lower rates than what BTC is at. The good thing about panic selling is that it clears the way for the next high. I base my buying and selling on the order book zoomed out to $10. A good flat vertical sign on the buy or sell side is a very good indicator of when to buy and sell. I call these $5 or $10 vertical lines soldiers. Price  right now $10,835 and not enough green verticals to go higher. Yup now at $10,797. Hope this helps. A lot of sellers and buyers making huge mistakes without looking at this verticals. Remember not to invest more than you can lose. It looks like we may wake up tomorrow at 10.9 or 11K, Good luck everyone.

And the 11-12-17 low of $5,600. But if China bans or other Countries, it may go down to $1,000? I would like to be optimistic, but it does not look good right now.
