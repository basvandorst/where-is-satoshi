You know, for the longest time, "buy the rumor- sell the news" has never made any sense to me. In the whole span of our euphemisms, it just escaped me. I literally couldn't wrap my head around the logic because it's almost a fact, at least in these waters. But this makes me get it-- the rumor is seductive,  you heard from mike that jessica slept with tommy, but the news as it does breaks your heart because she really did.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:13:06
Maybe not, but my gut says you're going to be really surprised-- I find it *highly* unlikely they never move. There's no reason nor rationale to retain a fraction of a limited resource without a cause, or idea behind it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:05:28
That timing of of the question, "what do you fear--" is eerie. It's, I hate to say it, but it's almost... prophetic 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:45
Then what do you make of the receding correction last week that fell to almost the exact price of the CBOE shorts and rebounded instantly upon their close?
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:14:41
Haha while entertaining, I don't believe anything to do with Satoshi-Bitcoin is a con. Just simply trying to put myself in the shoes of whoever is behind this-- if I developed this entity, why would I retain 1million out of 21 million? What would be the point? Maybe it's a hidden script tucked away on an offline node that turns on when the 21 million is reached. It's definitely a fun fantasy to toy with.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:09:10
just spit-balling, not hoping for anything-- just trying to put myself in the shoes of this reasoning to retain one million

You're not alone, there's a few other threads posted about it currently. Not sure what's going on-- apparently, they are not broadcasting the transactions though, which I'm not quite sure what that means. Like I know it means you can't search for the transaction but, I'm not sure if its good or bad?

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:47
Here's my concern: the rhetoric they're pitching to the masses seems to have shifted from "stay away it's a fraud, ponzi, drug money, terrorist funding, etc" to "it's a curious technology" to now, "bitcoin isn't too late to buy"
Why? Don't let this question give way to biased thought but, have they finished accumulating?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:17:46
GDAX and Coinbase have been *wickedly* slow the last few days. Sent a transaction last night, took 12 hours. Sent a transaction today, 3 hours and counting...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:03:20
I'm going to go out on a limb here, since everyone seems to be saying *literally* the same thing.... what if the futures don't do anything but add to the legitimacy of bitcoin? 
You figure, bitcoin ran and rallied just fine these last few years without futures involved, now you have an intangible asset that is trying to be separate but attached to bitcoin? Doesn't make sense from bitcoin's standpoint. It's like saying if GBTC tanks, bitcoin is going to go with it-- when in fact, it's the opposite. GBTC falls when BTC falls. The two never even cross paths, GBTC being shares to the right of bitcoin, and not actually owning any bitcoin. You can't exchange GBTC for actual BTC, it's a fucking sham. And I see futures being the same way. They seem like two separate entities to me

@_date: 2017-12-02 21:15:11
yeah it did, sometime over the night. Never seen transaction times this long-- sent another one today lol... same situation
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:46:50
I'm not sure what's going on. I'm trying to do the opposite of you-- send btc to trex from coinbase. And it's been stuck at pending for almost 3 hours now, with no pending deposit on bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:14:33
No, no-- it happened around the time their servers kept getting taken down week after week. I read it somewhere, and haven't looked back. But, I'm just looking affirmation on that, I haven't been back since 2015

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:30
I'm seriously not trying to FUD, I'm trying to think rationally-- and as I see it, they are a US based company, on US soil, that is directly in the limelight of insider trading. They're going to get audited. They're going to get investigated. I would be very surprised if the SEC is just sitting around with their thumbs up their ass while this is going on in their backyard, unregulated or not

I think you guys need to start waking up to the fact it's probably far more than 5%... go look at your blockfolio's lol almost everyone who was in before last week has reached new monumental peaks. 
Even the title of this picture is "Consumption spreads faster today" annnd the final date is 2005 lol that was 12 years ago, we are in a MUCH faster era today. Between all the facebook posts, the media plasterings, and the questions even from my own parents... its much higher than 5%...
Stop living within the bounds of your own means, this is a global entity
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:39:33
Not going to lie, and try not to downvote me too hard for this but I used to admire this guy. Hell, he's probably the only reason I understand half this shit as much as I do but, it's kind of hard to listen to this guy anymore after he hyped up futures so much. "oh man guys, you just wait and see-- we are in for a crazy ride after futures get approved! haha oh you just wait" 
And as I write that now, reality makes the most sense out of his words there but... at the time, he genuinely hyped it up in *favor* of a price explosion. His enthusiasm, tone, every detail presented great things ahead and I know a lot of people heeded his words and bought really high. So, if he's sitting here preaching about why ETFs are a bad idea, I can't help but wonder if it'll be the single greatest thing for bitcoin in terms of price.

I'm in the same boat as OP. Except transferred to Bittrex. Up to 2 hours now. Pending on Coinbase with 0 confirmations and no pending on Bittrex side...
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:51:50
To even further expand on your point, I'm pretty sure they account volume into the mix too. 
When BTC was on a tear passed 10k, they were charging upwards of 400+ the current price before the additional charge upon purchase. So, if you wanted to buy at 10,200-- you were essentially buying at 10,600+fee
Then after it started to fall the next day, back below 10k, all of a sudden the fee was only 50+ the current price. So, you could buy 9,800 at 9,850+fee. Kind of bullshit if you ask me.
Also, use GDAX. No fees. Just have to link your account and wait the 4-5 days for your money to transfer
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:45
Someone didn't buy 3k lol or... like the person said above, one bought on credit and the other bank but even then at buying 3k on either credit or bank is at least 15-20$ either way. So I think one of the two didn't buy 3k
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:31:44
That delay bullshit is what made me come to crypto in the first place. It'll be a really sad day if the charts go from instant, to delayed.

Way too much trying to explain it to someone who has no idea, boil it down to: global e-cash. Then transition into your explanation by comparing email(ecash, bitcoin) to snail mail(fiat). The more simple the better
EDIT: I love your description. But in the purposes of blogs and appealing to the masses, in a world where we scan through twitter posts and facebook status updates in seconds, paragraphs cause a loss of interest very fast.

@_date: 2019-06-19 17:20:23
as a 30yo, it's a weird age. personally(the thinker), you tell yourself it's a cut off, which i'd assume stems from a belief as a child. outwardly(the experiencer), society really starts to treat you differently, even if it isn't direct, just certain barriers change or adapt like you're expected to pay more for a service, which probably strengthens the idea of how responsible you should be by now. and then lastly, i'd say is a spiritual awakening(the feeler). you put off a lot of dreams and goals in your teens through 20s because you can, at 30 you become more time sensitive to the fact this clock is starting to speed up. so all the little nuances you told yourself since you can remember, seem to be drawn together to a culmination of it's now or never.

This is sooo unbelievably true it is surreal. From a brand/marketing standpoint of customer loyalty, name recognition is probably thee most important thing. Think Apple(their direct slogan). And now, no one thinks of the fruit at first anymore. You think of a phone, or rather a company. Bitcoin is *synonymous* with the dollar, the euro, the yen, and so on. 
That is why there are so many god awful imitations-- bitcoin cash, bitcoin silver, first bitcoin, bitcoin dark, bitcoin plus... and probably another metric fuck ton to come. It's because of the name-- Bitcoin, which belongs solely to the one true king, whom we all know and love. Might sound corny as fuck but capitalism compiled with our conditionally undying obsession to buy *anything* feeds into the lifeblood of brand loyalty. They're brands you know you can trust. Bitcoin, you know you can trust. And that puts it soo god damn far above the rest that when you really fathom how much money truly resides between all the hundreds of alternative caps, it seems truly and utterly insane.

REMINDER: our notion of "crash" is about to evolve. Think about it... we were celebrating/fearing $100 milestones and swings. Now, we're in double digits-- we have been celebrating and will start fearing $1000 milestones and swings.
Look at the latest TWO "crashes" last night btc fell from 10,8 to 10,016 recovered into 11k+ in a few hours. And the one going on right now... from 11,2 to 10,5 rising back to 10,8 in less than 15minutes...

Yes bitcoin specifically lol even the video posted here today, the guy states that bitcoins value increases with every coin that is created on it's master ledger.
Bitcoin is a growing, breathing tree. Alts are its branches and ICOs its budding leaves. If an alt dies, the tree doesn't notice. If the tree dies, the *whole* tree dies.

@_date: 2017-11-27 05:21:55
Exactly this. The right of this page will gradually start to look like the left. What we see now is bitcoin battling with itself. It's trying to figure how who it wants to become, as anything that grows in due nature. These battles are nothing compared to what lies ahead. Fortunately, bitcoin is so far god damn ahead of the pack that it'd take a miracle for another one to catch up.

Good point, but come on... you have to admit-- we've seen three futures closures now and bitcoin has responded to a T to all 3 of them: massive shorts(correction), massive longs(the last two weeks), massive shorts(the last few days). Once is a coincidence, twice is not, three times is assured. Sure CME/CBOE futures volume doesn't even come close to a lick of volume in crypto, but you can not deny there is obviously manipulation afoot. Someone with a pretty hefty bankroll is playing both sides of the field and benefiting greatly. At this point in time, I don't see why you wouldn't just make the same bets on bitcoin that you can see being made on futures
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:40:37
Honest answer, you don't. Less honest answer, trend analyzation. Simple/exponential(up, over who gives a fuck) moving average on the down trend AND the mac-d is slipping down as well, bear mode incoming. Simple/exponential average on the up AND mac-d is on the slide, bear mode incoming. Simple/exponential on the up and up AND the mac-d too, bull run incoming. Of course, all must be cross-referenced with the volume of trades being sold or bought. But bada-bing-bada-boom, there's your crystal ball. It tells you nothing.
