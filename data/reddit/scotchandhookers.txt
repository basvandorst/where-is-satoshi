Not going to lie.   Strippers, booze and coke for me.

Nope.  Maxed out on credit cards.  Been without a hooker in months so I can buy as many Bitcoins as I can.  lol. Shits about to get real.

Guns are the perfect equalizer.  You can be a fat copd on wheelchair with oxygen.   Once you have a gun, you are equal footing with the muscular 6’9 home invader.   Sorry but a criminal invades your home, my life is more important than “feelings”.
Ask London how their crime rates.   Strict gun laws and impossible to obtain a gun.  But stabbings and acid attacks are through the roof.   Now they want to restrict knives.   What’s next?   Sticks?

I’ll see your 2.5 million XRP and raise you 525k Bitconnect coins.

Problem with China is that getting rich in communist economy is a no no.    Either you will end up in jail or dead eventually.

Why stop at 1k per month?  Lets demand 10k per month.  We deserve it.

Vietnam and Afghanistan population only had guns but gave lot of trouble for the US military using guerrilla warfare for years.  
I bet Hong Kong wish they had guns right now.  Too bad China will absorb them by force.

Exactly.   Especially if their fiat becomes worthless like Venezuela style.

In Colombia, no one really drive expensive and fancy cars.   It pretty much advertise criminals that YOU have money and should be kidnapped for ransom.  Just saying....  as the Bitcoin moon and fiat becomes worthless..... there will be desperate people out there.

That means your country is on a decline.   Decades ago, Sweden used to be the safest in the world.  Doors unlocked, very little crime.   Until they embraced feminism and open borders.   Now they are the rape capital of the world.  Just saying.......

I hear stabbings and acid attacks are through the roof.   Also terrorists love to use trucks to run over people.  Ban cars and trucks?

You should look up urban warfare.   Governments will not use drone attacks in their own populated cities and have to bring in military to do house to house searches.  That will be political suicide.   It’s not like in a war zone where you can kill people with drone discriminatory.  
Maybe you should stay off video games and movies.   Guns are just as dangerous as half a century or 20 years ago.    And from experience, once you piss off the local population, it makes your life much more difficult.  Doesn’t matter how advance your high tech weapons you have.   There are homemade pipe bombs, IEDs, infrastructure sabotage, etc.   Guns as toys lol.

Sucks for other countries where criminals have more rights than you.   Able to break in and steal your stuff.   Rape your wife and kids while you can’t defend yourself.  
Castle doctrine is a great law.  Break into my home, leave in a body bag.

What is this garbage?   Maybe women should chose degrees that pays more instead of bullshit degrees like Art, English, women studies, etc?  They don’t want to do the dirty work like mining, oil rigs, garbage disposal that pays more... but want equal pay.
