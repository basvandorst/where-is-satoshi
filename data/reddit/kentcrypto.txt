Yes you can. They have shapeshift inter grated

Pay how much? 900,000? It seems the gov wants it all. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:40:13
Sorry. What should I do?

Honestly, I’m new to this but out of all of the options I’ve seen, and I’ve seen many many option, OpenBazaar seems to be the best so far.

Actually, I think for starters, just to show people that Bitcoin can actually make a difference for a homeless person, I can find out who’s hiring to do some basic work for bitcoin, buy them a phone, set them up with Blockchain.info, show them how to use it and show them where to spend there bitcoin when they get paid from work.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:41:14
Ok, Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:50:08
I’ve been tempted to dabble into other currencies but I’m 100% about the bitcoin. I just don’t like the idea of putting my personal info on these exchanges. When a hacker decided that he is bored in his moms basement and wants to hack gdax or bittrex for fun, my info will be exposed.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:42:01
How can I sell this here? I really need to earn some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:31:52
Can you please explain. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:59:56
Go write No2x! And give those suckers ONE star! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:29:32
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:39:55
But OB2.0 acts as a payment processor. Right or wrong? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:19:02
Where’s your paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:56:19
Bitcoin is like Mayweather and the shitcoins are all 50 of his opponents. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:44:39
I was thinking about it. But that would mean I would have to get them cheap android phones. I wasn’t thinking of it from like donation at first. I thought with bitcoin becoming more and more mainstream jobs paying bitcoin are also going to become more and more normal. So suppose some of these employers hire homeless people...idk... maybe I sound stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:52:46
Omg! I just don’t know. All of this info circulated is making some of this stuff hard to believe. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:41:44
They are supporting the demise of bitcoin. All of these so called forks are an attempt to cripple bitcoin. That’s the way I see it. And I’m not the one who started this trend. I’m passing on the message. This is how you save the bitcoin you love. No2x
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:46:27
So they release private key to that wallet? Can I add my own wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:30:00
I’ve heard people say that there’s a limited number of bitcoin that can be created. If that is true, how can it bitcoin replace usd? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:52:20
Because I’m not a genius. I ask questions and I learn like normal people. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:44:01
No idea. They sent this to my brother so he can pay employees. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:18:20

Oh wow! Thank you. I’ll check out the link now. Once again, Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:03:24
Wow. You tried to discredit my post just because I’m a Reddit of 1 week. Sad. Just learning and spreading news. That’s all. Have a great day buddy.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:46:09
Nice one ��
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:53:06
You don’t think bitcoin is mainstream now? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:16:39
How is it “ a bit of cheerleading” and “ less than factual?” I honestly thought it would be helpful to inform others of the current price surge.  From the research that I’ve done, when these price surges occur people like to trade. So that is why I thought it would be helpful to add that here. But it seems like I’m wrong and a cheerleader for probably making a mistake. I’m new to all of this. Still learning. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:24:24
Currently have them listed on open bazaar but if you don’t use that then you can order them with me privately. No problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:20:19
Yea I know. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:07:39
I think Nov 16
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:31:11
Thank you. Greatly appreciate this comment. So what should I do to accept payments? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:03:00
I have a question. How can I expand to a wide range of people if buyers can’t even access openbazaar. Does open bazaar have an app? Because the majority of internet users, these days, shop via their smart phones. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:29:21
Take your bitcoin and shove it all the way up your moms ass.

Lol. Idk....
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:02:02
And how will that homeless person get access to the app? Because we will provide them with cheap android phones that will enable them to find free WiFi and find jobs paying with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:47:12
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:53:46
Thanks for info. I’m currently setting up my store now. One thing I’m kind of confused about is, if you’re not online does that mean no one will be able to see your store? Also, is there an OB app being made? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:43:10
Wow! Exactly! You took the thoughts right out of my mind.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:46:06
Satoshi would have 50 billion followers 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:45:42
Thank you!

Something may be wrong with your cards billing info and the information you have on file at Coinbase

When I document this on video, people will see how helpful it can be. Now, I’m not saying this will work for every homeless person in the world, but I’m 100% sure bitcoin can change the life of at least 1 homeless person. We need an app, like the Uber for jobs paying with bitcoin. That way it can be very easy for a homeless person to find someone who for example needs there lawn mowed or car shoveled out of a 10inch snow pile and get paid in bitcoin. Man, bitcoin can really change the world. Once homeless people start getting themselves back on their feet, they will also help more people with bitcoin. We need an app and more employers paying with bitcoin.

I thought a paper wallet would be the best choice for me as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:26:40
Free WiFi everywhere.

Haha, your right. Sorry about that. It’s probably afternoon or even night somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:59:52
Yes I know. I’m a little behind on that aspect of the financial system but I’m learning Day by Day. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:04:08
Who uses open bazaar? I barely hear any one speak about it and it seems as if I create a store their, no one will see my products.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:32:31
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:36:22
Can you explain what you mean in a more simple way? (Lol) Sorry, I’m new to all of this.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:21:37
Haha! ��
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:50:43
So this kind of technology is the same that’s being used with like google Authenticator?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:43:26
You’re welcomed. No problem. Have a great day. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:39:44
I created a store today. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:35:25
Give me .01018 and it’s all yours. Free shipping. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:46:36
No idea where to start with this but you’re right. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:18:14
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:28:00
Yea, I said the same thing. He said bitcoin was meant to be for storage and not currency which is not true. Actually it’s the opposite of what he said.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:31:26
There’s a lot of ways. But one would be to first give them a basic understanding of bitcoin and most importantly show them where and how to spend there bitcoin. They’ll find ways to get access to the internet, trust me. So if they don’t have phones we can provide them phones because they’ll need it for day to day transactions. If we were to give them a job that pays in Bitcoin they’ll just need to know the basics. Idk...Just thinking of ideas. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:25:24
I hope so.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:28:45
Great idea! Everyone needs to do this. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:35:23
So what does that mean? Sorry for me being slow lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:50:48
So when hacker decided to have fun with bittrex and Coinbase in his mom’s basement, all of my info will be exposed
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:05:13
Don’t get it, that would be his public key.
