1. A large part of the crypto market is in the hands of ameteurs - when it looks like they could lose a lot of money these ameteurs tend to panic and sell. This will contribute to a large sell off.
2. A large part of the market is controlled by proffesionals who have a tendency to book their profits, so after a hike they will sell large amounts of coins, which will eventually spark a breakdown.

1. You only have to walk into a café to hear someone talking about their bitcoin investment.
2. There are two large parts. The ameteurs and the proffesionals, who together make up the market.

I'm not arguing against rational investment. I'm arguing against gambling. The market is so volatile now that it is impossible to form a rational view based on an understanding. Very few people truly understand bitcoin, and following the doctrine of Warren Buffet, genuine investment requires an understanding of the fundamentals of the asset (or liability). 
FOMO is just hope, and as Napoleon told us, hope is not a strategy. I don't doubt that SOME investors understand cryptocurrencies, but most people are simply going out on a whimb with the belief that it has more potential, without any deep understanding of what is going on - they have been lured in by the sharp increase in value and hope it will continue.

No. I am an expert and this is my opinion on the future of bitcoin.

Herein lies the problem. Those who are too emotionally invested in Bitcoin can be prone to making personal attacks on world class experts who raise a noteworthy and legitimate argument.

Which type of adult are you? A zelot who can see only the upside, a pessimist or a realist.

Need I remind you that people were jumping off of buildings because of the wall street crash. A case in point.

Actually I made succesful investments and pulled out after making a profit.

You've just made my point. Thank you and thanks for the good luck.

I bought at about $400 sold at $15k. Make of that what you will

My proof is the history of bubbles. Wall Street Crash is a good example.
Too many people emotion trading in high volumes. At first sign of a potential crash alot of them will flake and sell. Breakdown time.

A large part can be less than half.

Why are you talking about bitter posts? My post isn't bitter. I think the bitcoin craze has been great fun. It's time to get out though.

Uneducated? Didn't realise 2nd year Econ student at Harvard was classified as uneducated.

Have you not read "what they don't teach you at Harvard"? There is a world out there you know.
