Okay that's good to know. Thanks. Not up for me either though. My "enter password" box is completely gone, I don't have the option to enter my password anywhere.

I think that's what it is. Fascinating how people can manipulate the price like this, it's much more viable to do in bitcoin than say the stock market or traditional currency exchanges because of such a small market share. Crazy stuff.

Although I don't mine bitcoins and don't plan to, just following the ASIC discussion, and race between BFL and Avalon is absolutely fascinating. Looks cool!

But why such a massive influx in the last two weeks? Has there been a recent surge in media reporting this month? I feel like it should be growing at a much smoother rate, I can't explain the sudden jump in users and price in the past two weeks. idk

I'm pretty excited for this to happen, even with the inherent risks. sealswithclubs is too small to be viable.

Why was there such an influx of new users in January? I'm a new user that joined this month. I tend to think of myself as an outlier though, I just happened to stumble upon bitcoin. I got lucky and bought at $13.8.Is there an underlying reason that there have beeen so many new people?

I have the wallet address, identifier, and Private key stored offline. That's what I need right?

Hmm okay, I think i'm understanding it a little better. So the fact that I'm spreading my BTC around through betting at satoshi dice is going to inherently raise my costs for transfers anywhere at this point, purely due to btc coming from multiple people/transactions?

okay, that makes sense. very helpful, thanks!

Yes, you will receive 10BTC regardless of what happens to the value of the coin over the next few days.

Don't think bitcoins will have much value if electronics aren't working..
