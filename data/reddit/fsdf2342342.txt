If you have at least £300 it costs less to send an EUR wire to bitstamp. Total fees are around £30 for your bank's fee (£10), the conversion from GBP-&gt;EUR and then EUR-&gt;USD and the bitstamp trading fee - so around 10%. If you have more money the fees go down percentage-wise.. probably bottoming out around 3% because of the bank fx charges at around £2000 or so.

perhaps Bhutan would like to endorse bitcoin? maybe we should be petitioning the royal monetary authority of bhutan instead ;

It's a cool idea, but realistically if the sellers value their time it will never be a cheap option for buying coins. 
I think it's useful for people making their first purchase and aren't ready to navigate all the maze of payment options for getting money into an exchange. It could also be good for travellers who need local currency and don't have existing banking facilities in that country (and also have lots of spare time and might enjoy the social experience of meeting up with someone in person).

That's usually a safe assumption.. for one; individual miners don't earn many btc these days so won't have many to sell. also miners are a very small percentage of the bitcoin sphere anyway these days.. most people on localbitcoins are not miners - those that are are mostly small-time and won't have many coins to sell.. there might be one or two exceptions who might behave as you suggested but it'd be the exception rather than the rule.

maybe he can post it on a personal blog (on a separate domain) - but really the original blog post was totally forgettable and posting these so called rebuttals just grants unwarranted attention to something that could safely have been ignored.
