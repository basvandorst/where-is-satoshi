For a lot of the US, the issue seems to be "Change to who, exactly?"
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:25:01
But they done dang diddly doooooo

Aaaaaand dismissed.

Debunking bullshit requires hundreds of times the effort required to produce the bullshit
Or some such
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:19:01
Awwww yiss
And here I was worried I'd have to find some alternative way to get my coins.

I'm not sure making a parody of an ad and posting it on facebook counts as harassment.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:40:42
I don't know why you would think, even for a moment, Google would let an adblocker for their own browser actually work on their ads when their ads is how they make money.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:00:26
Looks like you just gave some lucky guy a fair bit of money there.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:39:17
Do people even use screensavers anymore?
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:46:52
Are you trying to say restricting the average citizen's rights more and more with every passing week is NOT the way to end terrorism?
You're silly, Germany knows what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:14:10
Looks like someone's unix timestamp fucked up.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:01:46
Wild guess coming through.
You're using chrome, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:31:29
Possible, sure, but you're gonna have to show microsoft that there's actually interest in such an implementation. Most likely they aren't going to even bring in changetip if there's enough interest, as making the system themselves would mean they can take their own cut without making it more expensive than changetip anywhere else.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:32:25


What the fuck does that even mean, first of all?
@_date: 2014-12-08 10:47:13
The problem is, funnily enough, the lack of mainstream use.
You don't want to be left as the only one who uses bitcoins, because you gotta buy your stuff from someone with the money you make selling, and if they don't take bitcoin, taking bitcoin is a bad move for you.
The same goes for every business as you follow the chain.
There's a reason fiat money is super successful, every merchant knows that whoever they're buying their stuff from accepts fiat, provided they operate in the same country. Bitcoin simply doesn't have that, and the process is slow as shit
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:30:14
Oh no, the guy who made the system is filthy rich, that's horrible.
Oh no indeed.
Literally who the fuck cares?
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:36:18
Any source going on about "the new world order" and taking Alex Jones, of all fucking people, seriously is a source I will dismiss without even reading the first paragraph.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:58:35
Neither is my claim of an invisible elephant in my garage, but somehow I don't think you'll take anything I say seriously if I continuously go on about all these invisible beings and phenomenons around my house. You would probably be especially critical of anything only 
Or maybe you will believe that, I don't know. If you do, please send me $50, because he said he'd trample your house if you didn't. I guess I forgot to mention the elephant can speak. You can send me a PM for my bitcoin address if you wanna give me those $50, I'll make sure the elephant gets them safely.
Remember, while my claims are not generally accepted, that does not mean they are false, so you should probably just take it as fact.
If you absolutely need evidence, I'm sure I can film a bucket falling over or something in there.
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:58:21
The difference is I'm not going to bother ever checking or trusting a watch I know to be broken, whether it will be right 2 out of every 86400 times or not, because the chances of it being bullshit are incredibly high, and there is no way to determine whether it's right without checking another watch to confirm anyway.
At this point, I may as well just use a watch I know isn't broken.
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:14:57
I'm still not going to use a broken clock to check the time, ever.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:21:41
The tor devs don't want tor to be used for CP either
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:05:50
TIL Euros are illegal to own, buy or sell in the US.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:34:58
I certainly am not part of that group, at least.
I use bitcoins for my own reasons, I couldn't give less of a shit about who has money and who doesn't.
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:26:10
Hahah, people gave their coins to that shit?
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:33:09
It was still in my browser's history from some time back.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:05:55
Buying drugs with cash is a lot more work than bitcoin, if nothing else
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:44:35
There is an in between, but it's not possible to tell what has legitimacy and what doesn't have legitimacy when the source is a crazy person screaming "LIZARD MEN, CHEM TRAILS, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, THE NWO, RAPTURE NOW, MOON LANDING WAS STAGED, OBAMA'S FROM KENYA" without going into each one and spending time debunking it.
This is why I'll dismiss anything Alex Jones says, it's why I'll dismiss anything I hear when visiting an insane asylum, it's why I'll dismiss anything said on a flatearther forum, and it's why I'll dismiss anything from this source.
If I see the same information from a source that hasn't already proven itself to be insane, I'll give it a read.
