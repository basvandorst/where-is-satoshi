Seems to be around [$28 Million]( but I see where you're going with that.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:07:26
Doesn't seem to be unattainable, especially with an existing pool.

I don't see a link anywhere on your kickstarter for bitcoin pledges. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:02:22
With much of Bitcoin's value focused on it being decentralized, doesn't the potential for this kind of attack put Bitcoin's value at zero?
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:31:07
Nicely spotted!
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:53:42
Does that mean to say that Ghash is running on $500 million of processing power? I find that hard to believe.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:26:23
Fair attempt. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:12:25
I tried that, but it goes over the max number of letters you can use in a sub.. Apparently there's a limit. We can always put "Bitcoin Only" in the sidebar though if that becomes an issue. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:20:04
I haven't yet. I guess I'll see how well Bitcoin sales go. Thus far, none yet. Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:22:51
Yup! There's over 70,000 Shopify stores..

Thanks :)

As a reminder, check out for stuff you can buy with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:29:10
It does seem to be especially relevant!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:04
No question, but thanks for being here!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:11:53
Yup. We saw virtually no traffic from there. All our Bitcoin sales came from regular customers. I think that's a good sign to be honest!

I meant attempts. I agree that it makes sense to sell now and buy back low but not out of panic. It's an educated decision.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:12:41
I'd say we're pretty niche but [we]( do have some awesome goods.. Maybe we'll be your 6th! :) 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:20:32
It shows up just like a regular order on Shopify. You can give it a try on my [site]( so you can see how it works. Just add anything to your cart, and goes through the regular checkout. It's pretty simple. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:11:22
Hey, we're at [outgrow.me]( Looking over this weekends orders, we did get a few dozen Bitcoin orders. Not a bad start! Although, these orders were mostly from our regular customers. Only 5 visitors or so from bitcoinblackfriday.com.. Interesting to note!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:45:32
As of a few weeks ago, you could only add Bitpay as your primary payment method which meant you couldn't accept credit cards and Bitcoin simultaneously (kind of a non-starter for most). As of yesterday, you can accept both at the same time.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:34:56
I hear you, but you have to share subs somehow. How else will people find them?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:45:35
Nice! Are you receiving the payments in BTC or USD?
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:54:17
Why would it be spam? It's another subreddit in support of bitcoin, not a personal blog.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:30:00
Bitcredits.io let's you integrate bitcoin within the Shopify checkout, and it takes about five minutes to set up. I have it going on Outgrow.me. 
I'd add it and tell her to come back!! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:05:44
The attempts to create panic just so people sell is pathetic. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:26
Thanks :)
