Yup. If you don't act guilty enough for the court, it's rejected. 
Since 98%+ of cases are resolved via pleas, we wouldn't want anyone questioning their own role in a system that imprisons the innocent on a shocking regular basis. 
It's perverse. Not only are your chances of conviction today similar to that of the show trials of the USSR, but they also require the victims to act. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:45:36
This is stunningly naive logic. 
If he said anything to contradict his plea and the courts heard of it, he would be doing 30 years plus additional time. 
The plea system in the USA - which is effectively the only one as only 2% of cases go to trial - requires that people act guilty both inside of court and out in order to prevent any moral questions from being raised.

And in a decade, we will find out that it was a honeypot put up for that exact reason.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:46:02
Of course they will. We have no interest in dealing with traitors in the USA.
@_date: 2014-04-12 20:29:41
Sure, but this is America. We have a long and proud history of violating the civil liberties based on skin color. 
America Uber Alles!

omgz. the deadline is coming!
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:32:23
Our legal system is currently based almost always on pleas. In a generation, we have effectively eliminated trials and nobody cares.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:29:23
Well known trick.

Plenty of people out there with a libertarian mindset.

lol. You can totally trust them. I ordered 800 marijuanas and got them in 6 hours.

I would suspect that a few Japanese gentlemen with lots of tattoos would be willing to do this, especially with the amount of money involved.
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:31:27
Then why doesn't everyone who lost money pool some money together to pay some unsavory gentlemen to start drilling through his legs until he starts talking? 
If the system fails you, it's time to go outside the system.

No, they'd use it as a PR attack on bitcoin and colorado's policy. You'll see fucktards on Fox News and CNN talking about how people are "flaunting" the law or how businesses are "confusing the public" or some other bullshit. It's all about propaganda and pushing their agenda, whether that be with unscientific studies or anything else.

I mean this in the nicest way I can, get help before you end up fucking yourself completely.

Which means nothing when the NSA is sniffing all traffic on the internet and passing this data to the DEA to construct a case using parallel construction.

This was written waaay before blockchain currencies existed ('95) - he ended up the subject of a witchhunt and ended up doing serious time for running background checks on federal agents using public records site - the state claimed it was "intimidation" 
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:47:12
Yeah, but this way they can get their jollies off not doing that.
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:51:19
He was "free" to say he was not guilty, but doing that would have got him 30 years in prison.

Mine is 
"We are closing because we are incompetent dipshits who don't know how to scale, keep a fucking webserver up or code. We also accept that we have been a blight on bitcoin repeatedly and are choosing to close our doors out of responsibility."
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:28:57


All this will do is to move the scum to jurisdictions where enforcement is effectively impossible. Humans don't change because of bitcoin, they adapt.

Truthfully, I'm a bit shocked that there haven't been assassinations of some of the folks at Mt Gox. Just goes to show that people are usually pretty good.

Or just run each one for a week before selling it to a customer. Profits double.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:14:46
Yeah, but most of the Tor exit nodes are run / infiltrated by the security services, so it's easier for them to track folks this way.
/tinfoil hat (but really, a ton of tor exit nodes are compromised, you shouldn't use it if you're trying to avoid the state tracking you)

This is the box at CES that was shown without processors? Roffle. Ok.
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:23:42
Or use market psychology and trash the value with even less than that. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:46:53
Yeah 6850 is barts, 7850 is pitcairn, etc, so I figured you just didn't understand ;)

Or prints. 
But bad cheques for $4k is going to end in a felony.

Vapor as fuck, lol.
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:41:06
They'll fuck with it. The 0.01 BTC transactions and ddos attacks during the last crash showed the market was vulnerable.
@_date: 2013-08-30 22:21:01
BFL? Delivered?
@_date: 2013-01-15 05:50:12
To be fair, they took a rather active involvement in that, it wasn't just sitting around.
@_date: 2013-01-10 07:24:48
I have a 6850 and a 7850 running about 12 hours a day at about 600mhash. Over the last month I've made about .5 bitcoins. yeah. But I don't have a heater in my room and it keeps it warm.

Because paypal doesn't care.

When I tried to deposit a cheque into someone's account I needed ID and prints. Was weird (also a few years ago)
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:23:34
 is also an option. 
The ATM does take a fair bit in fees, I'd suggest in person (that said, I've had exactly one great experience)
@_date: 2013-01-15 15:14:31
Yeah, heh. I don't even know what the fuck they were thinking. Like even fucking Phantom had shit at E3 and CES. It might have been one working keyboard for the whole site or something equally stupid, but like, it was never this bad. 
There is no fucking way that is going to be released next week or whatever the fuck their "ship date" is. 
Fucking steel and fans. Vapor. As. Fuck.
@_date: 2013-01-15 14:16:55
Not at all if they all turn out to be vapour. Which, with the whole "HAI GAIEZ, LETS GO TO CES WITH A MINING RIG WITHOUT PROCESSORS LOL" thing...

What does gui miner show in the drop down?

First of the vaporware to fall!

This assumes the feds don't use seized coins to fuck with the market and kill the currency.
This is the US government, I think it's fair to say they will.

And merchants of whichever nation US foreign policy has infected.

Yay... Assuming the whale isn't the Fed, who will use it to play games to undermine the currency.
@_date: 2013-01-16 09:39:49
Ah yes, because CES clearly wasn't a big enough event to actually show people circuit boards... Who goes to CES anyways?
