This is missing the point of my hypothetical question big time mate.

Let me pose a slightly more specific question. If we discovered a power source that cost 0.1 cents per kWh and we had enough to last a millennium at current energy consumption levels. How would Bitcoin change the day after it was discovered? How about in the 10 years after

Work would still need to be done and there would still be finite resources.

your reasoning as to why the world would be annihilated shortly after zero-point energy.  That is a massive logical leap.  Also please define shortly
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:26:03
I actually mean something like this:   I'm not interested in debating the energy source, I'm just interested in the implications for bitcoin.  Thoughts?

It’s infinitely divisible. You can add more decimal places

Do up a spreadsheet of all the asset classes (gold, silver, real estate, broad money, stocks, government debt, derivatives, etc.) and the corresponding worldwide market cap. I think bitcoin has the potential to shave a percentage off of any asset that is used for savings or as a store of value (gold, silver, government debt, real estate, etc) and then also add to that the value it could take for its use as a currency which would take from the broad money market cap. You can get in the millions pretty quick
