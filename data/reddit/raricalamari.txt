That is simply not true

Or maybe crypto will correct 80%, he buys back in and makes bank. 
You sound like you're afraid of people cashing out. No need to call him ignorant for realizing profits.

LoL weak post OP

No hard cap but it actually is limited.

It makes you sacrifice your own money
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:42:05
People who put their lunch money into bitcoin and dream of being rich are downvoting you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:05:14
Lots of coins outperformed it price wise in 2017 so thats not really a good argument.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:12:44
Thats sad

Im curius too, could ethereum handle anything close to it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:35:34
Yepp, and not only for the ongoing pump.

The trolls are those who convince others to buy a currency that takes $30 to move. Bitcoin is going to shit regardless of the sticker price.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:18:01
People will go crazy when they will see a real and lasting correction
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:49:07
ETH has lots of really promising projects for 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:34:08
Two whole turkey sandwiches?
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:03:39
Thats some backwards ass thinking about the fees.


Because they bought into the get rich quick hype and are blinded by greed. Thats the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:07:16
I spent a good amount of time here in the past when I still held bitcoin. Also what bitcoin does is still very much relevant for me because the coins I hold are still somewhat tied to btc price movements. Because of this I actually dont want bitcoin to fail. I have a feeling it will though. The "peer to peer electronic currency" aspect is long gone (and lightning wont really solve that + segwit will not work for the forseeable future). All thats left for bitcoin is the "store of value" thingy but I have a feeling people only think its a good store of value when the price is going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:11:34
BTC loves you in the ass with $30 fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:02
Yes please
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:46:00
Crypto? Yes
Bitcoin? Definitely not, I dont think Zimbabweans would be too thrilled to pay $30 just to move their money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:27:21
Except bitcoin is not  Tesla. Like definitely not Tesla, it is very far from Tesla in fact.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:06:10
Welcome to bitcoin

You are totally incorrect, why even try to explain when you dont know shit youself
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:11:23
Get out of here shill!!
Jk I have ETH too, am happy with it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:22
lol, good one
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:56:32
It is a huge issue but people are promised to get rich quick so they shut up about it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:16:38
Its a well thought out meme.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:44:17
Go beg in front of a gas station or something.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:47:15
Thats not profit, thats just buying at $15513
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:30:30
That completely escaped me :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:31:41
Bitcoin is not the only decentralized project you know
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:22:55
Another option is to never tell people yu ever held any.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:39
Your problem wasnt buying at ATHs. if you bought any ATH of any major coin a year ago then you would be doing pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:28
Bc bitcoin only goes up in value, right?
Also bitcoin would be nowhere without people using it. And Im dying to hear people say how good of a store of value it is during a bear market/ heavy correction.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:31:23
It must be a promotion thing, it probably had terms coming with it. Usually they give you the x amount of dollars but you have to do somethings with it in y days or else they take it back.
In other words people in this thread should grab their pitchforks and stick it up their ass.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:11:48


You mean its no longer a currency right? I've been out of bitcoin for some time, thanks. If a bank charged you that much you would be seeing red I bet.

There are 3 posts about r/bitcoin on their front page right now. Not a lot tbh, meanwhile this sub is full of salty posts crying about BCH being released on Coinbase.
You are obsessed
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:25:40
What happened to banking all the unbanked people from Venezuela and other countries that struggle? You know, giving them stability and all the feel good stories like that?
Now its about greed and buying out the little fishes, nice. Im sorry but bitcoin no longer has anything else to offer besides a promise of getting rich quick.
I believe in crypto but this is getting ridicuolus.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:35:41
That won't happen
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:34:13
See the blockchain!
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:18:23
Dude said outside of bitcoin though. That might fail because of resources used but transactions on blockchain go way over bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:55:37
Thats marks the time when the reptilians start buying bitcoin, crazy shit.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:59:00
I didnt know about it for a long time but the price was well below $1000 when I heard about it, got all excited, read about it, then decided that buying would be too much of a hassle. Pretty dumb I know.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:34:00
Young nigga poppin with a pocket full of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:58:54
For real, Im getting so fucking high if it skyrockets and I cash out, cant wait.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:04:58
Honestly no fucking idea, I bought my laptop a few weeks ago, it has windows 10 on it. I recently torrented a few statistics programs, other than that I only use this laptop for surfing the web.
Thanks to having the laptop for a couple weeks only I dont have too much data on it, what little I have I already consider them lost.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:49:07
I really hope so.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:54:42
Sent coins to Electrum on my mobile. My other worry is my bank account, I have done online banking from this laptop, can they access my bank account now?
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:10:44
You keep saying dip but you dont seem to know what it means.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:51:21
Pornhub is safer than torrenting.
