Eventually Bitcoin will probably be treated as currency. *Eventually*....

If it's not Bitcoin, it'll be some other crypto. Although Bitcoin is obviously the largest contender right now. Fiat currency is flawed in the sense that more can be produced from nothing. This can potentially cause some issues. Plus, the world is moving more and more towards digital payment, which makes crypto appealing. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are also limited and now that it has a name for itself, it isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

Maybe. It's all speculation really at the end of the day. The halvening is in 2020 so perhaps.

Kind of silly to say something like time travel into the past isn't possible. We know so little about things.
@_date: 2019-11-26 06:11:54
I'm looking at the bigger picture. What seems impossible today could be possible in the future. Even if it takes thousands of years. We don't fully understand physics, or just about any scientific system.

Yea, edited post.

Okay so let me get this straight, if the original buyer gifts 100$ to his friend, there is no taxable event being triggered. After that, the friend is the one who is taxed?
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:53:11
Yea but the gift tax limit is like 15000$.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:36:49
That makes sense. Although, I'm not trying to commit tax evasion. I'm just trying to figure out who would pay taxes in this scenario.
@_date: 2019-10-15 01:34:00
What? I think you misunderstood me. I'm not the one selling it on Coinbase. I'd be transfering it to my friends wallet as a gift. He would not be giving me anything. Whatever he does with the bitcoin would be up to him.
@_date: 2019-10-15 02:04:03
Yes but that doesn't mean I *pay* any taxes on it. Simply holding crypto or moving it never triggers a taxable event. That's just a form that asks you a question. Also that question could end up being revised. It's way too vague. Virtual currency could literally mean money from Farmville or WoW. Not to mention the entire question is confusing.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:24:18
You'd check no if you are just holding, right?
@_date: 2019-10-14 04:52:00
Yeah, I thought so too. Taxes are weird though.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:05:28
Hmm that doesn't make any sense. Why would the buyer owe capital gain taxes on it? It's not like he'd be buying anything with it. It'd just be a gift. I thought that simply moving bitcoin wasn't a taxable event. I thought it worked like this. You gift btc to a friend. No taxable event is triggered, since you didn't buy or exchange anything. Later on, the friend decides to convert some of that btc to usd. Converting btc to usd would trigger a taxable event. So, all tax responsibility would be on the friend who received the gift. There might be gift tax, but if the amount was as small as 100$, that wouldn't apply.
@_date: 2019-10-14 05:31:42
Yea it'd just be a transfer. Nothing exchanged as payment for the coin.
@_date: 2019-10-15 01:53:14
I've done my fair share of research. Pretty much everywhere says that gifting crypto isn't a taxable event unless you gift a huge amount. If you have somewhere saying otherwise please link me.
@_date: 2019-10-15 00:17:26
I’m not talking about selling it someone though. Just giving it to someone else. With that logic you’d be taxed every time you moved your bitcoin to a wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:38:46
Not sold, just gifted. The person gifting would receive nothing in exchange from the friend. No goods, no services, nothing.
@_date: 2019-12-04 07:42:55
Definitely possible, but who knows really.
