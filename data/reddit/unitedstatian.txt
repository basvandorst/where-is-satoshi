How can I test the LN in testnet for myself ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:43:25
I wish I didn't listen to the mainstream media, because of them I didn't invest in it.

I always said in the end BTC with its outdated 10m blocks will turn out to be the most censorship robust.

It's his best talk, he doesn't preach at all. The only greater BTC'ers are Anderssen and SN.

That's a fundamental error here. State has started issuing money only very recently.

How can shorting at the same time as longing could be a hedge?! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:45:17
The number of precedents in this sphere is mindbogging.
Was that the biggest anonymous tip in history?!

How can I try it myself?

Posting here while drunk is far better than trading while drunk.

This is just the beginning. Now imagine every buck you paid in taxes and every state expenditure was on a public ledger. Everything would be digitized and analyzable and most importantly everything could be ruled by everyone LIVE using only smart contracts for allocating the funds.
We've seen nothing yet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:52:29
It took me half a year to grasp that, you're cleverer than me...
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:15:23


This is wrong but what bugs me is how you ignore BCH is a *fork*, which really means every BTC holder got it *premined*, for **FREE**, so nothing divided in reality and the choice is all yours.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:08:43
People here fail to understand how worrying this scenario can unfold - with a 10% hashpower drop blocks will be mined 10% slower meaning the memepool will be 10% bigger. That could create down spiral which will hurt the price really bad until the next difficulty adjustment.

Echo cahmber someone?.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:28:18
If Coinebase let users dump their BCH it'd crash to $10

There's no way to make a DECENTRALIZED exchange which works with fiat.

They ban-unban CC's every thursday.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:35:19
I think... nvm, I don't wanna get you know out of this sub.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:40:59
People here aren't "investors", they're speculators.

Core should have changed the PoW algo to a gpu based one.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:24:12
They could go to the exchange physically and pile up the coins.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:36:30
This isn't 2013 anymore, there are many subs about cryptos.

I don't think you understand how blockchains work...

I'm willing to bet 1BTC they shorted like madmen before they announced it.
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:55:24
Will they block tax revenue from the mining industry as well?

You alreardy told me to buy the dip at $4800. . .

Now that China is banning mining, what's the point of it!?
Miners shouldn't have a say at all.

One of the banks is currently working on its own blockchain...
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:57:44
Reading that post made a shock in the ether. Now I'm glad there's such a huge time between blocks in BTC, looks like it could turn to be BTC's biggest advantage.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:22:38
Why not buy it in increments? That makes no sense tbh.

Because only the bank works with legal tender.

At least it's more legit than BTC Gold.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:49:31
That's the best one so far. 50% for making %300 is better than 100% for making 2%.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:56:57
Why not use a bank safe?
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:00:22
People who don't have much money in cryptos don't need one anyway, they could use online wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:42:42
At least you didn't lose 1M BTC as SN has*.
* before you censor me, almost all of the first 1M coins were never moved.

It's been well known for years every one in WS trades BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:54:24
Will they be able to stop people from using it ? 
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:58:14
It could only work out when your private keys are on a hw wallet.

There are more Satoshis than Elvii on a LV look alike convention.

That's retarded on so many levels.
