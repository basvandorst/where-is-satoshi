What the duck does that even mean? Hold until when? If I can't spend it whenever I want without huge fees and delays, what good is it?

Looks like it's the steepest drop so far. 
We all want the price to bounce back as quick as possible but I'd rather see a steady growth and adoption than these deep drops and highs. I am not a specialist but sometimes I think the crypto economy is very prone to bull runs and big drops. (aka very volatile). This does not sound right to me. However even if that is the case, I see a profit opportunity because of the way the human psychology works. There will always be new people with glittery eyes for huge profits. So at this point I accepted the apparent loss (haven't sold, and I won't sell at a loss unless I need the money) and I'll work on my systems and knowledge for the next bull run.
