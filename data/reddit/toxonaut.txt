I don't see a shred of evidence
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:25:56
It is not really a wallet. It's a payment processor and allows you to send funds (which you received via your customers) via on chain or lightning. You could use it as a wallet if you add funds to it via invoices which you generate first, which is a bit impractical.
I would not mind having a real custodial web wallet for the moment to play around. So if someone is going to build that, that would be nice. Even just to play  with small amounts of coins....as there is no iOS lightning wallet yet

If you want to understand the concepts of bitcoin I suggest to download a bitcoin wallet onto your computer and phone, buy some bitcoin and transfer to your wallets back and forth and try to backup the private keys. It takes some time to understand the concepts of crypto

Rubbish. Someone just knows that people believe in falling trendlines which was almost touched. This person probably thought it's the best time to sell because prices would reverse soon. News don't matter much anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:37:03
Yes it's usable, just not very user friendly to use as a mobile wallet. E.g. you cannot scan QR-Codes, which will make certain uses impractical.
But for the moment a nice to have for iOS users.

I remember.. a lot of "experts" were calling for 10k or more to happen soon and were super bullish.. and then it went down for years. That's why I was laughing at the ridiculous year-end predictions a few months ago. Now it the time to buy and HODL. It was easy cheering "HODL" when the price only went up and everybody was in profit. The true meaning of HODL is what you should be experiencing now, and when the price will drop much lower.

In principle the miners don't solve complex math problems, but just spit out a lot of simple calculations with extremely low probability for having the correct result (as in a lottery). The winner of the lottery has the right to write down the transactions.

It's clear though that he opposes BCH. I don't think he discusses it in his book and in the second tweet he says "not even close to the biggest threat", so it IS a threat, albeit a small one.
He just wants to stay out of the drama

Thanks for your Input. I agree with that it's not fiat. Whether it's Ming or Yuan I'm not sure, but the museum where I took the picture said it's from Yuan. 
Regarding "the only legal tender": I took the following statement: "In 1024 the Authorities confer themselves the issuing monopoly and under Mongol governement, during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1367), paper money becomes the only legal tender. " from this website:

Brilliant !
Burning that note was painful to watch.. notes of the type that i took a photo of trade for about 4000 USD. Quite a long way to go for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-17 08:41:26
- During the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1367), paper money became the only legal tender
- Because these notes were issued continuously without redrawing from circulation the old ones they devalued from being worth 1000 copper coins in 1380 to 0.28 coins in 1535
- During his time in China Marco Polo came in contact with paper money and was amused at the thought that whereas in Europe the alchemists had struggled for centuries to turn base metals into gold, 
the Chinese emperors had simply turned paper into money
- When reporting his experiences back home Marco Polo was met with disbelief. It took a few more centuries until paper money was introduced in Europe
Hope it does not take that long for crypto...

Check whether you can withdraw USDT as Tether on Ethereum. Then you can just send it to your Ethereum address as a ERC20 token. Although this will eliminate the risk of losing the USDT in case the exchange or your account are getting hacked, it will not help, if there are fundamental problems with Tether itself.

Yes completely true (or 10% less), I was just comparing what you would pay on top of the market price with the example of Kraken (where i pay no fee sending money). The comparison was not to another instant buying service.

Not saying he did it, but it would not be that easy to detect. If he just found the vulnerability and reported it he may get a small reward. If he first transferred 70K funds on the wallet, then "stole" it, he could potentially hope to scam them of 70K (if they believed his story and refunded him)

It‘s basically a centralized second layer scaling solution. You lose all the privacy and unconfiscateability but you can still participate in the value increase of btc and have more possibilities to spend. There are pros and cons

Now that the price is low, the general outlook for Bitcoin suddenly looks very bleak, whereas if the price would be still high, everybody would be euphoric about it. Even with exactly the same state of development of the technology. 
The sentiment about Bitcoin has nothing to do with adoption or technological maturity, only price..... which follows normal hype cycle trading patterns

Very interesting. But is such an on chain scaling solution needed if lightning type networks prove successful?
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:48:35
You may be right about adoption. Just a thought: adoption can also mean adoption as a trading vehicle, not as its intended use as a payment method or store of value. I think a lot of adoption is just for speculation, and this can also be done on the way down. May point was more that i always find it funny how quickly sentiment turns into the polar opposite when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:36:55
Why does he say that ? Because he has heard that from other people who believe in it. This means that the more people believe in Bitcoin becoming the world currency, the more this message is spread and thus making it a self fulfilling prophecy.

I am not sure it's the other way round. If bitcoin can be rendered worthless by being undermined by malicious actors, then other blockchain can too. Alternatively a coin is centrally controlled which defies the whole point of a blockchain.

The wild price swings of bitcoin is a (unintended?) feature, not a bug, as it makes it an interesting speculation object and can attract large groups of people.

Great news. A Bitcoin only company which helps onboarding. Even if this is a bank, such services will in the end help adoption. Many more banks will offer this soon. Even if the goal of bitcoin is to get away from banks, many people too daft to look out for their own private keys may participate in and thus cause Bitcoins eventual price increase. Anybody can always opt out of the banking system once confident enough to understand how to handle their own keys.
