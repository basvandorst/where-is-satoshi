Settling price will be a combination of factors. And these factors are numerous that there's no point in learning and understanding all of them. But there is the major guiding factor of economics - supply and demand which is in full throttle right now.
For bitcoin unlike many other commodities, assets, currencies etc has permanent limited supply. This is the MAIN reason u hear all those famous people claiming it will be 1 million by 2020. No one can say the future but we can make estimations. As we know our underlying principles and other factors like altcoins, requirements for mass adoption, improvements in the technology etc.
Right now it's looked as an appreciating investment instead of a currency hence utter lack of stability and also it's not tied down to anything. 
I'm still mad I can't invest in it now (too expensive). Missed the boat

What company do u work for?  Isn't this bitcoin payment hurting your boss financially

2hat do you meaning lighting will change it? What exactly will the lightning network change about this? More transactions and faster? What about the whole lightning thing being owned by bankers ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:20:47
Elaborate please? How exactly them wall Street arses shorting bitcoin futures will cause a crash right now ? I see this happening at a much much higher price like 50k or 100k but not now

I just read about some IRS bullshit on the front page. Now while I do understand the anonymity behind cryptos at the end of the day this is the government if there's a 10% chance of them getting control over this they'll drag all their resources into this easy. Hell first things they'll do is arrest people on some bull shit charges and seize their crypto assets.

Damn nice example. Something like this would get me depressed for weeks. 
Out of curiosity though, now that all cryptos have become more mainstream wouldn't trading be better? Especially since it takes a huge amount of money now to make a significant buy amount . Eg ether at 400 is costly for someone that ain't got that kind of money

Thanks, I'm just venting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:53:29
I like your logic but 1-what about the issues with btc? 
2-other at coins should come up similar in value, after all the technology is the same
3-if supposedly massively undervalued and yet still has a lot of scaling and mass adoption issues  then how do you not see it falling in value given that an altcoins will come by and take over?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:23:36
Weird I too had a dream that I'd invested into BTC long time ago when I first heard of it and then was like 100k up today. Seriously this week has been depressing

Good advice definitely pay your taxes guys BUT 2 things to keep in mind :1)the power is shifting more people are becoming wealthier leading to shifts in wealth distribution Government does not like this. They do not like having no control.
2)there's inevitably going to be some bad apples who don't pay taxes this giving governments the ammunition THEY WANT to move negatively on crypto.
Point being a clash between crypto and governments is inevitable

Hey great job my man. Respect is not even enough to give you. Anyways wanted to know if you got another reddit profile or something to explain how you extracted such huge amounts and how you handling it with the bank. Or maybe a post you made?also how did you continously buy so many coins and keep them safe all in one place?
Damn, I find it so mind blowing haha. I hope if I ever get near those dollar amounts that I too have the heart to give back to others.
Anyways big cheers and thanks to you, let me know if you need anything that a random redditor can do for you.

But they can't do any adjustments to the base layer right? I mean from what I've read and understood the design is set
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:08
I feel most businesses would slaccept bitcoin if it would stabilise in value. Not to forget more people have to spend bitcoin instead of holding it in order for it to take over the dollar in value. 
In the end btc won't be a day to day currency if it doesn't stabilise
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:52
Let's ignore the scaling issues with btc for now and also the possibility that it's blockchain design will be succeeded by other designs in the future.
Then what we have is a super deflationary currency only 21 million will ever exist and there 7 billion people in the world. Thus by supply n demand laws one can easily see its value going up and up all the way to even a million many years from now. This is provided ofcourse that it remains the top crypto (this will come down to usage think a Samsung phone vs iphone) and it remains unregulated and decentralised. 
As far as current situation goes it is certainly highly inflated but that almost certainly cause of the Wallstreet bankers getting in right now.  The more they buy the more the price goes up. They do not like this bitcoin cause they can't control it so the only thing they can do is inflate it and then one day short the shit out of it crashing down. They won't succeed provided the other majority of people hold. In this sense no it won't crash completely not for another year.  
Edit: also don't look at it like a stock, this is not like the dotcom bubble though the market gives that appearance. Look at it like the Internet of money. Read that book if you really want to understand how this will all play out. Will it eventually stabilise to a proper price point, yes it will. Hard to say what that price will be. It could be 10k 50k 100k so on. Long ways to go. The current "bubble" may crash but the technology will live on and that's where it gets it value. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:14:58
did you account for inflation?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:22:12
This makes me so sad, I saw bitcoin sometime last year at around $300 and thought it's out of my price range not knowing I could buy pieces of it, damn, the pain gets to me everyday 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:54:39
But isn't btc failing from massive transaction overload issues? Don't get why people are talking about the price going to 100k when we have so many issues at 20k on top that the whole lightning network being backed by bankers or some shit is terrifying. Don't get me wrong but there's gotta be some good reason it goes all the way to 10000k
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:44:12
I don't know man, these values are definitely dream come true type shitt but with the fuckin government interfering and trying to gain control I don't see this happening.
I wish bitcoiners as a community can group and with serious discussions attempt to accumulate power in some form that stops any interference.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:03:46
But one would need large amounts of money to get anything out of it now. So sad I missed the boat.

Us dollars would work but only if the other party accepts them. The concept is super complicated but essentially based on the principle of the more something is out there the less valuable(purchasing power) it has. This brings the argument of inflation vs deflation. So far economists say the solution is to have some 0-2% inflation to keep the value of a currency stable yet slowly decreasing in purchasing power overtime in order to meet the demand.
If US $was deflationary like btc then everyone would 'HODL' it and no spending would happen. Deflationary currencies r not stable yet more valuable by definition. For this reason bitcoin will always remain valuable but to what value is decided by supply n demand. 
Thus bitcoin will never be actually used in day to day life (forget bout the tech part even just based on common sense economics it wouldn't work) But a stable cryptocurrency that cannot be manipulated is 100% on its way some years from now. 
Tldr: btc cannot be used in Venezuela it would only help in that it cannot be manipulated in terms of 'manufacture' therefore makin it valuable to pple there
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:29:19
Honestly Google would give you better more detailed and factual answers to your question. Imo spending wouldn't happen even close to the necessary amount. Spending in an economy needs to happen but not too much. A balance must be kept. In that sense bitcoin should be looked at as a store of value. A guaranteed savings that would go up. 
In a deflationary economy everyone is more incentivised to save than spend hence no balance. If most r saving instead of spending then businesses r not earning if businesses r not earning then no jobs, no jobs means no money for pple to have n so on ...it's a cycle.
Similarly in a super inflationary eco pple tend to spend up a lot because that 1$ they got 2 apples but tomoro that 1$ gets them only 1 apple this goes on untill venezuela happens n the currency is worthless.
As the saying goes balance is the answer to many things in life. In case of money this is true af. The answer to a perfect economy is more complex and some say unsolvable.
