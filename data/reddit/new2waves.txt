In simple terms you can think of it like the movie you pirated on the internet. Via a torrent network you pick up a piece of the movie from one of the many hundreds of computers on the internet that has a copy. You can start watching the movie as soon as you have the first five minutes but ideally you want the whole movie. The same with the "ledger" (blockchain) part is useful but ideally you need it all. 
Once you have the full ledger you are expected to make it available to others that might want a copy e.g. seeding the movie. You don't have to, but you would be considered a leech if you just download the blockchain and don't make it available for others. The big difference between a movie and the blockchain is that the latter is a never ending movie. Bonus scenes are continuously added to the blockchain "movie" which you must download. You need to know that the 5 BTC I had yesterday is still in my possession today. If I do, you are happy to trade with me. 
When you downloaded the movie you didn't know if it contained a virus (bad movie) but with the blockchain there is a sophisticated system to ensure you have a genuine copy of the ledger.
