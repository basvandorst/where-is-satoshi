Thanks for the link.   It looks like my transaction will work it’s way thru at some point; at least it’s not in the “inf” section!!!!

Thanks for the tip!   :-)

When bitcoins sink, they never can come back into circulation.   It seems here that by contrast Gold can come back in 300 or so years!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:11:04
And now I’m up to 3 confirmations already.   You must have gotten it unstuck for me!!!

.  Sign up for any of the bitcoin exchanges and you will have your place.

Can you point me to a wallet that has coins recently received from your miner?   I don't know whether that's the sort of thing you feel comfortable sharing publicly so public or private are both fine.
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:06:38
Salivating!   :-)

Does anybody know whether Electrum has the same behavior for recovery?
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:19:16
The public key shows on the Kialara but the private key is hidden deep within the non-dissasambleable construction.   You'd have to demolish it to take any bitcoin out.

The Blockchain: it's Mauve, and Dangerous!

 is the hero of this thread!   His miner diligently mined slightly more than 0.1BTC into a new wallet I created from which I moved exactly 0.1BTC into my Kialara.    The blockchain traceback after that single hop beautifully reads "No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)".    
He didn't want to be reimbursed, so I matched his amount and made a donation of 0.2BTC to EFF in honor of this effort.
Thanks to all for your advice and info!
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:09:01
This sounds great.  Maybe I would create a new address to receive those, and then send exactly 0.1 from it to my Kialara.   Not sure whether that 2-hop exact transfer is more or less elegant than a pure virgin but inexact amount!
I'll message you to coordinate and see if we can do it.    Based on some other comments here you might have several takers.   What do you think is a fair % markup?

This Kialara makes an AWESOME birthday present.   The reason I know that is my wife ordered one for my birthday, and it should be here any time.   :-)
Next stop would be to use the word Kialara as a custom amount on Changetip.  It would be a pretty big tip though!  :-)
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:05:33
Thanks  .... In my book it will be virgin-ish if I can make note of the timestamp of receiving it, look at the sending wallet, and see that the sole prior transaction(s) were to receive enough new bitcoins.  
 was it my post or  that didn't have any text?
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:27:39
It's a quantum thing.   You place your order and once you open the box either a Kialara or 10 live bees pop out.

Ut oh I'm only at 11!

Market insiders, LOL.    The "market" (and/or the "global economy") no more speaks with a unified voice than bitcoin governance does.
But I would enjoy it if they scheduled a debate between the Bitcoin CEO and the Market CEO, to air out these issues!   :-)
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:21:46
That would shatter the (illusion?/reality?) that the creator doesn't see or know the private key.   :-)

Thanks for the good writeup, I've shared with a friend who was asking about Coinbase.
The first sentence of your review about 'shining a new light' is a bit strange and unclear.  Rather than fix, I would eliminate it and modify the next sentence a bit to work as a good opener.   Just a thought ....
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:17:05
I love this sentence:   *And similarly to gold, mining bitcoin is limited to the rate at which the underlying equations and algorithms yield more bitcoin.*   We know what he's getting at, but the "similarl to gold" part is pretty funny!

This is a great chart, thanks!  
Could you make one with gridlines at $.10, $1, $10, $100, $1000?

My theory is he was playing games with us all.

I am reminded how far away we are from a system that the average person can and should use.   For most average non-tech Joe's, their hard earned money is far safer in a greek bank than in their malware infested PC or than in trusting themselves to try to devise amateur security plans that they won't ever be able to recover.

Point taken, but when I'm in Europe they don't for instance say "this will be $2.00, so please pay me 1.84232521 Euros."   They think and pay in Euro's, and I'm welcome to do the conversion in my head if I want to know approx how it compares to US$.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:43:15
Treat yourself to a Kialara (are they still available)?
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:01:09
Hi all --- thanks for the tips so far!   I keep my coins offline so transferring "from" coinbase is not an issue to me.  Also I am looking for lazy/convenient so localbitcoins is not what I'm looking for.
I just want fair market pricing, a small markup/fee, and convenience such as bank or paypal deposits.    Coinbase charged me $30 (1.5%) to sell just one coin this morning so it's worth it if I can get that fee down to 1% for instance.   
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:55:42
I agree with you to think in terms of the size.  I prefer the term Total Asset Value (TAV) rather than Market Cap because it's not a stock.
I'm on record two days ago saying I won't sell till it reached $100B (enough to be really significant as a world asset repository) and here I am two days later selling!

Gemini seems like a winner for me.   Thanks 
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:23:44
Thanks for the note    I don't keep my coins there.   
It's costing me .000603 miner fee to transfer one bitcoin to coinbase, which is $1.33.   But then it costs 1.5% at coinbase to sell it, which is another $30.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:31:53
There is no single price, because it is traded at (somewhat) different prices on different exchanges.
I like  because of the way they blend several by volume, but it's not perfect

Somebody should put up a countdown clock!

Will you sell them to me halve price?  :-)
