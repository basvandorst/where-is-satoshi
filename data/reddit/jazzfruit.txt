Most typical credit fraud is not reversed. If your debit card is stolen and they use it, the bank eats the loss. Sometimes if you catch a fraudulent charge, you can stop payment. Most types of fraudulent charges can't happen with crypto unless you are giving out your private keys. There might be a need for trusted intermediaries for some crypto transactions, like if you want to pay in advance for a product from a party you don't trust. That's a role banks can fill, or for example, eBay can handle the transactions for a sale on their website.
The current financial system is currently built on all sorts of scaffolding. It's unrealistic I expect a one-and-done solution to financial systems. The internet is a great example of unfolding, ever changing technology.
One thing is for sure; if crypto is inconvenient and scary to use, it will not be a success.

Hence why I said gold has industrial value, which is obviously extrinsic in category. But it's a tiny fraction of its current price.
I can argue that brand names have intrinsic value, because though they aren't tangible, they have real world effects of value.
Your example is a weak analogy. CocaCola has nothing to do with crypto. It's like saying CocaColaButtPlugs™ wouldn't have immediate brand value so CocaCola's brand name doesn't have value. CocaCola's brand is valuable in the context of soft-drinks and the related markets it has slowly created over the years. 
The Bitcoin brand is slowly building its value in the crypto world, and has an apparently large value to the name already, hence the bitcoin cash strategy to usurp the name and carp over nicknames like bcash.

First of all, I trust you understand the difference between intrinsic value and extrinsic value (most people don't). I argue crypto has both, securities in a stock have both, USD has only extrinsic value, and Gold has mostly extrinsic value except the relatively small intrinsic value of its industrial use as a malleable conductor. 
His statement misses the point. He's trying to compare crypto to a different type of asset, namely a security in a stock, and criticizes it for not being backed by stake in something of legal ownership. It's intellectually dishonest, because it's a false analogy, and begs the obvious question about the unique and intrinsically valuable technologies behind crypto. Using the blockchain and conceptually similiar technologies for immutable, uncensored, trustless exchange of property and information has immense intrinsic value.
Specific coins and tokens have a price that directly represents its extrinsic value, which is found through market equilibrium at least in part based on people's intuition of its intrinsic value (of the technology, the team, community, brand, legal status, etc). So the extrinsic value is certainly important and what most investors focus on, but it's often based on actual intrinsic value.

All valid concerns, which I believe can be solved with technology and better user interface designs. For institutions, there can be user keys that give partial access to funds, and admin keys for complete access. There can be all sorts of tailored security features.
As far as legitimate transaction reversals; these are problematic for most cryptos because banks and Visa type companies won't want to insure crypto wallets like they do personal accounts.  However if people employed more secure practices (assisted by good tech), this would be relatively uncommon. Nevertheless, I could imagine an insurance policy that could protect people's more vulnerable accounts (i.e. spending wallets), especially because the overall instance of claims should decrease from current debit/credit transactions.
Not sure if I'm being over optimistic here. But I know from experience that these kind of details can be ironed out in surprisingly little time. What takes a long time is transitioning from fundamentally different systems.

I invest in btc for many reasons, but if I didn't have philosophical interest in it, I wouldn't be here. But Bitcoin isn't going to solve the economic disruptions that we're going to have to deal with over the next 100 years. That's going to require huge political and social action far beyond inventing a new currency.
And crypto could in fact become a mainstream currency. Try to argue a reason it can't- and don't cite tax concerns because we can easily use software that organizes tax records.

Your analysis is all correct, you just portray the situation for Bitcoin very pessimistically. I think you're being careful to not conclude that Bitcoin is actually a ponzi scheme once and for all, because you know that Bitcoin is still useful to many people, and will be more useful once the network issues are fixed. 
I think it's reasonable to conclude that Bitcoin is temporarily edging into meeting the sufficient conditions for being a ponzi scheme, with many caveats. It's worth acknowledging that the cryptocurrency in general has moved so far beyond Bitcoin and even digital cash, and that there is immense value budding all over the crypto scene.

Buffet is undoubtedly a good investor, but his uniquely successful strategies are something that only .001% of the population will have enough money to emulate. And most of his investments were informed with insider information (albeit probably the legal kind, but nevertheless esoteric).

What is gold backed by? It's only value is extrinsic, barring the relatively low price it would otherwise fetch for industrial uses.
Crypto on the other hand is backed by useful technology and community. Immutable, trustless, uncensorable storage and exchange of information is immensely valuable. 
Bitcoin has a community, a brand, and a large market cap, which makes it especially valuable compared to other cryptocurrencies. Why do you think bankrupt companies are often purchased? Because their legacy and brand name has intrinsic value.

The legal basis of the U.S. constitution exists in the will of the population to uphold it's assumed premises. Whether you believe it or not, you will be considered by the majority to be equal to other citizens, and to have the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. Those premises are axioms which but don't need justification beyond democratic consensus. It loses its legal basis when the majority says otherwise.

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:38
True, because I've made it clear that there is no legal precedent for the foundation of law. Our legal system starts with assumptions (or self evident truths if you want to make them sound important), and with the support of a democratic majority, logically builds law upon those assumed premises. That's the foundation, and it's a strong one.
You falsely accuse this as being circular. If you studied logic formally, you'd know that the logic might be not cogent if the assumed premises are in fact false. But it's not circular to start with assumed premises.

You're absolutely right here. It's scary how people lose perspective and advocate to diminish free speech- especially in recent politics. Let the racists speak, and identify themselves, so that we can all judge how ridiculous their beliefs are when they are brought to light. Truth is best understood through dialogue, even if one side is completely wrong.
That being said, people are poorly equipped to deal with novel information, and are lacking in critical thinking skills. They are not able to pass sound judgements, and are convinced but emotional group narratives more than reason.
Crypto is especially tough, because too many people are here for the money, and that's paramount. It's also hard, because there aren't many verifiable unbiased sources that dig into tech and philosophy. I view reading Reddit crypto subs as a part time job now, sifting through piles of bs to aggregate an understanding of public perception (the real driving force behind market trends). It's basically the same tactic I have to use to understand modern politics, only that effects me emotionally, because it's hard to cope with the easily preventable harm being done to the world.

The logic in the u.s. constitution is not circular; it states moral axioms at the beginning and outlines the provisions to uphold those values for U.S. citizens in a linear fashion. It starts with statements that are certainly human constructions, but they exist as a real, functional social agreement. This continuing agreement is what elevates human relationships from a state of anarchy into an explicitly structured society.

Sir Bastian's arguments are weak and shortsighted. Let me go back through the points.
1.	Using crypto is currently relatively simple and easy, and is becoming more and more streamlined. It is entirely unfair and shortsighted to criticize bitcoin for its complexity by citing the relatively uncommon mistakes made by complete novices. These mistakes will go away promptly with software development.
2.	Your  argument is a straw man. You can’t discredit the certainty and permanence of bitcoin transactions and the blockchain with examples of people and exchanges storing their private keys improperly. Bitcoin transactions are tamperproof, uncensorable, and extremely secure. Try again.
3.	Agreed, except I’d take an optimistic tone about lightening and other emerging technology.
4.	It’s a great medium of exchange once fees and transaction times recover from the current infrastructure stresses in the btc network. It’s value as an exchange medium is that it’s extremely secure, fast, cheap, eliminates trust and middlemen, and borderless. Your example of irony highlights current perceptions of a world where bitcoin isn’t used as a currency, and where people are used to thinking of their wealth in dollars. This will obviously change when bitcoin can be readily exchanged for goods.
5.	I agree that bitcoin isn’t a store of value at the moment. It’s still in its infancy, and it’s still an investment. But since it is a convenient, cheap, safe medium of exchange, its market cap will likely keep growing and will start to stabilize. It’s market cap will have to be in the trillions before it’s a relatively stable currency. This is no problem as an international currency.
6.	Most of the world doesn’t care how many dollars they can get for a bitcoin. Bitcoin will be a much more useful international standard, since it is decentralized and useful everywhere.
The real criticisms of bitcoin are:
1. Most people's criticisms can be balled up into one: It's new, incomplete, and ever changing. We don't have precedent for global, p2p currency. It is potentially upsetting to local and world economies, and we don't have a sophisticated understanding of predictors and solutions to future problems. Poor policy and regulation is possibly the biggest threat to Bitcoin (which is not an inherent problem of Bitcoin). We need crypto developers to work with the government to create fair and perceivable laws and tax policy ASAP. We need cooperation and goodwill. A healthy free market will be only mildly turbulent as it adjusts to the new supply of currency.
2. So far, the crypto communities and certain individuals have demonstrated quite a bit of hostility towards each other. Open-source technology with this much interest, being tied to people's personal wealth, creates absolute chaos in participation. People are piss-poor at thinking for a global long term interest.
3. Developments made to technology are often designed and scheduled for the sake of retaining immediate value of a coin, rather than the best efforts to improve a coin for the long term. Price is often equated with quality and legitimacy, which is a distraction from the things that will ultimately make a coin valuable.

If it comes to light that he moved that much money, the SEC might take it as an opportunity to create regulatory laws regarding crypto asset trading. It is illegal for big investors to move that much capital in a short period of time on traditional markets. Not saying they'd have any success regulating crypto, just that Ver would be taking more than just a financial risk (selling low, buying high).

Thanks for the response. Most of the explicit responsibilities of the SEC are clearly beneficial to all investors. After reconsidering what I wrote, I must admit that I exaggerated my assessment of the SEC's value (it was at the end of a long Reddit session, and I must have picked up on the cultural disposition like a foreign accent). I don't fucking hate them. My perception of the SEC is likely subject to a negatively bias, because I only notice or hear about their objectionable behavior. They do provide a relatively thankless job, after all. Nevertheless, I'm still disappointed by their track record in providing a fair free-market trading environment in some specific instances. A few anecdotes:
I was acquainted with a multi-billionaire investment banker in the early 2000s who had some very specific complaints about the SEC overlooking large scale trading issues. He joked that they were too busy frying peanuts, or ants, or some other metaphor.
I don't like how they've overlooked the high frequency fractional trading schemes that, afaik, are still an issue today.
I disagree with the SEC's investor maturity rules in principle (they don't apply to me). I think these rules give a disadvantage to the average American and seem out of the scope of the responsibilities you cited earlier.
When I was day-trading, I was resentful of their use of the single-stock circuit breaker. I viewed this as a tool to give market movers and advantage. This may be imaginary, and you might argue that I should trust the SEC's maternal oversight and not be swing trading anyway.
There's some specific things I don't like about the FTC as well, though their explicit responsibilities are also undeniably beneficial to the well being of the free market. And since I am an average dumb America, as you say, I do have many complaints about most government departments. The strongest complaints are levied against departments that don't live up to their stated responsibilities, and play favorites to private interest groups.

If anyone is interested, I just write for the sake of writing:
One party is clearly worse, and the sentiments and culture of the constuencies are very different. It's generally possible to recognize categorical differences between policy too.
If I were writing a proper thesis, I would not call the parties identical. That is literally false. But the original comment seemed motivated by a sentiment which I think is very important. The point is that both parties ultimately function for a greater purpose: entrenching the status quo and maintaining control of major political entities. 
The two parties' superficial differences and the majority of party members are quite different. The Dems, especially with social policy, are far more agreeable with my personal values. But I don't let that distract me from other important interests, such as election reform, gov transparency, political bribery, etc.
I voted for Bernie in the primary; he was decent. But the DNC does not want to get money out of politics, so they muted his campaign. Their chosen puppet was Hillary, who would clearly work for private interests, foreign and domestic. The DNC will never support candidates like Liz Warren or Ro Khanna, because they can't be trusted to serve the DNC agenda. They are thorns, because many voting Democrats and moderates like their policy.
I am disheartened by the lack of options, but I will still vote and remain political active.

No! It was automatically forfeited when the police seized it at the gas station, when they decided it was used to transport a drug related criminal. The lawyer said it would cost about as much as the value of the car to sue the state police to get it back, and that there is a high failure rate in these types of cases. 
This is exactly the scenario they rely on- the assets are seized without due processes under the civil forfeiture act (which Jeff Sessions is working on expanding) and often without criminal charges, and getting the assets back generally costs more than the value of what's seized. We just let it go.

It happens more than most people think. My dad was an AA sponsor, and he drove his sponsee home from a meeting when he stopped for gas. The police recognized the sponsee, who had a warrant out, so they seized my dad's car. I called the lawyer the very next day, but despite the fact there were no charges to my dad, we couldn't get the car back. The lawyer found out it went to the chief of police's daughter (4 year old Audi). 
The New Yorker had a good article about this about 5 years ago. More people need to know about this form of theft.

They are only superficially different. Most of the "big issues" are relatively minor issues with easy solutions that are never discussed. Both parties are just different sides of the same coin that feed into the false dichotomy of public politics, while serving the same interests; maintaining control of potential candidates to ensure their ability to work for private monied interests.

Developers have to work together and coddle lowly, ignorant consumers. 99% bitcoin investors don't even scratch the surface of understanding crypto, and can't make informed purchasing decisions. The solution is to have responsible community leaders fairly explaining technical decisions and objectively reviewing the various efforts that individuals and teams are pursuing. If you want to employ a libertarian strategy to bitcoin (or an economy at large), it will have to come with some sort of responsible community-oriented ethos, rather than the cut-throat competitive capitalist strategy we're used to operating in.

I agree with the underlying sentiment here, but opting out is not the solution. You have to be politically active in conversation. Vote on the lines of least harm, and harass our elected politicians about illegal bribery and the specific policies which you know a lot about. 
We all need to start demanding these 4 things: tiered voting to eliminate the Nader effect, 1:1 representation (using block chain or similar technology), transparent government, and critical thinking and logic as primary skills taught in schools.

You sound bitter and went off topic. Nobody thinks bitcoin will replace banks and fiat overnight, and everybody knows crypto is a risky investment.
The fact remains that Bitcoin is highly competitive to the traditional bank business model, as many banks admit in various market reports, specifically because it automates many tasks otherwise handled by banks for a cost, and simultaneously improves security. Bitcoin possesses many other advantages- it's decentralized and global, open-source, and uncensorable. Banks can adopt the blockchain, but not the primary features of Bitcoin.
Right now, Average Joe currently benefits primarily from investments. That's a big deal, and careers are devoted towards similar pursuits. Retailer Joe benefits from being an earlier adopter and gets customers who want to spend their crypto. Tech Savvy and Econ nerd Joe enjoys the hobby. Gamer Joe can mine ASIC-resistant coins on his idle PC. Ex-Pat Joe can send some money home easily, Paranoid Joe can do things on the dark net securely, and Gambling Addict Joe can gamble safely on the internet.

I don't see why we don't just plan on increasing blocksize later on, rather than hard forking now. It seems inevitable anyway. As technology grows more powerful, a blocksize increase will not hinder decentralization. But obviously the community and ecosytem aren't ready yet.

Trump doesn't really represent the GOP. He is too risky for comfort. Most Republicans are probably bemoaning his nonstop campaigning (creating narratives to build a stronger constituency) and ludicrous statements, as he jeapordizes their regime. Neither the DNC or GOP want unrest, they just want strong identity politics. 
The two brands absolutely have a spectrum of political idea, and neither is homogeneous. But ultimately, neither party supports true democracy or fight for the liberty of individuals.

Gold stored under contract (like at a bank) and legal documents proving ownership are certainly more "hackable" than the blockchain.
Depending on the circumstances, gold's value could begin to fluctuate and bitcoin's could stabilize. These aren't permanent features of any store of value.
Gold requires a lot of energy to defend and transport.
True. But what does this matter? In a sense, BTC can be physically stored on paper, a ledger type device, or in your head.
