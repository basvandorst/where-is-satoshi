I've played enough XCOM to know that a tactical retreat is highly advisable.

Has anyone just tried "balls" 24 times?

Before that happens, a replacement coin with no fees and enough bandwidth to rival Interac or VISA needs to be developed, adopted, and placed on all exchanges like Bitcoin and Etherium are.
There are a handful of coins that boast this, but haven't proven themselves yet.

It's not about the money.
It's about a shitload of money!

One time I played so much Guild Wars that I almost failed out of third year University.
I wasn't even good at it, I just played a lot.

First, find an exchange that you like.
Then, put in some crypto. Transfer some into the exchange that has low fees, because the actual transfer into the exchange will have your standard fees. Each site has a large deposit page where you pick your coin you're depositing, and will generate an address to deposit too. Don't deposit the wrong coin into the wrong address or you'll lose the coins forever.
Now, you can exchange that coin into other coins on the market. You can set an order which is like you standing around saying "I'll buy for this much" and there are hundreds of other people doing the same. You can also just buy for the lowest guy standing around saying "I'll sell for this much".
You may be able to pick the correct coin on a given day, if you know news, rumor, upcoming events, speculation, or can time things. Most of the time, you will not.
Every time you make a trade on any exchange, the exchange will keep about 0.5% of what you traded. This adds up, especially when you guess wrong.
Day trading is hard, and it's easy to get hooked. Never delude yourself into thinking you'll get super lucky over and over.

For that terravivos one, unless the builders are true believers themselves and believe it to be a humanitarian effort, there is no way a $25,000 bunker will be up to snuff in a biblical end of days apocalypse.

Assange lost a lot of credibility in my eyes when he promised he'd let himself be extradited if the the US would commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning and give her clemency.
Well, they did exactly that, and he broke his promise. Guy's an asshole.
He'd rather a government be shitty and secret than productive and secret, because if it's shitty, then he gets more eyeballs and can stroke his ego.
