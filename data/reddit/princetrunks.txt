I used to do those "bitcoin drip" sites back in the day when I was first getting into bitcoin.  Wasn't much but when BTC got to about what it is now, I had $25 worth in my original wallet :-)

very cool.  I'm planning on adding Bitcoin payments to my OsCommerce cart and this will help with the verbiage needed.

oh wow... I just got this email today
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:12:46
Reminds me...I gotta put Bitcoin on my site OSCommerce cart :-) Keep the businesses accepting Bitcoin growing.  I want to see the utter fear in the banksters' eyes
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:06:40
I added Bitpay to my Oscommerce store and it's so easy for the retailer to use.  Covering in-store POS systems should help bridge the gap for retailers.  Awesome news

oops, I meant to say "not buying"
Bought in a little at $3000 a while back.  Nothing substantial though out of pocket

Short sellers cashing out. 
BTC really needs to be used for goods and services instead of akin to a penny stock.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:48:46
I so could have been a millionaire.  Was using office PCs to mine back at like $33 just to get an understanding.  Hell, I remember the old Bitcoin drip sites where you click on a link and you get BTC sent to your address.  (got about $35 in today's price in that)  Even became one of the first stores to use Bitpay (on my anime collectibles site) before Hurricane Sandy messed things up.  Granted, at the time my money might have been lost to Mt. Gox (if I stupidly didn't send the BTC to my own hardware wallet)
oh well.  Like you said, skin in the game and I'm all for BTC to be used more than a a short sale stock.  It's now basically a hedge but until we see more goods and services accept it, the ground IMO is still a bit fragile.  I think Facebook just unintentionally made BTC stronger though and reaching towards that goal.

I owned a few Satoshis and was trying to mine when it was $33.  Stupid me for not diving in as deep.  Glad to see it raise nonetheless
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:35:16
I was mining it at $30, saw the spike to 1200 the the drop to 300 after the whole Mt Gox thing and thought it was over.  At least i got back in at $3500 :/
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:29:31
Yeah, this was what lead to the initial 20K run.  Wallstreet got a good wind of it but in typical NY investor fashion were rather comp illiterate, finicky and quick to judge things they don't understand; add the initial ban NY got with trading cryto and the selloff happened.  I still remember the Mt Gox days when it shot up to $1200 and dropped to $300 due to Mt Gox.  I regret not\* buying about 100 BTC back when it was &lt;$40 and I was trying to mine on shit computers at a crappy web dev job but.. here's to the moon guys

I still remember trying to mine Bitcoin on crappy computers at work when it was $33 per BTC.  The $1200 MtGox-fueled crash happened and then everyone was like "welp, it's over" and Bitcoin stuck at about $300 until people on Wallstreet finally found out about it (mainly due to us programmers touting the usability of forked Blockchain ledgers).  The mainstream hype machine is over and like the boom, bust and steady consistency akin to say say Pokemon Go, same will go for Bitcoin...IF (and I've been saying this for years) it is treated like real currency and not a well matured/volatile penny stock.  I started selling on my own site using BitPay a number of years back.. it can be viable as an actual currency but until that is the main usage of it (and with a focus back on keeping the money in our own local wallets) then these volatile swings will continue.  Still, it's so much higher in value compared to the days of Mt. Gox, so it's current value, even if well below the $20K hype-fueled spike, is nothing to be ashamed of

@_date: 2019-09-11 15:58:44
Damn.  I used Bitpay back in like 2011 for my anime store since even to this day we need more ways to use bitcoin for more than like a stock or hedge.  Sad to hear they did this, wanted to put them back into my store as I slowly bring it back but this action proves myself and others need to use a different method
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:20:20
It's debatable from what I understand but mostly thought that we won't need it.  Then again, I'm in the league of us maybe finding a reason to one day.  I feel some upcoming tech will create such requirement; I'm betting what is being done with or will be done with machine learning models; not the algorithms used to calculate the models as that's just brute force linear algebra on GPUs.  I'd imagine the datasets needed to make insanely accurate models might push for 128bit memory....maybe

Quantum computing also creates way to create truly impervious security methods as the only way to bypass such systems would be to break the fundamental laws of physics.  Think QC as more of an evolution than a purely destructive outcome.. think (ugh hate this stupid marketer speak) more 'disruptive'.

Also we need to make sure nothing important is still on 32bit systems by 2038.
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:44:14
Pretty much. Granted, like y2k itll probably just be were old, forgotten systems will glitch. Most systems have been 64 bit for some time

@_date: 2018-04-07 15:09:39
Well, looks like it was a coincidence at the least :)  I was in the 4th grade in early 1994 and it seems a ton of stuff happened around that time.

I have like .002 BTC,...went from having $.25 USD worth to $1.50 USD worth of bitcoin.  Trust me, as a programmer who could have been a part of this early on, I'm kicking myself since all of my debt that's been haunting me since 2007 would have been gone had I got in early, but in the end, we need to just be happy Bitcoin is continuing to grow and become part of the financial landscape.  Bitcoin puts the power in the individual's hands; not the banks and with ever increasing security that traditional money exchanges wish they had.  
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:45:00
Great to see them making strides.  Hope I could get a Jalapeno before even those become obsolete for mining :-/

aww, how cute...California thinks they understand what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:36:59
I remember when it was $30.  To see it at even $500 is astonishing.  The people bitching are those who bought high and are using Bitcoin for what it isn't meant to be used for.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:44:48
yay... now I have $1.50 worth of BTC. god damn I wish I invested early :/  Oh well, we need BTC to keep moving forward so we can get the money out of the hands of the banks and back in our control.
