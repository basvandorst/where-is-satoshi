What if this really is the real Satoshi, and he has created the perfect alibi to deny everything? Not saying that's the case, but I'm loving the drama here.

Also, how many people think like you? In this sub there are less than 100,000 people. The 1 millionth Bitcoin wallet was just created. There are over 300 million people in the U.S. alone using websites like Amazon daily and repeatedly. and how many of those who have Bitcoin wallets will actually use them for retail purchases? 95%? 80%? 40%? Aren't there wallets out there that have not been touched since 2010? Or even later for that matter. I just cant see something as simple as giving your email address to a company that is trusted to be thought to be such a terrible act.

It'll be interesting to see what kind of precedence this sets for the Bitcoin community as well, whether hes convicted or not.

Businesses take that into account. They weigh the balance of marketing and suffocating. If you look at your email, I'd venture to suggest you have some promotional emails that you just never open. The fact that you still have to look at it before disregarding it, at least the title, is enough for them. And on the off chance you do want to shop there and go through one of their promotional emails, then their investment is paid for.

I understand that most of that is mundane, but that is to protect the identity of the person purchasing, except to the business. Now, outside of security information of which bitcoin can probably be better at, the address, phone number, and type of card actually have marketing value. For example, a person living in rural Idaho with a discover card will most likely purchase less than someone living in New York with a Visa Black card. the marketing value of that information is vital to businesses who want your return business.

Its amazing how Amazon makes money then right? The personal information they require is a one time deal. How many people keep using Amazon? Millions. What is going to make using Bitcoin better at a place like Amazon? 
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:02:04
I rebuttal with this: businesses want you to buy their products yes. But more importantly, they want your return business. Your return business makes them more money. With no personal information like an email address or billing address, they have no way to market future products directly to you. If I ran a business, one of the marketing strategies is definitely getting your personal info so that I may receive more of your business later. I think purchasing in Bitcoin is great, but as a business owner, I would not see an advantage when it came to marketing, which is a huge part of the business.

Bitcoin is the gold of cryptocurrencies. Will someone develop rubies, sapphires, and other gems? I have no doubt. But will someone develop a diamond? I'm going to say no. But I have been wrong before.

what do you mean no one knows if the ASIC's from butterfly labs exist?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:07:23
so what im gathering is ASIC is out of the question for the foreseeable future, and GUI mining is so difficult that i need to join a mining pool. I guess my next question is, is there a hierarchy of pools? also, how do i join these?

Where do the funds come from? Is the card linked to your address? Is it pay-as-you-go, loaded, or is there a credit system on the card? Also, is there a way to get Bitcoins off the card once put on?

Business insider hates bitcoin. Every one of their articles criticizes it or demeans it. I quit reading it months ago. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:21:04
exactly. just like any new business model, governments are always behind in regulating. Take Standard Oil's monopoly. Took the government years to regulate it, and it changed the world.

Question: what is the advantage of having a bank account with the IAFCU?
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:31:08
The hardest part I see is making profit from it. I'd say 95% or more of the American population has no connection with Bitcoin. Even if I set up in the most concentrated part of the country, I'd still have what, 5,000 customers? That's not alot in terms of a bank. Plus banks make money off loans, and loaning out bitcoins for car payments and house payments is not the norm right now. I see a Bitcoin "bank" as more of a currency exchange rather than a traditional bank or even investment bank.

I know there's what the exchanges are trading at, but there has to be some faster way of getting that data. Like I said, you can purchase stock software from Reuters that gives you info faster than it appears say on CNBC. That's kinda what I'm lookin for. I have an exchange tracker on my phone, but I'm looking for faster data.
Edit: also, one that combines the exchanges, not just lists them independently, much like the DOW

I like the CEDATA name for it. Sometimes all you need is a smart name for the masses to take you seriously.

Is there another name in which people pluralize it like Winklevoss to Winklevii?
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:56:53
its the same as any currency. If you make chickens currency, is it possible for someone to hold half of the chickens and have a working economy? Probably not. The value of those bitcoins come from what you can trade them for, so holding them may actually diminish their value.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:06
so ASIC's dont exist at all? or are they just unreliable?
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:32:41
Have you thought about being able to put BTC on the card directly, without going the the denominated bank accounts? Is that even possible?

I noticed it was "brought to you by RTBTC". I looked into that. The RTBTC is the real time ticker I'm looking for. It is the split second faster exchange rate. That's why it costs $10 a month, roughly, as the exchange rate stands. So thank you for providing the link so I could find that haha

It's not physically creating them. It's just creating them on paper. I think of it as if you give me 10 BTC as a deposit, I can lend out 9 BTC if I follow the 9:1 ratio. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 22:07:33
credit unions still need to turn a small profit to stay afloat. And in terms of online stuff, why would we put an online bank for a cryptocurrency to "get to the word out" and get people using Bitcoin? Most people need to know where their physical money is being stored. To do that, you need a physical building. This is why banks are very secure looking structures with greek columns and many cameras. People want to know their money is safe. It's hard to convince the average person that their money, Bitcoin, is safe because of an algorithm and a community collectiveness. Give them a place with a vault and a camera, and you have a better shot. However, I do not see a Bitcoin bank working at this current moment. There's just not enough people to sustain it. Businessmen know it wouldnt be worth the equity to start one, even in the most concentrated area of the U.S.
