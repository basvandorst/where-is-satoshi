Yes, it's the mean evil banks that are making fuckbucks hard to use, it's not that they're a made up worthless "currency" that is about as stable and trustworthy as the Zimbabwean dollar. Totally the bank's fault!
Probably also the government too. Fuckers are just holding you back dude, you'd be SO FUCKING special without them holding you back :'(

Not for money? Just for 0.65% from every transaction from your "community" of sociopaths and morons.  Cry me a fucking river, you've made money from idiots, I'm fine with that as long as you're honest about it. If you'd actually worked hard then your little card game website wouldn't have imploded. Since you've not done it for money, how are you paying 100 people? Or are you using random volunteers to check accounts and hand them out to their friends? 
You couldn't be bothered to splash out for a new domain name for your little site, you couldn't be bothered to use a suitable codebase, you couldn't be bothered to do shit when you were warned about your site being fucked. You were happy to take money from fools.
I wouldn't piss on you retarded fuckers if you were on fire.
Do the world a favour, take what's left of the real money and shut this shit down to put your "community" out of its misery.

Shouldn't you be working on getting these accounts back to their owners rather than fucking around on reddit? Or have you found some homeless people to do the work for you for you funbucks and blowjobs? Are you still seriously pretending that it would even be possible to diligently check more than maybe one or two hundred accounts a day with the two of you? Wait, aren't you far too busy completely re-creating your card game trading site from the ground up to do shit with accounts?
I think it's time to pack it up and tell people that they're fucked.
