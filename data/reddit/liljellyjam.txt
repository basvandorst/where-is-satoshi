Search for a wallet that allows you to import a private key then add it to that wallet then send it over to your coinbase but watch out for the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:08:39
Not really, I had 50 bucks sitting on coinbase but couldn't trade any of it due to the onsurd 40% tax cause of its name 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:42:16
I had 50 dollars worth of btc but not would be like a 40% just cause it's btc
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:09:44
Try bitinfocharts they have a lot of info or just google it

50%-20% correction is going to happen I can't give you an exact price. But always buy low and sell high
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:43:40
I use delta to track my portfolio, you can make up to 10 separate portfolios and set alerts plus when you add a buy you can put in the exchange fee.

Correction are normal, its health growing pains.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:26:14
I'd wait for a little to buy in for the correction in a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:26:50
It's sad and greedy
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:52:03
Basically, people verify your transaction, they are basically witnesses to so you can't send the same btc twice. Confirmation happens every block I'm pretty sure so roughly ( each time btc are rewarded to miners ).
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:54:43
I’ve never thought of it that way, Makes sense. I think my game plan is just to buy 30 bucks of bitcoins and just let them sit in my wallet and see what happens from their. Sell order basiclly are just selling tickets waiting to clicked on and bought basiclly?
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:47:08
Your going to get a new wallet for it. You can keep it in a exchange or paper wallet.
Method 1 
Go on coinbase 
Buy ltc coin with credit card 
Use shapeshift to exchange ltc for Monero 
Send Monero to wallet and pucker my holding lips and pray it over take bitcoin��
Method 2 
Use any exchange like bittrex(large us base exchange) or gdax(it’s ran by the same company as coin base and you can even use the same account) 
Exchange usd for Monero
Send to wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:46:56
Tradeview or the tools already on Bittrex and binanace 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:47:54
Yea I just seeing what other people in our community are thinking, thanks for the advice?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:11:46
Bitcoin is designed to be stored like gold, the lightning network system plus atomic exchange will allow basically any coin to be accepted from any vendor. Bitcoin might just become digital gold that we store in our virtual vaults or it will die as a flagship for the industry. It just takes too damn long to transfer BTC while others do it more cheaply and faster.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:25:33
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:49:26
Same I have 20 buck in their and it never verified and I even contacted support.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:39:28
It was best explained to me in this way, bitcoin cash only got popular because of their name. Imagine if bill gates son only had a billion dollar company just because his last name that's the same dillema between the two coins. Bitcoin cash hasn't done anything really but just throw a fit and create their own fork coin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:23:30
Yea that's what I try to do tbh. IDK if tomputmmsot of into bitcoin for go into etherum, ltc, monero and maybe neo
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:41:21
That’s great! Moving crypto coins from assets to actual currency is net positive for us all and maybe help stop fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:18:28
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:05:33
Bittrex, poloniex are probably the best options. Gdax is great if you have a coin base account.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:47:45
Yea it's just a correction in the market Ig
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:58:57
I’ll defnelty check them out!
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:48:45
Depends on what you want, if it’s in coin base they’ve said they’d give you a 1:1 ratio of bitcoin to fork coin but you won’t be able to do anything with your coins for 24 hours before the fork. If you don’t care about the fork or coins just keep it where it is.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:42:03
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:08:30
Maybe or maybe not

@_date: 2017-11-26 22:45:08
Buy low, sell high my friend. I would wait for the next correction if I was you because the giant bounces are followed by correction dips
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:42:35
Is it smart to buy bitcoin on coins desk and keep it in there or suffer through transaction fee and send it into something private? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:26:35
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:11:15
Since bitcoin is currency more of an asset then it is currency many people would liquidate it or maybe people will start using bitcoins a lot more since it be independent from the dollar. Monero could come into play since it’s literally made to be virtual cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:16:21
Yea they accept visa and such. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:47:21
Yea that's similar to my plain but I'm gonna starting holding on to a couple Alts

Oh crap, I never knew of this function. Yea do you think it's just a fud since segwit2x ended?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:40:46
See im not sure if I should purchase some coins now and strap my crypto seatbelt and go along for the ride or wait till the price dips to buy some so I’ll have more and wait till the price reaches 10k
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:35:15
Are you waiting for the fork or just waiting till the it hits 10,000?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:06:39
Do you get fork coins even if it’s in a wallet or dose it have to stay in a exchange? Are fork coins worth getting or is the original coin to damaged by the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:26:34
See that’s the whole opinion and speculation part and I still don’t understand it really. The only thing you’ll miss out on is getting the fork coin, I’m getting it just to have for the slim chance this fork actually dose something great and over takes bitcoin because it MIGHT be more competitive with fiat. Like everything in the crypto world take it with a grain of salt, if you don’t care about the fork or segwit2x coins then keep them in your paper wallet, if you want the fork coins given at a equal amount that of bitcoins you have put into coinbase but won’t have access to for about 24 hours then throw it into coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:05:34
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:13:48
It’s like .05 but that might commission not transaction charges 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:04:21
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:27:13
Damn, is bch even worth it or is just a pump and dump?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:24:05
Because it basically gain interest and you don't have to worry 24/7 and the fud of the market cause your in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:39:10
I’ve already got my first bitcoins and actually have gotten a little bit of profit in a day �� I’ll def stick with holding until I’m in college so I’ll be able to pay off my student debt slightly. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:48:18
Probably as low as it will go, depending on percentages I might buy in more
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:38
So if it drops by then I should buy buy buy?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:11:37
Is their any apps that have private keys that you know of?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:21:46

@_date: 2017-11-04 02:17:51
So just say fuck it and do it��
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:21:36
I’m gonna wait till the fork then just start holding my coins on a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:11:51
Then exchange usd for litecoin (super low transaction fees) then lite coin to Monero if if it doesn’t work shapeshift will defiantly work for ltc to Monero.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:56:53
But why can't that be applied to any other coin? Why bitcoin it has no real advantage now past its brand name the tech is from 2009 for christ sake.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:57:44
Yea, that's what a lot of people have been saying. I'm new to this so I haven't seen a price drop yet but at least I understand its just a fud and a pump into bch.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:34:55
What’s a better way to purchase bitcoins with a credit card, it turned my 20 bucks into 18 in a flash.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:36:07
So basically even if I have 20 bucks to spend just spend it and save it? Should I just buy bitcoins and keep it in a wallet or let it sit in my bittrex? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:15:44
Could a government have whole facility’s of nodes and would that be one way how bitcoin becomes closer to a fiat in the economy? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:16:50
No, just being able to compete with them in the world economy.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:20:50
I didn’t know they were regressing back a version, I thought this upgrade was just to help it compete with fiat currency. Coin base said their gonna do a 1:1 ration between bitcoin and segwit2x so my plan is just to hold on to both of them but in different wallets. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:27
So yea, its just a market correction then. Good thing about being a holder is dips don't really matter that much in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:42:27
Nope, they basically said because there wasn't enough consensus to go three with it.
If you wanna know more check out my article

@_date: 2017-11-04 21:26:26
I’m just saying I want both coins so keeping it in coin base will grant be me segwit2x if it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:51:42
I’ll check it out!
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:05:43
Ik coinbase will give an equal amount. So should I keep it in my coin base so I get the fork coins then send it to my wallet ?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:21:09
It should be in your exchange , if you had it in a wallet that didn’t give an equal ratio I don’t think you can get it. Coinbase is doing a 1:1 ratio next fork.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:48:21
It's the flagship coin though? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:45:37
Is their anything printable ?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:02:39
Sorry new trader
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:42:31
Use etherum, it will cost less than a cent to send them.
I personally use binanace to trade with eth and have no problem plus they have a trading app that you buy and sell right on there on its website.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:23:56
So a whale is just selling their millions 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:30:06
That’s a perfect analogy, I think I’m just gonna go for it tbh thanks for the advice. Do you mess with alt coins or do you just stick with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:24:24
What's a really good percentage then?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:22:38
Yea that’s what I’ve seen, just wanted to make sure cause 1% intrest sounds to good to be true.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:17:47
Is holding basiclly any amount even if it’s just adding 20 buck every once a while worth it
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:41:58
No flagship makes it forever and that's ok. Whoever station it doesn't matter what he will be remembered for is revolutionizing currency forever. It will be easier to trade, work, and buy things plus we can mint it ourselves once quantum computing becomes available to the public. Look at labor such as uber its complexity decentralized so why can't currency become the same thing which it has.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:56:54
I just set up my bank account on coinbase so I can avoid the credit card transaction fee, I think cryptocurrencys are just a evolution in currency hell one day one coin could be worth a million or it all could be lost due it not be stabilized.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:08:59
Bitcoin is gonna fail if stays like this and thanks  good to know !
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:43:01
Yea so everybody dosent sell out or transfer out I guess
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:48:28
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:24
True, I saw if it drops to 6,000 or 5,500 ill buy
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:24:48
So o should just hold tight till 6,000 or 5,500
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:36:43

I’m wondering the same thing, I’m a new trader so why is the fork so bad and isn’t a fork just a mirrored version of the original coin?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:07:59
I have 20 bucks to invest, do you think I could get 40 if hold on to ?��
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:59:39

@_date: 2017-11-26 21:07:24
Buy low sell high
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:31:56
Well, theirs always a correction for every growth which most likely will be very severe and will cause a lot of fud.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:13:32
�� is it even worth buying?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:00:49
What are nodes and what are their function in crypto currency ?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:31:59
I hope so, turn my 20 bucks into 25 !
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:33:32
Also what are you doing for the fork, are you keeping them in a exchange so you’ll get the fork coins or just HODling onto them?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:38:08
Here's a trading proverb "buy low, sell high"
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:08:58
That's the issue of bitcoin and why I think it's the flagship of a new industry, it's trying to be an asset and currency which it can't be both. If you're going to work with banks you relatively don't have to be fast since your exchanging large amounts. If you're a currency you need to be literally as fast as a blink of an eye to buying a sandwich.
This why altcoins will someday surpass bitcoin, I think monero has a great potential to be currency since that's how it's designed and it far more secure then bitcoin. You hold it and nobody can see it but you how it should be. I think eth and ltc might be able to maybe overtake bitcoin soon but it's just plain guessing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:54
It always bounces up, maybe this is just a market check since segwit2x was canceled 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:49:44
Is widely accepted a better term for it?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:14:13
Yea, it’s very easy but I’m not sure if it’s legit or not
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:45:05
I mean it defiantly gonna worth way less than bitcoin rn 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:38:01
Is their any decentralized mobile wallet or is it all just the same shit?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:49:54

@_date: 2017-11-05 15:50:24
 here’s a whole fact list about the new fork.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:28:43
Yea that's why I'm trading with eth on bittrex, 15 bucks for a 20 dollar transaction theft!
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:55:20
So it could be a good time to take advantage of btc while they pump bch and just sit back for the dump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:31:01
So buy litecoin from coinbase and send it to bittrex then sell it on bittrex?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:49
That's probably what's happening plus Koreans have been the ones doing all the pulling out of bitcoin its just a correction in the market which is normal.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:51:23
So basiclly it’s like irs or something similar but random people?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:46:26

@_date: 2017-11-08 11:13:07
I think this just one step of progress in industry, everything has been removing human interaction which increases efficiency and production. Although I think bitcoin is just the flagship currency, I think it’s the vhs to the upcoming cd and what coin that’s is I have now clue. I’m putting my bets into Monero since it’s built to be virtual cash, ltc has faster transaction times also which put its ahead. With this new fork it’s shown me that’s bitcoin is now similar to fiat in all the reasons why it was designed in the first place. 56 groups made a choice for 100% of bitcoin holders like an oligarchy or our federal reserve in combination of lobbyist and bankers.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:12:46
Makes sense, how do you get them out of the wallet though?

Bitcoin is a flagship which makes it Titian till the smaller faster coin catches up with it but it's all speculation maybe it will stay a diverse market and it won't matter what you got just the fact we will be able to exchange any coin for anything.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:21:59
The same thing happens to me on bitttrex, you may have to manually have them review your information.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:52:52
So is it better to put your bets into alt coins since they are at early investment stages and are cheaper?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:19:04
Makes sense, do you any about bit connect ?

@_date: 2017-11-06 02:37:23
Slow growth today, maybe people are getting jitters prefork.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:56:02
Yea probably should wait until it drops more, its just a pump into bch
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:07:12
Very well said, thanks!

@_date: 2017-11-05 00:44:26
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:03:44
But they earned their top spot on exchanges solely due to their name and the fact that exchanges gave an equal ratio. Segwit2x wanted the same thing but yea I think it's the right move for decentralization or else you get closer to how fiat is controlled.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:14:21
New currency industry on a new news industry = the future
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:41
What’s that? Im personally just want them separated so I can just hold onto them and if the not likely chance they get pumped or something I’d dump them. If I had a large bitcoin stash I probably wouldn’t keep all of it in a public exchange, I’d just use bitcoin for the fork and go through another service to separate a percentage of the fork coins out of by HOLDings. 
Edit: I’m also newbie to this so I only know the general concept of the fork, the fork coins will be worth much less than the actual bitcoin so it might not even be worth it. But hey, it’s free investment and miners and merchants support this new fork even though it’s downgrading back a version and more centralized which is the total opposite of the whole progressive idea and anarcho-capitlist bitcoin ideology .

Hold till the fork in coin base, then send the btc into a paper wallet and wait a long ass time.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:18:59
Yes but you’ll have to go through some service either way to separate the two, coin base is just the easiest option not the only one.

Yea I’ve seen people bragging about it, but I mean bitcoin has historically been a good bet on making money but I’m not sure what waters to test out with alt coins.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:04:29
So I should keep it in my coinbase till the fork then I’ll put the bitcoins in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:36:22
Took 3 years just to be able to purchase them tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:47:10
Thanks for the info! It looks like this can either help bitcoin become more competitive with fiat currency which probably means people are gonna pumping the crap out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:54:04
Ok makes sense thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:54:16
I just like to see what my fellow traders are feeling about the market, I'm a very dedicated holder so I'll probably just wait and see like we always do ��
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:45:35
It depends, coinbase will hold your coins for 24 hours during the fork and give you a 1:1 ratio. If you don't care about the fork coin then just keep it on a normal wallet. But you can also use a service to separate the two coin any ways. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:00:31
What kind of wallet are you looking for (FYI I’m currently researching to get into Monero rn to so I’ll do the research for the both of us) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:09:49
All crypto exchange customer services are pure shit, they have a monopoly on and it sucks especially coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:36:33
As I understand it, nodes just validate transactions while miners solve for coins.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:39:16
Def put some in Monero, again the more diversified your portfolio the more you can reduce profit loss.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:31:46
What’s a good amount to start investing, are alt coins worth it? Should i pump and dump or just sit on my bitcoins in a wallet due to its security but with the upcoming fork I’m not sure to wait or not to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:05:58
My wallet is Blockchain FYI 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:46:57
Damn, weirdly specific ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:47:21
Haha all good, yea that’s all what I’ve learned these past few days is most of it is just speculation. HOLDing seems like the best long term plan since bitcoin always bounces up especially recently. Have you ever tried shorting I heard it’s not worth the potential profit if your wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:57:19
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:04:48
Let the price go down another 1,000 then sure!
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:43:33
It cheaper to feed a monkey throw darts at random stocks them to support a trader while the monkey being more successful so �� its all gambling 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:58:21
Ok thanks a lot for the help!
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:27:58
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:50
Why? Could it drop lower?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:56:41
Wait how did you find out its mainly Korean or is that just a rumor?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:28:20
I say there should be a blockchain constitution.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:13:47
Btc just falls over and gets back up.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:22:42
Just to earn money, I know it’s not like instant but maybe by the time I’m out of college I’ll have enough to pay off my school debt or even buy a house. I’m just trying to wrap my head around about how to properly invest in alt coins while also having bitcoin as a main investment.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:24:05
Will do thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:58:35
I settle down for block chain, what do you like about airbitz?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:06
It's to volitale rn, once they start to stabilize we will have a reasonable currency. Like any investment, you can never be sure as long as it remains as asset not a currency why not just throw in some amounts every once in a while and diversify your cryptofolio
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:58:28
Well, I have a saying "diversify is the only way to get your profits high" I think in the future bitcoin will be obsolete since its literally still running on 2009 technology and takes 10 minutes for any transaction. Plus with the lighting nodes and atomic exchange which will allow you to transfer almost any coin to anyone right at that moment which means it's irrelevant but that's still a few years ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:42:30
Damn it sucks not to have a computer 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:15:33
Please lmk if that use a smart contract.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:02:22
So trading is basically just gambling but with assets not dice? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:10:43
This has a whole list of the wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:45:44
Yea I heard it's going to shit
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:31:55
How do you sell it through a exchange, will they give you usd ?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:53:43
I’m trying to say when it hits 10,000, I’m new to trading sorry. I’m pretty much asking what’s the best place to store bitcoin and is it worth buying it now or wait for a crash that might never happen since bitcoin just keeps growing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:45:39
Yea is it fud just over segwit2x not happening or just general jitters?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:54
Are alt coins volatile or are they lower risk due to their low cost but low reward since you have to pump and dump them?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:57:54
Down 3.7%, is this prefork jitters or just a bump in the chart?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:41:45
Why not just use bitcoin? Or monero?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:02:16
Will do!
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:15:09
Did you use a debit card? Was it cheaper than coin base?
