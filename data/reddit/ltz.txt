Not even close. We are far away from the time when we referred to files or anything for that matter in terms of bits. People know what bits are, but with context and the potential rise in popularity for bitcoins, I'm sure it wouldn't cause a lot of confusion. Not to mention those bits are referred to on the opposite end of the scale. There will never be a cross over as once we reach the 1.0 bitcoin level, it will always be referred to as bitcoins, rather than slang terms we typically adopt for fractional currencies.

You're completely wrong. You can open an account at a brokerage for $100 and start trading currencies within a week.

I believe we should stick to the SI Prefixes, but instead of using "bitcoin" at the end, we should just say "bit." It's one easy syllable to pronounce.
decibit, millibit, microbit, etc.

Then why hasn't a single issue been resolved through this method?

The fraud isn't so much with bitcoins, but with Paypal. You can issue a charge back on Paypal and there is no way to confirm whether or not the bitcoins were sent since they aren't a physical item. So people aren't getting scammed out of bitcoins, they are getting scammed out of dollars.

That means you want a healthy economy.

This is how the professionals do it. They tease price higher and higher to attract the volume worth unleashing a large sell order onto. This was potentially a "sell 10,000 bitcoins!" as opposed to selling 500 here, 1,000 there and so on as price was moving about. They would've been able to capture a better idea of how the market was absorbing the orders as opposed to creating a resistance level like shown in this and the prior example.
Edit: Adding onto what I just said, if there was a way to short the market through borrowing, I would have a better understanding of this tactic(and its large failure), but I'm pretty sure this is someone just looking to cash out while the market was at a high.

You can abbreviate to mbc and I still don't see any source of confusion. Like I previously stated, those bits are referred to on the other end of the decimal and are not commonly referred to by lay people. The purpose of this currency is to go mainstream.

Does PayPal accept that as proof of transaction? 
Then my point still stands.

I haven't heard any complaints about being scammed while using dwolla. From what I've read the main gripe with dwolla is they're slow when transferring funds.

Kim Dotcom: "Use bitcoins"
Feels like a penny stock in action.

The price of Bitcoins at the moment is entirely based on speculation.
