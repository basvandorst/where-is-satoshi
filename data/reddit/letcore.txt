One fine day, most people on the planet will be using it as a means of reassigning (monetary like) value to each other. It is a superior technology. Like web, email and games consoles largely replaced their analogue versions (as well as bringing amazing unforeseen innovations).
How long it takes depends on things like: global internet penetration, how long banks and government can keep this legacy fiat system afloat, and how severe the next world currency crash crisis will be. People will shift to bitcoin to cut their losses, if not to hold a currency that keeps/increases its value better while fiat inflates into oblivion.

If it is it's incredibly lazy.
There are dozens of ways of backing up, storing keys, online, offline, in the cloud, on your phone, on USB drive, all encrypted, with BIP38, or not, just have an easy to remember password and a few gmail accounts, mega account, maybe print a few paper wallets, a strong brainwallet, a few of them, or just write down a private key in ink under a table or something, a combination of all of these.
If I had 700k BTC my day job would be devoted to looking after them, testing them all the time, travelling to safety deposit boxes, devising ever safer ways, imagining scenarios of theft, fire, capture, forgetfulness, losses, and even insuring myself against any such eventuality using bitcoin in other locations and any other methods I could think of.
Keeping such a large amount in one or a few addresses, maybe that was fine in 2010-2012, but not in 2014 if there's any care to how much they're worth.

(5.) Using a merchant processor like Bitpay, Coinbase, etc. this is not a problem as they assure the transaction.
(6.) One of the things that gives bitcoin its value is that every bitcoin is equal. Any service built to discriminate between coins would only ever be voluntarily used anyway. If there is a threat of this then expect a lot more anonymity/shared send/mixing services to solve the problem.

At this moment in time I am living a very basic lifestyle so that in a few years I will have more bitcoin to do even more with. It's going to take a while. I live in the UK so luckily my parental units are not too far away from me if they get ill. 
I don't know what best way to advise you as there are many ways, it's good to know as many as possible really for your mind. You say you 'need' things. You need air, water, food. Want is desire and desire is ego. You can learn to appreciate everything around you, there is so much beauty in everything. You can learn to let go of things that are beyond your control, so you can live more in the moment and connect with the universe. You can learn meditation and yourself more to be more content with what you have right now.
My plan for my bitcoin once a high enough value is reached is to invest into green energy projects and community projects. At this moment in time I won't even spend them on myself.
I hope you are already receiving some kind of help, money or otherwise, from your government or local community. I also believe things will get better as money creation moves from banks to us, anyone, the community, so we get to call the shots on who gets what money and where it gets spent.
We, that is you and I, can begin now with what we have to build a better world. I promote several ideas including bitcoin and raising awareness and taking direct action over fracking which takes up most of my time now. I do it because I can. I have an internet connection and while nothing beats physical getting in the way of a truck full of pollutants with the police trying to arrest you, spreading the word and making people aware on the internet is a job in itself. There's so much we can do to help others and it feels good to do so. 
I care about this planet and I care about you. I will remember you and this moment. Thanks for making me aware of your situation, a seed has been planted in my brain. We shall see what will come of it! :)
Best wishes for you.
I love you unconditionally.

My dad is fighting prostate cancer right now and my mum also had breast cancer. Seeing the diseases people get made me change the way I eat and live, and I've been improving the respect for my body and mind for a long time now. I'm trying to turn every negative into a positive, it takes practice but it has done wonders for my life and outlook on things, and I'm getting better at it all the time. :)
My dad, from as young as I can remember drank lots of alcohol. They divorced when I was a few years old. It was awful to experience his drunken anger all through school and I didn't know how to deal with it. It wasn't until my 20's and after many falling outs that I began to challenge him on his issues. After a lot of time, patience, listening and repetition I was able to point out his flaws to him and how they were having a negative effect on not just him but me to. He is much better now.
He was homeless walking the street for a year and sleeping on park benches and bus shelters, a few years ago. What an experience, not just for him but for me also. Now we are both stronger.

Seems like rushed research at best with a negative speculation thrown in. 
My tip to Cato would be to spend some quality time watching how the network copes with a 51% threat, both socially, financially and technically. Acquire some bitcoin, hold it, and imagine you're a miner and how you'd want to protect the very network that gives it value.

Chief economist thinks he knows computer science. "Anything that can be programmed can be hacked" While this is true in most cases Chief, Bitcoin secures transactions by hashing an unforgable chain of blocks using time &amp; processing power, verified by independent nodes worldwide that anyone can run. 7 years on and billions at stake, you think you can hack it because you don't understand what a hashing algorithm can do. Take some time out of your day to learn some basics.

@_date: 2016-12-08 19:46:07
A fixed blocksize cap is what makes the Bitcoin network worth £9.8bn right now nearly 8 years in!
The miners will only run an increased blocksize bitcoin protocol when it is more profitable to do so and can achieve near 100% consensus. It will happen at the snap of a finger if mining hardware can reap more profit. You watch.
Basic economics.
This will happen after a point where demand for a transaction to be included in a block results in transaction fees so high that the miners have too many coins from extra fees to sell on the market, thus tipping the balance and reducing the market value.
This downward selling pressure would form a large dip in value ("crash" they'll call it), after a sustained rally during a large wave of adoption buying. If miners don't adapt during this gradual increase in demand and transaction fees they will lose on their mining hardware investment returns as the hashrate rises. This would be bad investing or a waste of money.

c) I will personally buy hardware to set up a full node capable of running for years with 8mb blocks because I'd have more confidence in bitcoin's medium-term future. I'm not the only one who'd do this.
At 8MB per block:
Maximum of 1.152 GB per day blockchain size increase
4096 GB Hard drive =
3555 Days
~10 years until full.
4096 GB Hard drive cost £&lt;1BTC!
Good luck!

Yes, it was an interesting point of discussion at my interview. I must have stood out from the rest because I got the job. 
You are basically a self-employed bitcoin trader who managed to stay self-sufficient for a year, who understands how bitcoin works. That is an achievement.

Indeed. Miners with low bandwidth can continue as they already do by only choosing good fee paying transactions to include in their blocks. Miners are balancing the risk of getting an orphan block with getting more fees from broadcasting more transactions. An 8MB miners' fee market will find its own equilibrium as it does with 1MB blocks. Some miners just want profit, some are more philanthropic.

I trust the cashier every time I hand them a note, that they will give me change and I can count it. The difference with bitcoin is that I can check the blockchain myself and trust that I will shop there again if they don't swipe the remainder of my wallet.
The point of this temporary paper wallet is so you can print an amount to take out with you for that day. You use it a few times if you wish and if there's any left over you can transfer back into your home wallet and throw away the paper. Or keep it as long as you trust the shops you go in (and that no-one will secretly scan the private key while you aren't looking).

Great stuff.
I wonder what a seller may think of this though. Isn't it less risky to run through a central node like SR than to have your own node as a seller? Sure there is no single point of failure which is great but then don't sellers personal security habits have to be as high as say SR were? (not that they ultimately were)
Basically what I'm asking is isn't going through a central node kind of like out-sourcing your security (and liability)? 
Or does that not matter if you are using Tor correctly as your own node?

If for example a tabloid newspaper requested to their low IQ or low EQ readers for their vote coins to vote on their behalf on a particular issue, possibly in a detrimental way to society, the following could follow:
1. They win the vote, but then the country goes down the pan, so another vote is called, and on making a mistake these people now vote the other way and lose trust in who they handed their vote to.
I see it being a trial and error system. Some decisions aren't going to work. Just like at the human level, we learn, we can change our behaviour, our own policy.
The huge benefit of this liquid democracy system though is that if something is voted for and turns out to have an awful effect it can be changed quite quickly. Much more  quickly.

I don't think the average Localbitcoins seller is ever going to do an iris scan in the street.
Bitcoin is peer to peer, it can be done anonymously, and mixed. Centralized points that interfere with protocol will be rejected and routed around, by democratic vote of spending a coin. Bitcoin enables a free market. 
The NWO (or whatever you want to call the power mad bunch of sociopaths trying to run the world their horrible way) are trying to control the Internet, but you know what will happen? Because people don't like their lives controlled and spied on, they will route around the problem. The Internet is quite heavily centralized at this moment and as a result the NSA has compromised its security. The way around this is more decentralization and the Bitcoin protocol is leading the way.

My rough calculation makes that affordable in approximately 7 years according to Moore's law. Although I think hard disk space doubles quicker than processor power so a drive with that capacity with overhead could be affordable sooner.

It would be nice if HMRC were doing it for this reason. I thought this was unlikely though because I'm guessing they'd receive less revenue from it.

@_date: 2013-11-01 13:55:27
If/when the time comes and us bitcoin holders become super-rich, we have to work together with the community and the planet to build a better world than what has gone before.
It is down to all of us to do this. I already have big plans to develop sustainable energy and food projects amongst many other things, for every person on the planet, starting local, but funding other peoples projects where needed.
I'm acquiring bitcoins now, not to make myself rich, the only way I can justify 'getting rich' is by using this wealth responsibly, for everyone. Without everyone there wouldn't even be a bitcoin, or internet, or the the wonderful things humans have created. 
This is me giving back what 30+ years on this planet has given me. I want to see Earth succeed. I want to see humans more in harmony with the planet, not destroying it, for profit.
I wouldn't have had this plans if it wasn't for the possibility of bitcoins rising massively in value. The current system is broke. Selfish money makers want massive profits for themselves at any cost be it: environmental pollution, destruction and death. I know this may still exist with Bitcoin, but I don't believe it will be anywhere near as bad once things have settled.
Banks have had way too much power creating money for too long. Consumerist propaganda we see everywhere is a horrible part of this and it leads to unsustainable use of Earth's resources.
Any politician pushing for 'growth' is simply encouraging the further depletion of resources. What they don't tell you is that only very few people on the planet benefit from this 'growth'.
We've been led wrongly since our being born. We need to learn how to live with the Earth, to take pleasure in more simple things, to see the exploitation in the advertisements for products in the media. Buy this buy that, when all we need on this planet is: water, food, shelter, sanitation, and internet. 
We all have to wean ourselves off the expectations we grew up with. If we ever find ourselves with great riches and the power that comes with it, we must help our surroundings that gave us life to thrive in order to thrive in ourselves.

If you are an independent seller accepting payments through your bank account you are at risk of being defrauded by two similar scams:
Man-in-middle scam or Job-scam.
Scenario: Scammer places ad for eg.Airmiles on a classified listing. Victim responds to ad and the scammer gives them your bank details to transfer into (the bank details you unknowingly gave to the scammer on Localbitcoins thinking they were a legit buyer of Bitcoins). Victim makes bank transfer into your account, you spot the payment and quickly release BTC to the scammer. 
Sadly the banks don't care. They see it as stolen money and will likely suspend your account for weeks while asking for ID and proof of what the transaction is, essentially treating you as a potential fraudster until proven innocent. Eventually they will release your account but will likely recover the funds as they are pretty much seen as stolen. The seller would be liable.
I disagree with the seller having to take the brunt of the scam. I believe it should be the 'victim' who was foolish enough to part with their money. They bank has protected this person from their own stupidity.
This is why Bitcoin is superior. People will eventually learn to be very careful with where they spend their money.
Selling BTC should be a pleasant experience but Banks and Scammers screw it up. Screw the banks, and screw scammers! Bitcoin for the win! :D
If you are a seller taking payment into a bank account you have to think like a scammer, you may have to ask your buyer for photo ID, but also realise that the scammer may be asking the victim for photo ID too just to give to you. There are ways you can protect yourself it just takes time and effort, but if a genuine Bitcoin buyer willing to go through your security processes then a good relationship may form. Worth the effort not to lose money too.
Best of luck to all sellers. Buyers, please have patience as sellers try to protect themselves. Banks, you have enough money so give some slack to Bitcoin sellers. Scammers, use your skills to help people instead of stealing.

Here's a way and what you'd need to trade quickly on Mars and with Earth:
- its own locally mined, planetary cryptocurrency for quick confirmation (and shops that take it).
- an exchange market where BTC can be traded for the martian coin
- BTC can be sent 155 million miles across space to and from the Mars exchange but returning a confirmation would take almost an hour, hence the need for an exchange.
- easy :)
That or create a cryptocurrency  that can be mined throughout the solar system, where blocks take 1 hour (Mars) - 11 hours (Pluto) to mine a block.
