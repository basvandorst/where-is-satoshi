I don't think there is institutional money in yet. I feel like the growth is just normal working people buying bitcoins. Everyday I see a new post from either a housewife or farmer or someone not so "tech" smart person ask how to buy bitcoins. And when the institutional money like possible enters it's going to so much higher. And that's scary.
People don't know what they are buying and are only doing it because of the price rise. The only value I see in Bitcoin is the price the next person will pay for it. What is the meaning of bitcoin? To replace FIATs or what is it really for.

Deflationary currency -&gt; People wont spend that much money -&gt; Businesses suffer -&gt; Jobs lost -&gt; No tax revenue -&gt; Whole economy tanks. It's as simple as that. But obviously everyone here knows every single economic aspect and has valid points why bitcoin replacing FIAT is a good idea. Yeah, no.

You do understand that a few percent inflation is a must to run an economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:45:15
That doesn't answer why we actually need it. 
You can't value something based on how much it costs to make it. If I dig a small hole and use 10days to do it and use a thousand dollars to do it, it doesn't mean the value would be thousand dollars or even more.

Huracan is faster, more advanced and half the price? Say that again?

The only opinion I've seen from people why bitcoin is good / growing / not a bubble are: Its limited supply, "supply and demand", FIATs will be dead in 20 years. 
Honestly I don't know how much time I've used to find valid reasons why Bitcoin would be worth hundreds of billions or why it would continue to grow. There are no fundamentals.
Blockchain is valuable, I think blockchain is worth trillions. But bitcoin isn't worth anywhere clear that nor is it worth hundreds of billions. It's great, but it's not worth it.

How could bitcoin be the future if we just cannot use it as a replacement for FIAT currencies. Deflationary currencies do not work. Don't people understand that?
What are people honestly looking at? Just the graphs? The funny memes on the first page? 
I spent idk how long in a crypto trading group yesterday and couldn't get a valid point why bitcoin would be worth hundreds of billions. Not a SINGLE valid point.
Please someone enlighten me and tell me why bitcoin is worth hundreds of billions. I understand how blockchain works etc. I've been involved for a year now. And don't tell me the only reason for bitcoins growth is "limited supply" or "supply and demand".

I don't understand why someone would kill themselves because of money? Money isn't everything. Are you sure there wasn't something else wrong in a big way to him? A relationship or something like that?
I mean if he clearly saw the potential in Bitcoin that early, I think he would be able to see potential in other things too. 
If he didn't need the 50million before why couldn't he live without it after all this happened..

Economy doesn't work with deflationary currencies.

I have a lot of experience on how the whole blockchain works. I've been in cryptos since 2013. 
Blockchain is a trillion dollar idea, Bitcoin is not. I thought we were talking about how revolutionary Bitcoin is?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:20:44
But why does it need to be worth hundreds of billions just to be the "cash" of the internet. Why wouldn't we use Dash or Litecoin etc. that is much faster and cheaper? 
And i'm pretty sure people aren't treating it as cash of the internet, no one is buying bitcoins so that they could use it as a currency. People are buying it because they see it as "easy" money and see it growing because more people come in. Do you think the housewife that's asking if she should buy Bitcoins is thinking about something else than that the value is going up for whatever reason. 
This is a huge problem, most people don't know what they are buying, nor do they see the bubble, which makes it a bubble. Bitcoin isn't worth hundreds of billions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:44
Please tell me whow it's revolutionary? Why do we need it? What is it for? Can you answer me these questions please. I want to know more.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:21:25
Is there a specific point in the video about inflation and deflation?
Also, why do you think governments and central banks are so keen on keeping the inflation around 2%? Because of how heavily it effects unemployment. Even a slight difference in peoples spending will have an effect on that. That leads to cutting employees. 
When unemployment goes up by 1% in USA, around 1500 die. If this happens globally, its more than 30 000 people. It's not a misconception.

This guy is an idiot? He seems a bit crazy too. He calls Warren Buffet a rat? Calls that Big banks are stealing money from clients bank accounts? Bitcoin is not a store of value, it has zero utility. Bitcoin is regulated? No. Holy fuck. 
Did you hear his explanation why gold has value? I've never seen more stupid person in my life. Just wow. And you all believe in him?
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:36:13
Because bitcoin doesn't have much to offer. We don't need it, and even if we could use it, there are better options (dash,litecoin etc). Blockchain revolutionizes advertising, banking, trading, almost everything. Bitcoin doesn't do anything. There is no need for it nor is it the top of the technology we could use.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:46:15
Or buy some other coin. When we get more FIAT/altcoin pairs we arent dependable on bitcoin anymore. Blockchain doesn't equal bitcoin

Honestly please what the fuck are you thinking? Im not being an asshole but please start thinking rationally. I dont care if you lose your money but come on.
What do you think bitcoin will be? Do you think it will be a medium of exchange or store hold of wealth? Or just a greater fools man theory? Or maybe no one knows what it is for. I've been following bitcoin and the blockchain tech since 2011. This is retarded. Blockchain IS a trillion dollar technology, BITCOIN ISNT. 
Ill get down voted for sure but seriously not a single one of you can create a discussion with me because you don't know any better why Bitcoin would reach anything. 
Im all in for blockchain but Bitcoin or any other transaction coin just isn't going to cut it right now.
You all bash on big names and researchers, yeah you know better right?
Is it really so inconceivable that people who spend years studying financial systems and trends will understand economics better than the common layman?

I mean I paid 4$of fees in a 10$ transaction and its been unconfirmed for 2 days.

Why do we need the whole China. Isn't USA, Europe, Asia(China exluded) enough for worldwide adoption?

I dont know what this has to do with anything. Also there is no way China would let bitcoin dominate their economy over Chinese Yuans. Chinas government has for years manipulated the price and fluctuation of Yuan towards their own monetary gains. They cant do that with decentralized currencies and assets. 
Chinas population heavily consists of elderly. Elderly people dont want change, they dont want to be bothered with something new. China is not as important as you think it is.

They cant remove bitcoin. They cant make it go away. But they can definitely make laws and restrict all stores etc. from accepting bitcoin. They can research users that use bitcoin and fine them and worst case jail time. Who is going to use bitcoin if you cant trade it to fiat easily and use it like normal currency? We need to have the governments on our side and not against us. No one can shut it downfrom technical perspective, but can definitely make it really hard to actually utilize bitcoins and use them like we do now.

I would like to buy a few of those 10cent bitcoins thank you

Had a short position with a nice leverage for fun. Put loss limit at 5800 and it hit like 5820 so thats unlucky

China is 15% of total crypto volume/market cap. China is not important. South Korea + USA + Japan are important.

no one will give a shit about taxing 600$. Its like selling a expensive pair of shoes. Who would tax that? Unless its continuous profit.
