@_date: 2015-12-23 06:52:24

@_date: 2015-06-01 10:15:09
2000 BTC or 2 BTC?
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:15:09
2000 BTC or 2 BTC?
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:12:00
thanks for your opinion. yes it looks like Trezor is the answer but I understood that the Xapo vault is insured and you are saying that even the insurance is not enough to cover a coin theft?
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:16:11
question is what kind of gambler you are and what games you prefer?
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:54:29
so it shouldnt be in the list
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:20:14
and this for 1 BTC only?
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:18:07
how about a free give away
@_date: 2014-10-13 06:20:58
before I visit yuor website please explain ELI5
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:27:13
ok moving coins only if I need is fine. but what would be a reason to use more than one wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:22:01
what if I lose my phone or some one will steal it? thanks
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:54:19
could You please provide the Newsweek link? thanks
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:57:17
they cant put all of us in jail
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:47:29
in general I would agree with you but as it is like securing a bank account it is better that the noobs will go more in depth learning what wallets and keys mean. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:06:07
move it from old to HD
@_date: 2014-10-03 07:45:04
why are you offering this raffle? to earn some coins? why not some other games?
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:15:16
first you buy sll and then from sll to bitcoin and then you can send the bitcoin out to your wallet
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:20:32
luckybit is not available in the USA? didnt know that. but if so, why not using a proxy?
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:39:18
sorry, but why must it be accepted? I will send you now xxx amount through my blockchain wallet and you get it.......hmm what did I miss?
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:28:24
**tend to treat certain individuals as celebrities.** = HE IS!!! believe me
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:08:37
why is rushwallet more secure than Blockchain? thanks
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:59:20
it is further asking to allow
Network communication = full network access
Storage = modify or delete contents of your UBS storage
Hardware controls = take pictures and videos
System tools = prevent tablet from sleeping
Your accounts = find accounts on the device
how do you like those?
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:22:41
oh thanks for the details. nice idea but as I see no takers yet :(
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:39:39
sorry  I meant in general  not Mtgox
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:30:36
did You mail them? 
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:14:48
similar? please explain, thanks
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:47:29
please keep us updated
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:17:49
yea who knows why?
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:32:28
but please be sure that You know how take it out if needed
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:32:06
good new thanks
forgot to ask what is min and max?
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:22:14
why are You asking? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:33:30
not rigged and best dice site in the moment IMO
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:53:50
coinapult service is good but software doesnt work. at least in my case. luckily only small test coins
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:52:02
I cant believe it. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:40:35
but they were funded on kickstarter, why again on rockethub? and usd 1k?
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:23:46
would you mind to explain more? I know bitpremier.com
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:51:25
@_date: 2014-06-11 05:54:29
Amazon is accepting bitcoin???? what did I miss here?
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:37:06
so what you propose is that we have one pc for surfing and one pc only for wallets? and this should help?
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:06:36
why not, but how about the costs to run the project?
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:24:56
ok, but how about the house invest option?
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:14:05
thanks and yes a countdown clock would be nice. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:06:49
whatever You decide. but I think it is worth a try till You understand it and earn some nice coins. it is for free as long You dont bet. there is no better place for free coins
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:34:38
yes it is cool but how do You use it on PC and Laptop? will it synch Your coins?
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:39:03
why I dont get any answer from support or here?
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:24:42
why are so many out there?
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:54:39
I had another test and this time it didnt arrive till today. I have send a mail to support and no answer yet. please let me know how you will handle this issue.
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:29:28
sure thing one could see it like you. I remember when I started to get interested I looked for an option to send USD or euro etc and it will be converted automatically to btc. with this option much more people will try it out, because they dont have btc and would like to send or pay something with btc. I hope You understand my point. english is not my native language
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:38:26
thats the way to go 
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:17:03
thanks for info. so why people dont accept $10 or $15? may they suspect some scam behind it. could be there a risk to accept it?
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:17:47
bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:37:53
the only problem I see here is that xapo has the private key
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:44:40
no I am not there now. but ask the people all questions, they are very nice. you need only to chat but the lotto will only come when people are betting. just stay a while until you understand ho wit works. you dont need to bet!
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:09:16
so what You would need is a casino with a 50/50% game = no house edge. there is one with zero house edge that I know. is a zero house edge enough for You to play there?
if not You will need a game with an advantage for the player. I am still looking for one like this :)
but the house investment option is a good one IMO
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:42:57
I would not give 20% discount. instead of giving the discount give them a nice gamble so they can win the 20% or the haircut for free. I dont know if it would be legal?
need to think about a nice gimmick/game that they can win easy the 20% and not so easy the free haircut.
may I ask how much is an haircut?
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:15:06
thank You. I said it is a nice idea and I didnt say this for the bits :)
so please give those bits to some one else who is new to btc
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:56:13
virwox.com  but fee is high
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:43:48
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:31:30
cant he cancel the 2FA and do a new one?
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:59:53
very kind :) ok another question. 
lets say I send amount xxx to a friend and he should  send me back some other day the coins. can he send to my same address I have send him?
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:05:45
how much does it cost?
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:46:16
ok but would You still work for/with a bitcoin casino ?
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:26:13
but you dont need to gamble or do any betting. just chat and the lotto will give You some free coins. and they have happy hour where You can get even more
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:07:46
thanks for explaining. sounds good to me. but I still dont understand why would You do this? just to help?
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:11:55
nice idea.........
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:55:05
I dont believe it, sorry
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:48:27
so no one got any coins yet?
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:19:01
oh it looks like a misunderstanding. I thought You meant another Xapo wallet
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:31:09
because the usb drive could have a malware etc
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:19:33
what was the amount you've send?
@_date: 2014-10-13 09:59:00
thanks a lot it worked like a charm
@_date: 2014-10-12 13:29:30
shut down the website, easy as that
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:21:38
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:56:52
thanks, but why by mail? can I PM you here?
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:17:22
take the time and listen to  AA's explanation
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:12:44
**A free hint is disclosed every 6 hours !**
where can I see when 6 hours are over ? or is there a countdown
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:28:30
no You are.............
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:54:33
lets order some more
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:04:54
I agree....IMO changetip should higher the minimum  tip amount to 1 mbit
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:01:34
did You have 2FA activated
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:22:37


thanks for the help. I am using google auth, would You recommend to switch to authenticator plus?
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:50:29
why did You do this work for three weeks? what is the reason behind?
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:13:41
yes I also would like to know if greenaddress is good and secure enough
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:39:36
does it really make sense to tip people who already own btc and know what btc is? IMO it doesnt make sense
@_date: 2014-04-12 07:00:54
thanks again, very much appreciated
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:54:29
my example would be JD but they are closed for now. but have been very serious and reliable.
@_date: 2014-10-13 07:50:49
sorry if I missed it. how can I move my old balance to the new HD account
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:42:23
I second that
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:11:49
thanks, but as they dont ask for any private details one could buy the max again and again, or what did I miss here?
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:44:53
exactly thats the way to go
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:07:20
where are you located?
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:41:16
just go to Andreas Twitter account and ask him, I am sure he will answer Your question
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:25:20
now that we know this, what is it telling us?
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:22:18
for me it doesnt matter because I take my hat off to Andreas
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:19:00
so do we need to change passwords if we have accounts with those insecure companies? or do we need to wait till they installed the security 
update? and how about the 2fa?
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:43:02
go to luckyb.it and chat a bit :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:12:13
yes 
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:57:50
I fully agree with You I also would like to see it happening
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:44:43
how about those who didn't get an email? IMO they need to change the password etc anyway
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:37:22
thank you for the info but to be frank I  prefer to wait for the update through the about page
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:15:29
maybe because if one plays a game and pays btc and wins btc  it is called gambling and illegal in many countries
@_date: 2015-05-07 06:19:48
I will follow this thread. if you find the solution please post it here. thanks
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:49:08
how long is that PIN? a PIN can be easily BFed or am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:51:28
why another dice site? there are so many out there already
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:29:38
can I use it already now and is it secure that no one will take my coins
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:16:23
and why are you not afraid or concerned?
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:02:37
he has my vote
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:30:40
what kind of games are you looking for?
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:22:35
what is so special about this kind of game? the rules? what is the HE?
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:04:19
what next? we need to wait that all websites we use will integrate your system?
what if I lose my phone and I don't have the 12 word phrase? I just need to create a new 1Block ID and that sit? or what did I miss?
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:21:50
 takes care of the investors
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:22:47
I clicked on update (android wallet) and it says your wallet is up to date with version 2.5.9
what do I need to do to update it or do I need to wait until it updates auto?
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:12:40
very good points made sir but under send from anywhere are not many countries yet
@_date: 2016-01-10 09:12:07
and paypal does not stop this kind of bitcoin deal?
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:57:30
maybe you lost it and now you are angry?
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:58:24
hopefully many servers will apply it soon because it is a great idea and I don't need anymore so many passwords to remember or to hide them
good luck
@_date: 2016-01-14 11:39:31
I could not do it but it sounds good if it will work out as you described
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:17:05
as far as I know it is not for online payments if you mean by saying virtual. I only use it in shops and ATMs
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:44:15
xapo is working fine for me
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:01:19
thank You but I bought one already :)
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:30:11
I am very surprised to hear that because in my case I get no answer for every day mail and asking for urgent help
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:16:18
so go for it if you can code it. good or bad idea? you will only know it if you are online and life
good luck
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:01:48
200 bets in one second..........and where is the fun of gambling?
good luck :)
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:49:42
thanks for explaining. I received one answer after 2 days and then my reply now for 3 days without any answer. I mailed each day again to get help. it looks you are the lucky one 
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:35:52
I wanted to update my android 2.1.1 version but it says that I have last version.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:03:13
you mean once a week?
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:13:40
I like xapo very much but their support is terrible and waiting days for an imortant support mail answer is to much and very disappointing
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:09:35
why dont you go here and ask Micon?
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:55:37
on bitcasino.io you find daily freerolls. ritght now it is a good chance to make some $$$=BTC. with a bit of luck you can earn 10-20$ in a week or 2
if you play there please play only the freerolls.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:19:01
and their free rolls? 1 mBTC for 1st place haha come on 
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:23:39
visit some faucets or play some hold'em freerolls
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:53:39
thanks for detailed info.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:26:29
found only the 10 mBTC freeroll no 10BTC
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:40:05
do you play hold'em poker?
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:26:23
thanks very much appreciated
@_date: 2013-10-19 08:49:55
sorry but I dont think that You are right, because what You are saying is that if someone has a game idea and he doesnt know to code and doesnt know to do his own website design actually he has no chance to get his idea online. if this is what You meant that would be very sad and he will die with his idea :)
are there any coders that can be trusted?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:09:34
thank You for trying to help. I have send You 2 days ago the message with the info You are asking. ok I will send it again.
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:58:32
what is the house edge?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:02:17
I received now a mail that the receiver found the mail in his spam folder.
so all was and is fine. I am sorry for the false alarm.
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:39:18
nice idea, is it Provably Fair? or did I missed it? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:56:03
hmm if You are right, then it is really bad business behavior. because the idea is good IMO and there will be always problems. but problems are there to be solved. saying that it sure needs a good and prompt support.
thanks 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:47:04
I thought I will give it a test and have send some small amount. but the receiver didnt get any mail yet after I have send it 5 days ago. it has already 905 confirmations. I also have send them a message through their website without any answer yet. I actually liked the idea very much
@_date: 2013-10-19 08:13:44
if You cant develop the idea Yourself You have a problem. if the idea is good You will be the last one who will get it online. but there is one developer who said that he never stole an idea. maybe he is the right one.
the thread is
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:47:03
I like Your theory because everything is possible. but there is no proof yet IMHO.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:06:55
lets say I do all You proposed here, and I have the wallet.dat backed up, do I need to destroy the old used computer I bought for this action?
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:33:36
why that? sorry if I dont understand Your message. what did I wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:28:36
just for info. the second test worked out fine and didnt land in spam folder
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:20:54
take a look at virwox.com it is expensive but it works fine
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:15:00
I did another test to same address to see if it lands again in spam folder. I will let You know
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:12:43
to tell You the truth Bit Pay has the worst support I ever met. really sad. I had to wait more than a week for an answer.
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:40:50
IMHO the best place to meet would be a police station
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:25:12
virwox.com is offering this already. but the more the better.
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:06:18
I just want to say that Gentry took a look into the support problem and cleared the issue in a very professional manner.
thank You
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:01:01
so you are one of the dev who dont steal ideas and deliver the projects?
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:12:03
so Your Laptop was at home? where do You live? didnt You close the door? You should easily find out who is going in and out at Your home, IMHO
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:09:27
hmm that shows me now how important it is that all those escrow guys should have a backup meeting point for their customers. or in case I would need now an escrow? where could I find one?
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:36:16
didnt know that Bit Pay's second name is Google. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:11:38
............ and that the host OS gets a keylogger attached to it. Linux &amp; security guy here ... can you tell?!
what do You mean with attached? if it is an offline machine how would he attach a keylogger and read it out?
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:01:38
I dont think it would be ok to post it here, ( will PM You) I checked the mail conversation and I saw that even I got an answer after a week or more I didnt get an answer to my question I asked. so it was really disappointing because I am not an expert in bitoin matters and just thought maybe I could use Bit Pay on our website.
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:00:30
Chapeau = I take my hat off
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:47:23
take look here
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:57:49
even if I want to login I dont see the option on page
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:59:31
when can I login again?
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:58:32
sorry didnt know that. but for me virwox is fine. I need to find out what states they dont work with
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:12:56
ok understood now, but I can tell You that I had one of the best support from google regarding google business account. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:03:38
