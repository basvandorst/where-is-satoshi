Bill Gates is on Reddit. Hell I was shocked by the amount of rich folk and professionals on here, especially in contrast to facebook!

You have an actual physical bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:31:15
No, I've just looked at your previous posts for it. Bit way.world or what ever, that's clearly a pyramid scheme. I have to admire them for literally pointing it out on their how it works section. Most companies do it more subtlety.

I know a bank card serves as ID if needed at one so at least you don't have to use government documents. 
Just go on LBC and look for a bank deposit.

Yes but that's not Hodling yourself. Your trusting an exchange to hold it for you. That's why it can be attacked and stolen. The people here have it so they Hodl their own coins (and key) to avoid attacks.

Just checked out the URL, looks like there's quite a lot you can do with BTC over there
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:43:10
Yes but by then people should be trading 0.0001 bitcoins for items rather than 1 BTC as they do now. 
A billionaire who had his money in GBP would have lost 20% of their wealth after Brexit, but the average joe on minimum wage barely felt it because they held less of the currency.

As I say, just wanted to make sure you knew.

You seem like a very unpleasant person to be around.

I got the entire Dan Carlton Hardcore History podcast series with Bitcoin. As well as GTA 5 from a computer chain near me.

They represent bitcoin blocks mined

Oh, I don't care about that even slightly, you just come across as a douche.

I could watch that website for hours 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:54:48
I paid $1 the other day and it was done in a hour. 
Maybe try viabtc transaction accelerator.

Easiest would be local bitcoins. Either cash or bank transfer.
