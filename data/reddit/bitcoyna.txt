It shouldnt be. Sounds like you were either charged GST and/or BTC value went down post purchase.
Right now on Igot:
600AUD buys:
Subtotal:1.51771937 BTC
Fee:1.0% (0.01517719 BTC)
Approx. BTC to receive: 1.50254218 BTC
1.50254218 = 579.1 AUD on Preev.com right now.

?The hell are you on about mate?

Did you check the buy price after the bank deposit and once it was in your BTCmarkets account? Perhaps the value of BTC went down in that time?
Remember BTCmarkets quotes won't be the same as preev.com (unless they are using same quote system) as well...
I just wrote this thread on finding best deal in AUS:
Compare the markets:
The link above shows you what you end up with after buying $100 AUD worth of BTC on any exchange in Australia - updated every 15mins.
I have just moved from Coinjar to Igot as they have a flat 1% fee (half that of Coinjars) and they do not charge 10% GST.
Thats generally where your money will go in Australia, using Australian exchanges...
Fees + GST + Non market rates.
Igot has 1% fees. No GST. Market rates.
Check them out! I love them I was just annoyed my last 5k BTC purchase with Coinjar I threw away $500 on GST alone!!!
p.s no affiliation just a BTC enthusiast!
*Edit - looks like BTCmarkets has low fees and no GST if what I quickly see is right. So the value of BTC must have gone down after you bought....

Bottom line, for the moment...
Igot is not charging GST. Coinjar is.

The ATO 'guidance' is not law.
Coinjar do not have to charge 10% GST currently. So yes, they absolutely can change their company policy.
I don't think you understand the situation.

They definitely need to tweet and make noise about your site.
They gained a new customer out of your site.
Suggestion - add referral links to your site ;)
In fact give me your Bitcoin address I am going to donate 0.01330 ($5) for the money you will save me.

Its a great service! Well done. I only found it because I was about to build it myself hehe.
You solved a problem. I am also a web developer with some things in the Bitcoin space. Are you an Aussie? We should talk ;)
I am so annoyed I just used Coinjar and only just found Igot (thanks to your site) - it cost me an extra $350 due to the GST!
Never again!!
Coiner1 you should send this link to the Igot guys so they can Tweet it etc. Helps you, helps them, helps us!! :)

Exactly. 
Then the Aussie dollars just flow into OS exchanges (a leakage in economic terms) and then the AU government gets 0 tax on those dollars ever again.
Well done AU govt. Well done. 
Under the current model, Australians purchasing Bitcoin from an exchange that adds 10% GST to the Bitcoin purchase will end up paying 20% GST!
For example, if that customer then goes on to buy a coffee with said Bitcoin, in Australia, because the coffee also has 10% GST added onto it, it is double dipping! Will change the way I vote that is for sure!
There is a petition to change this ridiculous Australian Bitcoin GST legislation. If you want me to dig up the link let me know.
