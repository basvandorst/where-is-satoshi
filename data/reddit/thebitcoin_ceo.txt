the wallet is something we have been testing in [IHB Labs™]( It has been around since 2013 and has transacted over 150 BTC and has yet to be hacked. Written with Scala using BitcoinJ.

thanks for the insight
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:01:30


take your time and learn a lot about wallets and security. create a paper wallet yourself offline. once you go through that process you will have a good understanding of what is takes to have rock solid security.

yup the navigation is fine tuned. thanks for noticing :) take 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-15 06:29:29
Yes, but we are still testing it and don't want to release it just yet. when we do it will be open source with an API. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:52:18
no. it needs to go higher. maybe 200 bits will help @_date: 2014-11-10 21:14:43

it is so bad i need to give you 10 bits @_date: 2014-11-04 17:12:25
I respect your opinion Andreas, but I believe this page is necessary. I can not tell you how valuable your book and speaking has been to our small company, ever since I was on LTB E78 I have not missed a chance to learn from and cover stories that help bitcoin. 
Especially that I am so India focused, your message really hits home in a country that is so plagued by corruption. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:21:10
nothing much, just that freelancers are paying too much in fees :)

you noticed that also :) I should have put a filter for reciever also, so we could see who sent Andreas tips. take 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-06 18:28:33
it doesn't matter. my name is amith nirgunarthy. i am just saying... why did they need it. it was so much extra time. i could have given in so many less clicks.

you are right, probably didn't need that part. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 07:24:36
thanks for the tip. here is 20 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 21:07:42
you are 100% right. going forward it will change, this was filed under opinion and we are currently looking at how we previously tagged past posts.
the logo is being moved and the way the nav bar works is as well. i found it to be flimsy. 
this piece was very ranty, i agree. and i should have posted the underlying data for the mining contracts. that is going to happen and i will make it avialble for download for everyone as a csv by end of next week. 
have a lot of other posts going out over the next five days. as a heads up they will be long. i am sorry, but this is stuff we just need to get out before we move forward, but all of them are positive and won't be ranty.
oh god do i need an editor. i almost failed english in high school and college. i can not tell you how much i dislike writing. hopefully i can get an editor as soon as possible. but it would have to be for equity in the company, because i can not take dollars away from my development budget.
here is 50 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 21:36:36


I agree with you, my writing is bad, I was probably not clear. I was just trying to be illustrative with the chart. That fire was too small to draw any conclusions. I don't believe I did.
But, you can draw conclusions over a long period of time. It does fluctuate, but over time it's deviation should be very close to the mining formula. This is math. Daily payout formula is below
Satoshis =((Gh/s*1000000000)/Difficulty)*50291.419
Hashrate is directly affected by the amount of hashing power connected to the network. This is more important to know and care about than fluctuations of it. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:05:36
Awesome. Thanks for taking care of that. I can see we have 12 testers already, nice! 
Looking forward to getting this going. Please update the community page to reflect that we are running two betas, now that we have added the **Decentralized** **Advertising** **Beta** to the **Global Bitcoin Index™** **Beta**

cex.io is kind of a scam. doesn't anyone do simple math to see how badly people are getting ripped off with their mining contracts.

@_date: 2014-11-10 05:46:00
Coinbase does a lot to help bitcoin. It seems like they were super responsive in this case and are taking ownership of finding a solution. 
A lot of us here, don't use Coinbase because we either mine our own bitcoins or are probably using something like electrum, armory etc. 
Which is perfectly fine, but don't forget even the underdogs have been hacked. 
We have to give Coinbase a lot of credit. They are helping us all. Please don't tell me you guys will be angry the day that you can use your own wallet at McDonalds because of all the hard work they have done in increasing awareness and acceptance, while you were all b*tching about them.
This is bitcoin, and it can be many different things to many different people. 
To judge them is not right. If you are angry, vent at Congress and ask them to audit the Fed.

I am working on my analysis now, this coupled with the fact that you are still unable to give me my full txn history doesn't make me feel so safe. I read your entire terms, may not be a scam but a horrible product and the numbers do not lie. Look at the way you display your chart for GHS/BTC pricing are you telling me that's not a scam? Misleading at best. You should know better being so prominent in the community.

thanks for the feedback. yes, i agree it was more ranty than i would prefer. going forward you won't see that, but you will see a strong anti regulation - government agnostic view point from this site. opinion pieces will always be marked opinion and news marked news.

“There’s a lot that Bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But Bitcoin won’t be the dominant system. When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you can actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two. We need things that draw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough.”

Then why wouldn't you just buy the LTC then? Mining only makes sense if you get back more coin than you invested.  Fiat money doesn't come into the equation at all. If it costs me five coins I need to get more than five coins back. Period. 
Also. Can you trace anything on the blockchain? 
Come on please. These guys claim so much crap about their hashcoin it is laugh out loud.
