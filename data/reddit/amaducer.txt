Why is it dumb?  Lots of languages have the construction.

Orrrrrrrr it could be that it's related to zir, another spelling, and xe, the nominative case of it.  Non-gendered, third person possessive.

Definitely better the second way!

I guess its somewhat more humane?  To go get a bullshit college degree?
What a world we live in.  Do you know of the Howe-Strauss generational theory?  Similar cycles.

Ah, right.  Got it.  Thank you for explaining!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:13
Wait... what was this?

Thanks Bucky!

Totally agree here - that's why I cash out on Venmo all the time.  
I've got a friend at Coinbase - I'm taking this idea there.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:37:11
You're absolutely right about Venmo.
Next problem up is time to using that money / getting it in and out of a bank - which Bitcoin doesn't really help with..

I love your new acronym!  DIH DIH!! hahahah
As someone who suffers through lots of acronyms that aren't first established and then used - I really appreciate you.

Awesome - I keep thinking about pursuing more BE, especially in my sales enablement role.  Have a great T-day!
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:45:09
I needed this - I didn't realize this was the case and now I understand bitcoin MUCH better!

Super interesting to talk with you!  It all makes sense to me.  And the reward points! Hadn't even thought about that to keep people towards the non-technological system.
Is your background behavioural economics?
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:53:44
Your analysis sounds right to me.
But the premise almost sounds absurd - why isn't there a Venmo style app for sending Bitcoin?  It's basically just a wallet that keeps track of other people's wallets, right?  Or am I a total newb?

From my limited knowledge of bitcoin, it does solve some of the problem. Because bitcoins cannot be duplicated, you don't get into the ious as easily. The prevalence of smartphones and the lightness of the coins themselves means you wouldn't need fiat money. Plus, if they weren't stored on your phone then you have security from theft. 
Thinking about this more makes me already want to contradict my arguments. I don't know enough about bitcoin.

Private banks. So while the government should be not-for-its-own-profit it has become so. Banks make money by providing our means of economy, their value add, and they pay politicians to keep the status quo. Unfortunate thing for politicians is that they are easily replaceable, and can sometimes just need a weak moment on TV or a previous scandal to make them irrelevant. Bankers need the economy to crash for that to happen, which the government won't allow because that situation isn't in their interest either.
