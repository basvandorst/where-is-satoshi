Guys, could guide us what can we do to protect ourselves? 
I have 64 coins there, how do we do to ensure that this balance is not lost or changed in case of return activities. 
I saw some other POST we should petition the government about what happened in japan. How to do it?

I do not believe that is the end of the BTC. Until then I have a perta 64 coins, and really is a good part of my savings was invested. Not desanimarei the bitcoin because I also believe that someday will be much higher. I'm still planning to go to the game again! 
If I'm upset, pissed, dumbed down? In a way yes, however confident and hope for a light at the end of the tunnel.

To disengage the conscience use all safety Blockchain.info offers. I personally use: 
+ Password; 
+ Secondary password; 
+ Google Autheticator to logon; 
+ Fixed IP (PS.: Mine is fixed.) 
And yet, just let it move that amount daily.
In more good his account. 
A few months disappeared from my wallet some BTCS, however reported that support was stolen, however I will do this process to restore BKP, who knows ....
