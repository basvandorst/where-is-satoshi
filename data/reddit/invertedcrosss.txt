Bought a GPU for 250$ worth of BTC in 2015 to mine cryptocurrencies.
Should've kept that BTC.
Everyone has a story. Still glad I bought my GPU because at the time I had no money to spare for it.

Unfortunately, I didn't know anything about BTC until 2015. But yes, I can only imagine mining in 2009!

I stumbled on my thesis director (I am a master's student in education) looking up GPU's in 2015. I immediatly thought he was a gamer. Imagine my suprise when he told me he was mining Monero and Ethereum in his garage. I went home and studied bitcoin, the tech was amazing I said to myself.
Let's just say it's kinda like he gave me a scholarship (I bought some bictoin in 2015). Also, it was very hard to talk about my research whenever we were together during 2017.

I just bought some Bitcoin, better sell because if history repeats itself it will drop 25% tomorrow :)

PS - 1) I mine Grin since Bitcoin is not profitable (not that Grin is at this rate but I rather supporting this project than Nicehash or ETH/other coins), 2) my electricity is included in my monthly rent and I am pretty sure my landlord is not going to notice an extra 5 dollars, and 3) mining in 2015 was fun.

Peter, love the podcast! Good job on the series!
For those who never listened to WBD, I highly recommend giving it a shot!

Doesn't mean it will do it again. Bitcoin in 2014 is very different than today.

Replace the 19000 and 3200 by :
Buying Bitcoin in a bull market / buying Bitcoin in a bear market
Buying Bitcoin with promises of adoption / buying Bitcoin with underwhelming adoption
Don't get me wrong, I think/hope/believe Bitcoin has a great future. But ofc it's a hard buy right now after the a whole year of downtrends. The price lower doesn't necessarily mean it's a better buy!
