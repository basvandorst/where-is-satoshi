Oh no not at all, I just haven't done much research for btc tc, and btc-e. They're both very trustworthy?
EDIT: And another reason would be that it's very easy to reinvest money after dividends are payed, so unless you have a certain amount of capital, you'd make more on havelock. I'm not sure what the exact number is, should be anywhere between 20 and 40 BTC. I'll look into moving to one of the bigger guys when I add more capital.

The 100 BTC wall on havelock at 0.027 just got removed, when the person realized they undervalued it immensely. Bummer.
EDIT: He moved it up to 0.0272

Management fee is 0.4% only on SELL. 
And yes we all know it's 1/100th of a share, but why would that even matter? 
I don't believe you can export the shares to your wallet, you'd have to convert to BTC first.
It's extremely easy to get BTC in and out of havelock. (30 minutes tops for either one)
EDIT: 2.9/2.7 = 1.074 
7.4% percent gain is huge. (7% total after all fees are taken into account)

Instead of using coinbase you could opt to use bitstamp or bitfinex and simply keep your money in USD online until after your predicted drop happens, then switch back to BTC.

I know that with havelock you can buy a share of asic that is cut into 100 mini shares. This allows you to more easily use your dividends to reinvest in asic.
0.4% sell fee (only when selling shares)
5% fee on all dividends received.
Does anyone know how bitfunder works?
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:43:30
If you were to buy them on coinbase, you could see if the price would budge by going on bitstamp.net and seeing what their sell wall is like. 
In general, 50 bitcoins isn't enough to push bitcoins up or down more than a few dimes.
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:03:57
Because they were worth 2.9 at the time on every single other BTC exchange.

It was a 7.4% undervaluation on a 100 BTC order, ripe for the taking. 
Maybe a guaranteed* 7% doesn't mean much to you, but I'm sure it's quite a large gain in a few minutes of trade for others.
*very low risk
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:42:57
Anywhere from like -127% to -5953%, closer to the latter if you're picking Butterfly Labs.
This is with ASIC's, you'll make far less with CPU's.
EDIT: You could technically get a positive US dollar ROI if the price of bitcoin soars, but at that point you're better off buying bitcoins. Do yourself a favor and just buy bitcoins instead.
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:49:43

1. You acknowledge that "buying BTC instead of mining equipment would result in a higher net profit".
2. You state that in a certain scenario, you could have made more investing in gold rather than silver
Case Study 1 = You knew that there was a better investment yet chose to take the worst one. This is a **bad** investment.
Case Study 2 = You make 300% ROI instead of 500% ROI investment in silver instead of gold. You had no idea gold was going to go up 500%. This is a **good** investment.
There's a bank that says you can pick two accounts, both are free and have no fees. The first one offers 10% IPY, the second one offers 20% IPY. They have no differences apart from the interest per year offered. Which one would you pick?
You're giving amencon and the rest of the community a really hard time.

2. Pinch to zoom in/out
3. Notifications for when prices reach a certain limit, or if price goes up a certain percent within a certain period of time, e.g. volatile periods
4. Allow users to see the bitcoin average of all exchanges (or the ones they choose) e.g.

I had 10 BTCs in Havelock stock, and decided to sell all of them at around 8% under market value (so they could go through instantly). I'm now at 9.2 BTC 
Then I noticed the huge wall at 0.027 got removed, so I wanted to slap myself in the face.
A few minutes later, he places the wall back at 0.0272. I buy everything I can with my 9.2 BTC. In roughly an hour I sell back at 0.0289 for 10.5 BTC
Ended up making only 5% profit, but still nice!

They charge $39.99 a month which waives the $0.99 fee per item sold. If you sell more than 40 items a month, it's financially beneficial for you to pay for the monthly charge. Your post is very misguiding in that it makes someone believe you have to pay that charge simply to have your products displayed on amazon.

For volatility levels, it's simple!
If the value of x goes up or down 20% percent within 2 hours, notify by notification/SMS/email!
You could even goes as far as having a 'volatility graph'. It would be the same as a normal graph except the color of the line indicating current btc value would change colors. If the value of X (current btc value) was 10% higher/lower then the value of an hour ago, have the graph line turn a yellow color. If it was a 20% difference, have the line start becoming an orange color. 30% difference? You guessed it, red color! If you want to make the graph look extra attractive, have fades between two different colors when colors change.
And you're welcome, hope you find someone to work with you on this. :)

You're absolutely right. But if you divide 2.9 by 100, you get 0.029, not 0.027. I took advantage of the difference on an exchange with lower daily volume.

I sent the CEO of Coingig.com a link to this post.
I've been a seller on there for a few weeks now and I completely agree, there is no way for the buyer to be secured. In my opinion an escrow service needs to be created, with like a 1% fee. And then once both parties "validate", the money is released to the seller. This sounds awfully similar to paypal, but that's the one way to do it safely. At least until sellers start getting feedback.
EDIT: Apparently an escrow service exists.... use it!
