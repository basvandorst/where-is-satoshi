That broken clock was right twice a day.

"fast" and "low" are incredibly subjective words. Removing them removes the debate over how true they are.

I cashed out my entire 401k and put it into crypto. Depending on state taxes, you’ll get 50-60% of the account value in cash.

@_date: 2018-01-14 18:34:31
And then explode in your face?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:32:28
Ok. Thank you for your reasoned criticism.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:21:33
Have you tried not talking down to them? Most people are receptive to new ideas if you aren't a complete asshole.

Isn't the whole point of crypto to enable people to be free of banks?
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:47:34
Great style! Love these.

This is not Coinbase, it's the card issuer.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:50:58
So you made 180 predictions, and hope one of them is good?

Do you think the Winklevoss' will ever do anything on their own?

m$ = 10^-6 $
M$ = 10^6 $

If you can't take the time to write it with care, why do you expect someone else to read it with care?
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:35:04
If my net worth is negative, does that make my crypto investment infinite percent of that?
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:35:44
Well, since you can't use margin in hindsight, I stand by what I said.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:11:59
Why bother saying anything, if you don't care how the message is received? Sounds like you just like to hear yourself talk (or read your own writing).
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:48:24
No, you're missing the point: there has to be a transition between traditional fiat and BTC over a period of time for the general populace. It is not an on/off switch. They will have to interface with each other for a while before BTC can replace other currencies.

If it’s comparable to his other work, it’s about 15% correct, and 85% bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:43:44
So I offended a fanboy? Oh noes. . .
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:46:56
Yeah, but so are emojis. I'm not sure that this is as big of a deal as you're trying to make it.
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:34:23
Quit begging here.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:17:23
So, this is a pyramid scheme layered on a CPU hijacker to mine. What a world.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:46:39
How does your super hardline stance help anyone adopt?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:05:31
Whatever you say, dude. You’re the reason people are hesitant to join the Bitcoin “community”.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:18:42
You have made no attempts to do anything other than accuse me of. . . something? I’m not really sure what your goal is. You can declare whatever you want about me if it makes you feel like you’re better than a stranger online. Best of luck in life. You’re going to need it.

brb . . . changing my name to "AllKnowingOne"
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:50:12
Yes. But how does that change anything? Why are you trying to undermine my character and credibility instead of discussing how to spread adoption?
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:22:43
Just did a quick browse of your post history - do you ever post anything that isn't a scam or begging?
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:08:08
It's never wise to use margin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:48:21
It is now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:42:28
You don't seem to be countering my point. I agree that it enables nuts. Because it enables EVERYONE.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:19:39
Yes. It also enables left-wing extremists, centrists, socialists, communists, capitalists, fascists, and in general anyone who is remotely human.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:10:22
It shouldn't go on a picture if it's over 10 words.

"Bitcoin price will hit $1 Trillion", says some equally delusional man.

My opinion is that John Williams is one of the greatest composers of our time.

Very cool style! Great work.
