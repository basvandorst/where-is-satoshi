so you pull one quote from one person most likely out of context and that proves that they do not understand economics but you do?  Also one of your comments promotes Keynesian ideals...
"Spending/giving increases adoption and acceptance!" this is also know as stimulus...

Thanks for a reasonable response!  I've actually checked it out and love the idea of bitcoin after I get my current debt down a bit I'm going to adopt a more bitcoin friendly lifestyle!

First I'm not keynesian or neoclassical, second when you spend something to with the desired effect of increasing the velocity of spending of a commodity in this case bitcoin that is pretty much astimulus.  Also try arguing with logic or fact and you might be more convincing.

In what way?

Do you have a background in economics/finance?  Not trying to troll just curious about where your viewpoints are coming from

just to expand on inflation fighting real quick it's not that the Fed stops buying debt, its that they drive up the interest rate of securities through the sell of securities which also tightens the money supply.  The Fed acts as a fiscal agent for the Gov but doesn't lend to or from the Government.  The Government actually goes to the Treasury to issue new debt.
