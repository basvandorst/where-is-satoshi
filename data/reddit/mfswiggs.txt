Is it worth coupling this UASF with a minimum block size rule? The change would be that blocks are at least 1MB. When activated this would immediately split the chain into two (1) the 1MB+ (Segwit) chain and the (2) 1MB- (current) chain. 
Currently most blocks are 900kb+ and there is always transactions in the mempool, so it shouldn't be a problem generating the 1MB+ blocks.  Also assuming that Bitcoin continues to grow then this new rule will become meaningless in the (near?) future.
The solution might also be better than a POW hard fork as this fork comes from a change in block validation. It also gives non-Segwit miners the opportunity to join the 1MB+ chain at a later time.

Maybe this UASF could be coupled with a minimum block size. So change the block size validation so that blocks are at least 1MB. This would immediately split the chain into two (1) the old chain composed of blocks that are below 1 MB in size and the new chain composed of blocks at least 1MB in size.
Most blocks are greater than 900kb so this doesn't represent a big change from the current block size. Assuming that bitcoin continues to grow then the minimum 1MB size will have very little effect in the future.
Doing this would also give non-Segwit miners the opportunity to join the 1MB+ chain at a later time.
This solution might be better than a POW hard fork as this is more a validation hard fork. Miners might need help ensuring that their blocks are at least 1MB.

How does my lightning node learn about other lightning nodes? Is it possible for my lightning node to send a payment to someone else even if we are not directly connected to each other?
