Hi, can you explain how a bigger block size can make it so lightning would be ready by now. I thought lightning needed segwit and some other poster was saying that those solutions were just vaporware.

Wasn't Counterparty also trying to do something similar? Didn't hear much from them lately.

When will lighnting be working. I read in the thread there are now 8 groups working on developing it and some have already had end to end tests on the testing net. But you are saying it's not existing. When I look at some github repro like roasbeef I see a lot of code.

I thought that people are now using Ether for transfers of money. I was looking at coinmarketcap and I see Ether is almost 10% of bitcoin so how can it not be a form of money?

I went to their website listed on the bottom and they need to spend $10 on web hosting as there's nothing there.

What does that mean, who are ViaBTC and why won't they support SegWit?

Some people here are saying he has invested in other stuff like alt coins, exchanges, applications and things like that so I don't think I can trust him myself.  He seems sneeky kind of person if that's the right work to use.

What are the unresolved problems?  How many groups are now working on LN implementations? I read someone saying 8 different groups but I am not sure who they all are.

So many pros and other than it will take some work to change wallets (which is mostly already done / in progress) I am not aware of any cons.

I think it's not so much a war as a country that's all wanting to go in one direction and a few sponsored terrorists who want to take control :-(  Very sad that the few spend the time and money to cause so many problems for the hundreds of hard working developers who are helping change the world.

Hi, do you know if there are some white paper or something about bigger blocks that we can see. I think most developer say it's not good but just some few people here on reddit say it's okay and we have very big blocks are good.
