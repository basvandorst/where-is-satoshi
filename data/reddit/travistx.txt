Here's a better copy of that video:

Yeah, everyone keeps saying Gemini supports Segwit. They do not seem to be generating Segwit addresses. I'm not sure what "support" they are actually showing. Unless I'm missing something, they are no better than Coinbase in this regard.

Bitcoin history is littered with sad stories of people leaving money on an exchange only to lose it from hacks, bankruptcy, government seizures, etc.
On breadwallet, go to the receive page, copy the address under the QR code.  Then in Coinbase, go to the send page, and paste that address in.

Sorry there might have been a misunderstanding. I wasn't asking what exchange the data comes from.  I meant what website can I go to, to see these charts?  I've been using bitcoinwisdom for BTC charts, but as far as I can tell, that site doesn't show BCH charts.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:41:39
Off topic, but what website / app is your BCH/USD chart from?
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:22:00
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:41:19
That's pretty unfortunate, especially for Overstock, who has been involved in Bitcoin for quite some time.
Did you end up getting anywhere with this?

She should have read his other tweet!

If you start getting an amount that you're uncomfortable carrying around with you in your hot storage (breadwallet), you might want to look into hardware wallets for cold storage.  Ledger or Trezor are good ones.

I don't think that was possible here since a github account is what was compromised.  The binary file was hosted on github, whereas the checksum is printed on their website.

Maybe if you edit the post to remove the link, and then edit it again to put it back?  I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page, and we're fighting against vandalism, not each other.

I checked from another computer, you're right.

I'm rebuilding megaman's foot using this pattern.  I could use some help.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:54:35
Could you? I have 2 accounts that I can run it with.  The old script writes over the american flag so I stopped it.  This design i think is the most respectful of it's surroundings and looks good too.  I haven't seen anyone else actively working on anything.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:39:37
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:18:32
I like it.  Maybe one of the script authors can help with this plan.  ?
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:23:20
Ah ok, I will help.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:38:41
TBH I think this plan looks better than our original plan anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:29:15
Looks good.  I'm helping.

Is it just me, or is this circle not symmetrical? Was that intentional?

The past 9 hours disagrees with the "bitcoin doesn't sleep" theory.

What this really needs to get everyone on board is a visual mockup, showing what it's going to look like on and where it's location will be.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:03:16
mrchaddavis, thoughts on updating your script with qoloku's changes, which includes the 3 missing corners from the text?  IMO it looks better with these 3 corners filled in.
Also, A+ work man.  You should post a donation address.

I don't think I am.  I've been blacking out the area between new B and France.  If I'm conflicting with the hive mind, I'd like to see the plans so I can be on the same page.

We're nit-picking capitalization in a text message?
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:28:17
Just curious what this means, and what would make it bad.  Like doing arbitrage between LocalBitcoins and Gemini?  Or are you alluding to some money laundering or something?

He asked for an alternative so I gave one that people have had success with.  [This site]( says Gemini will allow trading BCC and BTC, which was the concern here.

These look pretty nice.
