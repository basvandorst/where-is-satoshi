oh, you think I am ok?  thanks!  does it take 10 confirmations before anything shows up?  I would have thought it should show 'incoming transactions' even before they have 10x confirmations?

Thanks I'll give one of those a go.

I should clarify, when it's down $15 I mean down to $465.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:12:33
Do you use any of those?  if so, which one would you recommend? how much would it cost for each trade roughly?
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:29:25
Yea I checked that.  No pending deposits are showing.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:40:38
all OK.   The Bitcoin finally showed up in my account.  I just wish they showed the transaction in the 'incoming transactions'.

thank you!  that makes me feel much more at ease...  I will wait it out.

Thanks.  I hope so.  It has been 8 confirmations and nothing showing in Crypsy yet.   :/
