Amazing Idea, I think the doubters here are don't care enough to really put some thought into the white paper or don't have the proper background to make sense of it. I will be following this coin closely for sure, maybe even work on the project myself. Great work

His meme contradicts your point. DCA makes a lot of sense. Dwaas, you are misunderstanding what DCA actually means buddy

Or instead of keeping it in fiat transfer it to altcoins (LTC, ETH etc one of ur liking) which are probably gonna skyrocket after the fork as the btc war will be too damn bloody..

Sure you are raising a lot of good points, but could you tell what happens if these "governments" decide to attack cryptocurrencies. Like just imagine US shutting down Coinbase, Bittrex and Poloniex. Yes you do have your private keys but you dont have any gateway back to fiat, and dont you think the few stores which accept cryptocurrencies as means of payment will also terminate that soon after when their means of going back to USD is no longer there? 
Even now EVERYONE is getting hyped about cryptocurrencies value increase in terms of fiat (9k, 10k, 11k... all of these are value in 
USD!?) 
Looking forward to hearing someone make a nice counter argument to this issue (and please dont answer saying things like fiat will be replaced in 3-5 years and completely gone because that is a "hype" iddea but not a solid one imo)

   My question for you is, in the 1099-K form sent to me by coinbase the number of transactions is let's say "100" however when I pull my transaction history even though I take out the wallet to wallet transactions I end up with more than a "1000" transactions. Do I need to report all "1000" transactions or the ones which are significant enough and make sure that the reported Gross amount in Schedule D is close to the Gross amount specified on the 1099-K? Do the Gross amounts need to perfectly match because there are some transactions with the capital gains/loss being "0" and when I include those transactions I have a gross amount a bit higher than the gross amount reported on 1099-K and when I take them out I end up with a gross amount less than 1099-K?
