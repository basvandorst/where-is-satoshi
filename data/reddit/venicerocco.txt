Maybe Satoshi was hired by the government to create Bitcoin because it's apparently untraceable nature it attracts drug dealers and money launderers. Satoshi was on a work for hire basis, signed *very tight* confidentiality agreements and obviously did not keep the coins himself because they belong to his employer.

That's not entirely fair. Its akin to someone creating a purpose build building out in the dessert where drug dealers go to buy and sell *billions* of dollars worth of drugs. "A life sentence for a building." isn't exactly what happened there.

Do you think Judge Forrest is fair and reasonable?

It's a racket. 
"Forrest was nominated by Obama to the bench in May 2011 on the recommendation of U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York" 
Schumer is the guy who "discovered" and first launched the FBI's investigation of Silk Road. 
It's one big drug war family like we're second world country.

DPR's private PGP key was stored on Ross Ulbricht's personal laptop. That alone is pretty damning. And then there's everything else. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:26:33
I'm convinced he thought he was safe because he was on the dark net, using PGP, open wifi etc. etc. Just completely naive.
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:45:11
Exactly. They're clutching at straws and they're only hope is to promote any reasonable doubt they can. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:04:03
Absolutely. But it's not strange at all. It's perfectly logical when you consider the drug war at large. That generation / class / ideological group are pathologically obsessed with the war on drugs. They will unleash all their power and money to destroy some people's lives.

Two docs are: Alex Winter's via Epix and Vice's. There's also a narrative currently in development.
You can make a movie out of anything, it's the way you tell it not the what it is. This story absolutely has the right tantalizing ingredients, though it may lack an audience because of its specificity.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:52:08
The judge has so far granted ALL of the prosecution's requests and NONE of the defense's, so this doesn't look good.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:00:07
Fair enough. Looks like the judge isn't quite as bad as I suspected.

The "evidence presented" in the trial is all now tainted from these new revelations.
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:37:34
Judge Forrest was appointed by Sen. Charles Schumer who launched the investigation into Silk Road - 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:59:00
There is *not* ample evidence that Ross tried to have people killed and here's why: now that the public has been informed that two leading agents in the trial had conflicts of interest in the case (they have been charged with stealing the defendant's money), it means that any evidence secured by said officers is utterly inadmissible now. The reason Lyn has been so adamantly pro Ross is because she knew about these revelation before you and I did.
Corrupt DEA / Secret Service officials is a *really big deal* in cases where evidence they secure is used.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:12:51
It absolutely *does* render the evidence mute. 
Given the officers had a gross conflict of interest any evidence they procure becomes irrelevant. You cannot trust their evidence, as they probably made it all up and planted it. This is how the law works, evidence is thrown out if the due process isn't followed, and stealing money from the defendant while talking to him is not due process!!
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:38:56
The question I'd ask a jury is do you trust *any* of the evidence now that it's perfectly apparent that two of the leading officials engaged in a broad range of illegal activities calculated to bring them personal financial gain. Furthermore, Secret Service special agent Shaun Bridges *actually had admin access* to the Silk Road site (via Curtis Green).
I believe it's possible to successfully argue that 1) given Bridges had admin access to the site, and 2) Bridges has been shown to have acted illegally, that the evidence presented on Ulbricht's laptop cannot be trusted because of this gross misconduct. 
This is up to jury interpretation of course, but it certainly casts *reasonable doubt* over the evidence which is all that is needed for a non guilty verdict.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:07:16
The judge refused the defense to bring a LOT, and I mean A LOT of evidence to the trial. She was desperately one sided.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:49:01
You believe that demonstrably corrupt officials suddenly decided to play it straight and just left the laptop untouched? In light of the new evidence of gross misconduct and a massive conflict of interest it seems reasonable to doubt the evidence now. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:51:20
Oh but they do. If you can argue that the evidence gathered by the corrupt officials becomes inadmissible due to their conflict of interest and due process not being followed. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:34:52
They were pretty deep into the investigation though to be fair. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:51:24
You keep asking me to read the document. What specific conclusions are you expecting me to discover?
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:06:10
"These federal agents had no part in the seizure of his laptop and the evidence gained from it." - yes they did. They were communicating with "DPR" for over a year therefore they had a *direct* part in both the seizure AND the evidence gained from it.
"how can you not also believe this evidence corroborates what we have already seen from his trial" - there *is no evidence*!! That's what I'm trying to point out. You are basing your belief that he orchestrated a M4H based on *now faulty evidence* - where is the evidence? 
It is you who is in deep denial over having your world view shifted from this new evidence which *completely invalidates* your entire argument. The corruption of the agents renders your evidence logically and unbiasedly uncertain. ***There is no evidence.*** 
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:28:17
It's logical and non-biased to presume he is innocent of arranging a murder for hire plot *now that it's been revealed that* the officials were corrupt, and any evidence they provided cannot be trusted. You are basing your conclusion on dirty evidence generated by corrupt officials.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:08:54
It means that the entire case brought by the Federal Government is now tainted beyond repair. Every shred of evidence used against Ross is potentially unusable now. These revelations bode well for a retrial.
EDIT: Josh Dratel's tweet - 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:12:06
Right because no evidence has ever been tampered with ever and no corruption has ever taken place. I recommend you spend some time in the real world. Its a very good learning experience.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:43:04
It's up to the prosecution, and also you in this discussion, to prove that Ross executed a murder for hire. So far, all of the evidence they have provided, of which you are also using to form your opinion, is now moot.
Further, I have a copy of the 95 page indictment here thank you very much. Quit telling me to read it and try challenging my point.
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:34:54
He's known for months but was gagged.
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:37:53
Not any more.
@_date: 2015-03-31 05:43:54
I have no legal background and I honestly don't know what'll happen. All I know is as an observer, it appears as if thy have a good case for a mistrial. The only reason Ross wasn't granted bail was because of the duff murder for hire charges. So if they are thrown out then maybe he could be released on bail pending a new trial. And who knows what - if anything - may happen before the sentencing. 
But honestly that's all speculation. I don't have a clue and neither does anyone, even the legal professionals at his point. It comes down to Ross launching a case for retrial. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:03:48
It all comes down to interpretation, argument and persuasion. If people of influence can argue the point you made and other people of influence (judges, juries) agree, then the entire case just became one giant mess. All of the evidence is potentially inadmissible now. But if no one powerful enough is able to make a good argument and no one wants to listen the. Nothing will happen. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:36:37
Where gross misconduct and conflict of interest are apparent, it's reasonable to cast doubt over the evidence that the two officers were in part responsible for gathering.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:58:29
The judge in the case has leant profoundly in favor of the prosecution. Dratel will probably request a mistrial.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:58:47
I think you answered your own question. The bottom line is that we don't know. But just watch... Something tells me the murder for hire charges in Maryland will mysteriously go no where after they conveniently smeared him.
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:40:19
Even more reason to ensure a fair trial. If the evidence is *that* overwhelming the prosecution shouldn't need any additional judicial help.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:34:10
hehe, totally. The star leverage for the DEA / Secret Service agent villain character just increased to Christoph Waltz levels.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:15:48
It's pretty clear that he wasn't working alone and that he thought he was safe using Tor and PGP. He was also *highly* vulnerable for hacks and being framed. Naive, stupid, in over his head, easily lead and probably stoned half the time. Doesn't deserve life in jail but we live in a country that is pathologically anti drugs and will crush you. But he was very clearly guilty of a lot of illegal behavior, despite the FBI shenanigans, the unfair trial and the involvement of others.

Why do you think Dratel told the court that Ross' Bitcoin came from investments when it's so easy to trace them back to Silk Road and they had no evidence of this? Is Ross telling Dratel everything? Or was this Dratel's blunder?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:24:52
It'll find its footing. There's an industry out there that doesn't know it needs Bitcoin yet. Maybe its related to finance, maybe its related to import/export, maybe its related to dot com, I dunno. But Bitcoin's match made in heaven is out there somewhere.
