The trick is not allowing fear to control the information you allow yourself to consume. The hardest thing is learning to not fear the truth. Even when that truth goes against everything you currently belive. If you resist information bases on the fear of losing yourself, you have already lost control to fear. Learn what fear is, then rest comes easy.

It's more complicated than that. It would say day trading in general is a bad idea for someone asking a question like this...daytrading bitcoin is like day trading stocks (relativly). So if your not comfortable trading the s&amp;p on the daily I would say just dollar cost average into long term portfolio, and scalp profits when you must.

I am already telling everyone that I already told to use coin base not too.
If rather have them not buy at all then to get tricked into a chain that isn't what bitcoin is all about.
