Dooglus, you are the gift that keeps on giving. Thanks for running this. I wish BFX would just say what the losses are but instead we're left with fear porn and conjecture.

I for one appreciate and read your thread OP, even with the nastiness attached to it. Don't mind the haters or downvotes. Squad shit.

Jesus christ, you think BitGo would have some sort of logic like if(withdraw.amount &gt;= (bitfinex_wallet.balance * .05)) lockAccount(); callBitFinex();

There is no easy way to tell most wallets (at least mobile) not to spend outputs from certain addresses together.

That doesn't really work that well in practice. I think it's better to treat others how they want to be treated.

yeah that's just not true. you have built-in gains. there's a formula for calculating but the pre-PR appreciation has IRS implications if you sell even after you get decreed.

First, welcome down the rabbit hole! Second, the best place to buy them if you don't want to give all your information to Coinbase/Circle is to find someone on  or visit an ATM (read the reviews first though) which you can find on  
Security-wise, for the amount you're planning on buying (ie, ~1 Bitcoin), assuming you don't have a bunch of untrusted apps downloaded on your phone, I recommend downloading Mycelium, Airbitz or Breadwallet and storing the coins on your phone. If you do, just make sure you follow the backup procedure outlined in the app when you first install it so that you can recover your coins in the event that your phone is lost or stolen. 
Regarding divisibility, a Bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. You could buy 1 cent worth of Bitcoin theoretically. There is no requirement that you buy 1 whole Bitcoin at once.
Hope this helps!

did you write down their 12 word recovery phrase? if so you can enter the 12 words at:
If you didn't, your best bet is try to see if you have a backup of their wallet file (perhaps you had them email it to you as part of your settings), in which case you could have someone try to help you brute force it.

A car like this M4 would likely bottom out at somewhere around $25k even with heavy usage and being 10 years old, so really, it's like $5,000 a year to drive if you plan on hodling for awhile.

Actually, you might be surprised. On more than one occasion a teller at my bank asked me -- under feigned 'interest' but clearly for regulatory scrutiny -- what I planned to do with the $2,000 I was withdrawing (which was to buy a Ninja 250). Definitely gave me the heebie jeebies because they are so transparent.

This is extremely relevant and I agree completely. Royal pain in the ass when you have two separate donation addresses or payment addresses on different sites that you don't want associated with one another. Literally have to import the keys into separate wallets to maintain privacy, which boils down to basically not being worth it when the amounts are only a few dollars.
