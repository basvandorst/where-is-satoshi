I mean yeah I'm sure those other things like mining profitability are bad or something. I was just commenting on how the mempool is only getting more full when more transactions happen than get processed and only gets less full when less transactions happen. 
Which isn't good. It means right now we're happy less people are using bitcoin.

The number of transactions per second is down. Whenever it elevates the mempool fills as it regularly outpaces the ability of miners to mine blocks.

In addition to the difficulty change, bch recently became more profitable to mine on asics. This can be seen as a contributing factor to the unconfirmed transactions we are seeing currently. Unconfirmed transactions could also cause honest actors and users to become critical of the future success of the bitcoin network. 
Yes there are people who openly attack bitcoin and prefer bch. That holy war is impossible to miss. However, based on the current situation, it is likely that the recent criticism is not purely these people and their sock puppets. It is reasonable to say that normal users are frustrated because they can't use their money. I would be, you likely would be too. 
This is why a lasting solution is so desirable. It's why people are interested in the lightning network. It's why I hope it succeeds. But to deny that there is a problem with the current state of bitcoin is failing to acknowledge evidence to the contrary. We can only hope that developers can create solutions, before the problems destroy user confidence.

I don't get how 8mb is viewed as a remotely large number. It isn't. Its a penance. We could easily handle 100mb blocks on nearly every computer in the world. 
That's without including how memory grows and decreases in cost over time, a function that can be used to approximate scaling.

Bitcoin has to break 1.67% plus a penny in fees. Most transactions don't do that now. It's going to need serious changes to compete with the existing infrastructure and the competition. Iota is feeless and growing visibility. Expecting bitcoin to somehow beat that out seems like a stretch.

8mb is still nothing in modern computing terms. I click images bigger than that all day.

I mean the article is bad, but I've had 4 coinbase based transactions fail in the last 48 hours. A fifth likely will fail soon. Confirmed 169 times, yet coinbase isn't sure yet. 
Coinbase sucks.

Merchants aren't allowed to, but do. What's visa going to do? Say you can't take visa? Alright we'll just use MasterCard only then.

Look guys I like btc, but right now it doesn't look like bitcoin is going to be the one to kill banks. It's going to be an altcoin.

I haven't done research, or picked a side, but talking like that doesn't make you sound right. It just makes you sound dug in.

Nah man. Just accept it. Bitcoin is an inferior technology. It's going to fail.
