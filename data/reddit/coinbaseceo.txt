But if we provided such a simple and convenient option than there is the possibility the payer might not sign up with Coinbase.  How then do you propose we inflate our numbers?

Excellent work.  Expect a little extra in your paycheck this week.

There is no regulation saying we can't post a simple QR code with a Bitcoin address along with a sign up option.  It's just that if we did this people might realize that you don't have to be logged in to Coinbase to transfer bitcoin and we wouldn't get any of that precious data to mine and sell.

Thank you but I don't think I will be able to accept this because I don't believe in transferring bitcoin outside Coinbase.

I'm glad that you see that this is an issue.  I only wish it wouldn't take a front page post to get your attention.  I have emailed Coinbase before about this and I've even seen it posted here before and despite promises to correct it the problem remains.
I hope you don't mind that I keep this reddit username.  It appears that if used appropriately it can be an effective way of keeping you honest.
That said, I have been using Coinbase since the day you opened and I appreciate all you have done for Bitcoin.  I'm just doing what little I can to steer you towards (what I feel to be) the right path.
Good luck with the new exchange.
