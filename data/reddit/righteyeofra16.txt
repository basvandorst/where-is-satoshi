When someone buys the Bitcoins they go into escrow, then the buyer is supposed to make the payment, then you will want to call the bank to verify it was deposited and that it was cash. If you stick to calling the bank and verifying you will do just fine. Then once you verify the money was deposited then you can release the Bitcoins to the buyer. People will buy from new sellers as long as you have a good price. Also maybe allow lower buy amounts at least at first to get some rep.

I like how they put the home pod on the list like contributed to the rise. It was a failure.

It Bitcoin verse Bitcoin Trash. There whole idea was to confuse people, which is why I dumped the btrash as soon as I could.

It will increase the price because there will be less Bitcoins available. There are 1,800 bitcoins created every day, when it's halved, then only 900 will be created. The less Bitcoins available the more the price will move up. It's why when the government prints more money the fiat currency's value goes down.
If you look at the last 2 halvings, the price jumped after it  occurred.

Ordered! Going to read and then pass it along and then probably buy another. Thanks for helping Bitcoin!

Genesis doesn't pay very good at all, used it for a couple years and lost money.
Started mining with InnovaMine and have already made my investment back, so happy I didn't write off mining.
Check it out, it's great! [

Which is determined by the amount of mining power.

I think it's safer to say 90% of Alts are in a bubble. Most don't have much purpose and they won't have any value outside of trading them out for BTC or ETH.

Monero or Etherium are great, I mine both. Not as profitable as it once was.

There is but it's quite a bit less than other routes. It's definitely the best price but not always convenient.

Supposedly there are a small group of miners who are thinking about attempting the fork regardless, which is why Coinbase is shutting down for a short time today.

You could just get a safe deposit box like I did. It only costs $30 for the whole year.

Use Bitstamp to buy with credit card.
Use LocalBitcoins to buy and sell person to person.
