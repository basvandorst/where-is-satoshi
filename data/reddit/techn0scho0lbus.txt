Do you happen to have a link to a short description of the differences between bitcoin and Dogecoin or other alt coins?
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:31:15
Perfect!, Such Thanks.

Money is not life. I've lost a lot of money in the past and you have to realize that it's "just money" as hard as that is to say. The things that matter, your relationships, your character, your life experiences are not affected and will continue to strengthen over time.

such wow. You doge people and the things you are doing here are amazing.

I lost about 780$ US. I sold bit coins in June of 2013 and have been trying to withdrawal every since but MtGox stalled the withdrawal and never paid.

They still won't transfer me my funds from June 2013 because they claim they must process wire transfers manually and cannot make it through the queue. Explain that one...

It's not just the BTC withdrawal issues. I've been waiting since June 2013 for a funds transfer which they aren't giving me because they say they "must process them manually" and cannot keep up with the queue.

You're right, and I've pieced together the same story from the scant official information we have. I'm just very upset that the company is being dishonest about this issue.

They specifically tell people (me) that they cannot transfer funds because they have a long queue and must process them manually. I have been waiting almost a year (since June 2013). As far as I know, wire transfers have nothing to do with whether one has a US bank account, but regardless that is not their explanation.

Go claim the bounty

The short answer is you don't use MtGox. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 11:50:34
So long as MtGox refuses to admit that their funds are tied up and keep calling it a result of a large processing queue then they deserve any of our support.

It hasn't resumed for me either. I have a withdrawal still pending after almost three weeks. This is a big problem for Mt. Gox. Here is a link to their service forum where people are discussing it:

Bullshit. There are still many people, myself included, with month-old unprocessed withdrawals. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 09:39:45
I have a 1 month old withdrawal that is not completed.
