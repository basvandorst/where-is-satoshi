Oh you are one sad fuck. Even came back to reply.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:00
HODL. When it dips more buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:54:58
You'd be trading. If the price does decrease, then you'd get more bitcoin that way. If not you'd have less than you would have had if you were to just hold. (And you'd be really mad).
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:14:39
Man people these days can't read.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:28:35
We are back boys!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:52
Holy fuck 17k sell wall on GDAX eaten in seconds...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:20
GDAX wtf is wrong with you. Oh my god.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:50
What a miserable piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:55
And it begins
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:36:13
Weak as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:53:53
I feel you there buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:34:58
Sad little troll.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:02:52
5 years ago. 1 year ago. 6 months ago. 1 month ago. Yesterday. Now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:46:18
That feeling will get better after a month. Get your concentration else where and hold. Your future self will thank you.

Here we go boys!
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:08:25
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:24
when the mempool is flooded, yes. Both my transactions have not been confirmed as well. (100+ sat/byte and the other 200+)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:49
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:47:00
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:41
Sell and get back to school.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:26:54
Anyone could write that.
I don't need to prove anything to you or care what you think.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:34:13
Buy more
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:51:17
Yes, you would receive it. The reason (for the new addresses) is so that all your transaction history won't be on one address, hence increase your privacy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:03:38
I'm also here for the money. Just not quick money.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:25:31
To learn about it, yes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:39:47
Save the click guys. It's worse than @_date: 2017-11-16 07:21:05
nah fuck bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:00
It really is crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:14:29
Holy fuck I'm glad I sold my car and bought some.
I have been saying WTF for these past few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:25:19
Did the same thing. Got a nice profit. Dumped the bch like a whore and bought btc back again. Felt good.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:07:42
I was thinking the same thing when I was about to buy it. Pulled the trigger and bought a bit more than 1 btc right away. Really happy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:19:38
Thank you for bringing me back my childhood.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:16:18
Sold all my btc to bch for a while got a nice profit. Now bought my bitcoin back plus extras. Thats what bitcoin cash is useful for.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:56:00
Sell all? Never.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:25:00
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:22:57
No capital gain tax here as well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:19:39
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:01:49
Haha this is perfect. 
Needs 16 $10,000,000 though
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:43:23
Looking at back it will be very low. Don't hesitate, buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:47:33
Just bought at around 3-4% dip. Felt good.
Here's another wave. Buy!
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:12:42
Still in the Earth's atmosphere boys. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:09:58
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:21:35
It's over 9000

This gif never gets old.

They are stupid.

What do you expect from Roger Ver's site?
