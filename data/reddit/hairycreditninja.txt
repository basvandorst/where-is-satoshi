Marincasa.org is a non profit that was formed this year to help children who had the most unfair beginnings in life navigate the legal system, their education, and the beginning of their adult hood. 
Most of these kids have never in their life had an adult figure that helped them in any way. CASA volunteers aim to change that. They represent these kids and go to bat for them. They do everything they can to heal from their broken child hoods and to live as healthy happy and thriving adults. 
They are doing incredible work in the world, and would be beyond grateful for even a fraction of a bitcoin donation
I have been doing all of their IT for free to help them get up and running.

It is known.  JP Morgan had 80 billion $$ short derivative positions on gold in 2000.  They had held it down since the 80's and they nearly went bankrupt when it quadrupled.

Wow.  I've been a trader for over 20 years now watching the fed daily.  LOL on your comment and lack of understanding of what the fed can and cannot do, and does and does not do.
Research Quantitative Easing for the last 9 years.

That is why I am asking.  The last 48 hours was perfect program selling.  ETH and LTC went down tick for tick in a uniform style that only algorithms can do.

Anyone who has ever been a trader with stocks know what HFT/Algo trading looks like.  The last 48 hours was perfect algo trading.  Just put ETH and LTC charts next to each other.  Program selling 100%.  That isn't nefarious.  It is fact.
