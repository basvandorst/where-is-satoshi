It should! Let me know!

That public master key has nothing to do with blockchain and doesn't allow you to spend, it can just recreate your public keys (bitcoin addresses) deterministically.

Yes, LTC, DOGE &amp; PPC wallets are already working well!

Isn't there any way to make normal pool useless, but not p2p ones? (i.e. if operator had to give too much data to miners and block found could be submitted by miner directly -- no more incentive to run a pool if user can cheat).
Of course p2p pool would have to work somehow.

Good question, I was still hesitating between GPL-like or BSD-like.
Interested in your opinions!

Proof of Stake solves that problem

Yes, it can parse full bitcoin blockchain in 4/5 hours (LTC 10 to 15 minutes)

It still needs to connect to bkchain.org API (query balance/UTXO, etc...).
However if you host your own daemon that is in sync with the network, you won't need bkchain.org, and everything is in your control.

Maybe there was some space before/after?
Search definitely need some improvements.

 Environment?
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:02:47
Yes, bkchaind is the backend daemon.
It still uses bitcoind underneath (it reads data from HDD to catch up, then switch to RPC for live info).
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:04:22
Yes, unfortunately I started my project at a time it didn't exist.
I will check what can be shared (but different backend languages, so probably not so easy).

Why not change hashing algo on a regular basis (as soon as ASIC get near manufacturing)? That should discourage people from investing in ASIC since it would be made obsolete as soon as it exists.
Basically the same as testnet being reset as soon as people started selling coin.

Everything is stored (that's how I can very quickly display balance of addresses even if they have thousands of operations). Scripts too (I don't display them yet, but you can see them in address/unspent API).
Database has been hand-optimized for the query I do (some might be stored in duplicate forms but optimized for different queries, such as address operations &amp; UTXO). 
Also it's all binary-optimized format, and entries ordering has been designed to take advantage of LevelDB ordering/iterating.
I use only low level get-value store (LevelDB), no high-level DB (too slow).
30GB of blockchain data takes 38GB in database, which seems quite good considering some of the duplicate info and ability to query any address.

No, it's either a seed, or a master public key (watch-only mode).
You can get your master public key after entering your wallet seed.

Yes, that's why I provide the static code on github, so that you don't have to trust me.
Hosted is for convenience. Also https makes man in the middle impossible.

Yes, it is supported.

I'll try to clear up the licensing asap (by tomorrow likely).
Thanks! It was a lot of work, but had lot of fun &amp; learnt a lot along the way, so definitely worth it! (and less failure point)
