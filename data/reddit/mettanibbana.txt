Guess I'll be heading to my local SatoshiPoint. Thank you, Sir. :)

Thank you. I could use some much needed trading practice.

I'd sooner decipher theoretical physics. ;)

100k seems a little hyperbole. But what the fuck do I know!? Would now be a good time to invest given the value of Bitcoin?

Seeing as the price of Bitcoin is expensive I wouldn't want to buy now. I'm a little trepidation in investing seeing as the the price goes up and down like a yo=yo. It's so unpredictable. 
It you know what you're doing that can be an advantage, but for the average trader it is a huge ricks.

Is that a realistic outcome? I know B topped at around 20k and then plummeted. You're getting me excited, Taishan666! haha
So I invest in 1 Bitcoin &amp; in a few years it could potentially worth 100k?
He who dares wins, right?

Agreed. However, the problem with HOLDing is that a Bitcoin cound be worth 20k, a couple of weeks later it's down to 4k.
I want to invent but I don't think Bitcoin is for me. I don't have the knowledge.

Good lord, that's an astronomical sum of money. Talk about a return on your investment. So Far I've put hundreds when I feel the price has dropped significantly. Obviously you can't make that profit now, but I like your strategy.
How has your investing gone? (If you don't mind me asking?)
