Hey Pine, dunno if anyone has suggested donating to this project.  Vasalgel is basically a reversible vasectomy.  Vasalgel is a polymer that they inject into the vas deferens to prevent sperm from exiting the body.
It's not getting funded since it won't make drug companies much if any money.  Male birth control options are much needed.

They don't deserve it, that's why they piss all that money away and stimulate the economy.  We should thank them for their altruistic sacrifice.

Hey man, bitcoin stopped me from buying drugs.  I spent 500 on research chemicals when it was  1500.  Then the price doubled.  No more man, bitcoin is my drug now, so high.
