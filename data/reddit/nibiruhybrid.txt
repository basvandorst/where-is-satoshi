[OK, I was wondering where you was going with that.]( If you do think of any other good candidates for bitcoin let me know.

Call it intuition but something tells me if I started another petition for a different company to accept Bitcoin you still wouldn't sign it.

Some people have been asking me why did you hire models for a promo video for your petition?
The story behind the video was born out of frustration and necessity. The petition was created on the 13th April 2014. I was having difficulties promoting and getting signatures even after creating the usual social media profiles to highlight petition. This is the first time I have ever done anything like this, so it has been one big learning curve. After a few dismal weeks, I finally decided a YouTube video would be perfect to increase awareness about my petition. I used a service from Fiverr which enables you to pay for services with Bitcoin.
I used Fiverr purely because it was practical to my needs. I do not have the setup or professional video/camera equipment in my possession. The service the girls offered is top rated and the results they had produced for other Fiverr customers ticked all my boxes. All I had to do was provide a script.
The video has been successful in increasing the petitions presence on YouTube. However there has been a degree of controversy and hostility towards the video. People are questioning the videos origins believing it was a publicity stunt and an official video from Spreadshirt. I believe this is due to the high quality production and delivery of script in the video.
The video has also attracted the attention of people that dislike Bitcoin. In my personal experience the people that typically protest Bitcoin are the ones that do not fully understand what Bitcoin represents, but that is just my opinion. Unfortunately this has been slightly counter-productive to my campaign resulting in some video down votes and negative comments towards Bitcoin.
Also a number of viewers are focusing on the twins rather than the actual message of the video which is a great shame.
I did not anticipate these reactions in fact my major concern when posting video was how Spreadshirt would react.
If the video is not to your taste, it is no fault of the girls. I should have given better directions with the script, so that is a failure on my part only. I had no idea it would come under so much scrutiny. I really just wanted to focus on Spreadshirt adding a Bitcoin payment option and the petition with a video to highlight it seemed the best option to me at the time.

Very true, great comment.

I have informed the press team of Spreadshirt that I’m behind the petition and requested an official statement. No response yet unfortunately. I can only assume it is going up the chain of command or perhaps they are delaying a response until the petition numbers are higher. I will update the petition thread when they reply. If you have signed the petition and want to add to the pressure. Please feel free to contact Spreadshirt and gratiously express your interest in them adding Bitcoin as a payment option. You can do this here:

Hey, ViscountLobulon. Thank you for the feedback and your honesty. I agree with the points you raise.
This is the first time I have started a petition. When you create a petition on ipetitions website they give you guide-lines on creating social media etc and a road-map on how to raise awareness about your petition. I just followed their recommendations. As for the video I made a very detailed post with the process and thought behind its creation highlighting the pros and cons of my experience. I did this for disclosure but most importantly to show that I am an individual acting alone.
My very first post in this thread included a disclosure at the bottom of the page detailing the questions you raise. Sadly it currently has too many down-votes so you probably did not get the chance to read it. I have tried to be as transparent as I can.
*Disclosure - I do not represent Spreadshirt. I am a solo activist trying to make a change. I am a user of Spreadshirts platform and believe implementing Bitcoin would benefit both Spreadshirt and the consumer. Instead of highlighting the problem, i'm trying to be the solution. Following the recent statement from the CEO I decided to make a stand and take action. I am passionate about Bitcoin and the fundamentals it represents. I believe consumers should have the choice and flexibility on how they choose to pay for goods. I hope the petition will resonate with the Bitcoin community and inspire others to take action and be the change they want to see.*
So for absolute clarity the reason I selected Spreadshirt and so passionate about getting them to adapt is because I use their service. I want them to add bitcoin. I feel Spreadshirt and its customers can only benefit from Bitcoin: it is a win-win situation. Spreadshirt is a worldwide creative platform for custom t-shirts, custom hoodies and other personalized apparel. I purchase designs from Spreadshirt and i'm also 1 of the 72,000+ sellers using their service to sell custom apparel and accessories. It is no different from rivals Cafepress, Zazzle, Redbubble, Design By Humans, Threadless. I really believe if we can get Spreadshirt to add bitcoin payment functionality its rivals will have no option but to follow their lead. This is why this petition is important to me, even if you don't like or use Spreadshirt as a service. If you want bitcoin to to succeed, in my opinion you should sign the petition as the consequences of Spreadshirt granting this request will no doubt have a knock on effect in the internet retailing arena.

IIoWoII Go back to r/buttcoin and take your Samefagging downvote buttfuck friends with you.
Nobody from r/bitcoin cares enough to troll r/buttcoin. **Of course you don't want this to go viral because you hate bitcoin.**
Why do you not want a business to add Bitcoin as a payment option? **Because you hate bitcoin**
Any potential merchant adding Bitcoin is surely a win for the community. So why are you so against it? **Because you hate bitcoin.**
I know my first post was a lot to read, but I have already clearly stated that I do not represent Spreadshirt. 
So if that is the only reason you dislike the petition. I hope you will change your mind. **But you won't because you hate bitcoin**
**[and finally..](

I don't see this as a wasted effort. I have put time, energy and a very small amount of money for video in to this petition. It has taken a lot of thought and planning setting up social profiles etc. I set my objective and I intend to see it through to the end. 
However I would like to win you over. So if I create a new petition for bitcoin will you sign both of them?

Users of Bitcoin Reddit I need your help!
Help me get Spreadshirt to accept Bitcoin.
Petition Video: 
Petiton Website: 
Facebook Fan Page: 
Twitter: 
Please spare 10 seconds of your time and support the online petition.
I would be extremely grateful if you could share the petition on your social media to help me increase awareness to the Bitcoin community.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Getting Spreadshirt to add a Bitcoin payment option would be a big win for the Bitcoin community and put pressure on other online retailers to adapt to the requests of the consumer.
If you are unfamiliar with Spreadshirt they are an international online retailer operating in 17 countries with over 72,000 sellers. In 2013 Spreadshirt had sales of over $95M globally with orders from 200 countries. Spreadshirt is the partner of choice for many YouTube channels, music artists, celebrities, sport teams, social networks and a number of design brands. (sorry if that sounds too official, this infomation is publically available online)
The Bitcoin community recently got an open invitation from the Spreadshirt CEO Philip Rooke that if enough customers request Bitcoin that they will grant the request.
"I receive hundreds of requests a month from consumers and our ecommerce platform sellers wanting Amazon checkout and payment. We have yet to have one for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is not mass market then it will be of little use to ecommerce retailers and platforms. The internet is a funny place however, where new ideas do catch on. My job therefore is to try and cover as many of our customers' needs as possible, so if enough people want to use either Bitcoin we will adapt and find ways of taking payments!" Philip Rooke InternetRetailing.net March 2014
If we are successful in completing the petition not only will it attract media attention and increase sentiment for Bitcoin. I'm sure their rivals Cafepress, Zazzle, Redbubble, Design By Humans, Threadless will all stand up and take note.
With the recent announcement from Amazon, that they will not be adding Bitcoin payment functionality. I hope I can rely on the Bitcoin communities support to help encourage more retailers to join the Bitcoin revolution to increase exposure and add to the Bitcoin eco-system.
I would be most grateful for your support.
As Satoshi Nakamoto would say "strength in numbers"  :-)
For those that like their privacy, fear not. A lot of online petition websites ask for personal details such as home address etc. which is big NO for me. I specifically used ipetition as it only requires a name and an email address. You have the option to NOT display your name publicly in list if privacy is a concern of yours. Also ipetition will NOT use your email for 3rd parties, only petition updates if you select option.
Thank you for your time.
If you have any questions or ideas to help the cause please let me know.

I can't understand why people in the bitcoin community are down voting this.
I think enabling people to earn bitcoins for creating and selling designs on their platform is just as important as them accepting it a as a payment option.
Getting paid in bitcoin and using bitcoin as a medium of exchange to purchase goods is fundamental to the survial and core of the bitcoin eco-system. If we want bitcoin to prosper we need to encourage change and be vocal in promoting businesses to pay staff in bitcoin not just accept it as payment. If bitcoin is to succeed and stand on its own we need to sever all ties and remove dependance from fiat money. If this petition is successful I hope it will inspire people to create new services that will help everyday people to earn bitcoin directly. Not only will Spreadshirt rivals Cafepress, Zazzle, Redbubble, Design By Humans, Threadless have no option to follow their lead and accept bitcoin but people using their services will demand payment in bitcoin as well. Other online services and future new comers in the internet retailing arena will have no choice but to accept and adapt to bitcoins growing influence and dominance.
We need to increase bitcoin user adoption. 
Now I just want you to think for a second. Spreadshirts service alone has 72,000+ sellers. This will introduce a lot more people to the world of bitcoin. Now add Cafepress, Zazzle, Redbubble, Design By Humans, Threadless in to the mix and you can see the huge potential here. This is why I need you to get behind this petition. Regardless if you will use Spreadshirt services or not, it is a massive win for the Bitcoin community. So please vote this up so we can increase awareness about the petition.

For those of you on [Twitter](

Why all the down votes people? Do you not want businesses to accept Bitcoin?..
I don't understand why people are down voting a petition that benefits Bitcoin?  
At the time of writing this the vote count is negative in the red. 
The Bitcoin eco-system will not grow if we choose to isolate businesses. We need to do the very opposite and encourage companies to implement Bitcoin. We need to promote the benefits and fundamentals of Bitcoin if we are to excel and accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin. 
What message does this give to people exploring Bitcoin for the first time on these threads. This is meant to be a a pro-bitcoin area showing how united we are as a community. The Bitcoin Reddit hub is the largest Bitcoin community online. Businesses and investors will be looking at Reddit to assess market sentiment.
The Reddit Bitcoin community used to be a friendly and welcoming environment. Eager to help and inform the uninitiated. I have noticed a change over the last year with growing hostility and negativity. I can only assume this is due to the price down turn in recent months. I could be wrong but maybe some of the newcomers were purely trying to just piggy back on the Bitcoin trend with a get rich quick outlook and got burned in the process. As a result now have a chip on their shoulder. Or am I wrong could it be reddit users from other alt-coins trying to down-vote Bitcoin in the hope their crypto coin of choice will gain in value.
What do you guys think? Any of you veteran Bitcoin Redditors out there feel the same way?
Bitcoin was designed to be used as a medium of exchange. Not to be just hoarded as investment. 
Why do I say all this. Well, sadly 2 years ago this would have worked really well on Reddit Bitcoin community. Right now nobody really cares, the only thing a lot of newbie bitcoiners care about is getting rich in USD as fast as they can. Regrettably...
Let me know what you think?....

I really want to believe Apple did this because they see the merit in bitcoin. **However it is probably only because they are losing market share to Android**. You cut me deep Apple, I switched to Android. I'm not going to switch back just because you want to piggy back on Bitcoins success.

I'm not familiar with funny or die, I had a look at the website but i'm not sure how it will benefit the bitcoin community? I read an interesting [article]( on how the website makes revenue through advertisements. *The small team of writers, directors, producers, and editors churns out upwards of 20 to 25 videos a month.* It appears you can not buy anything, and it seems like people can't make money either. It might interest stock investors but I'm failing to connect the dots as to why this would be good to petition for bitcoin or am I missing something?...
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:39:16
Great points, I totally agree. If Bitcoin is to progress we really need to start taking steps to remove dependency from paper money. I wish I consulted you first before I typed all that out. [Now I know why Logical is in your username](

That is not true. Promotion is key to any petition otherwise how will people know about it. You can not be upset with me for posting my petition for bitcoin in the r/bitcoin section. 
If you do not like the idea that is fine, but you can not deny that the petition will benefit bitcoin.
Even If you have no interest in using Spreadshirts service. Even if they accepted bitcoin. If you believe in what bitcoin represents you should still sign the petition regardless as it is good for the bitcoin eco-system and a win for the community. 
Its not just about customers being able to pay for goods with bitcoin, its about the 72,000+ worldwide sellers that will be able to accept bitcoin as well. You can not argue that would not be good for the bitcoin community.
How many other bitcoin petitions enable people to pay for goods and provide a platform for them to earn bitcoin too.
If this petition is successful and goes well and an opportunity arises for a new target that I think is achievable. Sure, I will create a petition. But right now, I'm working solo so my time is limited. I want to focus and make a success of this one first before I take the plunge again.
I see this petition as much bigger than just Spreadshirt as it will bring so many new adopters to Bitcoin. I'm sure rivals will follow Spreadshirts lead to remain competitive. Now add all the sellers from Cafepress, Zazzle, Redbubble, Design By Humans, Threadless etc. in to the mix accepting and earning bitcoin. That would be a ridiculously high amount of new bitcoin adopters. 
I really believe this petition has huge potential which is why I have put the time and energy in to it. 
As long as people continue to use Fiat money and need a bank account, bitcoin will continue to be slated by monopoly paper pushing fanatics. This is a step in the right direction. Bitcoin was not designed to be hoarded, it was meant to be a medium of exchange which means being paid in bitcoin and not just spending it. I hope eventually down the line more employers will pay staff with bitcoin. But we need to build bridges first. We need to increase bitcoin adoption, increase influence and give people more opportunities to be paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-11 11:04:52
I am not being paid by spreadshirt to promote this. I am a solo activist trying to make a change. Please don't sabotage my efforts I’m trying to do something positive and make a difference. 
I keep persevering, because I want to make a change. Not just for selfish reasons, but because I see getting a multi-national company like Spreadshirt to adopt Bitcoin as a huge win for the Bitcoin community. 
As an advocate of Bitcoin and a user of their platform, I have tried my best in the past to encourage Spreadshirt to implement Bitcoin. When I learned of the CEO's statements I saw my window of opportunity and took action. 
If I fail, that’s fine. But I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
I feel your main objective is to disrupt my cause and start mischief. I'm open to constructive criticism as long as it promotes truth not ego. I will not be provoked in to a mudslinging match. This is r/Bitcoin and was created to cover bitcoin news, a place for discussion and to promote all things bitcoin.
If this petition does not appeal to you, that’s ok. But why waste the energy on commenting. Please refrain from putting off others otherwise people can only speculate that you are anti-bitcoin and making negative statements because you have an agenda. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:46:11
What you need to appreciate is getting Spreadshirt to accept Bitcoin is a little bit different from just getting an online retailer to sell goods for bitcoin. It will also enable Spreadshirt to pay the 72,000+ worldwide artists that create and use their platform to sell designs in bitcoin which will increase bitcoin user adoption. This allows anyone to earn bitcoin by selling designs using their service, which is a big thumbs up in my book. The bitcoin eco-system will not grow &amp; thrive if we remain dependent on paper money to purchase bitcoins. Getting paid in Bitcoin is just as instrumental as using it for purchases.

This issue is the elephant in the room. I can't believe the level of disrespect some in the Bitcoin community have given to Roger Ver. Roger was the first angel investor in many Bitcoin business startups people depend on today. So people hating on Roger for just being a big bag holder need to check Bitcoins history, he has done so much good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:28:53
I don't think Roger is intentionally being difficult. I believe he thinks what he is doing is right and sticking as close to Satoshis vision as possible. He is essentially a Bitcoin purest.
