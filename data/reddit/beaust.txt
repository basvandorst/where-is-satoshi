Kranio23 ... The GoCoin business hours are not 24x7. Our business hours are M-F 9am - 5pm (Pacific Time GMT-7). We did receive your 3am support ticket and are working through the details this morning. It looks as if you have not received a payout because we have not receive the necessary KYC / AML / CTF documentation from your company in order to process the release of the coins.  You should already have an email in your inbox with instructions of what is required.
@_date: 2016-04-04 16:51:02
No need to worry, we simply need your documentation in order to validate your new account.

GoCoin and Ziftr together will be moving far beyond just payment processing.  Litecoin and Dogecoin processing has not proven to be very interesting, but using a cryptocurrency as a loyalty platform...with an integrated wallet...this will get interesting!

With the current state of user adoption, they are all shitcoins at this point! In order to truly be disruptive to the status quo...there needs to be innovations that give consumers a reason to use coins! ziftrCOIN is not intended to be a Bitcoin substitute, it a loyalty / coupon tool for merchants.

Paycoin we never integrated as an option on the GoCoin platform.  It was briefly considered before the wheels came off.

Convenience fee is for not having to drive to the theater to make sure you get tix to the movie you want.  Uber would charge you more than $1 to do that!

I can confirm they are legit.  They are based in LA and working with GoCoin for payment processing!

Why would a merchant not accept all alt-coins made available to them when GoCoin or similar will convert it to fiat for them?  Sales and sales...and just because someone has a different religion doesn't make yours wrong...

For the record...I was staying with Autumn Radtke in Singapore when she decided to take the ultimate exit.  We talked for hours and hours in the days before and I can assure you Bitcoin had no relevance in her decision.  Some speculated she had BTC in Mt. Gox but in my discussion with the police over the course of their investigation, they disproved that theory.  They have made no link between Bitcoin and her choice to leave this world and neither should anyone....it must have been a very personal choice...and how I wish I had one more chance to say the right words....things will ALWAYS get better!

Just so you are clear...PayPal is not yet accepting Bitcoin or Altcoins...it's all still going through partners like GoCoin, Coinbase etc...so the scenario where someone pays from their PayPal balance in Bitcoin is not yet a reality....all in good time!

This is for direct sales from Lionsgate to consumer paying in BTC, LTC, XDG and Tether.

Hard to believe the US got out ahead of the UK and other European regulated gaming jurisdiction with the first legal iGaming site to accept Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals 
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:40:44
Understand your point of view, but caution anyone going to unregulated sites 2 potential problems (1) It's illegal in the US and most major jurisdiction and (2) there is no player protection of you funds.  So, when you win, you may never see your coins!

GoCoin likewise experienced a brief problem of a similar nature.  Our engineers quickly remedied the issue and only a very small number of transaction were affected and those merchants have been notified.  We are looking into the root cause and believe it is important to the eco-system to be completely transparent about such events especially when Bitcoin companies are frequent targets for hackers.  Merchants and consumers can take comfort in the fact that the newer systems are increasingly secure.

GoCoin CEO here...I've seen so much of the this anti-anything-behavior that I barely give subreddit the time of day anymore.  Interestingly the subreddit does not have this problem... the crowd there is enthusiastic about anything that is good for the doge ... Keep up the good work Brian and Co...hopefully those sponsoring the negative sentiment will realize it really doesn't have the desired effect.  Adoption is happening and will continue...all they really are devaluing is ... Reddit.  It does however give life to  !

This promotion was massively damaging to the Bitcoin payments eco-system and to my investors. GoCoin held it's ground at 1% having quickly seen that 0% forced us to take a loss on every transaction and was unsustainable...but it cost us a lot of deals...that said, we are very close to profitability!

Has anyone tried this top-up service?

The other aspect you need to consider in this conversation is the published exchange rate on any of the exchanges does not reflect the depth of the order book.  So when pricing $10 vs. $10,000 one should not expect to get the published exchange rate unless the order book is truly that deep

Lionsgate is thinking about this in a very smart way...this is only the beginning!
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:19:35
AS IF!
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:57:43
Disagree...they are being very thoughtful in their approach.  If you believe in the future of Bitcoin as a payment method, you take a more positive outlook and support the giants of industry that share the vision!

GoCoin is working on a recurring payment service for digital currencies.  Will be in private pilot for this service soon.  We would love some feedback on community interest in such a service?  The concept would be slightly different than other wallets.

How many shades for grey? Give yourself a tip for your insightful insult...just the tip!

Do you really thing BitPay is "free"?  GoCoin gives the option to the merchant if they want to absorb the 1% fee or pass it to the consumer.  It's a very honest approach....and just because you don't like altcoins doesn't stop other from generating revenue with them.
