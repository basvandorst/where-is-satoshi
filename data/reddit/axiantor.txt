You should try Finex.
About ASIC Boost you might be wrong. Check here:

OMG, what gives bitcoin value is the ability to serve users. Nice job done there :/

Why is confusing that the longest chain is the forked chain?
Why is important to know which coin is Bitcoin?  Markets will say which coin is not people (Hairy or not).
Why would you support a coin that has a clogged mempool? Markets won't that's for sure.

Yeah what a puppet show.

Isn't segwit2x a block size increase signed by a majority of the community?
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:34:36
Could you use the same criteria for segwit1x, please?

You should open an account at bitfinex. That's where the big dumpening will happen. 
They are also core supporters.

I think its ridiculous to think SN was just one person. You guys still imagine bitcoin was made on somebody's basement?
You just presented accusations. If you presented any evidence people would consider the content of your post. People just ignore it.
What's your goal btw with this post? I see you confirmed the hard work being made on CSW's new patents. What else?

Not true.
The fact that you have a third entity makes it more unsecure and with bigger fees. "In physics there are no free lunches". More entities less to share and bigger the risk.

Everyone is following the same behavior. Go figured that out...
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:24:34
You wish!

One goal of bitcoin is to be a peer to peer. A third party makes it not peer to peer. In any type of chain when you add a new entity the complexity increases which also means reducing the security.
And i meant physics as opposition to metaphysics.
Reducing of total storage cost its not a goal neither a problem.
Energy being spent from bitcoin contributers should be focused on scalling and not solve not existant problems as storage. Neither compromised network safety and remove data increasing weight aka anti-scaling.

Users should never validate Txs. They just want to spend money or sell goods.
Marginal cost of storage is irrelevant. I run a full node with a HW that I bought 8 years ago for media usage and can carry the chain on the next 5 years at least.

There's no attack on bitcoin. 2mb block chain will become the chain with more total work. It will become bitcoin.
Its just an upgrade. Chill out.

I always got the idea that he said he was part of the team when the interviewer asked him. 
Q: "You can say I am Satoshi Nakamoto?"
A: " I was the main part of it. Other people helped me"
I thought satoshi wasn't a single person although the emails were written by one person. He was probably the lead scientist.
I would say that its a more interesting ad hominem attack to people destroying bitcoin with bad code (segwit) and going against SN principle ideas for bitcoin than on people working for the best of bitcoin's future in line with SN principle ideas for bitcoin.

On chain payments are better than payments channels/L2. Because they are safer and cheaper.

Never had a problem. First time I heard this. Best miners whatever the algo.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:56:53
Yes that's the definition of bitcoin itself.
