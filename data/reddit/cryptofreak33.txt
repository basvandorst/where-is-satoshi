Something _very_ close to that. Except I want to keep the transaction completely in Btc. Kind of like your debit card from your bank works now except drawing on a Bitcoin wallet somewhere. If this doesn't exist, maybe it could be part of the BitVendor system them. Wouldn't be exceedingly difficult to create.

The project is far enough along where I'm still on track for a October 20th release. I'd love to talk about developing a site. Can you email me at cryptofreak

I _really_ want to go with an open source license with revenue coming from the traditional support model. I also want to connect with a few other services that I might be able to generate some revenue by streaming some money their way as well.
I'm also looking at the model Bryan Lunduke tried a bit back where he gave away the source and charged for binaries. That seems to be a viable alternative (maybe). Like I said, right now, I just want to get something out to the community that they can use and makes things a little better. I'm nearly completely open on the license.

Good question and I'm not sure why I didn't think of doing it instant. I could have the merchant set the item price in their local currency then grab the current price of Btc at the end of the transaction and convert.

Thanks for the question. I'm still kind of up in the air about making this open source or not. On one hand, I understand that, for trust, this _has_ to be open source. Who'd use a Bitcoin program that was closed source? On the other hand, I need to make money (I'm an indie software developer) and relying on pure donations makes me worry about things like eating and paying bills.
What do you think about 'auditable' source code? For example, the program isn't 'open source' but the code is available for examination by anyone? I'm completely open to suggestions here so don't think I'm just trying to keep the code private. I really want feedback.

Many thanks, friend.

**UPDATE** Upon all of your suggestions, I just picked up  and  Hopefully, that will help BV seem a bit more respectable. Will be redirecting the .tk domain to the new site in a bit. Thanks for the feedback guys!

Well, I'm wanting to scan the kinds of bar codes that are on normal products. Though I'd be open to a simpler version since it's not like this is going to be used in major retail outlets. I'll check out CueCats. I thought they weren't selling those anymore. Thanks!

Can you elaborate a bit as to why a .onion mirror would be helpful? I'm open to it, I just don't see the value in it.

Holy shit no. The idea is _not_ to be some insanely complex solution like Quickbooks or other POS stuff. I'm trying to make it simple to set up, simple to run, and easy to understand.

Good question. I thought about doing that. But that would require near constant updates to the program as state tax rates changed. Either that or have a centralized database of tax rates that is updated regularly. Still, too much work.

Thanks for the suggestion. Definitely going to pick up another tld later tonight. Grabbed a .tk while I considered my other options just to get the site up. I was hoping for bitvendor.com but that's taken so I'll probably go with a .us. Should be registered by tomorrow.

Thanks for the feedback guys! Point about busyness taken and working to streamline it quite a bit. Eliminating redundancy and designing a wizard for first time users. Thank you all very much!
