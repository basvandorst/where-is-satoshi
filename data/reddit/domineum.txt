That doesn't mean the will now how much bitcoins I have. I could have sold them, keep them, used for whatever, at different prices etc. They might know how many bitcoins they gave you but that doesn't mean anything.

You can use different/unique wallets to receive payments so no one can know how many bitcoins you have. I have been receiving my payment in bitcoins since 2014 and never had that problem.

Hi! Is great that you are doing this for your grand kids! In my opinion, the best thing you can do, if you trust in bitcoins and looking the investment as long term, is just buy small amounts every now and then and don't get stressed by the every day price. If you are looking for a 10-15 years term, you should expect bitcoin being several thousands dollars more than what is now.

the difference is that, as is not regulated, he can openly share his "insider knowledge" with everybody. In a "regulated" scenario, he would have just kept his info for him and maybe some good trusted friends and take a loooot of proffit from it... like all major wallstreet funds have been doing for the last... 20 years?

I have been paid 100% in bitcoins since 2014 and I can tell you, is the best thing ever :)

Transfer them over to another wallet after you get them sent then.

The BTM network is actually pretty big, almost 1500 units. And is growing fast!

We have already lived this before. They will just ban it, study it, see the advantages, get back on the table.

Crazy right? They probably have to really think it out and go thru certain procedures because Bitcoin is HUGE in Choyna.
