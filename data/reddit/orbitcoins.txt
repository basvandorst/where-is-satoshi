There are probably way more anonymous Pros in this than you think.

They don´t. For small transactions they only have to wait 3 seconds. If there is a large transaction 40 minutes is nothing. And they can see the money is on its way after 3 seconds.

Depends on how rich you are and were you are in life. 
Maybe you should probably diversify not at once but sell around 20% and invest it into things you know you will need longterm. If you can why not try to buy it with bitcoins. Maybe get some Mastercoins and Peercoins. But not too many.
Invest some in things that will probably keep its value. 
Google stocks?
And don´t be too greedy, don´t forget do some charity, for those not as lucky maybe for cancer cure, something you yourself and people all over the earth might benefit from one day.
Also spend some on marketing to help secure the value of the coins you have left.

1. This has allready been done for the last two-three years and is still going on with little success.
2. Not every bank will, in the long run it will not matter.
There are 6.5 billion unbanked people who will care little of what banks say they should care about.

Yes I also like the. Its like paper money, that can be teleported anywhere in the world for free. Like Skype teleports words. Thats why the money is valuable.

Just let them know, in the future the thing that will matter is how many Bitcoins they own. There is only 21 million coins vs billions of more fiat money being printed all over the world every single day.

Not for the 96% who are not scientists. What makes sense is making it as easy as possible for avarage joe and his grandma, to understand it.

Do they speak every language in this world? 
They will have to convince every single person all over the world that their Bitcoins have no value to them. 
That money that can not be forfeited and you can send for free over the world have no value for them, their future, their family, friends and children.
Even "experts" can not tell people there is zero value in freedom, 
the idea of freedom will always have value no matter what experts in a single country says.

The answer in the long run is that Bitcoins in themselves are real money and should be looked upon as that, and that you should not wish to trade it for fiat you should be proud to own some.

There is value in it. For gambling and wealth storage and money transfers.

Its makes Bitcoin more valuable because you can move your bitcoins out fast, but not your fiat. Decreasing the value of fiat.
