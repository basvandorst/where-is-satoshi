The reason we need the internal system of money is also very simple. We are trying to create a stable marketplace. Look at nations. What do they do to protect the local market? They restrict both goods and money flow across the border. We are creating the border. And borders are good. :)

We need internal currency. We basically don't care how it works but we can't afford to run it in a centralized way. We're not an e-money operator to spend fortunes on protection. 
"Bitcoin-based assets" is the cheapest method on Earth. Among viable ones. Out of Onmi, Colu, and Counetrparty we chose Colu because it is the simplest. And because a solid legal entity stands behind the devs there.
That's it. No other reasons. No other statements. No other arguments. No attempts to ride on blockchain hype. Please read the site and the pdfs for details, it is all there.

Of course, the internal currency will fluctuate—but for its internal reasons. Imagine you buy ivory on some distant shores, bring it to NY city, make figurines, and sell. Your final price will depend on the fluctuations of the local currency against the dollar. That is totally ok, right? Sometimes it makes your business better, sometimes worse, but what can you do—that is the alien economy you've decided to deal with. So you have to accept its ways. You may even try to affect the rate of exchange if you are a big enough trader. 
Now imagine someone stops your ships in the middle of the ocean and demands that you have to change your dollars to Chinese yuans on the way there. China might be a great economy, an interesting place but that just is none of your business. That's exactly what describes the situation if we use bitcoins. It's a small (tiny) economy that has nothing to do with our business. We might as well use Philippines currency whatever they have there. What's the point?
