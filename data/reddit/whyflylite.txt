I had about 40.000 DASH back in the days. It was called Darkcoin back then. I didnt kill myself, not did I had any regret of selling around 2$. I do not regret selling because it was my choice to sell. Guys NEVER regret the choices you make! Sorry for your loss :-(

in before AML / KYC policies

Okay. And the private key is the .wallet file(+password) right?
im getting it i think. thanks

Guess i am the only one interested in true and free decentralization :0
Fyi zero knowledge proofs in crypto is something people wanted for a very long time but nobody achieved yet. This is groundbreaking
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:47:57
Okay. And If I send bitcoin to this wallet adress that has never been connected to the network. Will it still get confirmed?

The difference between zero knowledge compared to current anonymous systems like Darksend and Stealth adresses is that in these systems there is a transaction shown where coins are mixed, or washed. 
With Zero-knowledge however there isnt even a transaction taking place for the observer. So there is zero knowledge about something happening.
You could say that stealth adresses are like the stealth aurora airplanes flying from A to B, and with shadowcash there is not even a plane in the sky in the first place. Yet achieving the same goal.
Ofcourse you could say that anon is only for criminals and paranoid people but this is not true. It is about freedom. I know for one thing that now ZK is working, focus can be put on things like zero-knowledge voip, cams, chat and file sharing.
This is how a ZK transaction would look like:

Thanks. So once you save these settings the "plan" is activated right?

Shadowcash is around here for 6 months. They have been working on this zk technique and paper for the last 4 months with several open test phases people could join.  They have had a proof of work phase in the early days and now use proof of stake. Also they managed to set up the first proof of stake lite wallet and soon to follow another new technology that will increase synch times by x50. This is not an avarage get rich quick scheme. I dont hold so many myself as im a student but that doesnt mean this technology deserves a place to he shown.

.. there are hundres of transactions in my wallet. They all jumped back to retrieving. I have no idea what to do.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:17:42
thanks for all help lol
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:25:25
as much as i want it to work, its not gonna happen eventually bcus of money transfer license requirements by users.

Why so negative? First of all in Holland we don't pay 'loonbelasting / payroll tax' over profits when trading. We pay income tax over the total value fortune one holds. Which starts above 20k\-ish and is only a few (1\-3&amp; depending on the total amount. A very low amount compared to other countries.   
Furthermore all my friends know what Bitcoin is and have some form of idea about the technologie. Many people on the street aswell. Sure not everyone knows what lightning network is but who cares. I don't know how my current bank processes payments either, and I don't care as long as it works. Same should be applied to Bitcoin. Average Joe should not be interested in LN and Blockchain technology. The more we keep using those terms, the less attractive for new users it will be in the long run.

both monero and dark are pretty cheap compared to shadowcash (which comes the most close to Zerocash)
@_date: 2015-10-31 19:40:30
It's not what I claim. It's what I keep reading.
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:39:32
Dont overstate zerocash:) its not even working. Bitcoin is not ZK. Far from it even. And never will be. Bitcoin is basiclly the stealth aurora airplane still making too much noise, whilst SDC there is never an airplane in the first place and works with teleports. I dont think you have even educated yourself into shadow if you compare monero with shadow. Go read the white paper. Nizkps are here and working. And already working on snarks as we speak. If bitcoin was ZK there would be no need for zerocash. Educate yourself into cryptographicy. Because it seems your not too much aware of it. I am a cryptographer for 28 years now working with big companies, and I can list a whole lot issues I see with Zerocash. Feel free to PM for recensions if you feel like it. I am not here to tell bad or troll about zerocash because i can only hope for it too work icw snarks. It would be a whole new level. But comparing monero with zerocash and comparing it with shadowcash even is something hard too understand. Shadowcash is a zero knowledge, working solution and surely the best out there to day
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:43:04
Actually it is even better using nizkps , ring sigs and duals, AND it even works with spv wallets/light wallet. It destroys inputs and mints newly created outputs. And its trustless. Another positive thing is that Shadow doesnt require equal inputs and outputs, making it more efficient and flexible. Not saying zerocash is anything bad I actually love it, but a ZK solution is already working with shadowcash. Im not too sure why we would keep focussing on ZErocash.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:18:04
Zerocash is like Shadowcash. Only shadowcash works. Its already out there😌

I have serveral usb backups and an online dropbox backup encrypted. So that is safe i guess.
Its weird indeed. Just when I import my private key (self made) and enter its password and press unlock, it starts to sync but also gives the messages: a new private key has been made with the password of your wallet file blabla. So I now have around 6 keys in the backup map(as i opened my wallet 6 times) + my own made/exported private key.

im on ma millibits , snoopdog decentralizin dat shit

Not sure if serious

Alright thanks alot, this clears up the part about the wallet file. 
Now how about the key file? I have "exported" a keyfile to USB, so only when I put in my USB i can open my wallet. Allthough when I import the private key or unlock my wallet the Multibit client tells me that there has been a new private key made (different key). This happens everytime when I unlock my wallet. 
 
Which key should I use in the future to open my wallet? The latest automaticly created private key or the one I exported myself?
