The only "lose" situation is that your father had to die for you to inherit his BTC. You now have money so you won't be homeless for the foreseeable future. It sounds like you're a bit greedy when you should be grateful.
That aside, I would cash out enough to get you through the year (according to you it should be $24K). With the remaining BTC I would either hold it, buy mining supplies/cloud mine another coin, or build an alt portfolio.
Seriously though, hearing someone who is admittedly broke and about to be homeless saying a gift of $40K BTC is a lose-lose situation is absurd.

Red candlesticks are people selling. The more people sell the more supply there is, so price goes down.  Green candlesticks show buys, so the more people buy the less supply there is and prices go up. The order book shows orders people have set on both the buy and sell sides and you can watch in real time which direction the price is going.

You're assuming people are going to buy into it. It's up for the intimidation factor.

Sometime in 2010 - saw it on 4Chan.
God damn if I would've invested $500 into it back then instead of spending it on beer...

Gdax is Coinbase. When you deposit from Gdax it gives you multiple choices, CB being one of them.

Unpopular opinion here, some of us aren't concerned with Bitcoin becoming a currency or not. I'd rather it be a store of value. I don't understand why you think discussion of the price makes Bitcoin a pump and dump.

Ok that's fine with me. BTC is pretty centralized anyway so I agree, BTC will never topple governments.


Ok, like I said I'm cool with BTC not being a currency.


I never said BTC shouldn't be improved upon.


That's total speculation, the same as if I were to say "BTC will never rise to the levels you want if it isn't a store of value".


Yet BTC has mooned, many times. It's up 900% this year. Please show me another investment that has yielded a return anywhere near as close. And guess what? BTC only shows more signs of going up.
I'm all for *a* cryptocurrency becoming mainstream currency, just not necessarily BTC.

How many alts are commercially backed? Very, very, very few.

If you keep your coins on an exchange then they are not your coins. Simple.

Dude would be an idiot to dump all of those coins at once.
Price would crash a bit but most likely surge back. It could even trigger an extended rally and hit an ATH.

CPU mining bitcoin hasn't been feasible for at least 5 years...
