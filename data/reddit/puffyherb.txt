It's legit data, **but it's not proof of anything**.
This is Mt. Gox's **internal accounting**. If there are problems with this, then it lines up with what they've been syaing all along (ie they didn't know BTC was being siphoned off).

From their press release:


Ok so "confirmed" could be a little ambiguous. Possibly discovered 4th March, then confirmed 7th March?
I'm still not really convinced.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:03:09
I'm not a lawyer, but... wouldn't the whole fuckin document be confidential information in the first place?
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:04:32
If the leaked document is correct then they only had 22.5 million fiat debt. So that means they are only missing about 70,000 bitcoins at a price of $550 each?
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:27:17
Well, technically he added stuff to it. He added the black rectangles over the operating expenses, which were later removed.

I don't know any wall street traders that use web UIs...
It's good news and good for Bitcoin, but by no means a major step towards anything. MT4 on BTC-e can do most of what this does (except support multiple exchanges).
I also don't see how this leads to a normalization of price across exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:51:14
3 Possible ways this was accounted: 
 1: FIAT DEBT + BTC @ GOX PRICE:
$65 million - $22.5 million Fiat debt = $42.5 million.
$42.5 million divided by $135/coin = 314,000 bitcoins.
 2: FIAT DEBT + BTC @ MARKET PRICE:
$65 million - $22.5 million Fiat debt = $42.5 million.
$42.5 million divided by $550/coin = 77,000 bitcoins.
 3: ONLY FIAT DEBT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT:
$65 million (3x worse than the leaked document) **PLUS** unknown number of bitcoins.

I will officially never give the slightest shit to any future announcement from blockchain\. Second time they've hyped up a big fat nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:50:40
checked how?
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:28:38
They can be insolvent and still function. All they would need is an investor to cover the missing funds. 
For them to be bankrupt, they would have needed to lose a ridiculously huge percentage of their cold storage btc. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:56:39
For security, the majority of cold storage coins are spread across multiple locations and IIRC some type of multiparty key. 
Not to mention it's incredibly dangerous to load up half a billion dollars worth of coins on one computer.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:50:13
Stolen, apparently.
EDIT: I infer stolen from this:

Wow, fuck off you retard. You posted 4 times in this thread complaining about the word "Stolen". Mark says **lost** due to **theft**. You don't know shit.

6.5 billion Yen debt = $63.6 million USD debt.
750,000 customer bitcoins + 100,000 company bitcoins missing.
Mt. Gox has 3.4 billion Yen assets = $33.3 million USD.
850,000BTC @ $550/coin = $467 million
Fiat Debt = $65 million 
Assets = $33 million
**Overall debt = $499 million USD.**
**Expected payout if BTC &amp; Fiat evently weighted: 6.6%**

He did say that, but as he's also said 100 times, it's just his **opinion** and he has **no inside knowledge**. Stop trying to manipulate the price.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:37:34


Give me a good reason why?
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:19:42
How will MtGox removing a few thousand "Dear Customer blah blah" tweets in any way whatsoever help their legal defence? They haven't said anything other than "Dear customer blah blah" for **months and months**
Seriously, the amount of speculation and stupidity lately is astounding.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:48:26
And not everyone who has an account necessarily has BTC or fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:03:12

I get ya, but I don't think they would ever go down that path. Doing that would basically change them from a trading tool into a full blown exchange (bitcoinbuilder also counts as an exchange I would say). This opens them up to a lot of security concerns, AML, everything.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:34:14
But how does this allow you to transfer BTC quickly between exchanges? It's just hooked into each exchange's API. The BTC still has to somehow get from one exchange to the other. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:17:54
Yup, the theory may or may not be correct. Time will tell. But I will say the pieces are lining up. [For example, this one about Silk Road:](


Who needs a transaction ID when you got that? Ulbrichts own words, saying he had $25k on Mt. Gox and made well over $200k already. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:44:46


Of course, why would they open up an investigation? It's only like a half billion dollar theft.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:19:43
Exactly, plus because it was a MITM attack, only people who logged into Bitcointalk during the attack would be affected. Satoshi hasn't been logging in since 2010, which we know from his user bio.
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:26:38
Yes... DDos by doing a handful of incredibly transactions *rolls eyes*
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:52:01


And do what? Insider trading isn't illegal in an unregulated market. 
This is the wild west. 
Choo Choo mothafucker.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:49:05
They hyped this up for a week beforehand:
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:23:19


Everyone was joking about it from day 1 on IRC. "Oh, wouldn't it be funny if Mark lost the key?" or "Oh, wouldn't it be funny if Mark's cat ate the USB stick?"
Well, shit has got so crazy it's now one of the possible theories.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:05:54
Not the transaction, but good proof:
