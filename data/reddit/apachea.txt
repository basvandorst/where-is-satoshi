Sorry Im a touch confused by what you're talking about. Is this system able to be used now? (i'm fairly new to bitcoin and not as tech savy as I wish). Would the arbitrator just be a 3rd party person/company?

Aspiring Graphic Designer, thought I would get this to have on me in case some clients wanted to pay with bitcoin
  
(I know it's not super safe to just use one address but obviously the print had to be static haha)

Have people been forced to give money back due to bitcoin? I dealt briefly with paypal (unknowingly about the bitcoin policy) and although I had some problems I had a few payments go through related to bitcoin. Will they eventually make me pay the money I received back? I really only use paypal to pay for rent but with these policies now known to me looks like I'll be closing shop

something I found was this website:
Obviously this is a 3rd party person you would use (as the website doesn't offer the services) and their [FAQ]( seems to say that some of the well known wallets have this feature. (I use electrum)

USD? Go to coinbase. Uses your bank account and credit card. Takes 3 days to verify and 4 days to receive your first BTC order. After a month you can then instant buy up to 10 BTC a month.

sorry, so will this in turn make the price go up or will we see an initial slump before the climb?
