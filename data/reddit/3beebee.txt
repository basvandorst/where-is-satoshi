Hey guys! Would appreciate some help on some questions about selling products for Bitcoin:
What would be the best way for us to set up bitcoin as a payment method? Should we open a Lightning Node?
Also, if lets say our product is 10USD, do we set the price in bitcoin as a fixed price (arbitrarily 0.001BTC as an example) or does the price in Bitcoin change every day depending on the price of 1BTC? 
So lets say today 1BTC is 10k so we set the price as 0.001BTC, if at a time 1BTC becomes 20k do we set the price to 0.0005BTC?
If we are missing anything we would love more input and help! Thanks so much in advance!

Hey man, I started off just like you but got seriously into it the last month. I think whether you invest a little or a lot its a good practice to get into securely storing your BTC. You never know if your 0.01 or 0.1 BTC might turn to tens of thousands of dollars one day.
I would suggest an Electrum wallet as it has been really easy to use! You can head on over to electrum.org to get it all set up and if you need help getting it up and running just ask and we'll help you get it sorted!

Whats up with the price recently? Its like it doesn't want to dip below 16 and doesnt want to stay above 17. Are the futures really stabilizing the market this much?

Anyone know when the subpoena for Tether is supposed to take effect? I know it was issued in December but when will any more news come out about their audit?
