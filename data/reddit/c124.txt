So much this.
If your friend is geeky enough to care about XBT and hasn't invested they must have their reasons.
Get the person a sweater or something and catch up over the holidays at, which point you can bring up bitcoin and truly educate them about it.  The most important thing about Bitcoin is grasping the protocol.  I can barely count the number of times smart people ask "but who pays the miners" only to see their eyes glaze over when I expand XBT from a "coin" into a p2p, work secured, cryptographic ledger.  Hopefully those long quiet spells back home allow them to soak up the information.

I'm accepting bitcoin for blowjobs in central London.
Give me a pm hun.

And you expect their dividend to remain that high for how long?
Eventually they won't be the only game in town and I shudder to think of the backlash when their end user miners fail to hit 100%roi.

I take it you're new here?
Bitcoin is a proof of concept.
If a crypto-currency ends up being that valuable it won't be bitcoin and it won't be soon.
Mind you, if we're talking the apocalypse then 1btc may be $200k although all that toilet paper doesn't help me towards the pint of milk that costs 2 blue crab shells.

As I understand it, the problem is with our legal system.  As an exchange you hold funds belonging to someone else, which in the UK requires a finance/gaming license.
To get a license you need to validate clients identities which becomes a lot if effort for such a small market.
It's possible to become a "reseller" essentially by making big orders through EU markets and sell them on for GBP but this requires you to charge/pay vat and take on currency price fluctuations when buying/selling/holding GBP/EUR/XBT.
Thanks to SEPA you can just go through Europe but the fees are quite large for small investments.

Top response.

Enjoy your monetary devaluation, sorry "quantitative easing".
I'm not saying bitcoins are magic but to suggest holding greenbacks certainly tickled my ribs.

You should be talking to the wiki NAZIs.  The Bitcoin wikipedia article has always been keen to highlight perceived flaws in the network.
The simple fact that these are long standing words in the EN"English" language should point to them not being Bitcoin specific.
Anyone willing to accept wikipedia at face value isn't likely to be technical/educated enough to understand the security measures requires to secure a wallet, so, if anything, the misrepresentation of the situation will probably avoid potential coverts losing their money and having a terrible first impression of the network.

Can't find the quote but I'm pretty sure it came from Gavin during the last bubble and to paraphrase was: "Bitcoin is an experiment, not the silver bullet.  Only invest what you can afford to lose."
I will be trawling the forums/web for the post and think it should be a perma link on here.
Bitcoin is great, I am a convert, but *it* will not replace fiat.  It simply has to survive and prove to coming generations that a distributed, proof of work secured, cryptographically based internet currency can work.
Satoshi is the 21st century Plato and we are his deciples.

We may be a while off this yet but we really need a big chip manufacturer to diversify into mining.
They should quickly top the market.
Take initial r&amp;d on the chin, and push a product that can't be bettered by a power of ten.
+10% efficiency will pull in customers but won't alienate gen n-1.

I'm responding to the beginning of this post.
I firmly believe that the massive gains are all due to the long lead-in/pre-orders that have plagued asics to date.
Returns on projected network hash rates aren't happening.
I worry that manufacturers will continue to enter the market, pre order queues (and thus projected hashing increases) will remain hidden (as it's in the interest of the manufacturers future sales) meaning as the user base increases there will be more and more people willing to buy new hardware based on current or optimistic estimates of network hashing progress.
My worry is that people will continue to buy into "next gen" releases only to lose money and leave the mining game pushing more and more of the hashrate into bitcoin millionaires and big players in the mining rate.
My 2 satoshi.

Feel free to prove tour confidence by buying mine at $290.
Otherwise, please direct spam at bitcointalk as I like to read *news* on my r/bitcoin widget.

I suppose you didn't see the sellers refusing to use PGP.
I always expected the downfall of SR to be sellers raising USPS suspicions and getting busted along with X buyers who's deleted address wasn't wiped from HDD.
SR didn't trade in drugs, it traded in trust, which mainly went towards dealing drugs.

I doubt you work with many older eastern European programmers.
In my experience, about 5% can write great code and converse brilliantly but their terse error messages made little sense if not confused the matter at hand.

You're confusing mining with expecting free money.
If you have a lot of money involved in bitcoin it's quite advisable to host some mining at a loss because a 51% attack would decimate your portfolio.
In addition, if you value anonymity or have trouble directly trading in bitcoin you may be willing to punt $5k on a machine that will generate half that value at today's rates on the expectation they will increase over time.

I find propagation works best if you actually discuss the protocol with some technical people.  Otherwise, someone always starts asking "but who pays for the mining" or the like and seeds doubt into everyone else.  If they can understand it as a ledger that's continuously encrypted then they can take of it what they will.  3 people who know what they're doing in your office is better than 10 who buy on top of a bubble, invest in service X and lose a grand they shouldn't have been playing with in the first place.
