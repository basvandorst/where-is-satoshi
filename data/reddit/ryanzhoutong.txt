We apologise for any inconvenience caused if our staff members couldn't verify your ID on time. The new system will reduce our work load by automating the collection and verification of government documents securely. 
Even if you can't complete the greenID process without assistance, in most cases we can help you identify your account in 1-2 days because we will have much less documents to go through. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 10:57:21
MFA authentication is applied to the entire session. That means if you have completed the security challenge, it will be valid throughout the entire session (usually when you close your browser or click "Sign Out"). 
If it's still not working, please go to the Security Devices page and make sure it's enabled and activated. Only activated MFA security devices will be used.
Account limits should be clearly explained on CoinJar Filler. It's a 24-hour limit, applied to bank transfer if you're identified, or cash deposit if you're not identified. Cash deposit limit is $10k per 24 hours for identified users.
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:05:17
Yes. You're welcome to use scheduled BPAY payments. Just note that the minimum deposit is $10 per transaction.

We have found a SSL certificate issue with our API server that's used for the iPhone app. As we are unable to update the app, we had to change our server side for it to work again.
Now this issue is resolved. You can try to log in to CoinJar on your iOS device now. Thank you for your patience!

In order to be "in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions", this app is only available in iTunes stores in Australia and the UK.

CoinJar app will be available in the following countries in 24 hours:
Hong Kong

But it's now available also in the UK.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:15:06
This is correct. Adding a 0 *in front* of the account number will easily solve the problem.

The app doesn't support MFA yet. You have to disable all MFA devices to sign in. After signing in you can re-enable them.
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:48:15
There are no fees to deposit via BPAY. You only pay 1% when you buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:19:02
It has always been available in the Australian store. We previously removed the app from sale in all other countries and territories.

Ryan from CoinJar here. We are really sorry that the identifications were delayed. As some of you may know that we are developing a much faster way of verifying customers and at this moment it's just pending integration with our new partner (many Australian banks use their service for automated AML/CTF compliance). Due to Christmas/New Year holiday period this process is taking longer than what we can deliver (because I have actually been going to the office on Boxing Day and today, both public holidays).
What I can say is that the team has been incredibly busy working on new features, improvements and partnerships. It's definitely not true that we don't care about our customers. 
CoinJar Filler's volume in December was A$9.29M, and that's almost a 100% growth from November. We realise that effectively scaling our platform requires us to automate more business processes while maintaining the quality of customer support and user experience.
Thanks for your patience while we implement the new identification platform, which is scheduled to be launched by mid-January. Meanwhile we will continue to go through the backlog and identify customers manually.

@_date: 2014-01-01 23:16:31
Sorry for the confusion. I will ask support to change all the relevant KB articles and scripts. Basically we doubled everyone's limit ($1000 initial, $2000 after 7 days and $200 per successful deposit increase, max $10k) a few weeks ago. 
The $5k buy/sell limit is per order, so you can place a second order shortly after the first.

CoinJar doesn't charge GST when you sell Bitcoins. If you're a business CoinJar pays YOU GST.

CoinJar for iPhone was made only available in Australia after Apple informed us that our app must be "legal" in all countries where the app is sold. We are confident that our app is completely legal in Australia.

CoinJar for iPhone developer here. We won't be releasing a version for jailbroken iPhones. Also we may continue to publish iOS apps that do not include the features to send or receive Bitcoin in the future. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:13:41
CoinJar co-founder here. To be frank we have no idea why Apple has disallowed the Coinbase app in the App Store. In our opinion both CoinJar and Coinbase app fully comply with App Store Review Guidelines, including the part on In-App Purchase.
CoinJar's interpretation is that Apple allows the purchase of goods and services that are not being consumed within the app when not using IAP (e.g. buying paperback books from Amazon is fine, but buying Kindle e-books is not). In fact, these goods and services cannot be sold through IAP. In other words, since Bitcoin cannot be consumed and enjoyed within a Bitcoin wallet app (the enjoyment happens outside the app), not only you are not required to use IAP, you *can't* use IAP to sell Bitcoin.
App Store Review Guidelines: 
11.2 Apps utilizing a system other than the In-App Purchase API (IAP) to purchase content, functionality, or services in an App will be rejected
11.3 Apps using IAP to purchase physical goods or goods and services used outside of the App will be rejected
11.4 Apps that use IAP to purchase credits or other currencies must consume those credits within the App
In any case, Apple's inconsistent treatment towards Bitcoin apps in general has severely affected our incentives to continue investing in the iOS market. Our first version is definitely not perfect, especially with the lack of support of some European locales and the recently introduced Multi-Factor Authentication. Until there's more certainty and clarification from Apple (which we have been seeking), we will withhold non-critical update releases.
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:40:51
We were going to send that to the block chain, because it's a payment from CoinJar to an external wallet. The only way to send that transaction is through the Bitcoin block chain. 
However, in this incident, our server got a time-out error and the transaction was not sent properly. Instead of "resending" we simply returned the funds to the customer.

Global selling limit was cancelled and replaced with individual selling limits on CoinJar.

Hi I started CableGeek as a side business because I found it extremely expensive to buy high-quality smartphone accessories in Australia. Previously I helped some friends buy some of these in bulk from China and the US so I know which brands are both great and cheap, then I thought it’d be cool to actually run this as a business part-time. 
CableGeek provides free shipping on any purchase, and all orders are dispatched from Melbourne (so they will be delivered to you in only a few days instead of weeks).
As a Bitcoiner myself, I’m giving all Bitcoin users 10% off all non-sale items. Simply select Bitcoin as the payment method when you checkout, and you’ll be redirected to BitPay with the 10% discount automatically applied. Alternatively, you can apply the coupon BITCOIN with Bitcoin selected as the payment method.
Feel free to post comments in this thread and I’ll try my best to reply to all of you.

CoinJar allows anyone with an Australian bank account to take out hedged AUD too. So the centrally dictated exchange rate will be kept in check.
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:42:21
What's wrong with our new website?
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:18:33
Disclaimer: This is my personal opinion and not necessarily the opinion of my employer.
I think the main issue with BitShares is that there's no market-based mechanism to enforce price convergence. Unlike ETFs, where any qualified investor can issue and redeem using underlying assets, thereby indirectly regulating the supply and demand in secondary markets (there would be arbitrage opportunity if the secondary market price is incorrect), BitShares only enforce the BitAsset/BitShares price using price floors determined by distributed agents.
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with this. The price will still be correct (as long as the agents are honest, which we can assume so). If for some reason the market participants stop believing that 1 bitUSD = 1 USD, the price still can't deviate from 1:1, which is by design, and is great. However, the cost will be the lack of liquidity. (Microeconomics 101: Price floor above equilibrium price results in excess supply and fall in volume/liquidity.)
CoinJar Hedged Account, on the other hand, is the first solution that will actually allow you to redeem at least one currency being hedged to. If you're verified, you can instantly convert 1 AUD in Hedged Account to 1 AUD in Cash Account at just 1% unhedge fee, and withdraw to your bank account for free. Also unlike other centralised hedging solutions like Coinapult or Bitreserve, this ensures that CoinJar will have to maintain price convergence of at least one fiat currency being hedged to. Liquidity is also guaranteed.
Back to BitShares: I think it's anyone familiar with BitShares should know that bitUSD is not backed by real USD.  It's issued through short sellers opening positions, and redeemed through short sellers closing positions. The way I understand about it is that it's an imaginary asset that has to trade 1:1 with USD (trades at any other price will be rejected by the network). It's a genius idea, but I believe that liabilities of a trusted corporate may work better than an imaginary asset for frequent hedging requiring instant liquidity.
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:23:34
The fee only relates to buying and selling Bitcoin through CoinJar. Sending and receiving bitcoins are completely free.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:30:17
It's a factual statement. Bitcoin wallets available through App Store: CoinJar, Coinbase and Blockchain.
So which one is the most beautiful? :-)
@_date: 2013-08-15 05:46:58
CoinJar is a proprietary limited company ("Pty Ltd") and it is a separate entity from all owners. 
However the bank considers all directors to be "associated" (hence "risky") and since closing personal accounts doesn't violate any terms or banking code, they can do this.

If you transfer from a CBA account or deposit in a branch, the deposit approval process is now almost instant! (New automated system deployed on Saturday.)
Many customers got their deposit approval SMS very quickly. I think so far our record time for creating the deposit notification to approval is 40 seconds.
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:25:19
If anyone has encountered similar issues we will appreciate if you can send an email to support to discuss. We take issues like this very seriously and we are always happy to work with any bank to address their concerns.

Noted. I guess we will need to handle localisation client-side and convert to international format (e.g. 123.45) before submitting to our server. Definitely an important issue, considering we are calling ourselves a global company. Thanks for the interesting find!

In practice POSTbillpay is faster than BPAY, and they offer something like "due date protection" so if you pay by 5pm of the due date the bill will not be considered "overdue". BPAY can take a few days to clear. Origin Energy "may" charge the fee in your next bill. Only a handful of POSTbillpay billers (mainly city councils) charge fees upfront.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:45:48
Thanks guys. I didn't expect this to be on reddit so quickly but as a member of the CoinJar team, I'm really glad to be able to bring this wonderful app to the world. I hope it's the best way for every Bitcoiner to manage their Bitcoin wallet.
Personally this is my first iOS app project (I'm a Ruby developer) and I'm sure that there may be some minor issues but if you have any feedback, please email us at feedback or visit  to post a suggestion.
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:29:54
It's a 24 hour rolling limit. So you have to wait until 11pm Wednesday in your example.
@_date: 2013-07-17 04:55:32
Thanks for the feedback. Now we are showing the estimated delivery timeframe if Bitcoin cannot be sent immediately (which should be relatively infrequent now).
We will add the email notification system to the entire CoinJar platform. So you can receive emails for incoming Bitcoin transactions too.
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:57:57
The policy was superseded by compulsory ID verification for all bank transfer deposits. We realise that only a small number of banks offer 2FA, and most of them aren't even mandatory (for early customers especially). 
So if you're already identified, you can transfer from ANZ but we will still need to manually review each bank account when the first deposit is received.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:29:20
Great idea. I'll add this one to the list. Expect to see it in 1.1 or 1.2. Thanks!

Currently CoinJar Filler is for buying Bitcoins only. We do have a service called CoinJar Checkout, which is designed for merchants to accept Bitcoin online. 
However, we are continuing to improve the service by adding more features. In the future we may consider enabling Bitcoin cash-out as well. Subscribe to our newsletter ( bottom form) and we will let you know.
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:04:32
Thanks. Please spread the words. Bitbillpay will remain free for as long as possible and it doesn't cost much to keep it running anyway (as everything is automated). 
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:03:20
It's actually $500/day now. It will become at least $1000/day one week after your first deposit.
If you want to be identified, you can gain $5000/day cash deposit limit from day one.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:49:35
Another important use case: Many Australian universities accept POSTbillpay as a payment method (likely because they get a interchange discount as education providers anyway). International students in Australia can buy Bitcoin in their home countries and pay their student fees using Bitbillpay to avoid converting AUD and remitting funds to Australia altogether. 
I haven't did the numbers, but I think it'll be cheaper if they are an easy-to-use exchange like CoinJar in their home countries. :-)

Thanks! We're really ambitious about Bitcoin's future at CoinJar. Buying Bitcoin easily is just the first step for us (a crucial one apparently) but our vision is to bring digital currency to the real world.
Great that you like my service! :-) Also, please try Bitbillpay. I bet that you'll like the user experience. (It's faster than BPAY because you don't have to log in to your Internet Banking, and the payment clears the same day vs 3 days.)
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:40:06
We will increase your limit to $500 after 7 days of your first successful deposit. After that, our system will automatically adjust your limit upwards until $5000 whenever you make a successful deposit.
(Will document our detailed policy on our website soon.)
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:40:51
When we applied for the SSL certificate, we did not include the www subdomain in the Subject Alternate Names field. Theoretically all our links to the www subdomain are HTTP only, which should be redirected to  However some browsers may attempt to connect to 
We have temporarily reverted the SSL enforcement on our *landing page*. Anything involving your CoinJar account or money (including Filler, Checkout, Wallet service, API, Developer Portal, Exchange Rate service and Sandbox) has always been SSL-only and HSTS-enabled.
In the next few days we will contact our CA to re-issue the certificate with the correct SANs. Then we will re-introduce the SSL enforcement for our landing website.
So if you're really paranoid about this, visit  and sign in from there directly. Remember to check "CoinJar Pty Ltd" in your browser green bar.
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:34:32
As long as you're able to include a reference number in CBA cash deposit slip, yes. The CF reference number is the only thing we use to identify your deposit notification. 
So, it's perfectly okay to do anonymous transactions. However, CoinJar Filler will require you to verify your mobile number.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:51:32
In fact that's most likely caused by a rounding problem. We store all monetary amounts as 8 d.p decimals like Bitcoin. However, the UX limits us to show only first 4 digits, which may be rounded up in your case.
There are no fees in Bitcoin transactions on CoinJar. We will improve the design by showing the full 8 d.p. balance when you send money. (Will be updated by Monday.) Hope that will help. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:26:51
Yes, definitely. We are evaluating our options. Most likely we will use a HOTP or TOTP implementation, or maybe SMS. 
That will take some time though, as our security priority right now is streamlining the SSO process and further strengthen the security of the Filler and Checkout platforms.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:25:45
I believe that there's an iOS 7 compatibility issue with a library I used. If you restarted the app it should be working again. But it will surely be fixed in the next version.
@_date: 2013-06-14 08:00:53
We are fine with EFT. We use daily limits to prevent/limit fraud. If you use the same bank account and make several successful payments, your limit will grow automatically.
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:12:22
We will definitely expand overseas in the future. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-07-07 16:24:26
We use AWS at the moment. Given that we don't have dedicated sysadmin resources yet, hosting with AWS can actually give us more control over security configurations.
All our servers are in a VPC with different subnets for different purposes and environments (production and sandbox). They are also classified into different security groups by utility. All servers except load balancers do not accept any incoming request. (They are behind a firewall, and also NAT.) Outgoing requests are also permitted on as-needed basis, which basically means HTTP/HTTPS and DNS.
In a colo environment, a configuration like this will be very expensive, both in terms of time and hardware (due to lack of flexibility and under-utilization). AWS has a very good security track record, and we have access to tools that are usually unavailable with other cloud hosting providers, such as IAM and two-factor authentication for AWS logins.
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:22:25
Of course! We're the first VC-backed Bitcoin startup in Australia. 
Re: the BTC/AUD exchange rate:
Our exchange rate table is currently available here (previously unpublished link): 
You will also see the exchange rate when you use CoinJar Filler. It's on the dashboard after you've set up your account.
We are in the process of moving our exchange rate data to a separate platform component, and subsequently make our exchange rate feeds publicly available.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:47:08
Those are just general questions before they even looked at the app. Mostly concerned with IAP and our pricing model (we don't charge for the mobile app, at all). We explained to them that CoinJar doesn't make money from wallet services and the revenue comes from outside the app.
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:11:11
It's quite ironic that right after CBA has frozen our money, we called ANZ to blacklist our bank account as we were not satisfied with their effort in online security protection. And we were told that it's impossible.
Another insight is that ANZ contributed to a majority of fraudulent transactions in CoinJar. So it's unsurprising that they may perceive the transfer activity as "high risk". 
We compile pages and pages of fraud case to discover patterns and research the sources. At the same we also employ machine learning and utilise various metrics to make quick decisions behind the scenes. We especially understand that some Bitcoin users legitimately use anonymity tools and the use of these services should not be correlated with high risk activities like other e-commerce segments. We are working so hard everyday to fight against fraud and it's just very sad that we have no way to share our fraud prevention intelligence with some banks to protect consumers in general.
Fraud is a common problem and it makes everyone's business difficult. Banks especially have their responsibilities beyond locking consumers' accounts. So if anyone working in ANZ is reading this (unlikely, I know), you can ask your Group Security to contact us at support and we are happy to share our case notes regarding compromised ANZ accounts in the past.

CoinJar co-founder here. While it's true that we have a rather large backlog of account identifications at the moment, the team is working on new ways of verifying customers' identity. We plan to bring on a new verification system in mid-January that will vastly shorten waiting times.
Meanwhile you can always deposit cash at a NAB branch, and for many users cash deposits are near-instant provided they fill in the correct reference number.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:23:40
Hi all,
I have spent my weekend on this personal project that allows everyone in Australia to pay their utility bills, mobile phone bills, school fees, council rates and even some insurance premiums. As long as you see the POSTbillpay® logo on your bill, you can use the service. 
The main differentiation of Bitbillpay compared to other similar services (if any) is that the payment process is entirely instant. So you are able to get your bills paid instantly with Bitcoin and obtain the receipt number (exactly the same as if you pay via POSTbillpay directly) within 60 seconds. Many of my friends think it's even faster to use Bitbillpay than POSTbillpay.
BPAY bills aren't supported yet, but if there's enough demand I will consider it. Also once the website has reached A$1 million in cumulative transactions, I will open source it.
I'm a co-founder of CoinJar and Bitbillpay's Bitcoin checkout solution is entirely powered by CoinJar Checkout. By using the service you'll also experience the power of CoinJar Checkout API and the seamless experience you can deliver on your own site. 
Feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions in this thread.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:48:32
It's really hard to say but we had honestly answered all questions Apple's review team has raised before it got approved today. CoinJar for iPhone doesn't violate App Review Guidelines and I hope Apple cares about user experience as much as we do. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:05:29
CoinJar for iPhone is still here: 
Not sure whether Apple will take the same action, but we will be updating everyone if there's a status change in our app. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:30:08
Yep. That's me. I'm in charge of this mobile app project and Apple asked for 4 screenshots, hence the picture.
@_date: 2013-08-15 08:06:40
We never guarantee any time limits, but if you use only your own NAB account repeatedly you should be able to get deposits in 5-10 minutes. Cash deposits are always approved in 5-10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-08-16 06:50:12
Just in case anyone has missed the newly added paragraph: This is a temporary decision. We are still happy to accept customers of all Australian banks after we launch a new service in September. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:28:40
That's right. 2FA client support is tricky, so we didn't include it in 1.0. You can re-enable 2FA after signing in, and your iPhone will be linked to your account. (There's a mobile access token stored in the local keychain, pretty secure.)
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:48:13
Well, that's not a scalable thing to do for a startup like us. However, we will organise Melbourne Bitcoin Enthusiasts meetups regularly so we can do cash trades during the meetups.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:46:48
BPAY is easy but I believe you'll change your mind after you try Bitbillpay. :-)
Based on my research most billers don't charge extra fees for POSTbillpay. But for some that do, the fees can't be avoided because there's no option to do a bank transfer. The benefit of using Bitbillpay is that there is no extra charge by using Bitcoin. So practically you'll get a much better value compared to selling Bitcoin and pay bills using BPay.
@_date: 2013-06-14 02:09:34
Please make sure that your phone number is correct. You can also try again by clicking the button. If nothing works, please send us an email at support and we'll be glad to help.

[For CoinJar users with 2FA enabled, here's the most efficient way to get your 2FA reset.]
If your GA is wiped out, send the following information (as detailed as possible) by submitting a ticket to 
- Date of sign up
- Date, time and location of last sign in
- If using Filler, the mobile number and/or linked bank account details
- Last cash deposit receipt or bank transfer evidence OR two forms of ID
We take your security very seriously so we may require additional information based on your account-specific details in order to reset your 2FA status. Due to the scale of this issue, we have dedicated additional support resources/time to help our customers access their Bitcoin more quickly.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:24:50
You guessed right. I tested with all my billers (including University of Melbourne) and the scraping system can handle a variety of possible user errors. It even validates your reference number for you (but please still double-check).
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:41:14
Are you using 2FA? Try disabling it temporarily and sign in again. The 1.0 version doesn't support 2FA. We are fixing this in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-07-05 08:29:20
We operate the entire infrastructure in a private network, and permit network access on as-needed basis. Application servers and Bitcoin servers are entirely isolated and they can only talk to each other via a message queue. Our Bitcoin server doesn't respond to Internet requests at all. Rather, it only connects to a specific Bitcoind node running in a different datacenter. All server access is limited to our deployment-only VPN.
Our backend uses password (session-based) authentication plus SSL client certificate authentication. Even though we're a startup, we are actually running an enterprise PKI to enforce security requirements for all team members. We use our internal CA to grant and revoke access to the management system.
In terms of application security, we apply high standards: BCrypt hashed salted passwords, Extended Validation SSL, secure defaults (HTTPS-only cookies, HSTS and CSRF protection). 
Cold storage/paper wallet is still the king of Bitcoin security. Currently we are not holding a large amount of Bitcoin right now (and we discourage our users from putting more than transactional Bitcoin on our website) but we are actively collecting data to learn more about deposit/withdrawal patterns so that we can ensure our cold storage doesn't make normal transactions inconvenient (e.g. unexpected delays due to human intervention). 
@_date: 2013-09-03 05:22:01
Definitely agree. We hope CoinJar can become a transactional platform. It's ok to keep a small balance for everyday transactions and enjoy the instant CoinJar-to-CoinJar transfers. But the best way to keep Bitcoin savings is always offline wallet, and there's no alternative.
