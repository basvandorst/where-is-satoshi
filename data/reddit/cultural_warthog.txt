 &gt;  I see the energy requirement as a necessary evil. 
After all bitcoin is much more important than the environment.

Yes, like I said bitcoin is the most important thing in the world, much more important than the environment. Humanity will be much better off once we spend half our energy in bitcoin mining (i.e. wealth generation)

That's zero though.

Don't, instead read economy books by good, mainstream economists and watch videos by actual computer science and security experts.

"Deliberately sent money to the wrong address accidentally" is the dumbest thing I've heard so far today

Whoa, that's higher finance.

Yes, he is. Also a tax cheat. Although I have no idea how it relates to the matter at hand.

If you think 90% of professional economists are dumb-dumbs and wrong and evil, it's actually you who's the dumb one.

Lol, you really are an idiot, aren't you?

In reality each pump and dump cycle concentrates more and more wealth in the whales' hands and empties the pockets of "normal folks" like you.

Of course it's illegal, redditors are clueless idiots.

Actually it's a pyramid scheme.

No, he hasn't. It's like you have no idea how laws work.

A few years ago bitcoin was touted as 100% anonymous, this is about as likely to be true.
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:48:15
Lol, I bet you thought that was a good insult

Actually any reasonable person would believe him and so would the judge
