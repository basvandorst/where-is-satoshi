I guess we just disagree.  I do think it could be pushed or become normal, and I react strongly to avoid exactly that slippery slope.  It's optional, I reject it, and strongly recommend others reject it.

Any time someone builds the architecture that permits abuse, and then passes a law to prevent that abuse, they are either being dishonest or foolish.

Credit cards have had 50 years to innovate, but they started 50 years ago.  It's ready to go *now.*  In 50 years, they'll have had 100 years to innovate.

I have.  What contradicts?  Why shouldn't we be watching and concerned?  It says privacy a lot and that this is a goal, but the architecture suggested does not enhance privacy or anonymity.  It can't, because it's at odds with what it wants to do.  The *identification software* will be *privacy enhancing* they tell us.  So I'll be more anonymous with it than without?
The government (with a helping hand from private industry) is asking you to start using this protocol they built and control for your most important transactions, with the ultimate goal being that its used for most things.  That the intent is to require it is not a stretch, and nobody should be fooled or placated by a mission statement that says "It won't be required ever," or "we definitely won't use it to track people for stuff, that's against civil liberties."  Let's also not forget that just because there isn't a law against not using it doesn't mean that it isn't "required."  Like a car in the suburbs-why, you don't NEED it, just don't drive.  Or airport security's various violations, "well then just don't fly!"  Simple as that!  And the intended goal of this software is for online commerce, banking, etc.  You don't *need* to allow them to track you, it's not required!  Just don't buy things.
I'm with the author of the linked article, this should be watched closely.

Well it's not like US government wasn't involved with the original TOR which is the best tool of its kind I'm aware of.  Large organizations are like reddit-it's more than one person with more than one philosophy/opinion.

I would agree that no system is perfect.  The entire point of having them, in most cases, is to resolve what happens when you and I disagree about things like what motivations and moralities are shit.

Systems should be designed to withstand malicious actors, whether they're economic, political or information.  Such systems don't compel good people to abuse others but are able to mitigate damage from people who would.  Look at bitcoin, for example.  If a means of duplicating or stealing bitcoins was part of the system's design and exposed, it seems like a silly response to say "What we really need to focus on is what motivates someone to steal from someone else in the *first* place."

I'm not okay with companies who's business model is "sell heroin."  I think it's pretty clear though that throwing users in jail is nonsense.  You're also not allowed to sell poisoned apples in a grocery store.  It's illegal, but when someone eats one you send them to a hospital, not to jail.

You're right, if you push the metaphor it doesn't hold.  The deeper point is that the law's supposed purpose is to protect people from the harmful effect of the substances and sending them to jail to protect them is silly.
