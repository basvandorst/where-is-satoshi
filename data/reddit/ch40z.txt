No it's not, I'm talking about different balances before the date of the fork, that's why I find it weird. It might be because of a transaction which was never completed/confirmed, but I'm not 100% sure yet.

You are wrong...again! You must have been one of those victims of misinformation, open your eyes and learn more about economy and other cultures. Sorry to let you know but Bild is not the one and only information source out there. Talking about laziness, go get the figures and compare them, oh didn't Bild do it already for you?

Bad choice of location, move it somewhere else closer to downtown.

Greeks prefer cash and they don't even use credit cards a lot, so forget about it at least for the near future!
Bitcoin is not that mainstream in Greece and exchange from/to EUR bypassing banks is not easy for the average citizen. If there were more people holding BTC it would be easier to exchange, it's not the right timing at the moment but for sure after a possible Grexit. Of course as the guys already said survival comes first and then investments.
UPDATE: In the next few days the first bitcoin ATM will be up and running in Athens.

Good luck guys!

I had 3 other requests in the past that were stopped within a minute, as you said. I thought that some people might play around with the app to check how it works.

Bravo Niko!
Advertise it more and try to convince other business owners to start accepting bitcoin too.

Wow what a genius, every Bitcoin holder ended up with BCash after the fork. Personally I think BCash is trash and I hope it disappears as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:56:56
I doubt you have ever read or understood the reports, I'm a holder and I hope for the best but pretending there is nothing wrong doesn't really help.

VCs wouldn't invest so much money just for being part of a mining race, because eventually it's a race and sooner or later sth else more profitable will come out. I think they build a solution which will change the way big vendors think about bitcoin, so they keep/store/trade btc instead of selling them directly for usd.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:43:24
That's my guess too, currently all big vendors sell them for USD.

Happy April Fools' day!
That was obvious because we already know that Mr. Varoufakis doesn't like Bitcoin that much...

Not bad...early adopters and bad guys distribute their coins, time for the rest to accumulate.
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:00:44
As the other guys said, if you want to obtain BTC or have profit go and buy/trade them.
