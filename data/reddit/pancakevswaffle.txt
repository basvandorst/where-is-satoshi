Consider many instances of serial killers. If the identity of the individual charged wasn't divulged to the public, is the justice system at fault for endangering the public safety in the event of further crimes committed by the alleged perpetrator?
Further, what is the rational behind incarcerating the alleged perpetrator before they have been found guilty by a group of their peers? That argument alone should be very obvious to you for self debate.

Every single factor in the world plays into the BTC market. This isn't the NYSE, which is only open briefly, and less than 33% of BTC trading, which is always open.

Funny, I don't recall the Germans or French or any other banking nation forcing the Greeks to borrow from them.  
But that's how politicians in democracies get elected: bribe the masses with "free" shit.  
All you have to do is promise all government employees higher than inflation salary increases and pensions and you have their vote. Teachers always need more money and more time off to enjoy it.  
Problem with this is, you either have ridiculously high taxes, or you kick the can down the road with debt financing to buy all those votes.

Satoshi Nakamoto is the US government. The plan is to control the new reserve world currency as the old ages and dies. All the "lost" bitcoins from the founding et al, will be "found", and the asset reserve to back the economy and fiat like gold used to. This is the new age of planning for the collapse of empires and retaining continuity of world order with the USA retaining its place.

You've read all the usual timid crap about fiat cost averaging. Timidity never made anyone wealthy or "got the girl" or inherited the earth.
Get a loan for whatever you figure is what you want to invest near term. Purchase in 10% increments over the course of a couple months. Or if it takes a big dip. Could have a retracement to the $7k region apparently, but don't think so personally.
Human fear is a survival trait. FOMO is that expression in the present day. BTC has been around for a decade. You either believe in the fundamentals or you don't. Invest though as you may lose all of your money. But then again, FTSE and NYSE are the same game in their own ways.

If you bought in now and in "years" btc is $1M, would you be pleased?  
If you bought into the DOW and didn't understand corrections, or not have the stomach for 2009, what would you find of value?
  
There are apparently 30 million millionaires on the planet. There will only be 21 million bitcoin. Ever. Consider this in ten years. What were you thinking because you didn't buy btc "years" ago. Because you couldn't afford an entire bitcoin. Fractional wasn't good enough.

Do you remember 2009? And the giant dump the NYSE took? Now superimpose that image on your description here.
Many sold all the way down in 2009. "Selling in the face of unknown risks is a smart thing", according to you. But then there are always unknown risks out there by very definition.
And for the most part, if you held in 2009 instead of selling, you'd be rolling in the dough right now, ten years later. DOW 2009 vs DOW 2019. Aside from Lehman Bros, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, et al that failed/merged due to "not understanding" the investment/sector/technology, and the "unknown risks".
Thus, I debate you on your own point that it is invalid. No disrespect intended.

Yes, Macron is a pos. Look at the continued yellow vest protests still after months.
"Many protesters say their purchasing power has dwindled so much over the years that today they have [trouble making ends meet]( — let alone coming up with money for simple outings, vacations or even just to go out to dinner once in a while. Many are earning close to the median income, but costs have risen and pay has not.
The median earner in 2016 in France took home about 1,700 euros ($1,930) a month, but that means that half of the French took home less. The income has to cover rent, food, utilities and clothing, as well as the cost of fuel."

Exactly. This meme sucks because it puts forward that you must pay for everything 100% on the barrel head. It supposes there is no such thing as good debt. With government mandated inflation, entering a market, whether it be housing, NYSE, or BTC, it is a forced issue if you don't want your fiat inflated away while you're saving up for that big purchase.
Or even saving money for your education instead of taking out a loan. This meme would theorizes that you should work at walmart and save up $300k for education so that you don't go into debt ever.

I agree on this point of course.


Yes. And you seem to have a trouble grasping this potential thought process. The world is made up of wealthy people who have superior analysis of all sectors of the economy. Also, non-wealthy people who believe in their own analysis and speculation. Look at this reddit for proof of belief in individual speculation.
No one has the proverbial crystal ball\*, and yet there's proof of many making money on a new asset class. I am. Many in this sub are. I would even say, most here in this sub are, if they didn't buy 100% at ATH. And even then, the ATH buyers just have to wait.
Show me an asset/commodity that has historically returned 25% per year.
Anyone that thinks there is no superior knowledge out there that isn't shared with the world is delusional.

Your position would appear to be that anyone that mines below a certain btc price is stupid.
You seem to believe that you know the mining costs for all entities in the world.
Do you understand there's places in N.America with 1-2 cent kwh elec for megawatts required? You seem to be making assumptions that you know all total cost of ownership and op costs for all mining facilities.
But hey, you seem to have the knowledge inside track. Always good to believe you know more than everyone else in the market.

 What I posted:
Hi, just wondering if someone can clarify the FAQ for me.
The FAQ states:
**"What is Bitcoin Cash?**
Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org]( or read [What is Bitcoin Cash]( for additional details.**"**
So if this sub is for Bitcoin Cash and the ticker for that is BCH, why have an active sub for BCH under [r/btc]( Why not just point it to [r/bch]( for clarity?
This is confusing. And especially so for new bitcoin adopters like myself.
