We are going to $11,000 today folks

If someone would have told you 2 years ago that BTC would be at $11,000 and falling like a rock, would you have HODL or gladly grabbed your profits beyond your wildest dreams? Exactly. Don't be a fool and ride this down to $1,000

Interesting article here: 
***Researchers find that one person likely drove Bitcoin from $150 to $1,000***
To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.

Make a mental note of what you've seen everytime Bitcoin crashes - you ARE NOT ALLOWED to sell on Coinbase...they just shut the shit down and cross their fingers that the buying will resume so they can open back up. 
One time occurrence is excusable, two - maybe...but this is at least the 4th time this has happened at Coinbase on big down days. I do not trust them at all anymore, sorry.
Edit - and just to add a conspiracy aspect to all this, if I had to guess I bet they do not have the cash on handle to fill all the sell orders and that is why they pull the plug on big down days. Just a hunch.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:22
Never again will I do business with them. They don't have enough cash on hand to fill all the sell orders on big down days, so they shut the place down hoping that price recovers.. 1929-bank run level scary.

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:09
Says you. Regardless of what the cause is, the fact of the matter is every time Bitcoin goes down meaningfully, Coinbase goes out of service and Bitcoin owners truly become bagholders....has happened no less than 4 times now...sorry, but I refuse to do business with an institution that operates this way. I've read to many financial history books.

Does that mean Coinbase will allow its customers to sell when they want to now?

How do you know you are at the top? Example  above
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:13:37
Or perhaps it makes people trust the institutions less? Once the finally open again they all sell because now they are even more panicked - similar to a bank run.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:10
All very valid points, especially point  - these exchanges are a complete disgrace. They make the bucketshops that Jesse Livermore described in the 1920s look like reputable institutions.

Yeah it's called spoofing. Illegal now on most stock exchanges, done to trick traders/other algos.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:57
Normal as in $40 bucks like 24 months ago?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:55:23
Don't worry guys Coinbase will be back open on Tuesday and we will be able to sell at $7000
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:11
Wrong. If they can handle all the buy orders that drive BTC up 20% in one day, they can certainly handle all the sell orders that drive it down 20% in one day. 
Answer is much simpler. They can take your fiat immediately in exchange for BTC, but they cannot give your fiat back to you immediately in exchange for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:38

"Satoshi must be in a perpetual smh mode— it’s incredibly ironic and sad that the largest and most well funded startup in the space is Coinbase — the crypto equivalent of a bank ( 
The Companies that help you hoard currency and not use it are the ones valued the highest in this economy. This is EXACTLY what Satoshi didn’t want. We just recreated the financial system all over again. 
The people getting rich now are the same Wall Street traders, market makers and funds that dominate our securities markets…and the same systems that Satoshi so badly wanted to dis-intermediate. The world’s financial system is not global and keeps out literally billions of people (for credit or other reasons)…every single person can own crypto, yet it’s now being profited by the same type of institutions (different skin, same function) it was meant to challenge. 
The point of btc was not to not make people rich, it was to change the system."
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:28
Funny that these glitches only seem to occur when price goes down meaningfully.....20% up day? No problem at all. 20% down day? Come back later.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:08:46
Relentless selling since the US stock market close
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:37
Yeah, it can be done on a smaller basis as well. Remember, if the sell orders above are only for .02, the spoofed bid only needs to be at .02 to support price.....also, .02 BTC may not seem like much, but if someone is making money executing that size trade every 10 seconds on a 24 hours per day, 7 days a week basis the money will add up. The purpose of spoofing is to lift/lower the bidXask to meet the algos objectives. If .02 is all that is needed to do that, then that is all that will be used.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:52
Anyone else concerned about all of those open gaps down to $6000 on the weekly barchart?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:34
I have good news and bad news.....good news is that markets don't just fall vertically - even blow off tops....which means that at some point over the next couple weeks, I expect this to test back up. If I had to guess I'd say we will see a $15,000 print again by mid-January.
The bad news, is that (in my opinion) the BTC chart is broken, for a lack of better words...again my opinion, but I do not think $19,000 will be revisited for a very long time, perhaps never. Keep in my mind I am just some rando on the internet, but if you look at most parabolic charts throughout history (silver in 2011 for example) they confirm what I am talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:02
It's over dude, chart is broken. If we are lucky it may test up to $14,000 giving us the chance to get out before the plunge to $5,000.
