Actually trading the currency not some b.s. betting on it?

I'm tier 2 atm so I'm already in the mucking around with crypto deposits... might as well let me skip a step and wire usd...
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:19:38
Took me a week to get tier 2... still waiting on three for weeks... missed the ripple explosion.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:52:57
I mean people using it.

Legit question... would you Trust Amazon? Typically its a wholeseller store more so than an individual. Can you secure the Ledger by getting new seed words? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:42:20
I wouldn't expect to make lots of money day trading on coinbase. You probably saved money. I bought near the same time as you and got the coin 10 days later.

I'm looking to buy a Ledger and was going to get one from Amazon... since it could be a third party seller is there a better way for me to secure it?
Can I reset the seed words? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:05:42
I don't know off hand... but it won't let me deposit usd in tier 2 at all..

Where are they owned and operated from?

I knew a guy that did this in his barracks... it didn't end up well for him... something about defrauding the government and improper use of resources...
That said, something tells me Finland doesn't care much for protecting the tax payers money.

I just can't see why for two days I wouldn't be even able to submit...
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:38:21
Really? Wasn't it like 10 times more than this time last year?

Marketshare is king... normies know what bitcoin is... Bitcoin is what they will use. Only thing is it needs to be useable!

This seems to be an enthusiast subreddit more so than a trader/investor subreddit. Many people here would be fine if bitcoin stayed niche imho.

Fucking hell Roosevelt was a despot...

Brand recognition is everything...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:44
I mean its not really thown away... its still there... it wasnt a large amount just a toe in the water. If it vanished today it would be like Vegas without the escorts. That said I have a basic understanding!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:15:40
Coinbase is fine if you are dipping your toes in... Gdex once you are more comfortable. Continue to educate yourself and read about exchanges from there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:27
I hear large fees and I'm a Coinbase noon? That's Okay it was quick to jump in and it wasn't a large amount!
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:01
Pretty sure banks can sell your mortgage...
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:32:15
Coinbase obviosuly...
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:21:09
I like finding articles predicting doom for bitcoin that are years old... it's always "next year".
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:27:09
In your opionion is it really so dangerous to hodl on coinbase of you aren't talking large amounts? I know it's an iou of the coin but it seems safe to me in small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:38:54
I started with about a tenth of that to be honest, bought in around 14 and 13... just don't invest more than you are willing to lose! 
Try Kraken too, think it's based in the EU. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:49:13
Thanks I'll check that out!
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:48:38
I sit behind quite a few people in line who st8ll haven't mastered their credit card... that said
 I agree 100% we need mass adoption... I've seen some attitude here that noobs are somehow bad. Even in my hello message after I bought in after the crash... just literally saying Hello, I was met with hostility because my first purchase was on coinbase... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:03
HODL... first thing I learned was what that meant... lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:24:35
Pretty much. I'm sure there are better options but if you are dipping your toes in like I was the fees aren't really a big deal. 
Coinbase gets a bad rep for being a normie/noob exchange... well yeah that's what it's meant to be... and how bitcoin user base will grow.
I got on kraken to buy some ripple... took three weeks to get verified and I missed out on a huge jump in price... doesn't hurt to get verified on the better exchanges.
Personally I'd avoid exchanges located in eastern Europe, Russia, or china... but that's just me. USA and EU make me feel warm and fuzzy.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:37:00
Wait.... the article pretty much said nothing... just that bitcoin is silly?
