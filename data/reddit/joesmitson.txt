Fun stuff! I've thought about stuff like that too. It's convenient to have online backups, but needs to be hacker/scan proof.

To all those thinking that GOX will run away with their money: get serious, people. With these amounts of money they will be put on Interpol's most wanted list on the same day. IMO they will do their best to keep their business because it is hugely profitable.

You clearly have no understanding whatsoever of the Lehman collapse. Lehman was an institution of systemic importance, which had outstanding contracts with most of the major financial institutions around the globe. Gox, on the other hand is already being largely ignored, and if it sinks, it is only those on board which will suffer. We will see a Silk Road effect, where the BTC community gets rid of something that is dragging it down.

@_date: 2014-02-07 09:47:24
Firstly, the exchanges would not want to limit volatility. Their business model is based on collecting %-based trading fees. The more volatility and speculation that is happening, the better for them. 
Second, you can't generalize about what speculators are doing. Some follow a momentum strategy, so when price starts dropping they sell. Others like to scoop up cheap coins so they are the other side of the trade. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:02:46
Am I the only one who sees this as bad news? To have wider acceptance of cryptos there needs to be a positive stance from governments, and they are sure not going to like this.

Many of them provide additional services which are not in the true decentralization spirit of bitcoin, so you cant expect them to promote it objectively. E.g. Centralized web wallets with snooped transactions, centralized tipping platform.

Wow, that is such a sad story, sorry to hear it. Back in 2013 it took me a minute to actually make my first BTC purchase.  Of course, I don't live in the US. Dutch website bitonic.nl lets people with a Dutch bank account pay with their card and BTC arrives immediately. Not even a registration was required, let alone verification etc. 
If you are seeking non-intrusive ways, I'd go to Mycelium local trader or Localbitcoins. You can even post the buy ads yourself and get a commission instead of paying one, assuming your buying needs in the future are not time and amount-specific.

I beg to differ. Increasing money supply can lead to inflation in a traditional economic setting. Inflation is merely a consequence. 
As an example, take the Eurozone a few quarters ago. Money supply was increasing but there was overall deflation.

Good point. I wonder how EU banks would give API access to coinffeine... 
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:45:40
The term inflation relates to prices. Since almost no products or services are priced in btc (they are rather priced in fiat and quoted in BTC), inflation is an irrelevant term. It's just the exchange-determined price that matters. And yes, the increasing money supply influences that rate by miners dumping, but that's not inflation.
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:31:31
I don't understand all the negativity in the comments. It's a completely legitimate argument. Everything should be automated, just like the way difficulty adjusts itself. It must be quite simple to set a few rules that can allow auto adjustments. Then we never have to go through this fiasco again.

And yet in the Bitcoin setting it can never lead to price inflation simply because products are priced in fiat and just converted using the current exchange rate.

As soon as COIN is out GBTC will converge to fair value, as COIN will be very liquid and traders will immediately arbitrage the difference. In fact, the convergence will even happen before coin is out, as soon as it's confirmed. You probably don't want to lose 30% of your IRA account... 
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:04:53
Sorry to hear about your situation but perhaps you can use it as a lesson and start taking matters into your own hands by using a proper wallet, rather than a 3rd party service for handling your transactions. There would have been no delay if you had done that.

BS... The underlying shares still give you the same exposure and you can cash out from the hedge fund, it just takes a bit longer due to lock up period. There are plenty of people out there who are ok with this time horizon, so there is enough convertibility to have the prices be approximately equal.

Coinapult is a rip off; their fees are way too high. I get the same effect by using futures to hedge the BTC that I want 'converted' to USD. Roundtrip transaction fees are in the ballpark of 0.1% with virtually no spread. The spread of coinapult is ~1.5%

I don't really get how it would work without the btc being stored on a central system. Can anyone ELI5? If indeed private keys stay with owners only, this project is pure genius.

You would be disadvantaging late comers, as you never made it clear initially that there will be a time when you pull the plug. Consider doing it as an equity IPO. The subscription price per share/tokken is fixed but the total committed capital is secret until the end. When you close the books, everyone gets an allocation pro-rata based on their committed capital. If you set a valuation of 40k BTC (for 100% of the project), the maximum you can take up is 2k BTC (the 5% you are offering). If 4k get committed everyone gets 50% of what they subscribed for, and the rest is returned in BTC. However, before making any decision, make sure to consult a lawyer, as inevitably investors will be pissed. You guys should really have thought this out. Your reputation is on the line.

Sorry for looking like a nazzi, but legit question: isn't the verb 'halve', and hence: 'halving', rather than 'halvening'? 
Great idea on the party though. I hope someone sets that up. I can totally imagine pictures from that party on a bitcoin wikipedia page a 100 years from now.

Very mature. That must be the way towards mass adoption
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:57:06
If you are still accepting you should fix the counter. It hasnt moved in hours, which means investors are throwing money in without being able to at least calculate the current valuation.

I had the same with last update (and this one). I updated via the website, only to see it autoupdate to the same version some hours later. I guess it takes time for google play to push the new version through to all regions of this earth.

Try Kraken. Registration and verification was really quick and easy for me. SEPA payments arrive within a working day.
@_date: 2016-05-09 16:01:08
Great! I will certainly be rejoicing and shouting "It's halvening" once it halves. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:33:44


If this can be done by a bitcoin wallet as well, internet will only be necessary for the merchant. Being able to sign a transaction that easily offline will indeed be the bomb! Bitcoin users wouldn't even need an internet subscription! I hope this is feasible.
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:53:40
You should really consider investing in equities for the longer term. Google historical returns of asset classes. I'd be much more cautious with those metals. Yes, they've been valuable for millennia, but we are entering a digital age and mining those metals is cheaper and easier than ever.

If you're doing cash trades you should definitely give mycelium local trader a try. No fees and direct peer to peer transfer.

Thanks for the YouTube links!

It is a function within the mycelium wallet. Best alternative to LBTC and currently no fees but only supports cash payments and is less popular.

Kraken, which actually has its Euro account with Fidor Bank, the owner of bitcoin.de. Bitstamp also does SEPA payments but is USD denominated. There are also some smaller country-specific options, such as bitonic.nl for the netherlands, which directly sends you BTC when after you pay with your Dutch bank card, without even requiring registration or any documents.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:41:27
I just registered to see how that works, and to link an account they require you to do a SEPA transfer to an Estonian bank, which will incur the fee... idk if subsequent buys are done in this way

Can we have a list? How can we ever find these merchants!? Such claims must be backed by evidence, which by the way can only be positive for the payment processors  and merchants as it will make it easier for us to find those merchants and spend our btc.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:46:47
Just checked the rate on Kraken @ 13:01 CET today. Was @ 1808 EUR. Your screen says 1754.58. That's a 3% mark up. Can you confirm?

If you live in a city and are not afraid to do cash trades you might want to post some ads on mycelium local trader. Offer a low fee or no fee at all and you will likely find counterparts.

Awesome! Can't wait for the torrent :)
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:58:12
Thanks for the links. Comments in these discussion show that the average effective rate experienced by users in transactions is 2.5-3% less favorable than Kraken and other sites. This is more than justified, given that you advertise that your business model is based on taking a cut from the merchant fee. Could you give us the reasoning and how you plan to address this? This is sneaky and I personally would not be using your services currently because of this high mark up.
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:39:25
Looks like the business is getting tougher. That's a 'yay' for consumers.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:48:47


I have a card already at a bank and it surely doesn't cost me 3% to pay with it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not just trashing on you guys for no reason. I'm a big fan and would love to use the service but from a consumer point of view it just doesn't make sense with these fees. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:57:59

I have heard similar complaints about some Swedish banks... SEPA is meant to be free but banks find a loophole if the country is in the EU but not in the Eurozone. It's likely illegal but quite profitable for the banks.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:05:36
I wonder of BTC-E will apply =)
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:44:41
Coinbase, if you want any Bulgarians to use your service, you need to find a way to bypass the ~€30 fees that Bulgarian banks require for an outward SEPA transfer. Sort out your payment methods! Adding a possibility to pay with a Visa debit card will definitely do the job. Sending money to an Estonian bank will not!

Most people don't care about how the network works. Just emphasize the benefits and briefly touch upon the system.

Greece has a fully functioning banking system and no capital controls. So does the entire EU. Anyone wanting to move out of the Euro for their personal believe will move into hard currencies and assets (USD, real estate, gold). It's not realistic to think people will buy magic internet money with crazy volatility to safeguard their hard earned assets. If anyone is considering this, be mindful. Risk only what you and your family can afford to lose.

If you want us to trust you, we need some more information about you and your team. Names, pictures and some background would be great. Make that easily accessible within the website. In the space of fraudulent exchanges people can't just trust a random stranger with their money. I would really like to be able to trust your exchange as vanilla options are something I have been waiting for for years.

Features are not the importance. It's how well they work! Priorities for me are:
1) Security
2) Perfect execution (no bugs when cancelling orders, etc.)
3) Good and timely communication (maintenance announced in advance)
4) Friendly and reliable UI
5) Low fees
Short selling &amp; leverage should only be allowed if volume is high and there is proper risk management employed by the exchange. I heard of problems with short sell orders on BTC-e the other day.
