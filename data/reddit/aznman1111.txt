Welcome to Reddit

Also coinbase was, by a large margin at points, the cheapest BTC so kinda sucks I couldn't capitalize on that
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:54:22
Hahaha excellent! Are there hours that are more active than others? I'm assuming miners run their computers nonstop but since China seems to be the power player here does that imply more volatility during their 9am-5pm?

Huh I haven't done a ton of research into BTC so I hadn't heard of bitsquare. I was just skimming and have to get up and get ready soon so I'll definitely look into it a lot more.
I couldn't find what the usual payment method for that is though. Generally the same as local BTC? (They even drew the comparison in the pdf under White Paper)

My limit was 300 on Circle. My daily max is $10,000 (yeah I know right???) But the card is limited to $40. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:18:36
So you don't trust Coinbase, a $100 million financial institution, because it has backing by larger financial institutions?
What is the bank going to do to corrupt BTC?

Excuse me? Just because I've never heard of the specific website you use for freelance work doesn't mean I'm incapable of understanding the concept.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:16:35
I mean the sentence "I do freelance work for BTC." is a real simple statement. I DID understand it.
I just didn't know that there were websites where you could even make/take offers like that.

Hey sorry for the newb question but does the price of btc fluctuate 24/7 or are there set hours where it doesn't change? 
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:19:52
Wait is circle not on here? Sorry if it is but I can't find it :/
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:13:30
Thank you! :)

Cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges were not only separate dots, but they were really far apart from each other. Because exchanges were placed way farther to the right on the time axis. Because exchanges have existed for so much longer than the coins themselves?
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:11:43
This is perfect! Thank you so so much
Edit: Would coinbase prices be a good exchange to follow? To my knowledge they're the largest US exchange correct?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:50:11
Might be missing it but they don't have a phone number listed do they? I'm not sure where to go to contact someone without just submitting a request and twiddling my thumbs
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:54:28
Choo choo!
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:00:20
What do you mean work for BTC?
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:23:24
Oh my lord I got 2 minutes in and couldn't listen to that woman talk. Skipped ahead and heard someone ask the guy why he thought capitalism was the only way to produce resources.
Jesus Christ I supported Occupy Wall Street but my god some of those people were dumb
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:14:57
What video were you watching?
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:12:03
Ohhhhh that makes much more sense. Well that's a really cool graph!
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:45:43
True but to be fair assuming the payment method is the same as LBTC (have literally no idea if it is or not) then it won't be as widely adopted because depositing cash into a bank and getting your currency through a 2 for 3 multisig takes a LOT longer and requires more effort than typing a debit card and hitting buy.
In terms of widespread adoption it's never gonna happen.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:59:49
Yeah the submit a request link sends your case to their email
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:14:45
Haha yeah there were points where coinbase was at 650 while kraken and circle were over 700
@_date: 2016-09-13 02:19:00
Whoa! Well fancy seeing you here. Just wanted to say that your AMA, particularly your response about women not deserving to put up with BS because they choose CS was amazing. Even as a male I felt inspired.
Keep doing that good work and don't let ignorant people slow you down!
Edit: Because I think it's a particularly great chain. The comment I'm mentioning
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:23:44
Googling 'wallet security' is a minimal bar to set in comparison to trusting any exchange
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:49:00
I think he expected this to come out of a thread titled WATTBA

Confession time. I've thought he was saying "I'm drinking lean and thought I died"
Like no they. Future just woke up one day with dinner on his shirt and said "Oh shit what day is it?"

Hahahahahahahaha I mean who listens to Big Rings quietly while in a somber contemplative mood?

Paging OP. Buy. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:38:50
Any you recommend?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:00:03
Didn't expect to laugh so hard when I opened this thread.
Just wanna say thank you for that
@_date: 2016-07-13 11:46:51

Yes
