Sorry mate, but I think you're better off departing.

Exactly, bitcoin is not anonymous but rather pseudo-anonymous. 
It may not be clear which address to refund, as some customers may be paying from multiple inputs (possibly without knowing, as their client would handle this). It would be best for the customer to give you their receiving address to be refunded, and you would indeed have to create a new transaction for this refund.
You can use an address as many times as you'd like as long as you hold the private key :)

Paper wallet with self made invisible ink hidden in a stack of blank papers. You have to sniff around for it. Also good for marking my territory.

1. This will help against making every one of your sales publicly viewable.
2. The proof is in the blockchain, and no more worrying about chargebacks!
3. You can try looking for someone on localbitcoins to exchange for cash.

Or an offline prepaid Android device for $20.

You can create a paper wallet using a ubuntu live disk and Armory. Then do a watching-only import into your hot wallet. Test it out with change a few times if you're not confident in it.

Then find an alternate provider. I support this company's decision and am more likely to do business with them for it. If you do not, vote with your BTC.

Can confirm, am also Satoshi.

Too late. Switching to the G3 as soon as it's out.

Just ordered mine yesterday. If you own one coin or more, this is not a bad investment at all.

If this is true I sure dodged a bullet by transferring out and into Kraken just last night!

Pro-tip for your replacement: run it with the case off and just dust it every few days.

The screws are beneath the rubber legs. They're just glued on and will be sticky enough to be put back on when you're done.

Good idea. I use this product to keep a $20 on my keyring and it comes in handy way too often.

FYI, Scott Banister, a PayPal board member and VC is very pro-bitcoin.

Bitcoin days destroyed is an alternative measure of volume. You could send the same coin back and forth all day, so simply measuring transactions won't give you any useful information. BDD indicates the amount of days since the coin was last moved. This chart indicates that 173M bitcoin days have been destroyed, meaning a lot of old coins have been moved around. More than ever.

Here's a hot address from last May: 
I only saved it because that was the first time I got gox'd. Fuck the guy behind the receiving address.
Here's a toss address from November:

I said this at $6. Now's as good a time as any.

Crazy. Just two years ago I sold my 30G/h pre-order to pay for my wedding.

I hate to break it to you, but mining won't net you a return on your investment and will deteriorate your equipment + cost you more in electricity if you're not using an ASIC. Mine for the network, not for bucks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:59:58
Sold half at 360 thinking it was near the next bubble cap :/
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:55:52
This happened to me a while back. The $90 then didn't hurt as much as what it's worth now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:44:52
aaaaaaaand motivation gone.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:36:40
It was fun to watch as it wiggled around 1000, seemed like no one wanted to sell for less than that.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:32:30
I'd like to remain hopeful that with easy access to cheap usb ASIC miners, more and more people will take up mining to support the network and not to make mining profits.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:41:30
You can have .000009% of the network hash rate for $14 Amazon Prime'd. Actually, I think I'll order one right now and have my grandma mine blow stamps. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:42:12
I think this means SELL SELL SELL.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:20:22
I'd like some feedback on this too, I know of a certain Senate candidate wondering this as well.
EDIT: It seems the question is regarding the use of BTC itself, if the candidate receives converted to USD however, then it's considered an in-kind contribution.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:49:20
Sold some more at 970. A lot of people were cashing out at 995 just now and trade lag is growing. Feels like Spring :/
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:55:56
While bitstamp holds steady.

My Jalapeno is generating about ฿.009 a day. This will drop substantially as the difficulty increases, but it will always keep my coffee warm. If you want to capitalize on bitcoins, I'd suggest doing so by creating something new in the market and not giving a zero interest loan to a really shitty company.

@_date: 2013-11-28 13:32:46
Best way to learn is to buy $20 worth and follow that. And remember to use two-factor authentication. As someone who had a significant amount of BTC stolen, it keeps hurting more as the price rises.
