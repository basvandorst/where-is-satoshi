overdraft? you mean they have a 5% spread?
I've not used them but if they don't charge a fee per transaction then its bundled into a combination of the commission, spread and/or slippage.

There seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere. Even if all the bitcoins were lost except for 1 then it can still be actively traded because that bitcoin is subdivided into millions of units called satoshi's which can be valued at anything. The protocol can change so that each satoshi is subdivided into smaller and smaller units which happened before.

I keep the poo in my hands for slaps.
Either they take both sides of the market with the spread so 5% up and 5% down from the spot value thus you could've got a better deal on another side, Or they do the slippage so your first 5% is at market rate and 95% of the trade is way over the market price. They also might charge you a monthly/yearly fee for the account. Finally they might charge you an exit fee to cash out.
It's a business so you're paying somewhere and when a site says 'free' mean they're probably way overcharging you on something important.

I think you're a bit off on that 84% decline as the volatility decreases with each cycle. You want to be charting a  curve rather than linearly
