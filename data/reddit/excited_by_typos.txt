Organizations much larger than BTC-e have datacenter problems. That doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:18:00
Why do people use this argument? That's like saying, "lol they banned chemistry" because you're not allowed to be in possession of a bomb. I don't agree that banning encryption in any form is a good idea, or even feasible, but this "banning math" argument is really tired.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:35:12
Stories like this always make me wonder how shadier exchanges like BTC-e manage to stay afloat. You know they must have at least as many people running security/penetration tests against them.

Some screenshots of the entire flow:
1. When you get to the billing screen: 
2. Selecting Bitcoin: 
3. Then you have to click the "Bitcoin ^checkout ^now" logo to checkout:  
4. Bitpay embed: 
IMO step 3 is confusing. It looks like the badge that most places use to simply advertise that they accept BTC (like they do in the previous step!). I didn't think to click it at first and didn't see where to click to checkout. It took a few moments for it to hit me.
Very happy to see them do this! The checkout flow is a bit confusing but I bet they optimize it - a company so large invests lots of time into tweaking funnels like checkout.
Also worth noting that selecting BTC takes no extra steps on the second screen, whereas with a card you have to enter in all your details. However for BTC there is that Bitpay screen at the end while a credit card would just be silently charged in the background. Very different process for creating a transaction.
**Edit**: here's one more of an email I got: 
Interesting that they send the confirmation before they are even sure I paid. I wonder if Bitpay doesn't give them an easy way send it once payment is received?

@_date: 2014-08-03 13:10:35
If the only promise they made is a vague "it's free" then you shouldn't be surprised. That's marketing.
If they explicitly said there would be no monthly fees, or any of these others you are seeing, then you have reason to complain.

HTTP requests have a lot of boiler-plate. It really adds up when you're using polling (sending a request every few seconds). A constant connection like WebSockets enable only requires the boilerplate once, which saves a lot of time and bandwidth. Read [this article]( if you care about learning more.
As a dev, I broadcast all live data to visitors on my live chart site [cryptowat.ch]( over websockets. [Bitcoin wisdom]( also uses websockets for a big part of their site.

I found this interesting. The UK is trying to attack coin counterfeiting by making the coin more complicated to produce - and as a side effect, incompatible with existing vending machines.




There's many existing machines out there that will simply have to be retrofitted with new hardware or completely trashed and replaced because of a *physical limitation* that can't simply be patched with software. All of this effort just to prevent counterfeiting (which may not work - the counterfeitors' tech will likely improve along with this). 


And finally, certain manufacturers are worried that a coin that doesn't roll won't work in their hardware


Bitcoin has its own problems, but nothing like the ones they are dealing with. It's almost kind of funny. It is starting to make this feel like an ancient, primitive problem.

They help identify whether longer-term trends are reversing so you can react to them, as opposed to trying to predict the future (which just leads to lost money).
You can read [a pretty good explanation of Ichimoku here]( You can look at when certain lines cross, what orientation the cloud is in, etc. I'm still learning it myself but it's very helpful for making sense of a chaotic price chart.
The parabolic SAR is simpler - it's basically a lagging EMA that tries to "catch up" with the price. When it does, it flips directions, and the trend usually reverses at that time. So if the SAR is below the candles, that indicates you should take up a bullish position. When it flips to the top, that might mean you should sell.

There's a lesson to be learned from this. Forget splash pages, marketing, email lists, and hype machines. Forget parallax scrolling, custom typefaces, and sexy HTML5 video loop backgrounds. It's easy to notice that many (most?) successful software projects were announced with a humble email to a mailing list, perhaps paired with a basic website like this one. This sort of presentation tends to indicate that the priorities behind the project are properly aligned.
All of the new "bitcoin startups" I see these days spend way too much effort on their public appearance and not enough on validating and executing on the substance of their actual product.
