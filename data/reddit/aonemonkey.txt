Ryanair can fuck off

70! Haha. Cunts. And you're right about the online check in. It was also 7 am, and you're in Stanstead airport, no chance to go to Dixons.

My mind was not blown.  I was mildly depressed and amused by the experience.  I've flown on many airlines, all over the world,  in many different price brackets,  but there is only one airline who I would never give another penny to. Thanks for helping me with my memories though,  great feedback on what happened

Did you read my comment? 
I admit my brother didn't print the boarding cards. ( we had the tickets)  my problem was not that... It was the abusive and pathetic way they dealt with their customers

I flew with them once.  my brother booked the flights.  He didn't read any of the small print. Failed to print out the boarding cards. Ok...his fault, whatever.  Get to the airport.  It's 40 quid if you forget to print out the boarding card. Ok...so three people flying,  that's 120 quid.
Again,  our fault.  So at the airport it's chaos, full of people who got caught out in the same way ( must have been just after they introduced this scam/policy.
So lots of people complaining... The Ryanair staff member dealing with explaining to the upset passengers was literally screaming in peoples faces, and being incredibly rude. Verbally insulting everyone ( my party included) 
So we waited in line to pay 120 quid for 3 boarding cards, and when we reached the front,  I told the Ryanair woman, wearing a Ryanair tshirt, sitting at the Ryanair desk, that I would like to make a complaint about the way there employee was speaking to people. 
She looked at me and said. ' sorry,  I don't work for Ryanair. '
I laughed. She wasn't joking.
'but you are sat at the Ryanair desk, wearing a Ryanair tshirt!'
She deadpanned...'just because you're wearing Next underwear doesnt mean you're working for Next. 120 quid please. '
It was quite funny,  because she wasnt joking, and flat out refused to engage with me at all. 
Im not giving those cocksuckers another pound of my money,  and i when i do fuck off, ill gladly fuck off flying on a real airline, not surrounded by a bunch of pikey cunts like you :)
