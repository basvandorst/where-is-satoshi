The only ones I tend to listen to are the TA guys on [tradingview.com]( 
At least they're talking science.

Oh sorry, you believe they were killing the giants:

The US happens to be a world super power? For one thing they dropped the mother of all bombs on civilians in Afghanistan,  and no one questioned them.

Haha :D Funny!

Well you still didn't answer how much energy banks consume including human factor to compare. Besides, mining is temporary and block rewards distribution end in 2041.

If only BitCoin increased the block size:
1. They would have solved the scalability issues with fast transaction times, low fees.
2. They would have retained BCH market share instead of split.
3. They would have avoided security vulnerabilities that will be exposed by lightening network in the future. 
4. They would have enabled God knows how many poor Bitcoin amount owners who can't spend their bitcoin because the fees exceed the amount instead of worrying about pc storage space (Dude I can't spend the coin will space matter now?).
5. Instead all that matters is Power. Increase demand, increase hash power, empower the powerful, enrich the rich and lock the poor.
6. In regards to valuable.. Monero XMR is less scarce (18 million) and more anonymous and private therefore valuable but.. it's not powered by the powerful for the powerful. It's for everyone and thererore count doesn't decide value. It's hype.
Notice that BCH split has encouraged many other hard forks. Power is in unity,  but it's already too late.

Point  makes sense if you try to understand why BitCoin Gold fork was made.. to be more fairly distributed rather than only for ASIC miners.
Point  Didn't you just say that BTC is scarce where only 21 million of it exists? I found you a similar coin with all the original Satoshi framework. Besides, there are many coins which are even more scarce if number consitutes the attributed value and preciousness. 
If you have more references that could explain more about lightning network and problems of bigger block size please share because the guys on  BCH subreddit have made a video that discredits lightning network scientifically/practically and I'm not a technical expert to judge so I like to listen to all sides.

This means if there was no consensus on Lightning network update, many people decided not to update their bitcoin software it wouldn't have existed today. But running an old version of the software shouldn't that cause problems?

If that scenario is true, why China sought to ban cryptocurrency?
