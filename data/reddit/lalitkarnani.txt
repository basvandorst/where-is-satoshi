Yeah but in technical terms wouldn't it be beneficial to have just one hub and all the user on that?
Why have different hubs?

I am still scratching my head over this:
Wouldn't this lead to just one lightning node for everyone? Everyone on one mega hub.
That would be theoretically so convenient.
And if that does happen, what will the first layer even be used for?
What am I missing here?

Nope not myself. You could try doing it as both exchanges are in the same country so moving fiat will be easy. 
As of now there has been a 1200$ spread among bittrex and gdax for about 24 hours.
Even if you pay 10-15$ for faster transaction you could make decent money if you have the capital.
If you do try please let me know.

However it wouldn't impact the price much by itself directly as these contracts are cash settled, no one is actually buying a bitcoin. The ledger thing next year however is the real deal.

India. Unsure about legality of arbitration though.

Offline is better right?

Yes that's what bitcoin does, tricks you into financial freedom using cryptographic decentralized currency by luring you for big gains.

So they are only expensive because of software or there is some special hardware to it?

@_date: 2017-11-11 21:30:22

@_date: 2017-11-11 21:29:17
