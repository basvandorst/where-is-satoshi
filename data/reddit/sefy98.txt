The idea is they get big companies to sponsor it and then broadcast the whole thing.... They probably won't succeed but regardless I like that they're trying.

But they want to actually do something about their vision. Buzz does nothing by itself.

Not to mention half of them get out and suddenly are rich again.

It was only unstable because of day traders. People were driving up the price then cashing out, but if we switch to a system like bitcoin the value of the dollar loses meaning, but I doubt governments will ever allow their control over money to be lost.

It'll correct though because the toughness will go up right?

Maybe some people still think simple liberties are worth fighting for.

Oh don't get me wrong I vote libertarian, but it does weaken the republican party. I might have voted republican if Ron Paul wasn't running. For all his flaws I think we'd be way better off with him.

Why would you ever publicize anything about your clients? Isn't that violating their trust?

Yeah like how the states made it impossible to sell electric cars to individuals, and how car companies have managed to corner electric cars out of the market for 40 years through regulation. I can see all the corporate giants are pushing only for less government oversight and less regulation, not their own personal agendas.

At school children have different sources of information. At home you are the one and only teacher. There is no indoctrination when you allow for multiple sources of information.
ie. Let's say the teacher tells your child something he doesn't understand or agree with. The child goes home and says "Hey dad is blah blah blah right?" You can then explain why or why it's not right and the child can decide which way to think. I did it all the time as a kid.

We would have had electric cars 40 years ago if we had an actual free economy....

But if you're assuming the price has dropped because of the market being flooded (like footfetishmanx mentions) then you can assume it'll raise when the flooding stops. Which would be after the first iteration of asic miners raise the difficulty.

See I would believe this if it wasn't completely counter productive. Libertarian party is a 3rd party that steals almost exclusively from republican party votes.
Supporting libertarian actually gets you more democrats elected, and trust me the Koch brothers would know this.

I never said I associated it with isolationism. Home schooling allows for only 1 teacher and I personally think that having multiple teachers and learning from different sources is important. Not to mention things like library day and field trips. School is an experience and I think homeschooling deprives children of some of the experience.
Parents want to "Protect" their children from bullies or bad teachers but I think learning to deal with these things helps a child grow in life. You're going to meet stupid people who work above you, and you're going to meet bullies in real life.

I think homeschooling stunts a child socially. :-/
Edit: I should elaborate on this because I can sense downvotes coming. I do not believe a parent should ever teach their child all their knowledge because it indoctrinates a child into thinking like you, which is fine except I believe a child should be exposed to several different trains of thought, and decide how they wish to proceed in life.
Furthermore I understand that public schools suck, but there are plenty of charter schools and public schools that do not suck. You just have to take your time choosing one.

I would think day traders would destabilize the market and long term investors/users would stabilize it.
I feel like day traders work only on what's hot and moving, making it artificially inflate and move more.

haha, I'd totally buy coin from some random dude at the airport XD

If you would have invested years ago you definitely wouldn't be remorseful.

Hey now they're protecting us. Wouldn't want someone stealing ideas, or stifling innovation.
