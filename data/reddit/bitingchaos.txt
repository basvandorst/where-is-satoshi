I agree 100%. 
Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized and totally functional even if a "bad player" tried to hurt the network.
What do we end up with? **One** company spams the network, which keeps it from working for everyone. 
If it gets this bad NOW when 1 entity can disrupt it this much, what happens when Bitcoin gets more popular and lots of groups all spam it with countless transactions? 
What happens when a dozen hacker groups try 10,000 transactions per second of 0.0000001 BTC with tiny fees? Do you tell the hackers to play nice and use Lightning or whatever? 
Telling Coinbase to stop using the Bitcoin network *as it was designed* because it *doesn't work right*  100% point to flaws in Bitcoin, not Coinbase.

Is this the same Bitcoin that slows to a crawl and is crippled by high fees and a backlog of transactions because **ONE** SINGLE ENTITY (Coinbase) can bring it all to a screeching halt?

I tried to send $40 to someone. 
The transaction fee for sending $40 would be **$32.**     
I could choose to be out $72, or choose for the recipient to only receive $8.         
I did not go through with the transaction.

This was from the Coinbase interface. I didn't see anywhere to adjust the fee. 
I was planning on putting more coins on their service (I started *mining* back in **2011**), but I will continue keeping most of my coins where they are at.

PayPal works like any other banking app, and Facebook has no in-app purchases.

Shhh. Hush with your logic.
Despite Apple having this policy for 5+ years, other users seem to think Apple has some sort of vendetta against their particular chosen ~currency of the future~. Microsoft can't even get around this (30% cut of Office subscriptions purchased through iOS go to Apple).
Despite being the only factual answer to the question, another user that contributed to the anti-Apple circlejerk got more upvotes and even awarded gold.

To expand on that:

I have *ten* purchased with BTC. Then again, my number of coins was in the triple digits, so I didn't see them as that expensive. BTC was only around ~$100 at that time, as well. So for "less" than what I bought my GPU for, I'd have something better.
I had amassed a ton of coins using GPUs that only mined 75-340 MH/s anyway, so dropping a few coins to pick up a mess of USB ASICs that did ~333 MH/s for a fraction of the power didn't seem like a bad idea at the time. 
Then again, I didn't think about how that if I could get such nice ASIC for "cheap", that others obviously could get much better stuff for a few bucks.
It was a bad investment. :(

I saw this before. It is short for HoTMaiL.

Offsite backups. Even if you don't use Bitcoins, even if your house hasn't burned down, you should still be doing offsite backups.

Welp. I'm done with ever programming again.

I use to have over 100. :(

My biggest issues with it:
* It scans EVERYTHING, all the time. TXT files? MP3s? .config files? Pretty much every file action will pass through it, even if the files don't really pose a threat. Copying files from Drive 1 to Drive 2 can take ten times longer than it should. Why not just scan files on open? Why not just scan commonly infected files?
* There is no control over how many resources it uses. It will use 100% of all cores and use 100% of disk bandwidth. Everything else on a system can slow to a crawl when MSE is scanning stuff. 
* I've almost never had it catch anything. Malwarebytes has been *far* more effective at finding, catching, and removing things for me. I end up turning off MSE, running Malwarebytes, then turning MSE back on.

The LEAST protection, really?
It's the most resource-intensive AV program that I've ever used.
