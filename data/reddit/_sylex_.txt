Not all of an AI has to be part of a blockchain to have it's sole perception be that of the blockchain. It could be given any system to do it's computations on at real-time, but it's only new "perceptions" could be on a block chain.  So long as it's input and output are restricted to a blockchain, it's view of reality is that of the virtual space-time a blockchain creates.
"Bullet-time" from the matrix would be the most apt analogy. Virtually unlimited time to think, but only a slow view of known events and ability to effect the world.

The hardest problem to solve in any market is coordination, why exactly would you label industries which solve this problem "parasitic?"

the blockchain is relatively continuous if perceived from a frame of reference within the blockchain. Just as spacetime is relatively continuous if perceived from within, as we cannot see spacetime from an outside perspective we would have no way knowing if it were truly continuous. As far as we know there could be a discrete resolution for spacetime.
If you were some hypothetical creature that lived inside the blockchain, you would experience timesteps as each new block was created, thereby giving a semblance of a continuous reality.

The blockchain is a continuous representation of transactions over time, just as spacetime is continuous representation of space over time.

What gave you the impression that this was a "revolutionary" idea?

My argument was not at all metaphysical unless you consider spacetime from an outside frame of reference, and that was just an analogy to make it simpler to understand reality from a blockchain-internal perspective. 


That IS practical thing to think about, since a viewpoint from within a blockchain is perfectly legitimate frame of reference.
The undeniable fact is, if you were an AI or something that could experience reality inside a blockchain, then the timesteps would appear continuous since your thinking itself would depend on each new block.  This is an incredibly important thing to think about, since future autonomous agents could easily be implemented in blockchains to ensure their actions are trustworthy.
