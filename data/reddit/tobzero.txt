quoting myself from another thread for any non german speakers:

Most important part in the papers, basicly the reason why all this happens:
Simon has a german bank account which he had to create to offer the GiroPay deposit method. When he opened the account he declared his intentions and the expected money flow through it. Simon withdraw crash from this account from time to time, claiming that those were only profits from same day withdraw, parcel etc. but no customer funds!
After the ammount of transaction skyrocketed the bank (Commerzbank) wondered about the connection to the pollish bank account and assumed it had to be big scale fraud due to his cashouts and reported Simon to the german authorities. They (german authorities) thought Simon was running a scam and never intended to deliver the sold product (they assumed he ran a onlineshop not even considering its a trade site). Help from the polish authorities was requested who than quickly closed the polish bank account under money laundring and terror financing suspicion.
Conclusion: Bank thought many transaction = scam. report to authorities. all bank accounts frozen.
Thank you Commerzbank.

poker is a skill based game too. luck is not more important in poker. this is just one of those public knowledge myths.
im sure that selfperception from the "average" person who would play for money is close(if not the same) to bad players in poker. your brain is biological programmed to find flaws around you and very quick to discard selfcritical thoughts.
actually beeing a winning poker player has many connections to beeing a good starcarft player.
