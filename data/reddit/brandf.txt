Easy solution:  When miners get close to 50% (say &gt;40%) this automatically triggers an a change to the accepted hash algorithm.  All of their custom hardware becomes obsolete.  Should be a sufficient deterrent for it to never happen.

Thanks for the link. Bitalo is exactly the direction things need to go.  The fact is governments are going to attempt to compromise Bitcoin because it has the potential to go beyond their control.  It doesn't matter if Bitcoin is decentralized if they only have to compromise a few centralized exchanges.  As a matter of global security I think Bitcoin users should demand decentralized exchanges and fungability.  Without these it will just be too easy for a powerful government or compnay to disrupt.

With a nounce of only 4 bytes and a hash of 32 bytes, it seems entirely possible that no nounce could result in a hash below the target (for some set of transactions at a given time).
Is the timestamp just there to provide extra bits to the nonce?  In other words, are there any constraints on the timestamp that the network verifies (must be greater than last blocks TS, must be "close" to the real time, etc)?  If not, why not just make the nonce 16 bytes and get rid of the timestamp (which ultimately is somewhat meaningless in a distributed network)?

How does one make a public key like this?  Do you just keep generating random keys until you happen to have the word "dorian" in one?  How long would that typically take?

Its seems like you dodged a bullet.  Normally when someone dodges a bullet their take away isn't "you should always duck before the bullet hits your head".  Are you taking any actions to prevent bullets from being shot at you in the future?  Or did you just move your BTC to another exchange?

It seems like offline is the only safe way to go, but it's too much of a pain for the mainstream. I'm hoping exchanges like Bitalo succeed, so there is a better tradeoff without requiring high levels of trust.  It seems like CoinBase and the like are missing the point, even if they're (currently) not as corrupt, there are not safeguards against the same thing happening with them.

Seems like a good system, I'd use it.
One concern I have that wasn't answered in your description:  If trustedcoin is compromised and a hacker gains access to all of the keys, then he/she can look at the blockchain and find out who is the best target for a targeted attack to get the 2nd key.  The hacker will use the email/sms as an attack vector to infect prime targets (large sums of BTC) since they're no longer anonymous.  If the hacker infects a machine containing one of the users two keys, they can combine with the trustedcoin key to transfer.  
Obviously this is much harder for a hacker than without trustcoin, but easier than going after the 2 user keys.  Are you doing anything to mitigate this?
