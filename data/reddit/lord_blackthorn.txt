Nah he would have stolen that kids lunch money, and then pushed him jn

Still awaiting approval.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:56
They have confirmed that it was a hack and they lost everything
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:19:13
Lol I figured

I thought it was a band of ancient Japanese ninjas that snuck in and put all of their bars of bitcoin into their pockets. Then uses their ninjitsu powers to ninja telephoto away.

What type of income would bit coin profits be considered?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:33
Not may be, they have confirmed it
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:42:57
I invested it elsewhere unfortunately
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:02
Oh I don't have to anymore ;) she knows
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:48
This is quite true... We need to promote help and inclusion instead of being jerk...
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:46:46
Just barely outpacing inflation.... ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:38:13
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:55:23
Congratulations! I hope to do the same one day!
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:33:21
Depends on how you can prove "intentionally concealing"
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:59:42
I would immediately walk in and close every account with them.

Connecting your finances, especially something with such a high risk/reward will put undue strains on your relationship. If it is as you say, then you are better off both having your own wallets and each being responsible for their own investment. Sharing advice and information or talking about things you have seen in the market is fine, but don't share one wallet. It almost always leads to a bad end.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:57
This is the truth...
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:10:09
Can't even load The subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:29:06
Lol plan on forgetting lots of stuff if this goes through ;)
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:43:58
I listened to my wife and didn't pull out $4000 usd and put it into bitcoins back when it was &lt;$15.00 a piece...
Not only do I bring it up every now and then, but even her own friends do. Fun times ;]
The way I see it though, is that i never had the money. Never had ownership of the gains. I shouldn't miss what I never had.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:43:25
I wish there was a way to limit how many one person could buy to enable it to spread out a bit.  I dislike one person having the power to impact the market so much.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:07:52
I personally like the Ledger Nano S, however the Trezor hardware wallet is good too.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:58:34
You just described every technology ever invented...  Non-perfect.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:51:48
I disregarded your article entirely after you stated that "most" of your information is factual.
All of it should be.
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:51:38
1 USD = 1 USD too.. its value changes.. but one of something is always one of something.
1 BTC Today =/= 1 BTC Tomorrow
just like 1 USD Today =/= 1 USD Tomorrow
Yes they are the same unit, but the purchasing power of that unit varies in time.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:00:27
Seconded, Ledger does
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:09:12
Yes, you should be in control of your own wallet, don't leave coins on an exchange of any kind unless you are currently doing something with them.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:10:44
No Q/A is perfect. It's unlikely they would have pushed this out with zero testing as it has to do with access to a great deal of customers money.
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:15:27
Be sure to transfer your coins to a personal offline wallet, you don't want anyone managing your coins for you
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:52:33
You are describing nearly every currency ever in history. Inflation happens, markets adjust.
Even crypto could be worth less in 30 years that it is now in a coin by coin basis... none of them are guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:15:31
You shouldn't substitute one habit for another...
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:52:49

There are a few ways, coinbase has made buying crypto easier for a few coin types. They have streamlined the process for sure.
However, coinbase has questionable ties with Bitcoin Cash (which is not the same as Bitcoin btw) and pending lawsuits.
It's always safer to get your own wallet. My personal preference is a hardware wallet that can be stored in a secure location in your home. However generating online wallets can be done as well.
You can find info about bitcoin wallets at bitcoin.org.
Ether and other coins have similar sites.
Once set up you can transfer your bitcoin straight from coinbase (via withdraw function) to your private wallet address. (make sure it's exactly right and that you are using the right wallet for that coin type)
Any coins I mine or buy get moved to offline wallets that only I have access to. Many of these companies get hacked and lose their coins that they had at that moment, so it's best to not leave your coins on them. You are a much smaller target than they are anyway.

I am not only HODLing, I am buying.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:46:04
You are right that they are not equal, but implied meaning is up to debate and opinionated.. Its hard to make a logic statement about an opinion, so you must go with what was explicitly written
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:59:31
For all your work you discredit yourself.
The very design of your articles reveal that you are not unbiased or neutral in your efforts. You bold key words that create a negative image, you intentionally use exacerbated language to emphasize your side. 
If you ever want to be taken seriously, let your data do the talking for you. No need to come off like a tabloid. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:06:54
This doesnt work with loss very well.
If i put in $1000 on 12/17/2017, it shows me making a profit today, which isnt true. That day was the peak of the spike before everything began coming back down. We still are not back there yet I dont think.
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:22:02
It's going up
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:57:47
Man what's up with the uncharacteristic gains of bch the past few days... What's spiking it?
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:37:16
I hope one of you win ;)
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:08:40
I especially like that there is no axis labels...
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:43:56
Lol, they don't have a grasp of the terror that is hyperinflation....   Where you go to buy a loaf of bread with a wheelbarrow full of money, only to find someone has stolen the wheelbarrow and left the money on the ground because it was worth more...
