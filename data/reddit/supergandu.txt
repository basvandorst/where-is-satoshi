These are blockstreams own words, not mine. Adam Back (blockstream) has stated this openly on twitter. People are just making connections between what they say and the fact that they are against onchain scaling. This is a glaringly obvious conflict of interest for blockstream affiliated developers that are also core developers.
Edit: I don't mean to offend anyone, but this is the reasoning people of r/btc people going into BCH. They feel that a corporation is artificially limiting onchain scaling for their own personal gain. In addition to this many Core developers are affiliated Blockstream in one way or another, making it appear that development is concentrated in the hands of a single commercial entity. The fact that insititutional investors AXA and PWC have poured money into Blockstream compounds the suspicions in Blockstream's intention towards bitcoin as payment system. As many r/btc redditors will point out, Bitcoins market share dominance fell from 90% to little over 50% as soon as blocks became full and fees escalated.

its bad in the sense that if this bubble corrects badly it will hurt crypto adoption as a whole. reinforcing the lies that its a ponzi scheme.
it could take us years to recover, like the period after december 2013.

I hold 7 different cryptos. My biggest holding is BTC. Yes I do hold Bitcoin Cash, mostly just as a hedge for the upcoming B2X shitstorm.
And its good advice I just gave him asshole. Get out of debt before buying crypto. People in debt are far more likely to panic sell during a correction.
Edit: The real sneaky people are the ones convincing you get into debt to buy crypto, and pump up the price for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:19:02
no they are not. although a small entity, the majority of nodes use the core implementation.

BTC isn't even 10 years old. How would you know whats going to happen to btc in 10 years? alot can change during that time. In fact alot can change in a month.
I understand the excitement though. BTC to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:31:28
I have the same hopes you do. But my blood boils when I hear of people going into debt to speculate on bitcoin at these prices. 
Bubbles crash when indebted speculators panic sell. 
Also, merchant adoption for bitcoin is actually decreasing. Which means we aren't growing in a meaningful way. 
Even though I'm saying all this... I don't think I would be selling at 10k, but then again I only invested money I can lose.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:19:39
I wish you were right. But I highly doubt it.

@_date: 2017-11-03 06:39:13
the reason for price rise is different this time around.
2013 onwards it was merchant adoption. this time merchant adoption is actually dropping. ppl are taking loans to buy bitcoin, classic signs of a bubble.
please get out of debt. then invest money you actually own.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:53:59
We are in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:36:11

@_date: 2017-11-07 10:29:02
the actual context? ok.
From the article.
(Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware — a fact that has caused the big blockers to protest that Blockstream and the engineers it employs who are also Bitcoin core developers want to keep the block size small so Blockstream can profit. Back says this isn’t true because, beyond a certain point, side chains won’t really solve scaling.)
Adam Back (Blockstream CEO), we asked on twitter if this was true. to which he replied - "that's correct, and an accurate quote."
its all in the linked tweet. 
How could anyone not see that Blockstream has a conflict of interest with onchain scaling?
Please don't compare this to some crazy conspiracy. I'm not debating blocksize here (infact I think most of the problems with bitcoin can be solved by rolling back "Replace By Fee" code), but I am pointing out that there are nefarious actors in bitcoin today. Not just the 2X people, Core itself.
Also, please look at the following links:
AXA invests 55 million, partly owns Blockstream.
PwC and Blockstream partner up.
AXA is one of the biggest insurers in the world, PWC is one of the big four.
None of what I said conspiracy theory material, infact its coming from their own tweets and on their own websites. 
You should stop dismissing me like this and start caring about the fact that bitcoin is being hijacked by corporations. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:00:53
there is no such thing as consensus. bitcoin is adversarial system.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:33:38
lets not forget that bubbles are also formed by people going into debt to speculate on an asset, only to panic sell later and pop the bubble. I want the price to go as high as possible but not with debt money. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:55:12
Please mind your language with me. 
Sidechains and LN are probably  fine solutions, I'm not attacking that. But the possibility that a commercial entity is intentionally fighting onchain scaling for their own gain is very possible. 
Also, bitcoin can scale beyond 1MB especially if done slowly.
Just FYI, I'm personally against segwit2x for but for different reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:51:32

@_date: 2017-11-03 07:50:38
the price of bitcoin has gone side pretty much sideways between December 2013 to December 2016. Expecting it to go vertical for long is idiotic.

0-confirmation is perfectly safe from the payer's side, very slightly risky but mostly safe for a small transaction from the receivers if the receiver is running a full node.
I'm not a recent user of bitcoin. We have used 0-conf transactions for small value transactions without any issue before this mess.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:49:14
are you just trolling me? or is that as intelligent as you get?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:38:59

the price is rising because fools think they will get free coins again
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:33:23


Only if you pay a fee high enough, otherwise with current congestion on the network it will take hours.


What risk? of using visa?
Bitcoin would be instantaneous without the disease of "Replace By Fee", that was added by stupid (or possibly nefarious) developers.
Also, what good is a permission-less payment system if you can't use it for payment, because merchants wont accept it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:06:17
It might. I can't see into the future. But I'm almost certain we will see a brutal correction at some point (probably before 10k) wiping out the ppl that bought at the top and causing suicides among those that went into debt to speculate. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. It is however (like any asset) a wealth transfer mechanism.
Do you have any idea how ridiculous this looks to those that bought in just 2 years ago? Do you honestly think those that bought at 300 are still buying today at 7200??? NO!!! They are the ones quietly selling to those foolish enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:41:26
fees too high to spend on anything other than large puchaces
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:20:38
better to get out of debt. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:01:05
0-confimation for small transactions were ok before "Replace By Fee" code, which opened up the possibility for easy double spends. Bitcoin should go back to that and purge that crap. I guess if we can take care of that then bitcoin (at 1MB blocksize) could work well for small-ish transactions and it might be acceptable to pay higher fees for high value transactions.
Also, Bitcoin in its current isn't form isn't even great for online merchants today, as any merchant accepting would have to hike up their prices to pay for their own costs of moving bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash is 600 usd today. Surely that needs security? I hope you aren't sour about dumping "bCash" so early. 
Edit: sorry that sounded smug, I'm a little sour about dumping it myself.

I'm not shilling. The problem is that you wont have a discussion. Any person discussing anything contrary to somethinng blockstream or core did is immediately branded a troll or a shill.
I think you are the one shilling. Why don't you take the time and at least try to find out if what I'm saying is true? and then have a discussion?
I want Bitcoin to succeed. I don't know who you are shilling for, but I can guess.
  
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:20:34
you are also forgetting that the chain could stall with not enough hash power to churn out new blocks without a DAA or POW change (like someone discussed).
not to mention the large amounts of btc that could be dumped by the miners.
this could still be a shitstorm
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:53:20
Yes, there are many other facets, but we will never get to mainstream  adoption without low enough fees. How you can't see this is beyond me. If you would look into bitcoin's market dominance charts you would see how much bitcoin's market share fell after blocks became full. Merchant adoption actually fell in 2017. This changes bitcoin from a reasonable means of payment to something else. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:29:27

@_date: 2017-09-27 18:42:03
 I'm very sorry you are being ripped off by your ISP. But, you most certainly do not need a full node as a new user. 
We don't need hundreds of thousands of non-commercial nodes. A few thousand full node users will always be available. Not to mention that the very notion of normal users running full nodes is laughable. They barely add anything to the decentralization of the system.
If there is something we should be striving for, its decentralization both development AND of mining power. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:37:47
Ok .I get you, ppl could lose coins because of confusion.
But, What Im really asking is : why the hell aren't miners and developers reaching consensus? Why is there a party insisting on 2mb and another insisting on 1mb!!! 
This is bordering on the insane. I get why bitcoin cash forked off - they didn't agree with segwit from a technical perspective and want much bigger blocks eventually.
But going 1mb to 2m doesn't sound unreasonable.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:39:14
**Greedy miners.** You mean the people you are paying ridiculously high fees to? Because of our tiny 1mb blocks?
Those "greedy miners" are the very reason bitcoin works.
Also, what community do you speak of? There is no community here. We are just a bunch of greedy investors. The whole thing is driven by greed. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:32:06
Ok. I'll trust you, stranger on the internet.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:46:35
Maybe the very idea of consensus is delusional in an adversarial system. I think we will always have forks pushed by one party against another to increase control over the whole thing.
I guess in the end it falls upon the users to vote with their money. And to keep their heads clean of propaganda.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:13:10
I see. So they should group changes together and do them in the minimum amount of hardforks possible. That's a fair point.
But slow transactions and high fees are an issue - the most important issue affecting the usability of bitcoins. And a block size increase is no dangerous move, if only the developers would agree.
 
Its seems to me that the sentiment is just anti-miner. We are against the block size increase because the miners want it?
The miners have the most staked in the ecosystem. They have invested the most in bitcoin, and also gain the most. It is just implausible that they would affect change that would harm bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:11:39
I see. You are talking about accommodating new users that have to download the entire block chain when firing up new nodes? 
If we had the ability to process more on chain transactions, the user base would have been much bigger (cheaper fees) with significant merchant adoption.--- They would be running all the full nodes we would ever need. 
The idea that a significant portion of normal bitcoin users should have a full copy of the block chain doesn't make sense. 
We already have blocks **safely**. And bigger blocks are proven on other currencies. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:28:10
ummmm. yes. Are you ppl not reading r/btc ?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:34:56
I don't know how right you are about this. There is a little experiment going on with 8mb blocks testing your statement right now. Its a little early to say how it will turn out. We will learn a lot from that one.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:17:13
Yes, its wrong, Im saying bitcoin could be better.
No. I'm no fan of MasterCard. 
But LN nodes will give us something very similar to MasterCard. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:30:02
True. But an on-chain solution to scaling is too frightening. What would we do with all that segwit and lightning stuff?
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:13:43
Thanks for this answer. One of the few that actually makes sense.
Do we have experimental data on block propagation time for such large blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:52:17
I'll have to take your for it, for the time being. I haven't been on reddit long enough to know. Although, I fully intend to ask the other side.
You have to understand, to an outsider like me, both sides sound full of shit. It looks to me like now its BlockstreamCoin vs UnknownMinerCoin. You both come off like you have hidden agendas. A non technical user has no way of ascertaining the truth. 
 
Also, what are you saying they are claiming- That anyone can rob a segwit transaction? That's just not plausible.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:00:29

There should never be "agreements" in bitcoin. Its an inherently adversarial system with a very large bounty. 
The forks that happen due to the disagreements that have recently risen give us (the users) the opportunity to vote on the winning chain through price discovery.

its barely usable as currency the way it currently is.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:06:21
but i thought that block size increases have happened before, no? were weren't always at 1mb. 
why don't the developers simply upgrade the client?

@_date: 2017-09-27 18:20:17
That entirely depends on your perception of time and cost with regards to a particular transaction. Bitcoin is today being used to pay for real estate, because thats the type of transaction it works for. 
Also, don't forget, the smaller a transaction is, the less time you would be willing to wait for it.

Someone please explain. Why is this a big deal? Segwit is already here. What difference does it make if we have 1mb or 2mb blocks on bitcoin functionality? If anything, it just increases the transaction capacity. I don't really understand the animosity towards 2x.

Segwit2x logic: lets increase blocksize a little
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:05:39
No. I'm not sure, to be honest.
Although I find most other arguments against bigger blocks nonsensical, the block propagation time problem is a valid argument, when it comes to the need to decentralize mining.
I don't know what the right block size is. I don't think its just 1MB but i don't know what it is.
That being said, I am against the creation of off-chain transactions through third party payment hubs. That type of "solution" can de-incentivize mining, and create third party gate-keepers degrading the permission-less model of bitcoin.

I'm not spewing propaganda nor attacking anyone. All I've done is ask questions. Bitcoin forks is a complicated subject that I'm trying to make sense of. 
I'm asking questions to find out which fork is technically superior and will gain most value. 
Instead of attacking my credibility, why don't you take a minute and say something useful.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:28:26
Its true about "not Satoshivision", but i haven't come across much "anyone can spend" claims. Whats that about? 
And I have to disagree, they do in fact claim that segwit is a poorly written hack that doesn't solve bitcoin's current problems.
Just to be clear, I support both Bitcoins, although I'm mostly buying BCH because I believe its under-valued. 
I do however want to see both chains thrive if possible. And if it turns out that both chains can't co-exist, I think that the decision on which chain prevails will ultimately fall into our collective hands, the users who vote with their money.
