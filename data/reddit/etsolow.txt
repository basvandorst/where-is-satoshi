I understand the GBTC 91:1 split was supposed to happen today. It doesn't seem to have happened yet; will it be after market close, I guess?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:39:46
Like others in this thread, I didn’t see it either. Adding a phone number to my account made it show up.

As I understand it, pre-split a share of GBTC represents ~.091 BTC. Post-split it will be ~.001 BTC/share.

The best time to buy was 2009. The second best time is now.

Check my math but for $500 to turn into $2M he’d have had to buy at under $3/BTC. Color me skeptical.
At any rate, without some basic details no one here would be able to offer much help.

10 mil (USD per BTC)?

How could the app download and the "Umbrel" transactions possibly be related, given that you never used the app or even provided credentials?
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:10:25
I think iPhone apps are sandboxed to prevent that sort of thing, but this whole "unofficial" status is all fishy enough that I've revoked any API access for the app and changed my Coinbase password.
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:15:35
You can [DIY]( if you're so inclined. I imagine that would be the way to go for any extended use, but I thought I'd give the official product a try first.

From the pics it looks beige-ish.

It's like asking what would happen if you sent Bitcoin to your checking account number... it simply won't work.
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:02:46
Back at ya...

How is that a downside? What behavior would you prefer?

Mine will be coming in "early 2014," whatever that means.

...or not.

Sorry, no such thing!
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:26:48
They don't make a big deal of it. It's just an option during checkout. (Coinbase only, I believe.)
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:20:34
Holy... at first I thought the "165B.334514" was some strange Bitcoin pricing format I wasn't familiar with!

I believe it's a response to this lawsuit:

No thanks.

Just another Saturday night, eh?
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:43:43
Yep, I mined for them for a bit before I understood the difference.
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:13:13
That seems to be going around...

Then you're in luck: so far, the Soylent campaign is completely voluntary!

That Twitter account is actually run by the [Organizing for Action staff]( although the president does occasionally tweet from it.

If that were true, QR codes would be totally useless. If you think about it for a moment more, 13,000 is not really quite a lot in this context.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:35:36
You only share your BIP38 encrypted keys.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:59:49
Bitcoin addresses are expressed as a string of [27-34 alphanumeric characters]( QR codes can hold [~4296 alphanumeric characters]( So, yes.

I'll give you one guess.

Scheduling a recurring buy at a set amount of fiat allows you to benefit from dollar cost averaging.

Only one way to find out... let us know when you get your Japanese bank account setup! (Not trying to be a jerk, but that seems like hardest part, right? And the fees at pretty much every step of the way...?)
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:53:16
How would you know if it had?

Buy GBTC in your Roth?
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:50:56
Presumably they are talking about moving crypto that is currently stored on Coinbase.

You can put GBTC in a tax-advantaged account. Roth IRA or whatnot.

If I had just invested $100 in 2011 @ $1/BTC and held until now I’d be pretty happy, too.

We’ve got a pretty clear Batman formation on the GDAX 1-hr charts. Bullish!

For those too lazy to look it up, Soros apparently made a billion dollars in one trade by shorting the British pound.

Fuck. No.

Isn't "it" NOT showing up? (It being your bitcoin balance?)

I don't see how it's possible to get an accurate count of missing coins. How could anyone possibly know if my paper wallet is in a safe deposit box or in a landfill, for example?

Any chance you could expand on this? In the meantime, off to Google.
