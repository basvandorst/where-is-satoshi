I'm fairly certain that "simulating liquidation" without actually going through the regulated way is criminal. Not just "we can sue you for this" but "you go to jail for this".
The only way I could see it being legal is if the enter into contract with enough people that they have money to pay 100% to those refusing. Consider how likely that's going to be.
Edit: Rethinking, realistically, it's not going to be criminal until they refuse to go along with insolvency proceedings (which they don't actually have control over - it's the creditors, that is the people with Bitfinex accounts with funds, that will -via the courts- force insolvency)

No court is going to accept the company just not paying out your balance under some "terms of service" claim. And you don't need a class-action lawsuit. A single creditor not getting paid (after the formalities; claim by registered mail, at least 3 weeks to pay out, court demand to pay up, another time limit on that that I don't know how long is) and the court *will* start insolvency procedings, which is by nature designed to wind down and liquidate the company in a manner that gets creditors a fair split (and not just the initiating suitor).
Now, the company can *probably* stall a bit by paying out the first couple of claims (until money runs out); probably without getting in trouble if there are semi-credible plans to acquire the funds for all the creditors somehow. But that just means there's an incentive to file your claim fast, which means sooner or later formal insolvency *will* happen. And if at that point the payouts were found to be irresponsible given the facts (i.e. they knew they would never pay out to everyone) it might be a criminal matter.

When users are given a choice, do you feel there is any significance to which choice is the default? Or is it absolutely always fine to give users any default, even ones they do not want, as long as they have a choice, somewhere, somehow?
Think about the principles here. Think about how this was communicated to users. Think about what other things these kind of principles can be applied to (e.g. choice of browser, choice of installing third party apps along with the software you downloaded an installer for).
Eyeo is a for-profit company. They could easily be non-profit, but they are not.
And really, what are your thoughts on the selection bias for participating in their survey?

Misinformed. MtGox has never been a counterparty to BTC trade that anyone knows of. If someone puts in $2m worth of buy orders, those orders will stay until someone puts in matching sell orders.

The essence of what he's saying if you don't want to watch the actual video;
"In our country, do we want to allow a means of communication, between people, [...] that we cannot read? And my answer to that question is, no we must not. [...] And if I'm leading the government, [legislation against it] is what you'll get." - David Cameron

Official response at last -  8 accounts accessed, all related to bitcoin. Not much detail on how such a breach was possible in the first place.

So if I sell my bitcoins to you - whether for fiat or some product that you sell - and then claim the coins as stolen, you're fine with no one accepting said coins? What if I tell you that you must pay me back half of what I paid you, or I report the coins stolen?

This should not surprise anyone. Discussion of silk road, and in fact any discussion that might be deemed to be about something breaking the law, is against the rules. Discussing why is against the rules. At best it is hand-waved with a reference to Freenode policies (implying Freenode bans discussion of illegal things, which it does not.)
And yes, it is a matter of some concern. I do not like that the majority of the network uses a client from such people.

You seem to have a political point to make, but disingenuously do so through "what do /you/ think, people I want to turn to anarcho-capitalism?" Why not make your argument directly?
And I think the connection to bitcoin is very tenuous. There's plenty of ways to extract value from someone entirely untraceably already, and that is hardly the weak link in your proposed schemes that stops them from occurring more.

And if he has a reason to keep it secret, that isn't in violation of any laws?

I made 20 bitcoins, went up from 200 to 220.

I like this question in reverse; why is there money in transaction fees *now*? Why haven't miners banded together to exploit hashing dominance *already*? Answering those questions will likely also explain why the future is not as bleak as painted.

It isn't actually. They had an open source version, but had to make a new version, that is closed source, to placate investors.

No idea if it's a real person or not, but I've made money on Bitcoinica. Withdrew what I had with them unrelated to any events, because I didn't feel the expected payoff was worth the risks (of the site disappearing, getting emptied of funds by hackers, or whatnot).
@_date: 2012-03-10 05:53:06
Today, I would estimate about 0.02 BTC median in the blocks mined with transactions. (Some blocks can get a lot more.) Why is that? Why isn't the transaction fees 0? If bitcoin adoption increases (which seem likely) won't the number of transactions (and thus fees), and the value of the bitcoins in the fees, all go up?

If presented the offer right now? I think he would want to mix with "dirty" coins. I mean, he believes in bitcoin, right? The average user don't want to see bitcoin fail, right?
The network effect only works once blacklisting has a majority; at which point everyone will avoid blacklisted coins and everyone who cares will switch to a coin that is more resistant to blacklisting effects.

Aren't you assuming that the price of bitcoin reflects the *current* adoption of it, and not the *expected* adoption of it? It's quite possible that the current price is the *most optimistic* the market will ever be about bitcoin, and thus that the price will never rise significantly above the current level again.
@_date: 2013-08-30 21:14:51
Exchanges have confiscated funds of people who do not want to mail in identification as well. That doesn't make it right. And let's be frank, the network effect is not on your side here. If there is even a fraction of the economy that accepts "tainted" coins, the measures will be largely useless.

Your debate tactic is ugly. This line of thinking is used to attack anything from gay pride parades to feminism to any fringe political view. Hell yes, people will speak up about what they're concerned about, and encourage like-minded people to do the same. There is _nothing_ wrong with doing so.
As for what to expect if EFF actually accepted Bitcoins again, you can check the ledger from when they did  Any suggestions you have for how us normally-EFF-supporting people can pledge bitcoins to EFF are welcome, but until you have any decent ways for us to disprove your accusations, they're just baseless slander.

If there is a blacklist of "stolen" coin, anyone can threaten to put coins they've spent on said blacklist, and demand a portion of their coins back from the seller as blackmail. Up to and beyond falsifying "proof" of police reports, or even giving false testimony to the police. Not that even that would be needed for someone who wishes to remain anonymous or for other reasons can't defend themselves against false charges.
@_date: 2013-01-19 18:51:35
That's not what EFF says. Those are your words. Speculation, which you have to resort to exactly because the EFF only have that one singular post on the topic, which multiple people have written about the flaws of. If the EFF thinks Bitcoin doesn't align with their goals, they should say so, rather than let their statements - that comes across as misdirection if not lies considering their support and endorsement of Tor - in that post you linked stand.
Most people that support and endorse Bitcoin also support and endorse EFF's work and ideals. Which is why this move was so bewildering.

Indeed, bitcoin was never anonymous automatically, this just reveals more information about those that didn't go for (or failed at using the right tools and precautions for) anonymity.

They were perfectly willing to go on the line for Tor, going so far as to publicly run their own nodes and stating they did so because they believe Tor /should be/ legal. I don't buy that angle at all.
And the constant stonewalling after their poorly-thought out post a year and a half ago indicates there's  more to it as well. There's been no clarifying follow-ups after all the criticism of it and their decision, no response to questions about it, at least two AMAs where they've ignored the topic. This despite that they know perfectly well they are losing donations because of it.
