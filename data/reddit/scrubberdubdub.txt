Bitcoin’s stable for now, sure... but it can drop like a rock in seconds whenever it feels like it. Make sure you never blink and you’re constantly refreshing your charts so you know when it’s time to start *screaming*

I’m not sure why, but if I were to take a guess I’d say scammers usually stop when the opportunity dries up and thieves usually stop when they think they’ll get away with it... probably one reason or the other or maybe a combination of both

Well when you’ve invested a percentage of your wealth into something your only choices are to either feverntly believe, live in fear or cut your losses... so I can understand it.
It’s not really such a bad thing to believe in either considering how crazy the world is becoming, but I really wish if people were actually concerned with wealth distribution and political issues they’d actually take action to make a difference in that space, because no difference is being made here.

lol not saying I agree with this tax he’s talking about, but I can’t think of a single person that’s worth $100M+ that actually earned it. At best some of them got thrust into a privileged role that benefitted others above them (like movie stars, musicians, etc) but most super wealthy (and even moderately wealthy) people made their money ripping off the hard work of others, whether it’s through some business or financial structure. If anyone exists that’s genuinely worth that kind of money they are probably too humble to ever capitalize on their existence

Ughhh. Wake up, the only ones spinning the narative were those trying to sell you on bitcoin in the first place **because they want to make money selling you nothing.**
Use your brain... do you really think a few random Reddit posters have set out to bring down bitcoin with negativity for zero gain... or do you think those making literal billions off this nonsense love it that people like you believe in the *FUD* narrative that diverts attention away from them and their profits?
It’s real basic logic dude... you just follow the money to see who the real bad guy is, not hard.

@_date: 2018-03-30 03:31:48
That’s just the fomo talking, slow down and breathe girl!
A true bottom would be sub $1k somewhere, back where it was before the 2017 heavy price manipulation kicked off. If it doesn’t drop at least that low then you’re still playing the whale’s game and are at risk of a hell of a lot more heartache 
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:52:42
If he’s in the hundreds of millions he is. Coming up with an idea and having other people execute it for you is only profitable because of the corrupt financial systems that are designed around profitting those who are willing to manipulate others for personal gain. There isn’t a modern multimillionaire that exists that would still do so if the 99% weren’t forced into positions to build their wealth for them.

@_date: 2018-03-10 04:31:16
By investing in bitcoin you are just doing what your oppressors are doing to you - you’re claiming ownership over something that you’re expecting will be in high demand later on so you can sell it off/use it for your profit at another’s loss. This is not how you beat your oppressors, this is just another one of their systems and that’s why it will fail you. Stop letting greed rule you and work for your freedom

99% of ‘FUD’ is people trying to warn you this market is dead and with every purchase you’re just feeding the whales.

No one knows? Do you really think those behind the exchanges and major mining ops have no clue what’s going on? Let me garuntee you something - up or down, those guys are only ever going to profit unless an exit scam suits their purposes. Don’t act like nobody knows just because Reddit is clueless
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:50:47

@_date: 2018-03-27 10:53:01
Because it’s worth nothing, useless and has very little public interest. It’s also owned by the few, suffers a variety of tax and legal issues depending where you are and is propped up by an unreliable support network of 3rd party randoms that only have their potential profits in mind.

Uhh bitcoin supports those same crooks, the only difference is your fiat is at risk of ending up in someone else’s bank account besides your own.

Problem is these defining features have created an open market that’s even easier for scammers, thieves and market manipulators to take your money from you with very little to sometimes no risk or repercussion. At least with centralization you know somewhat who’s resposible... whereas crypto is basically a decentralized scam platform where fraudsters can legitimately fleece you in creative ways.
Also the trustless thing is a lie... not only is there even more trust required for transactions because there is no way to recover lost funds, but all it takes is for a coin to lose profitability, value and hash power and your entire life savings could be turned to dust in a 51% attack. At least you can trust society’s current financial infrastructure is the same one the rich rely on to be rich... if that collapses then we will have a lot more to worry about then how our portfolios look
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:12:46
Um you’re not listening. The same people ‘ruining’ it are the same ones that pumped it up in the first place... it was never worth $20k... it was never even worth $2k. $1k was were people saw value in the currency for making illicit purchases and illegal trades, but those folk have moved on to other options. You’re not buying into an investment or commodity here, you’re buying into someone’s game...
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:32:47
Don’t act like you’re part of a movement or making any difference to the world, you’re just another guy who dropped a few hundred on a trend hoping to get rich.
... and for that to happen you do need favours. If serious government attention is drawn to crypto then you don’t want them seeing the space as a place for scams and pointless speculation, otherwise it’ll just end up in the too hard basket and regulated/banned.
Don’t act like you don’t trust either... bitcoin is wholly built on trusting a few. You’re trusting the whales won’t steal all of your money, that exchanges aren’t pumping and wash trading for their own benefit, that miners give a shit beyond profit, that malicious actors (or even wallet producers) won’t just allieviate or lose all of your crypto forever... there’s a lot of trust going on that you’re pretending doesn’t exist mate
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:58:27
Honestly why are people still buying? The whales are stalling the crash so they can collect your money on the way down. Just let it get to the bottom you dopes, then if you’re really still interested in wasting your money you can throw it away then
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:09:16

If I am to take a guess I believe the value will be intentionally lowered to near-nothing and sit there for a few months, but then be followed with some big tech announcement alongside a massive pump that will see all the people that missed/lost out on last year’s surge flock to bitcoin one last time for fomo. It’s the only way I can imagine large amounts of new money returning to the currency

How about you name one positive thing for me first, and I’ll give my opinion on why it’s a load of bs... and I personally can’t name a better altcoin because I still view all of crypto under the same blanket... there’s nothing in this ‘market’ that’s overly breaks away from the bitcoin mold at the moment, unless you’re someone who makes illicit and illegal trades... a lot of drug users or tax/gov evaders can tell you which coins they prefer and why

You laugh but bitcoin died with mt gox and then was resurrected by schemers that saw an easy way to profit from desperate people.
I don’t think it’ll ever go to zero btw, and I’d be surprised if it ever fell as low as $100... but at the same time it’s not impossible to believe one day a novelty tech like bitcoin will be forgotten.

It’s ironic because it’s this self-serving, lazy attitude that has left these people needing something like bitcoin in the first place. Instead of making real sacrifice for a better future they always take the (seemingly) easy option presented before them and then wonder why they end up with less for it.... they are too dumb to realise that as long as they are willing to capitalise on someone else’s life then there’s always going to be bigger fish capitalise on them.

I’m not claiming anything, I’m informing those bright enough to listen - bitcoin’s 2017 price surge is the result of manipulation and it’s continued ‘stability’ and ‘growth’ is the result of the same.
There’s no significant new money coming in that isn’t being swallowed up.

It’s stupid advice even if you can consider it advice at all. People only say that with these pyramid-like schemes because they need your new money to grow their investment, but want to avoid any of the guilt or responsibility if you’re the one who loses out.
When people say stupid shit like “only invest what you can afford to lose” you should stay away because it’s an obvious sign of shit times to come when they can’t even fake belief in what they’re selling you.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:16:01
Belief in general is bad... it’s just a word people use to justify their wishful thinking. The basis for people’s ‘belief’ in bitcoin has proved fraudelant so far... for example it failed as a currency, is useless as a store of value, is not decentralized, is not outside taxation or government control, is not beyond the control of financial institutions, is not a secure or safe method of storing/distributing wealth, is not free from manipulation, etc.
What you’re calling belief is just what people use as justification for spreading these sorts of lies. People say they believe and spread this sort of shit not because they believe, but because they *know* they need more people to adopt to this system so that they can make money. The system itself may be structured differently but the actions and language of the ‘adopters’ is no different to that of your average ponzi pusher. Just look at any Ponzi scheme’s affiliates and you’ll see the exact same form of belief you see here

The problem with that argument is that you’ve got to make up your mind whether you see it as an alterable protocol or an immutable object worth purchasing, it can’t be both. You don’t buy a tcp/ip or a http, you buy devices and services that use those protocols. If it’s really just a protocol for sending and receiving value there are already much better options available and without a doubt even better options will emerge in the future...
... but if you want to see it as an object then it’s easier to go back to the phone anology. Sure, the 3310 could still be used but there’s also a hundred million of them in landfill... and you sure as hell aren’t using one to reply to my post right now.

You’ve been tricked into thinking that bitcoin is an evolutionary technological concept like that of a phone or the internet or whatever but it’s not... blockchain/crypto is the concept and bitcoin is a Nokia 3310 - as great as it is eventually it’s going to be made obselete by something that utilizes the concept in a more efficient and applicable way...

That’s moronic. Production costs need to be weighed against the value of the object being produced as they don’t add value but only subtract from it. If the production cost outweighs the value of the product the product isn’t worth producing and will cease to exist.

Why do you archive this guy? Clearly he is just doing this for attention and you’re giving it to him...
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:07:50
Lol if bitcoin needs government regulation there’s no point to it existing any more as you might as well just stick to fiat... surely this is not a hard concept to understand...

I wonder at what point does a hodler realise they spent tens of thousands making rich men richer and only recieved a *token of appreciation* in return...

Almost perfect technical analysis but you forgot option 4 - none of the above. It’s not the most effective of strategies when it comes to growing your portfolio but for a lot of newcomers to the crypto scene it’s likely the right choice.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:56:40
lol no it doesn’t. Anyone can say “if this happens, then this will happen but if this happens this will happen unless this happens in which case this will happen”...

You should of listened to your grandpappy when he used to tell stories about the great bitcoin depression of ‘45... when the local mine collapsed he was forced to sign up to the state forum and beg for satotishis just to feed his fam. Still got the wallet address tattooed on his wrist he does

It’s not hard to understand... the price is purely the result of manipulation and has been since $1k

I like how your trolling went from telling people the hard truth to telling them what they want to hear as the market keeps collapsing around them... it’s more amusing this way
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:33:29
I’m only responding because you spent the time to write all that.
If you really want to pretend this market isn’t at the mercy of the few and keep on believing the tired sales pitch of “trustless” then go for it, it’s your fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:27:54
All you did is use a lot of words to say nothing. I don’t even care if you be honest or lie to me, but give me a simple, straight answer - for the record are you wealthy from your crypto investments?

Honestly can’t see bitcoin surviving for years into the future... even half a decade away I can see it as being a relic when compared to whatever technology we have then.

If it ever goes under $100 again I’ll buy a handful just for laughs. It’ll be a great conversation piece with all those that dreamt of lambos

While I agree that most people who are going to get in already are, that 8% figure is bullshit. They surveyed 2k people... I bet I could find a pool of 2k people where 0% have crypto, and another where 30% do pretty easily

Maybe it’s an inside joke with the market manipulators that the moon landing was a hoax but everyone will believe it anyways....
.... but more likely it’s just that flying to the moon represents an achievement whereas landing on the sun represents burning and instant death.

All the billionaire exchange owners thank you for your kind donations

I love how people in finance come up with all this bs terminology to make it seem like they understand some complex, intricate system. Inverse head and shoulder, red candles, bull runs, dips, buy walls, bear traps... it’s really quite embarrassing to think people take this crap seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:56:56
That’s exactly what I’m taking about.... the market’s become another tool for fleecing money from suckers who buy in unaware. I don’t agree there is much of an ongoing supply of new money left though... it’s mostly only hopeful traders and desperate hodlers trickling in their meager paychecks now... if there’s more than 3 months left before it goes sub $1k I’d be surprised.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:56:28
Haha don’t speak truth, you’ll upset people. I would not be surprised though if prostitutes adopted crypto in a big way, as I can imagine a lot of the types of people that dream of lambos would also pay for physical intimacy.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:49:58
Hmmm but dude people made the crazy unrealistic predictions that bitcoin would hit $50-100k this year and that nonsense cost gullible people hundreds of millions yet I don’t see you holding them accountable. At least this kind of prediction is aimed at helping people...

Young Whaleling: Sir, the internet is depressed, we have no new money coming in... what do we do?

@_date: 2018-03-25 14:49:23
lol no it doesn’t... this is just a myth spawned because every time bad news appeared the exchanges closed down/pumped bitcoin to make it look like it’s unstoppable. It’s not some rapidly evolving creature; it’s design is flawed, it’s development stagnated and it is at the mercy of the few
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:21:13
lol be dismissive all you want, fact is unless you’re a daytrader that’s been making lucky gambles, if you listened to the ‘fud’ over the last 3 months you’d be financially better off... the same is true for 70% of now broke-ass investors if they listened to the last 12 months of ‘fud’... and pretty soon that’ll be 75%, 80%.... 99%. :)
... but go on playing it so damn internet *cool* while you’re spreading that sweet fomo... I’m sure there’s a lambo waiting at the end for all your efforts and not an empty bank account.

That’s a dumb question with a simple answer - if a horse stops being an animal it also stops being a vehicle, but if it stops being a vehicle it doesn’t stop being an animal. If this is what the internet age views as an interesting philosophical question then spaghetti monster help us all

Maybe bitfinex has already wash traded enough tether for btc and now they are just sacrificing some of their btc for fiat to build up their bank accounts for the audit 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:13:21
It’s not. There’s nothing good about bitcoin... no one can say a positive thing about it without a counter argument quickly shutting them down, that’s why they just use religious terminology like ‘believe’.

Yeah he’s just saying what people in the crypto space want to hear... he stands gain everything but lose nothing with a statement like this. If bitcoin fails he can make any excuse and walk away, or even coerce people into adopting a newer, ‘better’ alternative that is even more profitable for him.

There’s always resistance, then a pump/dump cycle leading to a further crash and a new level of resistance

Top 3 places to hide your bitcoin seed -
1. Under the first 24 letterboxes in your street
2. Shave your dog and tattoo it on it’s body
3. During a random funeral place it in an open casket.

Bitcoin makes sense once you realize the market is totally manipulated to the benefit of a small pool of individuals and anyone else involved is at risk of losing their hard earned money. That’s why there is no pattern... every time the investors do something or expect something the market is manipulated in the opposite direction, it’s that simple.
