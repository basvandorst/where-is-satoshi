I can tell you're giving constructive criticism and i appreciate that. But I just don't understand how to do it with just BTC/LTC for some reason.
Every time I try, my brain is like "we're NOT DOING IT THIS WAY" 
I'm self taught so maybe it just hasn't been taught to me properly.

At .015 I passed the ball to prepare for it to hit .011
At .011 I passed the ball to prepare for it to go back up, which it will.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:09:41
I feel it.
I go for a $1,000 trade and it comfirms at $990 because it changed by the time I type out the 0's and hit enter. 
Coinbase has no conversion fees so I've just been doing lower numbers and only making the trades when it's a good jump.
I'm being told by a lot of people I'm getting lucky. Ok. Probably. Yeah. But a lucky dollar is worth just as much as a calculated dollar lol

you can instant profit and repeat if you like .78% return i guess.
I like 6%.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:00:58
False, it affects their value ratio to eachother
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:33:00
The only way I'll get screwed is if ltc or btc absolutely tanks and never comes back up.
I just dont see it happening, and if it does, I am out a lot more than this little trading game I do allows.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:42:53
why? This builds my portfolio though...??
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:13:50
that happens all the time. When that happens, I go into it even more.
If it drops more, I go into it even more.
It will come back up.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:43:39
why? Doesn't this BUILD my inventory? there are on fees to convert, so....how don't see how i could lose out..?
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:35:17
I take liberty when I want
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:08:14
oh i never do everything.
I usually do 6% of what I hold, and then goal 6% increase.
and if it skyrockets to .05BTC, I only moved 6% of my holdings out, it's piddly numbers in comparison.
Safe, easy, profitable
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:49:22
uuuuuh ok yeah i guess at I am using $ as a measure of quantity in my trades, and it helps me keep an eye on the ratio in a way i understand.
But don't tell me to forget about USD prices, i'm using them as my measure of quantity. And i understand it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:40:40
Dude good for you that's awesome! I hope it pays out more than you expect in the end!
oh yeah dude this shit is never going to see fiat again
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:35:35
It is true; but I overthink and forget which way the profitable trade is supposed to go every 2 weeks and then worry about my math and whether I've actually Lost the $1,000 i'm bragging about or gained it.
I've screenshotted another poster's explanation and just gonna stair at it in 2 weeks from now lol.
Yall are pretty salty in here. Almost everyone is wishing me terrible luck and trying to bring my attitude down. I just made the $1,000 LTC/BTC trade, i'll let you know when it hits the .016 and I move it back ;)
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:28:40
I hope that works out for you, man :)
I put 10% of my weekly income into BTC so if it works for you it will work for me.
I like to play with small $100's of dollars for fun though. it's exciting. Even if i lose it's not by enough to worry about
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:34:56
have i profitted in the past 1 hour since my initial trade from BTC to LTC?
Looks like it's gone up .79% so far. 
I'll be holding out for a larger return in a few days when the ratio gets closer to together lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:13:44
i like 6% though,
It's such a sexy number
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:10:39
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:11:01
Proof is in the pudding
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:27:36
ok, i end up with more btc...but I do end up with MORE. I'm not LOSING anything by this pattern...yeah?
if i do it backwards, I lose out on....something
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:01:21
oh god thank you this was so refreshing.
It has been fairly volatile I agree, but I predicted the .012 low in May, and the subsequent .018 in may, and I think it's going to get down to .0115 in the next few days here.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:53:01
i'm $1,000 up as I make small $200 trades with a goal of 6% growth.
The most I ever stand to "Lose" is $200. And that's in quotes because my money remains in the crypto market regardless.
I haven't lost anything yet.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:39:35
salty boy.
Just wanted to make sure it was LTC to BTC and not BTC to LTC.
I confuse myself from time to time by over thinking it. Just wanted a little assist there.
I could season my eggs with the amount of salt in this sub
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:23:27
once I was affirmed that this was the appropriate move given the scenario I detailed, I went ahead and made the trade.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:25:35
well the ratio is provided, should be enough, right? if 1 ltc is .0115 btc, and then 1ltc is .016 btc, that should be enough to know the calculation?
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:11:25
"pays out" in the context I was using is a common figure of speech meaning that something achieves the greatness you are expecting of it, not to literally pay USD out of it.
