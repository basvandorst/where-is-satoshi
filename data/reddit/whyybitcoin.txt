I tell people all the time, you don't know about Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:37:50
I don't even use Coinbase but I'm signing up just so I can give 'em shit :p

Now I know mass adoption is inevitable -_-

April 20th 16:20 is a good time for the halvening :)

$533.78 if you're a BCH :p

You're right, It doesn't have to, But it will. Bitcoin will eventually expose all the inefficiencies within banks and government to the point we'll stop using or interacting with them anymore

Shit like this isn't celebrated enough in the community. 
This is key infrastructure. 
Yes we are going to the moon, we're going in a rocket. But before the rocket we are going to need a rocket launchpad :)

Correct, it's always been about the tech :)

I don't get it? Wherever I can post a QR code I can accept Bitcoin. This includes my twitch profile. I don't need permission or the "nod" to go ahead. Or is this really about "OMG, I can accept Bitcoin that I can now instantly turn to fiat" To that I say "fuck fiat". I post QR codes for more hodl in my life not fiat, but yah know maybe this is because I'm in this for the tech :P

Well said, I never thought about it that deep before. Bitcoin will drive the market for clean cheap energy. This is really interesting, Bitcoin will force countries to compete with one another for cheap clean energy. 
"There's too much bullshit in oil, and we need this Bitcoin to enrich our nation, now what's the cheapest way possible?"
Bitcoin: First the banksters, then the oil barons
Buying land at possible renewable sites is an idea :)

Oh yeah, lemme just give you this private key I've been hodling on to with all my Bitcoin on it. Get the fuck outta here. 
The only person I trust in the Bitcoin universe is me. Everything else, I verify :)
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:39:29
Hodling is a way of life
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:58:29
It's not that I don't care, I care very deeply about Bitcoin. This was always a long term game. Bitcoin is going to change the way we have traded for centuries and on top of that, level the playing field for everyone which has never been done before. This is more than about gains and losses, I could argue the point that the future of the human race depends on Bitcoin. I knew this back in 2013, all I see is people crying who dipped their toe in Bitcoin December 2017. Bitcoin is much bigger than your profit loss. You know the funny thing is I actually bought in at the 2013 $250 top and watched it go down to like $90. Do you know what I did? I bought more, why? Because I believed in this technology (know that Bitcoin is a technology first and foremost) and it's potential of freeing the human race. We are all enslaved in a prison we cannot see, taste or touch.
Well... Not me... Not anymore
Fuck your profit loss, it's about freedom!
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:13:52
Mate... I've been in this space since 2013, this means fuck all to me. Just another dip on Wednesday 14th November 2018 so the fuck what!
Wake me up when Bitcoin dips below $200
I doubt it, all this is... is fluff til we get to the moon.
Anyone who is crying, is in this short term and will probably sell next time we hit $20,000.
Then cry again when in that same bull run we blow past $80,000. Ain't none of y'all here for the tech all you want is to get fiat rich! You're gonna die fiat poor.

If you think about it, there was never a "ban" in Iran. Just because you say so, it doesn't make it so

I think in these days and times its a little naive to believe that the tax you pay makes a difference. The government through the central bank prints way too much money for whatever services they offer. Collecting tax off you at this point is a formality and not really needed.
Also Bitcoin is a brand new system you can't use the old tax tax system within this one. We need something new. Personally I believe taxes should be voluntary. If the government chose to be open and transparent about where tax money is spent, and I can see my money at work and not just used to kill people in another country I'd happily drop them a few satoeshis.
I've seen many posts about taxation and Bitcoin. It baffles me how much people want to pay tax, you can pay my share if you like :p
Road builders build the roads not politicians. A politician is a middleman and I thought Bitcoin was about cutting out middlemen.
Point is we can fund the road builders directly now.

In the mean time if I was a US citizen, I'd continue to hodl. There needs to be a better system in place. As a hodler I was the one that took the risk. If the risk fell flat that's on me but now because the risk pays off I'm still technically punished for it, by paying X amount of taxes on a purchase. Back in 08 the banks took massive amounts of risk it falls flat and they still get rewarded! 
This is precisely Whyy Bitcoin :D
Thankyou for answering my original question :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:22:14
I know hodling isn't taxable. How can you get, what you cannot reach. "Your arms are too short to box with god" - Bitcoin vs Gov lulz
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:16:38
Tax in general is not fair, a system you're born into with no say. I love Bitcoin for many reasons, one of them being we could one day have a system of voluntary tax. Who's against this? And why are we not building this now? I will hodl up to this point if I have to :D
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:31:36
This is wishful thinking
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:11:32
I'm not a US citizen but I'm curious to know. If I have lots of Bitcoin I bought years ago at a fraction of today's prices and now it's really valuable, if I spend not sell Bitcoin into the economy, are there any taxes involved in this process?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:59:22
true dat. I'm a big fan of choices, Bitcoin gives me choices and hopefully spawn even more choices in the future :)

Next time can we have a picture of a happy cat sat on top of a Lambo? I still like to dream during the dips :p

Dat Bitcoin doe :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:09:12
How the hell do I work that out, it's not like a kept receipts of my Bitcoin purchases?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:18:08
It's not about hodling forever. It's about hodling to the day you can SPEND Bitcoin everywhere as easily as fiat today. I'm never gonna sell my Bitcoin but I'll spend the fuck out of it :)
@_date: 2019-09-04 00:29:52
Dats right!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:41:06
Is hodling taxable? Why do I feel this could be the case one day. I'm grateful for all the answers I got, they've not been very likeable though.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:08:52
I predict moon! I have trouble with the 'when' part though
@_date: 2018-07-28 01:22:53
If this was 2011 I'd of given you enough for 4 bchs. But right now I'm hodling
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:33:58
I didn't get in this Bitcoin shit to sell. I got in this to spend. In my mind, one day everyone accepts Bitcoin. It is at this point I'll be cracking open my Bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:27:11
hahaha needs more upvotes
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:28:34
Even if Bitcoin died tomorrow it still would of been worth it. The sheer amount of laughter I had gotten from this technology. Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:49:30
I think you misunderstood me friend. I'm talking about the technology of Bitcoin. If it didn't exist in today's world neither would all the fun memes, videos and comments exist along side it.
Also people were losing money long before Bitcoin came along. I never lost a dime you know why.... because HODL that's why :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:46:34
If you're in Bitcoin and still think like this then...
You don't know about Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:14:28
You only lose money when you sell. What part of hodl do you not understand? Real hodlers know it's not about selling Bitcoin at 20k, 30k, 40k+. It's about one day you'll wake up and find the bank is closed and there is no telling when they'll open back up, and if they do I wouldn't expect to see all your money there, maybe some. In the meantime hodlers will have Bitcoin to spend and a bank being closed means fuck all to the functionality of the Bitcoin network.
