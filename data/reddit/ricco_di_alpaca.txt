In the worst case scenario your transaction being sent to the non-LN adopter is simply the close channel transaction.  You just close the channel and send the proceeds to the destination.

It's possible he did hire a hitman.  It's also entirely possible someone else had access to the account and hired a hitman.  It's possible the whole thing was fabricated.  It's very convenient that none of these supposed hits were actually done as well, which makes me think that there was absolutely nothing to it, and either an FBI agent had access to the account, or just the whole story was made up.

The only trigger in a UASF is a flag date.  If the economic majority is following the tighter rules, then any miner who follows a maliciously mined block would end up with coins that had less value than on the UASF side.
A reluctant mining community could keep this chain alive, but would be giving up revenue by doing so.  Economics would drive profit-driven miners to the UASF side, and thus leave the non-UASF side subject to reorganization.
Without economic support, miners would be best to ignore the UASF chain, although it could survive as a minority alt-coin chain for users who really wanted to use it.

No, they are overridden if blocks are produced, nothing to do with "votes".


Miners are free to produce any size blocks they want, regardless of the signalling.


Not just China, but all partners.  Your post really doesn't address any of the issues - they have the vast majority of supply of ASICs going out, and can control who gets them.  He will only give supply to those loyal to him.
F2Pool is avoiding signalling specifically to stall.  This is the beauty, try to drive BU slightly ahead of SegWit, and leave the rest undecided.  You'll notice AntPool took until recently to shift over (after SegWit started gaining ground).  The whole thing is a show, simply so they can pretend to be waiting, when in reality, they know they can't force  BU on users who don't want it (ideal case for BitMain since it hands control of Bitcoin to miners), and it stalls SegWit.  By being "undecided", F2pool can try to get favors or concessionos for support.


Seeing how many BU nodes are run on AWS sybils, and how few posters there really are posting about BU, shows how little support it actually has.  Look at the price on Bitfinex, it's sub-$200.  It's a joke and completely fake support, and just a way for BitMain to strongarm.  Jihan knows it's shit code, but needs something to oppose Core so that privacy is stifled, and fees come right to him (Antpool collects all the tx fees and does not pay miners, so he loves high fees!)  Jihan and Bitmain are very likely culprits behind the spam attack, designed  to drive tx fees higher than they otherwise would be.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:56:06
They actually have.  Previous soft fork proposals had various stages of activation.  If I remember correctly, there was  soft fork that required a new block version to be specified.  At some level of support, it allowed old block versions.  And at a later level, it would deliberately orphan the old block versions.  I'm a bit fuzzy on the details on this one, but it's a similar approach.

Bug riddled code and broken systems are not valid options.


Except Core cannot control consensus.

There is no deferring to Core.  There is deferring to the Bitcoin network, which enforces a limit on coins, a target for block time, and a max block size.  One does not have the power to change this.


If blocks are too large to validate, you cannot enforce a soft fork as a user.


So what is useful about this signal? 
What is useful from a random node signaling anything?


I believe you mean SegWit.  ANd yes, it's a soft fork, but the consensus falls entirely within the original consensus rules. It takes away no use cases and only adds meaning.  Not even close to comparable.

There are far more options than BU and Core.  You could use btcd, or bcoin or NBitcoin or any of the other options out there.  You could leave the network and use Ethereum or Monero or Dash or Dogecoin or Litecoin.


Yes, until users can no longer reject them (as BU enables).


Exactly.  Why would they give a shit?  If they did give a shit, why wouldn't I sybil attack?


Core provides code that is compatible with the rules that have been around since the beginning.  Changing that requires consent of everyone.

Exchanges, especially crypto-to-crypto exchanges have a low barrier to entry and anyone can compete.  When all the exchanges backed ETHF vs. ETC, a lone exchange emerged offering ETC.  ETC then became listed at major exchanges.
In the end, exchanges must provide what customers want or they will go elsewhere.  But in the case of a UASF, miners have every incentive to simply avoid a chain split to begin.

You can do all of those things without something like OB, and most of the time without Bitcoin.  Sorry, I'm going to trust Amazon as an arbitrator more than some random guy I meet for OB.  Sometimes middlemen serve useful purposes.
None of the problems you mention need a solution like OB to succeed.  It's just one of the issues when you have strangers engaging in commerce.  Instead of PayPal freezing funds, you just have some random OB escrow agent doing it.  You are thinking of the problem in terms of the seller, but buyers will buy where they please.  Bitcoin and OB don't make previously impossibile things possible.  That should be your first sign that it's solving a problem no one cares about more than anything useful, otherwise it would have been done without the Bitcoins.

Miners playing stupid games in a power struggle against users is the problem.


It allows users  to be on completely different chains, which is completely fucking useless. You might as well have someone using Dogecoin and someone else using Litecoin, and trying to transact.

It still is.  Who do you think is pushing these fork attempts?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:32:15
I do like this proposal.  I would feel much more confident about this if wallets were able to correctly detect a possible chain split.  Are you aware of any wallets that are able to detect substantially deep forks that may be valid?  For, if a chain split occurred due to a minority of miners orphaning non-SegWit blocks, it would be nice if a warning appeared to recognize that there was an alternative chain appearing, and my chain was at a higher risk than normal of being reorganized.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:55:45
No one is destroying a coin, a chain is just orphaned because it no longer has the most work.  This is what happened when BIP66 had miners accidentally mine an invalid chain with the new rules when they were SPV mining.


A soft fork cannot become a hard fork.  Perhaps you should read my first article that explains the differences:
If a chain split occurs, I would expect the users on the non-forked side to immediately hard-fork if they want to ensure they don't ever get orphaned.

Weak hands fold.

This is true.
Core really can't do much other than offer an option to people.
BU takes that option and hands it to miners.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:42:01
It's unclear if they are actually backing the BU attack  Keeping capital controls in place definitely is a priority.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:12:54
I don't think this is always true.  Imagine that mining became so centralized that the PBoC could veto any transaction not registered and approved by them.  In that case, a split would be far preferable.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:23:52
I can verify it and have sources.  I just cannot disclose it.  I want to be able to detect if they ever do switch to BU.

BU does not have an AD=infinity mode.

Core isn't involved.  The exchanges are the ones who would want to move forward.  Right now they are paying quite a bit in fees and would benefit greatly from SegWit.  If they feel like they would not benefit from SegWit and would like to continue paying high fees, they can support the status quo.

It doesn't need to be a well funded mining attack.  It simply occurs whenever the value of Bitcoin is higher than Bitcoin Unlimited, or the mining rewards are greater due to increased transaction fees.  It does not need to be done secretly.  It can be completely in the open.

It's flexible in that miners fight each other to the death through orphaning to get a winner.  If you thought 0-conf being unsafe was bad, wait until 3, 5, 7, 10, 1000-conf is unsafe.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:27:02
But if there is a split, one side is vulnerable to annihilation, and one is not, so if the economy even is close to divided on it, it's extra pressure on miners.  Price will drive miners.  Miners also would hate to see a split if they can avoid it, and this is an easy way out.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:01:33
Miner signalling is far from a guarantee of being accurate from whether they will actually enforce a rule.  When BIP66 was introduced, it had 75% miners signalling.  However, miners weren't actually checking and it was not enforced and some miners got forked off following the wrong chain.  This is no different.

Both extension blocks and soft-hard forks fall under the soft-fork label, at least in terms of chain re-orgs.  As far as functionality, that's a different animal and just a different dimension in a matrix.

I've always liked this chart.  However, I think this chart would make more of a matrix (you can do any of the above cases with any of the mechanisms (hard/soft would only cover some subset of each)).  I believe these are two different dimensions to compare - a chain split may occur, and depending on your chart, one may be the alt-coin and one may not, for example, but it depends on what the change was and what the economy supports.

Both sides would suffer from slow confirmation times in say a 75/25 split.
Bitcoin would be crippled for a few weeks, then adjust.  A few weeks is sufficient time to show the economic majority backing the split (or not), which would bring hashpower back once they realize they can make more mining it.
Incentives will drive miners to the correct chain, even if it's reluctantly, and after some delay.  And it will be a lesson moving forward, making the case for Bitcoin far more bullish than ever.

It doesn't need to be calculated.
SegWit is uncontroversial to any non-attacker or person under attackers influence.  It is opt-in, it is well tested, and optional for miners.  It is trivial to protect yourself as a miner or user against.  Most miners likely already have such defenses in place.
A better question to ask is, why would any of the economy actively go against an optional, opt-in feature.  And my answer to that is, if they would, they don't belong in Bitcoin - they are authoritarian assholes who wish to rule Bitcoin, and if it causes a chain split, then good riddance.

They provide suggestions, that are overridden due to accept depth and sticky gates.


There is no voting.  There is a suggestion box.  There's a big difference.  A vote is binding.  A suggestion box just asks nicely, and if ignored, does nothing.


The votes miners signal are in no way binding.  They could completely violate this.  In fact, the incentive for miners IS to completely ignore their own signal and just mine on the longest chain for greatest chance of getting a reward.


Sorry you are blind to this.  They are playing the community.  This pretend division, which  is really a handful of holdouts and astroturfing  sockpuppets standing in the way, is a way for miners to pretend the issue is not settled, and then milk us all for high fees.  You are being played.
You shouldn't blame miners for a problem that isn't unique to miners, and BU proponents shouldn't blame core developers for a problem that isn't coming from core developers. That just pisses people off and extends the conflict.
I don't.  I blame core for stupidly putting it in the miners hands and not having a UASF from the start.

The goal of this BIP is to allow it to activate for users even without them having to upgrade to BIP148-enforcing nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:18:52
It reduces the likelihood of distributed consensus in any decentralized environment and makes the currency less usable. Different users with different configurations will see different states. Users will see frequent reorganizations if they ever are in a configuration different from the majority of the hashpower.
It takes away powers from users in being able to validate (miners have no leash to produce blocks that cannot be validated).  It has no bounds on costs to operate a node, which will lead to fewer users running nodes, thus fewer checks on miners who may want to do things like double-spend, inflate coins, or just plain steal coins.
It leads to miner centralization (either to coordinate, or through large conglomerates intentionally making hard to validate blocks in order to push small miners off the network.
It's a truly insane policy with no clear goals.  We've asked Peter Rizun about what it even is trying to accomplish and he never even bothers to answer.  It's clear whatever they are, just about any solution would be better than EC nonsense.

It depends if its a soft or hard fork. If it's a soft fork with the majority enforcing, any miner who mines a block that is invalid in the new rules (but valid in the old) eventually gets orphaned by the old rule nodes.  In a hard fork, the new rules will cease to exist without the majority.
Yes, a chain split may have zero users or value.


This sounds a bit like fud.  If there were some type of catastrophic bug, the best bet is to go before the bug showed its behavior, introduce a soft fork to fix it, and let that chain be orphaned.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:04:26


Exactly, BU hands over user control/auditing to miners.


Same kind of analogy with debt limits set by Congress.  Congress spends like a drunken sailor, then hits a debt limit and whines, then the debt ceiling limit is raised.  It's a joke it even exists.  Just remove it if that's your policy.
While the effects of raise the limit as usage seems to match is similar, there is a gigantic difference between a soft fork, a soft limit, and a hard fork.  BU supporters have a hard time understanding this difference and just handwave away risks.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:58:27
SPV nodes essentially have a very thin ruleset that both BU and Core overlap.  So whoever has the most work is who SPV clients follow.
SPV nodes would then need to be re-coded to hard code reject the Core chain at that point, but BU proponents simply hope that it would never happen.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:54:56
It is impossible to know if any soft fork has the majority of hashrate until it happens.
Even so, if the economic majority supports the soft fork, the miners *will* follow, since they won't be able to sell coins that don't follow the rules (or if they do sell them, they won't make as much).
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:45:29

$100MM subsidizing is complete horse shit lying meant to scare people.  I don't believe it for a second, unless they actually are state funded to cripple Bitcoin.  No economic actor will do that.  And the worst it does is make empty blocks for 50 days.


A chain split will certainly be painful in the short term, but it might be a very strong sign moving forward.  When you are bullied, the best thing to do is to stand up to the bully and punch him in the nose. You might take a beating from it, but chances are, he'll move on to other targets or not get so arrogant.  It also sends a message to other future bullies.


True, I really do want this, but at this point, even if it's not there, I'd be willing to split off and compete on merits.  This being held hostage is completely unsustainable and harmful enough that it's worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:28:30


So we end up with defaults, exactly the same as where we are.


You are missing AD.  You follow the &lt;16MB blocks for a little, until a bunch of 16MB+ blocks show up, and now you have to reorganize your chain and see if you lost money or not.  The default AD is 4 IIRC.  So you see your transactions confirm, and then an hour or two later, turns out you didn't actually have that money after all.

Absolutely.  But a chain split is *always* possible, with or without a UASF.  Anyone can fork off the network at any time for any purpose without permission.  Clams did this a while ago.  So we must further consider who a chain split might affect and what those effects are.
In the case of a community-supported UASF, the chain split would result in a group of miners who wish to go against users, and some reluctant people/people who are not informed of the UASF.  We should take measures to make sure those who are not informed are as informed as possible.  It would be ideal if wallets could detect any kind of unknown soft fork to at least alert users to be cautious.  Anyone who wishes to stand in the way of progress and instead wants to follow their own chain is free to do so.  However, due to the structures of soft forks, they would have to make an additional soft or hard fork to stay protected from a reorganization that is likely to occur if the economic majority truly is supportive of the fork.
If the economic majority does not support a split, then more dangers could occur.  But these can occur today at any point if someone wanted to.  Nothing in Bitcoin can stop such behavior.  We have hundreds of altcoins already.  The worst case scenario is a group of people decide that they REALLY want a feature that Bitcoin users by and large do not want, and they move on to a chain that is more accommodating.  In such a case, a chain split can provide value - two groups both get what they want when it is incompatible.  Users can trade across chains and vote with their wallets.  In such a scenario where there truly are two different groups with two vastly different needs, the split can very well be a net positive.
Miners also have the ability to prevent a chain split very trivially, if it is economically damaging.  They stop mining on intentionally created invalid SegWit blocks, and no split ever occurs.  This economic incentive makes it extremely unlikely that the majority of miners would purposefully choose to split the coin in a case where such a split is economically damaging.

I'm not sure they have actually come out on this side, or just needed some amendment to please the SEC.  


No thanks of the Ver coins.  I'll happily dump those as well.
There is significant loss of value from having a network that can be taken hostage and stop innovation as well.  Nothing is safe in the world until we die.
Being able to rid ourselves of anchors like Ver sounds like a plus, even given the short term pain.  Do you have any doubts at all that long term that the network of innovation and leaders will outcompete the network of troublemakers, loudmouths, and sellouts like Ver?  I don't.  So there might be some short term pain, but I'm there for long term gains and potential.
And if there really is the potential for loss due to a split - miners can quickly remedy this by forging the chains together.  This is done by only mining blocks compatible with both sides.  Miners, being interested in shorter term profits, should do the most profitable thing.  It may take a little bit of time for them to realize this but surely they will.  Or we are better off split, and in that case, there's nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:12:14

There are 3.7ish blocks created on Testnet using SegWit.  Do you need me to google that for you?
With current usage, we'd have around 2.3MB in SegWit blocks.  In the future with things like Schnorr signatures we'd have even more transactions inside the same 2.3MB blocks than what might be in say a 2.7MB block.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:09:44
You need to signal it, but you do not need to include anything with SegWit.  As long as you run a border node,  you are enforcing SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:47:38
Think all you want, but that doesn't make it true.


Not necessarily.  For example, when the chain split due when the soft limit was raised, the community and economy added stricter limits (a lock limit) and ended up rolling back to before the bug was exposed.  Similarly, the same thing happened with the overflow bug that allowed billions of Bitcoins to be created.  This was done by tightening the rules, not anything else, not re-loosening them as you propose.


Soft forks have been around since the days of Satoshi.  Satoshi introduced 3 soft forks.  Gavin introduced another with P2SH.  They have been the best mechanism for extending functionality while maintaining backward compatibility and preventing chain splits.  Compare that to true amateur hour development like Ethereum, where the chain is split forever, and now two coins remain in it's place.

You would need to upgrade your border node to one that filters out invalid SegWit blocks.  This is pretty trivial action.

Voorhees's projects are always built on spamming the blockchain and externalizing his costs onto Bitcoin users.

His site got robbed internally due to his lack of due diligence. He's a pure amateur and never will rise more than being a pump and dumper.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:50:37
This is incorrect.  It's a soft fork.  There are no transactions in SegWit that are valid in that ruleset, but invalid in the original rules.
A soft fork *can* cause a chain split (in fact, it happened with BIP66).  Miner signaling is a convenience to avoid it, but even miners can signal incorrectly, as they did with BIP66 when the majority were SPV mining.

This will slow down the hashrate of the other chain, and depending on the attack (which costs significant money), it might just lead to difficulty reset faster.


Attacking isn't a free lunch.  It's easy to talk a big game about attacking, but devoting 1/3 of your chain's hashpower to attack is expensive.

You would need economic nodes to reject invalid blocks, and a reasonable number of miners enforcing the full rules of the soft fork.  The reason this isn't done is it can produce a chain split if the majority of hashpower just continues on with the old rules.  Chain splits can be problematic - it causes confusion, it may even cause losses if the chain is orphaned out of existence.  This is why in many soft forks of the past, miners would signal readiness to enforce the rules, and once 55/75/95% (depending on the soft fork) were ready, then the rules were enforced.  When this was tried with 75% where unupgraded miners would unintentionally produce invalid blocks, a chain split occurred when the majority of hashpower was not actually validating blocks (SPV mining).  This lead to the standard of 95% now.  If a user activated soft fork occurred - it's important that there is long enough lead time for users to properly prepare themselves for this possibility.


Not quite - it leaves old nodes able to function on the same network, as long as the majority of hashpower is enforcing the rules.  For example, we have many new rules with Bitcoin today, but users with some of the oldest clients Satoshi released would be able to properly validate today's chain and accept it.  With a hard fork, this wouldn't be possible.
You end up rejecting blocks.  Miners are creating something you do not want.  This would be the same as if they sent you a Litecoin block or one that created 50 coins instead of 12.5 coins for themselves.  Economic incentives drive Bitcoin.  If no one will buy an invalid block (or very few people will), then they won't be worth much.  Miners will follow the revenue, and if the economy prefers the soft fork blocks, the other chain eventually gets orphaned.

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:19:51
The main factor not outlined is chain stagnation.  If 100% of the hashpower follows one chain, then the chain grinds to a halt.  Though if any economic presence is left on the original chain, there is motivations to at least keep the chain moving (even if done through fees to motivate miners temporarily).
Part 2 will be published tomorrow showing some economic factors that will dictate how the resolution or lack of resolution will occur.

There's a reason why there has not been a fork so far- they know it would split the chain and users cannot be coerced to follow.  They could at any time have split but have chose not to.

It's a type of soft fork.  My definitions have nothing to do with end user functionality or usability, but simply what is valid on that chain.
A soft-hardfork hijacks the existing block format in a way that it is completely valid to the old clients (and also completely useless).  But the old client will still recognize that chain as valid no matter what it does.

There's a lot incorrect here, but there's been a lot of really bad information out there.
Transactions, today, comprise two different parts of data - witness data and the transactional components.  Each transaction may have a different amount of the data, but each byte counts the same today.  You are limited to 1MB of (witness + non-witness data).
Currently, that mixture is roughly 27% non-witness data, and 73% witness data.
So a 1MB block will contain 270B of non-witness data, and 730B of non-witness data.
Segwit removes the block size limit with a block weight limit.  The block weight is defined as 4* non-witness data + the witness data, and must be less than 4 million.
This works out to now being able to fit 600B of non-witness data and 1600B of witness data.  This would allow for a 120% increase in transaction capacity.
These blocks would be 2.2MB, not 4MB, as you implied.  They would, however, have a 4 million block weight.

Exchanges are free to support whatever they want.   People will need a place to dump S2Xcoins, so whatever.


Garzik hasn't contributed in over 2 years.  And his contributions before that were quite minimal.
You can make changes to the Wiki if you want.


One thing to look at is how much opposition there is.  It's pretty tough to know how much support something has, which is also why hard forks need to be well planned and have a large amount of consensus.


2 Exchanges, a handful of merchants (no, Bitpay is not a merchant, they are a broker selling coins for people and paying merchants).  There is a similarly long list of major players who did not sign it.


Miners have been notorious in signalling things they either don't even run or won't run.  BU had &gt;50% "signalling", but no one was actually running it except Roger Ver.


Quit with the fake "us" crap.  Any split where there isn't some kind of value gained (bcash gave value because it removed toxic players from the system and they had a different vision), will hurt value due to the network effect being lost.

Strange, I see it the other way.  btc1 supporters convinced the hashpower putting a few letters means an eternal commitment, even if the software is bugged and broken beyond repair.  They refuse to accept any feedback or criticism.  While it's possible many businesses suicide, the benefits are not worth the risks for them if they force a split.

I can respect people who stick to their words, and when you make an agreement that has no clause to exit means there is some moral obligation to follow it out.  Of course, there generally are exceptions (things made under duress, a contract signed under false pretenses, or being broken by other parties, etc...).
I believe the criteria above have been met to exit unilaterally without being immoral due to both the BCash split (violation due to the involvement of many mining pools, including the instigating one), many thinking that this would be a fully supported release and not a solo job by a half-rate developer, and the duress that Jihan Wu was extorting the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The economic majority is those who are purchasing coins minted by miners, defining the value.  You can measure it in the marketplace.


Garzik and Gavin has been inactive for years.  Grigg and JVP have never contributed to Bitcoin development. Both of those are scam artists, so even if they did, it doesn't matter.
From this list, you can see only Wang Chun even found SegWit2X even remotely acceptable, and he's a pool operator more than a developer:


BIP91 was created after the btc1 plan for activating was exposed as hopelessly broken.  BIP91 was a way for miners to enforce BIP148 earlier, if it had sufficient support.


I see no evidence that this is the economic majority.  I see a handful of businesses claiming it, but that doesn't make it true.
Why should they implement replay protection? Because every one of their users will need to upgrade software to use it, and it prevents users from losing money.
No it's not appropriate because we have no clue what the "minority" will be in advance, and even if we did, users who are completely unaware of the fork will end up losing money because they didn't upgrade their software (whereas every single forker will have to choose to change their software, thus none of them will lose money by following).

Exchanges are not an economic majority.  Exchanges are businesses that allow people to buy and sell things.
Merchants sell coins, not buy them, so they are not the economic majority.
Voting with coins means nothing, there is nothing at stake.
The burden on those forking to prove economic majority must have *overwhelming* consensus.  This certainly cannot be the case with such vocal opposition including nearly unanimous opposition from all Bitcoin developers.  Many businesses refuse to run software that has not been vetted by them.
I wasn't sure if UASF BIP148 software had economic majority and was willing to call it an alt-coin if it didn't.  But miners decided that a split was a bad idea and implemented BIP91 to support BIP148 and it is compatible with Bitcoin.
I suspect miners and businesses will try to avoid a split and the only way to do that is to abandon the 2X part of btc1.  If they do find a split valuable, they can do it in a responsible way, rebranding and offering proper protection to innocent users, much as bcash did.

@_date: 2016-12-15 03:20:17
Bitcoin works because it has a Trust but Verify model.  Miners produce blocks that are valid (e.g. don't cheat through extra inflation, don't steal coins that aren't theirs) because they are audited by all users of the network.  If they break these established rules, they get no reward.  Full nodes provide this auditing capability, such that miners cannot break these fundamental rules, even if it's for their benefit, and even if they collude.
To do so, yes, they need to be able to replay the history of Bitcoin.  But you really don't need a huge number of nodes to do so.  They would need to be able to serve newcomers to the network.
Nodes also allow relaying to miners, so that you don't need a direct line to them.  This encourages decentralization of miners.  For example, if you had to send you transaction to each miner to get them included, large miners would be the targets of more transactions being sent to them (thus higher fees would get to them) than unknown miners who don't advertise.
Imagine you had a bank where workers needed to take signed orders, and move money from one box to another, according to that signed order.  The workers are all in a glass room with millions of cameras watching them connected to the internet.  Users of this bank can all watch the workers move the money, as directed.  In fact, the watching part can even be automated such that each user can verify that the workers aren't cheating or stealing, for just a few dollars a year.  Workers each take turns fulfilling a set of orders, then the next worker comes in and does the next.  A worker can also pull an alarm, resetting the money if he believes the previous user cheated.  Users watching can also sound the alarm.  When you have the glass box with camera scenario, a worker is going to be far more likely to pull the alarm himself when he knows others have watched, and if he doesn't set the alarm himself, he won't get paid for his work.
When you remove the view from the outside world, the game now changes.  The workers can organize together and agree to perhaps steal a few dollars (not enough for anyone to really notice) and give themselves a bonus.  After all, who is checking to make sure the money adds up?  They may steal a few hundred dollars per shift, which may silently devalue the money they move a little (but surely not as much as their profits from taking the money).
SPV nodes essentially are people who don't bother to monitor.  This can work out OK - if enough people are watching in your place such that workers stay honest.  But if this model is the only way most people can monitor things, the incentive structure changes, and you can guarantee that theft happens more.
People are much more honest when they are being watched.

It does not require a large majority.  All it requires is 6 blocks to be found built on top of an invalid block.  For example, one miner creating an invalid block might end up with a bunch of SPV miners building on top if it for some time, then this pool would follow them.

The term “open source” software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software.

All miners must be full nodes, but not all full nodes are miners.  Full nodes reject invalid blocks (e.g. if a transaction wasn't actually signed properly but included in a block).  Full nodes reject all chains that are not following valid consensus rules.


This fundamentally isn't how Bitcoin works.


Why will miners reject this?  Why wouldn't they also participate in this extravaganza, and take coins for themselves as well (other than full nodes outright rejecting their blocks).


Currently, that's how the system works.  Everyone does ignore that chain.  That's what running a node does.  Other systems might operate differently, but not Bitcoin nor any other functioning cryptocurrency.

Miners don't make decisions.  This is a misconception spread in that miners somehow hold some power over consensus.  They really have two pieces of power:
1)  They can choose which valid block to extend.
2)  They can choose which transactions will fill their block.
That's really the end of their power.
Now some features roll out a lot more smoothly when you have miners helping use their powers to prevent a permanent chain split.  Bitcoin works a lot better when there is one united chain rather than the Ethereum-like splits.  There's less confusion for users, the network effect is larger, etc...  So miners have the ability to signal readiness for soft forks.  This is a signal given to users to start enforcing certain rules at a certain time.  In the event users do not upgrade to this enhancement, they still get to continue on without a risk of following the incorrect chain for any more than normal amounts of time (a block or two at most, which, can happen even without a soft fork).
When miners aren't ready to upgrade, these features are on hold.  But they don't have "power" in this sense.  It's just a way of being helpful.  Feature upgrades could be added that do fork the network, and if the feature was valuable enough, and if miners were just being obstructionists, then they still could be passed through, and miners and users who chose to come along will be on one chain, and miners and users that didn't upgrade will be on another.  This would have to be a pretty significant divergence in philosophy if this happened or a major bug.
@_date: 2016-12-14 16:50:37
They appear to be signaling that they will accept invalid blocks that have 6 blocks built on top of them.  This will lead to you mining invalid blocks that cannot be spent anywhere.  You may wish to switch to another pool that does not have this vulnerability.

This part might explain a lot of why Roger has reached incorrect conclusions:




So when you believe the only purpose of a node is to be redundant file storage and nothing more, of course you will neglect the importance of running one.

Yes, although there really is nothing they can do to stop off-chain from happening if fees rise.

Miners should be smart enough to realize you can't sell at a loss and make up for it with volume.  Any analysis of the system will show they will make more money with smaller blocks than today at a higher price.

Miners can have short term gains at the long term expense.  Miners have a short shelf life, so their incentives are not quite the same as holders.  Miners must maximize revenue in the very short term.
For example, look at the mining pools even 2 years ago and compare to today.  They are much different.
Miners also compete with each other - so doing something in their individual interests can actually harm everyone.  This is something like the prisoner's dilemma or tragedy of the commons.  Prisoners will have an incentive to defect, even though they are both better off if they both cooperate.  Mining has a lot of game theory implications like this.
Do not confuse miners with long term investors in the system.  The best comparison you have for them is someone who has purchased options to buy Bitcoins in the near future.

You might have been able to confiscate a larger amount if someone else wasn't watching, but you still win.

There is virtually no technical objections to it. (There are several pseudo-technical ones, and a few economic/political ones). However, Bitcoin is now plagued with politics at the moment.  From the early days of Bitcoin, a lot of tradeoffs didn't have to be made.  
Wedge issues are the key to political control - they are issues that will allow a community to be divided.  Division is the key to any kind of major overhauls or changes.  In this case, the wedge issue is capacity.  SegWit solves this both in terms of a short term immediate bump, as well as allowing scaling at levels not possible on-chain.  This is a huge threat to politicians who NEED to have a crisis to gain power.  Those who invested in failing businesses who need the protocol to change drastically in order to meet the explosive growth their investors demand (or else they fold), absolutely need to shake things up.  You'll see who has been supporting these changes in the past, and you'll see a large number of companies that either have failed, are clearly failing, or have completely pivoted away.  They need the protocol to change to make money.  These businesses care about one thing - making money.  Whether or not that aligns with users of Bitcoin is a completely different story.  One only needs to look at something like Circle, that used Bitcoin as a mechanism to secure Venture Capital to grow the company, before completely moving away from it.  They have no loyalty, no stake, no interest in protecting the platform.  They are willing to sell out any privacy features because they already must comply with anti-privacy laws.  In fact, the harder it is for Bitcoin to remain private, the better off they are since it reduces their compliance.
Those who wish to harm Bitcoin also benefit from division.  I'm not sure if we are seeing that yet, but the fact that Mike Hearn was actively working for a competitor during his trashing of Bitcoin, makes me think we probably have this already.  Wedge issues give them a way to stifle innovation or cause chaos.  A blockchain split or division of the community is a huge win for them.
So how does SegWit remove this?  SegWit will solve capacity issues for a long time.  Short term, because it's an immediate 2x capacity increase.  Users are free to upgrade at will as they need the extra capacity.  But even more, with layer-2 solutions like LN, where middlemen are not even needed, you have scaling at millions times the level we have today, opening up more use cases than today.  Once users have this, how can you possible draw political support from users?  The hardest kind of revolution to lead is one when people are fat and happy, and SegWit will deliver that.  There will no longer be a wedge issue for many years.  They are dead in the water.
So allowing SegWit to activate is a huge threat to them.  They cannot allow it to happen.  Politicians do these kinds of tricks all the time - they never pass permanent tax cuts, they always make them temporary and tie them to when election years are coming up.  They create solutions that are destined to fail, simply so they can campaign to fix them in the future.  They cannot have success, otherwise people will not need them.  This is why Bitcoin politicians like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Olivier Janssens, Roger Ver, Mike Hearn, Jihan Wu, Jerry Chan, and Peter Rizun are desperate that this does not activate.  They cannot have Bitcoin succeed.  Those who invested in middlemen businesses also are failing.  Brian Armstrong, Jeremy Allaire, Roger Ver, etc..., all need Bitcoin to depend on middlemen for their investments to ever pay off.  The second Bitcoin becomes able to support a massive network as P2P instead of depending on them, their investments are dead.  They don't care about Bitcoin- they care about getting rich and having power.
So when you ask - why isn't it activating - ask yourself this - who is harmed the most by Bitcoin scaling without middlemen?  That's your answer right there.  They cannot have Bitcoin scale.  They cannot have Bitcoin succeed.

Miners can always abandon other miners, it's how the network works.  Miners choose which branch to extend.


This quote from the whitepaper clearly refers to which branch to extend, and is what happens here.


This is the kind of hand-waving nonsense that so-called experts like Peter Rizun trot out.  Game theory isn't just a magic word you can say to assume everything will work well.  The incentives must line up.  Miners absolutely are prevented from doing harm by users being able to validate and ignore invalid blocks.  Removing this aspect drastically changes the game theory implications.
Miners interests are extremely short-term.  They have rigs that quickly become obsolete, so they will have strong incentives to get the maximum short term rewards at the expense of the long term economy.  Trusting the system to miners is selling out all long term hopes for short term profits.  This is why short-sighted, impatient investors are pushing this.
@_date: 2016-12-12 20:30:28
This paper is highly flawed.  It completely neglects selfish mining and networks miners use to propagate fast.
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:29:46
That's not what they are signaling.  6 blocks is sufficient that even a minority of hashpower could sufficiently mine those blocks successfully.


Probably, but that assumes perfectly rational and all-knowing actors.  Mistakes are often made, bad assumptions are made.

It's the opposite of a middleman.
Banks are middlemen.
Cash actually has a huge middleman too - why do you think prices of everything keep going up?  The reason is it's the value of your money going down.  More money is created driving the value you hold in the cash down.
Bitcoin is the elimination of many of these middlemen.

That assumes it even is needed to be fixed.  It's a pretty minor problem to have.


What are you basing this on?  If you have knowledge of every node connected to you, and they tell you every node connected to them, and every node connected to them until you have the entire network mapped (or say, everything within 20 levels mapped to you), that's going to be enough.


The number of routes will be a multiple of the number of nodes in the network, and only needs to know a live update of it, not an eternal history, as bitcoin must have.


You only need to get this data once, then keep track of any changes. 


Yes, this isn't a huge challenge. That can be obtained right before making a payment once you have a few candidate routes.


Sure, it might.  But you don't need to keep track of it forever for every route ever checked.


There might be a level where it starts to break down (maybe millions of nodes), but that's a long way off.

If this were just a payment channel, yes, but LN is a full network.  So you buy at an exchange, they push money to you.  You shop at the store, you push money back through that same channel who then pushes the money back to the store.  Then the store sells some back on the exchange and pushes it to the exchange, for you to buy again.
Money circulates, not flows in one direction.

Looks like this was added in Feb 2016.
The other issue from the old designs (not the busted nSequence ones) was the payment was only really 1-way.  So if you opened two channels, and rapidly paid each other, they'd quickly deplete and you'd have to start again.
I remember this because I was attempting to use them and realized it was going to be a huge PITA for my use case since it required parties paying each other frequently.

Not always true.  In the event of soft forks in the past, this is demonstrably true.  There were chains that had more work but were ignored by other miners, as they built on a chain with less work that followed the new rules, and abandoned the most work chain.


Again with the game theory handwaving.  Miners will mine the blocks they will be able to sell for the most profit.  Mining a longer/more work chain that is not supported by users will not lead them to profits.

I'm talking about exchanges paying users out of the exchange account.  But this also allows exchanges to not have to have custodianship of funds for trading, which is a huge increase in security for users.


Yes.  Most gamblers won't bet on a single event.  They'll place 5 bets for this week, then some might win or lose, then maybe a few more next week, etc...

I haven't been following all the routing proposals, but I doubt they are pursing anything that isn't trustless or decentralized.


Remember the recording history of bitcoin is not the bottleneck, hard drive space is cheap and node can be pruned.
But you don't need to constantly be processing changes to validate the state.  If the changes are minor, you keep track of them.  If the changes are significant, you just scrap what you have and start from nothing.  You can't do that with Bitcoin.  You can't just say "well, just give me the UTXO at block 400,000, and I'll figure out the rest" and remain trustless.  You always must validate every change in the history of Bitcoin.


The entire bottleneck of Bitcoin is keeping a valid UTXO in memory and being able to validate slow operations.  None of that is relevant for LN.


This puts virtually no strain on the network.  Single nodes can process thousands of tx per second without issue.


No, because you figure out the route first, and then verify the expected paths right before sending.  You don't need to send a message to the entire network to do this.

There's quite a lot of misinformation and disinformation going around right now, especially concerning miners powers.  I'm pretty sure you are the one who is confused.


Miners will follow profit.  Ethereum Classic proved this pretty easily.  If all the users want a change, and miners decide not to mine blocks, they are missing out on a great deal of potential income.  Certainly some miners will come on board, seeing the huge opportunity to be the only miners.  Others, seeing that no one is buying their blocks anymore, will then come on board, until the new chain is fully secured.


Well, temporarily.  The old chain is still secure by the old proof of work, and the new chain has profit motive driving it forward instead of being attacked.  Miners cannot attack for free, and as long as they gain more by extending chains than attacking them, they will do so (at least those who are rationally interested in profit, and not interested in just attack).  This incentive is the same today.


If you look at my post, I described the powers miners have.  They have the power to choose what chain to extend, and what tx's to include.  That's their power.  I suppose they have one more - the power to mine or not mine.  They can always quit or find another coin to mine.


I've only seen Bitcoin Unlimited's groups lobbying miners, which really seems to be more about political posturing and obstructionism than any kind of power.  So yes, it's true, miners do have the ability to block this particular type of safe soft fork from happening.  But, users can decide that the risk is worth the benefits and try without miner support.  This still goes into the powers I listed - the power to choose what chain to mine.  Since a soft fork does not invalidate old blocks for non-upgraded clients, they can potentially split the network in some cases.  But that is true today - miners can always choose to mine a split any time they want, and unless users value that chain, it's worth nothing.

Right, even moving the block size limit to 8MB doesn't make bigger blocks.  Miners still have to mine them.
That's semantics.

I think you've learned a good lesson - if it's too good to be true, it likely is.
Chances are you'll never make up the $200 you use to purchase it, even if you have free electricity.
But let's say it was true.  If everyone bought the miners, the network hashpower increases.  Every 2 weeks, the network adjusts based on this, making it harder to mine the next 2 weeks.  So whatever profits are to be made are quickly brought down to more reasonable levels.
The reason this isn't always the case is because it takes time to make miners and add them to the network.  So the price of Bitcoin might rise faster than the ability of miners to come on the network.
This guy would not be selling you the miners if he could make $600/month with them, though.

The division is already there.  The division will end one of two ways.  Either reconciliation or capitulation.  Smart politicians don't overplay their hands and will have their chance for reconciliation.  The religious zealots like Ver, Chan, Janssens, and Rizun, will likely have to just leave the space, likely coming up with their own scam to try to sell the public.

This isn't a conspiracy.  I'm not suggesting.  I'm suggesting people have rational personal interests to make sure SegWit does not get approved.
Roger Ver is a great example.  Though I haven't seen any evidence he's actually a top 3 investor after his alt-coin losses and malinvestment in shitty companies and his large payroll to shit on Bitcoin.  His riches in Bitcoin may very well be a fishing tale at this point, even if he owned a large amount long ago.
He has investments in companies that need explosive scaling in a short timeframe for his investments to pay off.  Segwit destroys that.  Of course he's against it.
Jihan Wu is a different story.  He appears to want to be King of Bitcoin, and has a lot of users in China who must stay in good favor with him to get the latest mining equipment.  So he's using this as a wedge issue to exert his power over the ecosystem there.
The vocal opposition of the Venture Capital backed consumer-facing companies was clear for over 2 years.  They are the ones who signed the 8MB agreement.  They have short runways (Coinbase seems to be the lone exception here), and most are failing.  They need explosive growth immediately, or else they go bust.
So it really comes down a lot to short-term vs. long term thinking.  If your goals are short term (and won't survive to the long term, or don't have the patience), then you will do everything now to ensure things blow up now (either for good, or for loss).
Nothing about this makes it a conspiracy.  A conspiracy consists of a group of people secretly planning about how to do this.  It's politics, instead, where the true purpose is just obscured from the mainstream populace, in order to win favor.  Nothing more than that.

Miners can only offer blocks to users.  That's their only power.
Users are free to reject them.  Proof of work alone is not enough to make a valid block.  For example, miners who create too many coins will get their blocks rejected by any fully validating node.

There are many facets of Bitcoin development.  There is protocol development.  That is done by many different software implementations such as libbitcoin, Bitcoin Core, or btcd.  There are layers above the protocol that are done by several teams.  There are wallets and APIs done using the existing protocol.
Bitcoin Core is the software that is the continuation of the project Satoshi created that is maintained by dozens of developers who all contribute, review, and test code.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:29:25
Not quite. There's a lot of trust in the code that went into that full node (trust earned through a thorough but imperfect review process), trust that economic incentives keep the network secure or your transaction from being reversed, and trust in social consensus that will honor the code to make sure the transaction you received will still be worth something when you want to spend it.
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:00:45
Nothing is black and white. There are always attacks or threats to anything, and it's important to model them to understand what is actually viable, or how much risk you can tolerate. Having black and white thinking leads to either complete inaction or massive inefficiencies. 
It's important we don't oversell things and are just honest with ourselves.


Economic incentives are the key to the whole thing! That's the only way Nakamoto consensus works! Transactions are always reversible in Bitcoin, it's just a matter of cost to do so. Someone could break SHA-256 and mine at no cost and break the whole thing for example. We are trusting that the SHA-256 hash function is sufficiently unbreakable, something that is not guaranteed and can change, for example.
You have to trust how many confirmations are good enough for you. Reorganizations can and do happen all the time. 6 is not some magic number where things become locked (unless you use idiotic checkpoint schemes like BABC). 
Multiple implementations don't buy you much, although if you do run them, you basically need to panic if they diverge and just shut down and stop dealing with the system, not try to reconcile.
I really hope the network isn't dependent on a $50k/yr software engineer doing reviews. You won't find anything useful from someone that badly paid.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:27:56
You have to trust economic incentives that will allow for Nakamoto Consensus to arrive. You probabilistically trust a payment as being irreversible. And you trust the code review process to deliver correct code (no single individual could potentially audit the code with complete accuracy).

No.  That sounds like central planning.  Instead, the market will adjust.  You don't *really* care about what an on-chain Bitcoin transaction costs, you care about what it costs to achieve and end (sending money to someone).
The method of sending a transaction is not important.  What matters are tradeoffs of different factors such as cost, security, trust, etc....
Layer two allows multiple options to exist to explore different tradeoffs.  Lightning Network allows peer to peer commerce to exist without touching the chain often with low fees (besides the initial setup).  E-Cash banks are possible on top of Bitcoin while operating at 100% reserves.  Sidechains and Drivechains will offer different security properties that will be opt-in for participants without adding to the validation cost of the network.  It's now clear that these solutions are the ONLY way forward, but also that such things can actually provide value to users such that users that use them can generate enough revenue to justify building them.
But keep in mind, Bitcoin is doing something far more valuable and revolutionary than just cheap transactions.  Cheap transactions is boring and can be done tons of ways.  Centralized solutions will ALWAYS be cheaper if there is competition.  Bitcoin removes the most important trusted third part of all- a central bank.  That alone is enough to completely re-map the financial landscape of the world.  And here some of us are complaining about $2.

non-upgraded miners' blocks will not be orphaned
This is only true if miners do not build on invalid blocks. One malicious block and they are mining invalid blocks.
Both require running border nodes.  BIP148 requires one extra action - flipping a bit in your code.


First, there is no such thing as "95% consensus".  Second, it requires 95% miner signaling.  Miner signaling is not reliable.  You may have missed BIP66 where 75% of miners signaled readiness, but 50% were just SPV mining, and there was a chain split.  Miner signaling means nothing in terms of whether they will enforce it.  It is useful for coordinating users.


Economic incentives mean that a small number of important nodes can shape the entire policy, when it's just a matter of being more restrictive.


This is already covered.  You talk to people.  If significant number of important economic actors commit to this, then miners have a strong incentive to avoid a chain split.  Bitcoin runs on incentives, and one of the most important is that miners operate for profit.

Your obvious facts are not facts.


This is untrue.  The block size is replaced with a block weight that has a maximum block size of 4MB.  


While true, there are elements of trust to such systems, or limitations in terms of the lengths of such channels, none of which are really possible without SegWit.


This is not true at all.  Numerous alternative implementations have been able to support SegWit without issues.  It has also makes future script upgrades easier with script versioning.


This is also untrue.  Sure, you could make a client that accepts this, but how do you coordinate it with everyone else?  How do you know *when* to start accepting?  How do you know everyone is ready?  How do you know that a bunch of people won't just reject that change and split the network into two?

And that of course increases mining centralization in many ways, de[ending on how it works.  Miners that don't know about or don't care to know about the extension block won't be able to validate blocks that spend the extension coins.  So they have to SPV mine on those, and also miss out on any fees on those extension blocks.  Depending on how big they bloat, can really change dynamics.  Which makes sense why big miners are pushing for this and funding it - they can basically use the extension blocks to knock their competitors offline.

MASF can be used in conjunction with UASF for early activation.  There is nothing incompatible there.  BIP 148 however accounts for the fact that SegWit did not plan for UASF at the end.


UASF has nothing to do with devs.


What if there was a feature that miners did not want to activate?  Then what?  Just surrender?


Or it would simply reset expectations that miners are expected to  provide what users want, not the other way around.


There is no reason to think this ever will be the case.


And surprise, surprise, Jihan has another proposal meant to stall the debate - Extension Blocks.

This is not true either.   There is no mining requirement for BIP148.  It may be possible that miners will ignore BIP148, but if the majority of the economy backs BIP148, then the blocks they mine will be worth less, thus they will have less of a reward, thus miners will be losing money ignoring it.
0.13.1 may deviate around Aug 1 depending on how miners behave, but the chain split will be temporary once miners recognize the power of the economy.
If the economy  does not back BIP148, then it will be withdrawn.

No, this is not true.   BIP148 is a UASF.  UASF's are more than BIP148.
The reason for the deletion is there was comments from some of the companies mentioned that they felt their support was misleading.   The vetting process for adding companies to the page is unclear, and seems to incorrectly conflate support for UASF in general with BIP148.  
I'd love to have the companies added.  I would prefer to only have companies added who explicitly support BIP148 and approve of broadcasting this support.
Until it is properly vetted and cleaned up, the best course of action is to remove it until that can be done.

The signaling is done so that users are protected when miners are able to upgrade faster than them.  It's not a vote.  95% ensures safety in this scenario.


This has nothing to do with node counts or buying consensus.  The economic nodes will define what consensus rules they want.  A soft fork ensures that no split occurs.  This is not a 51% attack, because users are actively wanting it.


Nothing about a UASF has any issue with this.  Miners have an incentive to mine blocks people want to purchase.  This simply changes the incentives such that they enforce a rule the vast majority of users want (that harms no user, and is optional).

There are no activation conditions.  The conditions are "people run the software".

This is dumb.  I can sell cow manure at stores, but it doesn't mean it's good money.


But 90% of Ethereum community didn't.  Something like 5% voted in favor of it.  Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized Foundation running the shots, so there is no chance this happens.  It also has enough people with strong fundamental beliefs that would prevent it.  And if someone did try it, they would not leave with the name, as Ethereum improperly stole from Ethereum Classic.

Disappointing but understandable that Greg has done this.  I think Greg tends to be a bit overly conservative in this case.  That being said, I think it's clear that there are ways to improve safety of doing this.  Unfortunately, that will mean a likely 18 month wait for SegWit.
In the mean time, we can look to review the BIP9 modification proposal made by shaolinfry, gather support for a UASF for covert AsicBoost, and better equip the ecosystem for possible chain splits.
Chain splits are risky, but in my opinion inevitable at some point.  All soft forks (UASF and MASF) have this risk.  Having users in less danger in case a chain split occurs would be incredibly helpful.  Allowing users to protect themselves through replay attacks in a chain split (perhaps a new OP Code for requiring a certain block hash to have existed in the chain for it to be valid) will allow better protecting of assets for custodians.
Personally I am much more risk tolerant than Greg.  If Bitcoin is to fail due to mining centralization, I would rather it happen earlier than later.  Delaying the battle does not make it go away.  If we need to change POW, we need to learn how to do this while the community is smaller rather than larger.  It's similar to getting Chicken Pox as a kid vs. an adult.  You can avoid the risk and maybe you never get it, but much better to catch it young and build an immunity and become stronger.

Chain splits will be temporary.  Miners that mine blocks that no one (or very few) buys will lose money.  Since the majority of mining is done at an incentive to profit, miners who seek profit will follow the chain that makes the most money for them.
How long it takes for this chain split to be resolved will be determined by the stubbornness of miners.

You can start with an empty block.  This is typical when you find a new block but haven't verified it and don't know what transactions are in it.  As transactions are verified, you can include any still valid transactions from the mempool.  You can then grind a nonce range, and then as more transactions come in, you can swap them out.  This is common since you want to include the transactions with the most fees per byte.
Changing the timestamp on the block also works, along with making small changes to the coinbase transaction.

It's quite telling he thinks there is a 3 pronged stool and users don't even get a seat at the table.  Just Captains of Industry, Monopolist Miners, and Developers.
Developers are free to create code that people use or don't use.  Users are free to use that code, alter it, or disregard it.  Miners are free to create blocks, but need users to pay them for the energy.  Businesses are utterly dependent on users as well (unless they just end up being sold out to the miners like BitPay).

@_date: 2017-05-22 21:38:04
This is a very naive assumption.  All it takes is one miner willing to try to break the chain.  The cost to create a single invalid block is trivial compared to the amount of money they were using to attack even a nearly unused Vertcoin.  Once there is a single invalid block, the benefits are gone.  Except we have the disadvantages of having to review/redeploy new software.  So one tiny benefit, and many massive costs.  No thanks.  If Bitcoin cannot gather enough support for BIP148 to be viable, whether as a minority chain or majority chain, I will be exiting and moving to more interesting projects.  I suspect many others will agree.

If you run a full node, you will be unaffected by BU mining nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:59:20
If BIP148 even gets any significant hashrate (15%+ I'd say), then it really puts a lot of pressure on the legacy chain.  Miners now have a chance that their chain may vanish if miners flip flop.  Showing the viability of 148 will be a huge signal and move miners quickly.  Thinking miners will burn resources to attack is silly.  They didn't even bother to do this  with Vertcoin, where it only cost $20k a day to attack.

Not entirely correct. Signatures are just stuffed in a new structure  appended to the regular 1MB block. For a full node to operate correctly,  one still needs to download it, verify it and store it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:54:28
Because there is not widespread support yet.  A UASF requires substantial support for it to work.  Going at it half-cocked is a failure.  You should only run a binary if you are fully committed to the rules of the UASF.  If you are willing to switch back afterward, then the entire threat of the UASF is negated.
Releasing binaries would be irresponsible both in terms of supporting BIP148 and future UASF, as well as potentially harming users who don't realize that it would be going past the point of no return without coming back.
If support grows for BIP148 prior to the deadline, it would be more prudent to deploy binaries.  If you need someone else to make a binary for you, it's unlikely you understand the risks involved and would be the equivalent of giving a loaded weapon to a child.

BIP9 was built on naive assumptions that miners will act in our interests.  You think a default will stop them from deciding to destroy a UASF in the future, but not otherwise?


The cost is redeploying SegWit, testing, etc...  Something that it wasn't designed to do, thanks to Core's naive assumptions about miner behavior.  So your track record is not quite good enough to trust on the actions of miners.
BIP148 is happening whether you like it or not.  Trying to stop it is fruitless.  Especially when many of us are committed to even being a minority.  You are free to join us or not.  A BIP148 in the hand is worth at least two BIP149's in the bush.  But we are moving forward, and our patience has run out.

If the BIP148 chain has over 15% of the initial hashpower, you will see Segwit activate prior to its expiration.  If it's less, miners would have to fake timestamps to get it to activate.
Two chains would exist as long as there was any interest on either chain if the majority of hashpower boycotts BIP148.  But as soon as the majority does more work on BIP148 chain, the other chain dies.

I saw the link.  It was outlining a lot of different pieces of information.
None of that shows anything about node count influencing anyone.
Bittylicious is right - the only way to avoid a split is if the economic players and miners join those running BIP148.  BIP148 is happening regardless, and cannot be stopped.  Whether it is a split or not is up to miners.  The rest of the ecosystem could certainly make that split less likely by joining support of BIP148, thus making it harder for miners.  But if they don't, a split happens, and we have two coins.  Good luck competing with a coin that is missing SegWit, something people badly want, and on a chain that can be wiped out at any point in the future.

BIP148 can just be run by miners directly, no need for segsignal.  The entire point of BIP148 is to make it economically costly to miners to not follow BIP148, so that they would.  SegSignal could potentially get there faster, but would cause disruptions if users are not following its rules too.

The DCG companies get to claim they successfully saved Bitcoin from disaster and can pat themselves on the back, while  avoiding any potential chaos or disruptions from a UASF.
The proposal itself can't even be agreed by each participant (they are all saying conflicting things about what it does or doesn't do), has no code, has no testing, and an unrealistic timetable.  There is no way it could actually be implemented.

UASF has nothing to do with a sybil attack.  Node count plays no role in UASF.
The economic members can choose for themselves however they want.  What is certain is that there will be a split on Aug 1.  If the economic majority is on the side of BIP148, then it will erase the other side.  If a strong economic minority is on the BIP148 side, it may be enough momentum to swing the majority that direction, wiping out the legacy side.


This is completely false.  You'll notice the following line on uasf.co
Does node count determine activation?
No. Users that decide to enforce the new rules will only follow blocks that conform to the existing rules which will in turn cause miners to activate SegWit. A UASF could be enforced by any number of economic nodes, although hash power may only choose to follow such rules if there was significant economic weight behind it.

So more time is a feature?  Sorry, this has gone on long enough. 


BIP149 has as much a chance of a network split as BIP148.  At least with 148 it will be sooner and done with, and it will be predictable when it happens.
A network split that divorces malicious miners and arrogant CEOs from the rest of us is a feature, not a bug.
Your comments INCREASE the likelihood of a chain split.  If you wanted to avoid it, you would support BIP148 and do everything to help get it merged into Core.  BIP148 cannot be taken away.  It's in the wild.  It's happening.  There will be a split unless the economy and miners join on, or activate SegWit.  You don't have the power to stop users.  You can join us or not.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:18:56
They don't know best.  They gave us BIP9, which was naive as hell.  I think they all realize it's a mistake.  They are humans and make mistakes.  Shit happens.
Now we have Core being so arrogant thinking they can stop BIP148 after it already is running  They refuse to even give users an OPTION to soft fork for 148, even though they allow similarly dangerous features like invalidateblock.   The justification is that "I don't want to give someone something that can hurt them".  But refusing to have the option could lead to more harm - if BIP148 is wildly successful, as I think it will be, the work on the chain will potentially erase the legacy chain, leading Core users unable to even switch if needed without uninstalling Core.
It's pure arrogance at this point.  Not all the developers are falling for this.  I would still welcome the majority of their work, but I can no longer recommend using the Core repository anymore.

@_date: 2017-05-03 22:12:32
I agree, but one of your criticisms "we don't know when a chain fork will occur with 149" also applies to 148.  They could fake signal (or a majority could), then after it activates, all seems well, until a miner mines an invalid SegWit tx and miners follow it.  Same issue as 149.
Given proper enforcement of the soft fork from users, both cases miners should be the ones with the losses, but it could always happen at an unpredictable time.

80% shows when 91 becomes active, which still requires miners to orphan blocks such that 95% actually activate SegWit.

Miners have a choice to either split the chain by not enforcing BIP148, or serving all users by enforcing BIP148.
If the size of BIP148 users is reasonable, then it can stand that a miner would have a strong incentive to avoid a chain split to serve all, than have to pick a side.
Once a split occurs, then miners have the choice to resolve the split by enforcing the tighter rules, or by letting it continue.

That's untrue.  It's trivially easy to counter-soft fork the other chain.

I get that it can't be merged.  But, you don't have the power to merge code.  All it's going to take is a detractor, like Suhas now today, who is going to FUD up 149 as well.  We are stuck with unknowns now, which have no advantages, longer time, and who knows what other bullshit proposal comes out before then to try to take steam out of 149 (SegWit Frankenstein, Extension Blocks), etc...
There's no guarantee of any activation date for the variation of 149 (the whole "something functionally similar) - it's going to be whoever is the most conservative, so we are stuck until 2019-2020 if someone raises a stink.
Or we could just end this now.  The choice is obvious.  I can understand you not wanting being the one not pulling the trigger, but you are actively standing in the way of users at this point, and making things more dangerous.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:24:04
The cost is low for most miners, but actually kind of high for those trying to use covert AsicBoost.  Which is why they fought it.  Add in that SegWit will actually lower fees for most users, this may not be offset by higher prices making miners less profitable.  But in the end, different participants in the mining ecosystem have different motivations.  Chip manufacturers want to have increased demand, which comes from increased efficiencies relative to the market or increased total revenue for miners.  Miners themselves benefit from being better than the competition long term, and short term by price increasing faster than difficulty.  Since difficulty will eventually follow mining revenue, even having the price/mining revenue going up doesn't help for long (only until they catch up).  Pools make money from attracting market share and from the value of Bitcoins going up.  So it's not even all the same incentives there.
An intolerant minority that isn't intolerant (not willing to exit for their cause) can be ignored completely.  Without their intolerance, it doesn't make any sense to cater to them if it's even at all against your own interests.
Imagine you are throwing a party and having pizza.  One guy who you really want there says "I'd prefer veggie, but meh, I'll eat whatever".  Everyone else wants Pepperoni.  In that case, I can guarantee Pepperoni is getting ordered.

Jeff Garzik disagrees.  He stated that it was the entire reason for the rushed timeline and approach.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:21:52
BIP148 has the same issue as 149 in the decisiveness case.  It's possible that &gt;50% of miners decide to flag the signal ahead of time, but at some point, they actually don't enforce.  Pretty much BIP66 all over again.
Agreed with compatibility points.
The other is simply speed.  Waiting 3 months vs. waiting 12-18 months is a huge difference when the safety is nearly identical in both cases.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:44:22
Aww, someone might use a SegWit transaction!  I'm sure that harms you soooooo much.
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:37:25
I define support much differently than actually enforcing it.
Anyone trying to enforce it now is a fool setting themselves up to lose money without any economy backing it.  The time is really to gain sufficient support.

Yes, you don't have to create SegWit transactions or blocks in the future, even if you signal.  You just need to detect invalid blocks and reject them.

I don't think miners because they are doing their job at the threat of not getting paid.  Miners had to be dragged to this.

@_date: 2017-07-21 18:40:53
Strange, I see every pool signaling SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:13:12
Signaling on Bit 1 will have that effect.  Miners will need to ensure that EVERY block beginning in about a day from now will signal SegWit until a full period passes. 


A lot of FUD.  SegWit broke a patent-violating advantage that BitMain was using to get a 30% edge on other miners.  They couldn't disclose this, so they made up as much FUD as possible to stop it.  Once this came to light, then it became clear that a UASF would be needed to force SegWit.
There really is pretty much no one outside of Roger Ver who is against SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:25:18
Miners can do that, and it's their prerogative.  This was something miners decided to play with fire about, so they can live with the consequences of it.
I would recommend users keep an eye on both chains if they can and freeze receiving payments if they diverge.

Avoid btc1 at all costs.  It's unreviewed, untested garbage code that will break consensus.
You are getting a warning because miners decide to activate a rule on their own.  Use Core, or a 148 client.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:39:35
Why should they do that?  It serves no purpose to delay. 


Because BIP9 sets expirations in case people lose interest in Soft Forks (maybe a superior option comes up) and the bit doesn't have to be reserved forever.  The bit MUST expire at some point.
There still is plenty of interest in SegWit, and miners surely will not activate it now unless the community gets behind BIP148.

I'm to the point where I'm willing to leave laggards, trolls, and troublemakers behind, even if it's not broadly supported.  Call it an alt-coin if you want, but I believe that long term it *will* be the chain of most value, even if it's not obvious to everyone immediately.  This is why I support BIP149 unconditionally.  Anyone unwilling to take that minor risk is not someone I want to be associated with or a chain that I believe will have any long term value.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:58:01
Yes, and BIP148 supporters are willing.  Bitcoin has been co-opted and is no longer useful without changes.  Having a clean slate for those who truly understand sovereignty and ridding of those who kneel to Jihan is a positive.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:03:22


The threat isn't from the price drop.  It's from completely abandoning them.  They end up with space heaters.


Two distinct bitcoins WILL happen at some point.  I'd rather it happen sooner than later, and show that one will get completely annihilated.  


Miners have no power though.  The only threat they can do is mine blocks we ignore.  In other words, throwing money into a toilet with no effect.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:42:57
Yes, you are fine. The worst case is you will have coins on both chains on Aug 1.  When you transact after that, you may need to protect yourself to send only on one chain after that date.  Mycelium may support BIP148 after that date as well, so you'll know you got coins on that chain.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:06:05
This is the beauty, it doesn't matter if it is or not.  Anyone can fork from the network at any time for any reason.  We must realize this and not worry about it.  Bitcoin is not a suicide pact.  If someone wishes to fork off, so be it.  2MB HF may be abandoned, it might not, but we can ignore it.  We may end up with coins on two ledgers, which we can sell one of, and buy more of the other.
I don't think it will happen, but if it does, do not fear it.  It's not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:35:59
I think you misunderstand game theory then.  This is exactly why it succeeded.  It succeeded because the risk was greatest for the miners.  The worst case scenario for them is a POW change and was on the table.
I'm sorry, but I care about far more than short term fluctuations in price.  If you are in Bitcoin and don't have a greater than 5 year time horizon, you are going to have a bad time worrying about every time a miner farts or some business makes a threat.  We need to be able to withstand threats by tackling them head on and be willing to have short term losses for the greater gain.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:39:08
That's not how UASFs work.  It has nothing to do with node count.  It has to do with economic activity.
Miners decided it was best to not split the network so they are complying with BIP148 a bit early.  Perhaps they pull out, but at their own demise.  Such treachery would surely lead to more support for BIP148 along with a possible POW change.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:41:17
That's the thing, there comes a point where I just plain don't care.  I'm not in Bitcoin to be popular or agree with others.  I want to take the best steps forward, and anything that can be gridlocked by miners or FUD campaigns is useless.
If I end up even being *alone* in support, there's no reason to even hold on the other chain, it is broken.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:48:46
I covered this pretty clearly here: 
As long as someone has demands that are opt-in and affect no one else, I hope the ecosystem is able to readily adopt it!  Good on them.  Maybe more UASFs can occur and if they have a critical amount of support, they can get adopted.
If a minority tries to harm the majority, it's pretty easy to reject them.  I'm not thrilled this ended through a miner enforced censorship fork, but I think miners are clearly knowing where they stand in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:56:23
It never will go into effect.
Miners signaling has nothing to do with being a hard fork or not.  First, signalling is nonbinding.  Since no users are actually running btc1 (and even most miners), the worst they can do is fork off.
Bitcoin Core will have SegWit.  It just won't have the gimmicky 2x crap.  And likely, no miners mine it since it is DOA.

UASF BIP 148 got traction, which would cause a split in Bitcoin if miners did not enforce it.
Miners could not just support it and eat crow for blocking SegWit, so they came up with a plan to save face (similar to Lightning Roundtable after BIP148 for Litecoin threatened them as well).
Miners and some VC-backed companies created a closed door meeting with the result decided and rejected developer input to create a new client - SegWit2x.  SegWit2x would be a way for miners to enforce BIP148 without actually acknowledging the strength of UASFs.
SegWit2x gives miners plausible deniability when it comes to preventing a chainsplit for 148 (we aren't running 148, we are just running something that enforces the same thing).
No competent developer is contributing to Segwit2x.  No sane company or miner will actually run it.  It's a cover.  Jeff Garzik and Barry Silbert may be the only people who actually think its a real thing.
So, we'll get SegWit, BIP148 will have won, and miners can save face, and Barry can sniff his own farts and enjoy them as he claims he saved Bitcoin.
Shortly after SegWit activates, everyone will stop paying attention to the 2x part and everyone will go on their way.  SegWit2X will go the way of every previous coup, into the dumpster bin.

BIP91, when activated and enforced, behaves like BIP148, but at a possibly earlier activation.  Since BIP91 is locked in, it will enforce rules consistent (tighter) than BIP148.  BIP91 is a miner enforced version of BIP148 that triggered based miner readiness (with 20% veto).
All miners that follow BIP91 (based on the chain today) will be compatible with BIP148.

Yeah, that guy is a charlatan, liar, scam artist, and troll.  He's made a living by touring conferences and get donations from the FUDsters who wish to block SegWit to protect ASICBoost.
SegWit is opt-in.  If you don't like it, don't use it.  Simple as that.  Miners don't even have to use it if they don't want.
SegWit will allow more throughput, which can potentially reduce income from miners, but also will prevent some miners from running a secret advantage (or at least will make it not economical to do so).
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:01:08

@_date: 2017-07-27 17:57:40
No, signaling was meant to signal you were ready to enforce the new rules.  Once a huge portion of the miners were ready, they could start enforcing it and it wouldn't have any effect on users who hadn't upgraded.  Instead, it turned into a miner veto to hold the entire ecosystem hostage so that they could make demands.  Instead, they got demands from BIP 148 and got in line.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:18:58
Bitcoin Core Devs do not have the power to hard fork, nor can they stop a UASF.  The worst case scenario of a UASF is still better than a hard fork.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:11:12
The cost of SegWit is primarily the cost of BIP148.
BIP91 still remains to be activated, and remains to be enforced.  It's still possible one of these don't happen.
Bitcoin really can't rely on benevolence (if it does, it has failed).  It must rely on incentives to survive and thrive.
In the example - ordering an extra pizza is a cost, so it only makes rational sense for the host to do that if he personally benefits from making the guest feel better.  Nothing like this in Bitcoin exists (perhaps the biggest stretch of this is if the price rises of Bitcoin due to his "benevolence").

It's a figure of speech.  Miners realized they had more to lose than anyone, due to the resolve of the 148ers.  So they caved.
Miners fortunately are acting rational, even though they feign irrationality.
Signaling can't cause a hard fork.  Signaling means nothing. Miners have proved they aren't stupid enough to suicide a chain split, and I see no reason to think that the next 3 months will cause them to become suicidal after choosing to live this time.

BIP148 is not synonymous with UASF.  Look at BIP149, a more conservative approach.  I think this approach is likely to draw the community together.
I do see soft fork/evil fork options as likely next steps.  The hard part is finding competent developers who are willing to do so.  By finding hostile developers like JJ from bcoin and Ethereum developers (who Bitmain has investments in), this may happen.
Miner support for a MASF extension block may be possible, but most users will ignore them.  If sufficiently dangerous, users can block them with a UASF.  More likely, I think most users ignore them until the mining majority is no longer enforcing them, or sufficient funds remain on the chain, and then miners revert to abscond the funds.  Since users do not enforce the extension blocks, miners can profit the money without penalty.
SegWit moves forward with BIP149.  We wait a year, everyone is ready, and a non-event happens. Roger gets mad and mines an invalid block on purpose to show everyone and loses 12.5BTC again.  Maybe a few people follow, but not enough for anyone to notice.

FrankenSegWit (2x)
* Is there any difference between UASF segwit and segwit2x?
UASF requires miner signal and a fixed date.  SegWit2X allows a 20% miner veto.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:11:22
Nope!  That's the beauty of 148/91 and why it could happen on such a short timeline.  It didn't require anything as long as the miners enforced it.  Miners (if enforcing) will abandon any chain that does not signal intent to enforce SegWit, beginning in about 228 blocks.  Miners will 51% attack anyone who does not signal SegWit.
This means that if the majority of miners are enforcing BIP91, then it becomes the longest valid chain with 100% of miners signaling for SegWit, which is over the 95% limit.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:59:31

@_date: 2017-06-22 21:10:59
No, it's not compatible, it requires 80% of hashpower to go through signalception with sufficient time to enforce BIP148.


In the event of miners abandoning Bitcoin users, then a change of POW will be the obvious answer.  In that case, mining is sufficiently centralized and problematic that BIP148's chain is superior to Bitcoin since it is not encumbered with a broken POW algorithm.

I mean there might be, but there hasn't been up to this point and part of the reason why is no one actually wants 2MB enough to force a split.  That's the difference between 148'ers and 2MBers.  148ers WERE willing to split to get their way.  2MBers keep backing out and find excuses for not forking off.
NYA guarantees a chain split if followed through at a later date, by postponing one that was imminent.  Fortunately the first chain split is likely to not happen, so now it just comes down to ensuring there isn't later.  But no one can prevent that (I could make my own fork tomorrow, just no one would care).


If miners attack users by trying to force a fork, a POW change is pretty simple to pull off.  I think the fact that miners caved so quickly to 148 shows they have no interest in splitting the network.  So they will abandon the 2MB effort as quickly as they realize its a guaranteed split.

That subreddit was purchased by someone who has made massive investments in altcoins, and tries to discredit Bitcoin.  There are hired shills that post lies constantly there, in an effort to smear Bitcoin developers, or distract them.  The moderators all work for the same employer (until recently), and a few "loyal" followers were there.


Bitcoin could have any number of sidechains.  Think of it as freezing Bitcoin on the main chain, and then having completely different properties on the other side.  Maybe they have more inflation or bigger blocks or different rules.  You can then move them back to the main chain if you wanted to.
The sidechain would typically not have to fork unless the fork of Bitcoin was so incompatible it couldn't.  This is unlikely to be the case.  Sidechains do not require permission or the Bitcoin network to be aware of them.  They are voluntary and opt-in. Anyone can add one at any time they like.
There were talks of sidechains where miners could mine both the main chain and a sidechain simultaneously but as far as I can tell that model has fallen out of favor.

GPU's do not have a monopoly manufacturer, so that helps a lot when it comes to any centralized party controlling it.
POW HF with community support is not an altcoin, it's just a change as any HF is.  For example, if someone cracked SHA256 such that anyone could make a perfect hash with no energy, that would be a flaw that I would expect the community to immediately fix through a POW HF.  Similarly, if the community was attacked through sustained 51% attacks from miners, that would also warrant a change without being an altcoin.
I would prefer a Bitcoin-spinoff altcoin with a decentralized POW and SegWit to a centralized Bitcoin without it, so I have no qualms if it becomes an altcoin.

There's no way to know how much of the hashrate will enforce BIP148.  But assume it's only 1% of the total hashrate.  In this case, you could do a POW change and just have SegWit automatically activated on that chain.  This eliminates the threat of re-orging the first chain, but perhaps there are some tricks to do some extension block style tricks to still allow old hashpower to contribute where 1 block a day was sufficient and most transactions occurred on an auxiliary block.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:10:39


I would be thrilled if this were the case.  It would mean victory would be inevitable. No need for a POW HF Then.


Let's see, you could have a chain that has SegWit, real scaling, bigger blocks, AND cannot be reorganized, vs. one that doesn't have any of those things.  Easy choice for the economy.


Bitmain has 70% market share right now, Bitfury sells containers that are $1MM++, and Avalon is nothing.
For GPU, yes, you have a lot of manufacturers who are interested in far more things than just monopolizing Bitcoin like Jihan Wu.  GPUs are far superior than ASICs that tend to be dominated by one player.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:43:22
1. Sure, it would need another proposal, but it's pretty clearcut that if miners ever become evil, Bitcoin will change POW.  Miners attacking users is a clear case for this, and has a great likelihood of bubbling up to Bitcoin.
2. I also agree it won't happen.  Jihan is a huge bluffer.  As a poker player, it's obvious.  Bluffing works great against weak tight players, especially those who are short stacked (see DCG members who have limited runway, shit business models, and no growth).
3.  Bitmain is not some all powerful evil entity.  They have SHA256 hashers (and some GPU hashers).  Big fucking deal.  They cannot just switch to another POW and be dominant.  They still need to attack.
POS is a pipe dream.  Changing POW does not take long in an emergency.  Code is ready.  They literally cannot attack, as it exposes their entire value proposition as fraudulent.  It's a suicide attack.  Jihan is many things but he's not going to screw himself out of hundreds of millions of dollars.  He's far better off ignoring it and hoping it goes away.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:30:57
Is your split easy for people to account for, and is the benefit of having you in the network worth the cost of enforcing it?

Someone who chooses to be on the 148 side should protect themselves from this by either splitting coins before transacting.  Dumping their legacy coins prior to entering 148 is far from a risk.  Those who didn't act are the ones at risk.

This is completely untrue.  Segwit has nothing to do with a sidechain.


A sidechain is free to do whatever whoever builds it wants it to do.  It can have its own coins, its own redemption rules, etc...


Sidechains have varying degrees of security depending on how they are set up.  AFAIK the only sidechains set up now rely on a federation that enforces the rules and allows the release of coins back to the main chain.  Other sidechains like Paul Storcz's drivechain allow a mechanism for miners to release coins on the main chain based on voting.  Using a sidechain will involve choosing a different set of tradeoffs.


I'm not sure what this means.


This may be part of your problem.  Reading is like reading r/flatearththeory and then trying to understand how an eclipse happens.
