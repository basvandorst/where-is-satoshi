I don't, sorry. I've never used a software wallet. I keep it all in cold storage. Maybe someone else can chime in. Also, the sidebar has some useful links to help you get set up.

It'll be funny reading this post in 2021 when Bitcoin is over 80 grand

Completely up to you, I moved mine out at $500
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:07:31
Probably, probably not. I think it will be a combination of fiat and crypto. Will it be Bitcoin? Who knows. All I know is that crypto and the underlying tech is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:20:27
They'll have to buy all the crypto then or make their own

It's possible yes

You don't have to purchase an entire bitcoin you know. A 10% fluctuation in $100 worth of bitcoin is the same as a 10% fluctuation in $100 worth of any other altcoin. Additionally, just because coins are cheap doesn't mean they are better to buy. Look at the market cap and supply to get a better idea. Also, Bittrex.com is good to buy different altcoins. Idk about light or silver.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:05:55
Right, but if I put it right back into crypto does that count as holding?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:58:00
Ok yeah, not to be mean but what's your point? You can speculate on stocks as well
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:43
I'll do whatever the hell I want, bro
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:49
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:49:35
Definitely does not. Bitcoin is not a stock, doesn't behave like a stock, and shouldn't be treated like a stock. Bitcoin is not a company. When you buy a coin, you are not a shareholder. It won't fluctuate based on company performance. It goes up 40% in a day and down 40% the next. It's absolutely possible to own it for 10 minutes and see a huge return or a huge loss. There's no way that applies.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:19:12
No one can predict the future
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:39:05
BTC is more like a storage of value (like gold) in my opinion, and other cryptos will excel in areas that Bitcoin doesn't.

That's called arbitrage, people do it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:25:31
Check out IOTA. No fees, no miners, fast transactions. Still in the beta stages and needs a lot of work, but it has potential to ~~do~~ be a game changer. 
Edit: Extra word
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:26:45
I would use Coinbase/GDAX to start off. Keep money in exchange up until you accumulate enough where it's worth to put into a hardware wallet. I don't know much about mobile wallets. The sidebar has useful links to help you get set up. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:10:36
Sign up for an exchange and sell it on there
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:05:46
There's still that risk that the *investment* could be worth 50% more or less tomorrow, as with any other cryptocurrency. I believe in the tech as well but the risks are inherently larger which does not classify as an investment, at least not the way I think of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:51:46
Yeah I know that, and that's currently my main issue with them. Having considered that I still believe in the tech and potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:24:06
If you don't have much I'd just keep it on the exchange
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:40:58
To establish a new floor of some kind. Healthy corrections are necessary. It won't keep rising exponentially forever without some sort of pullback from people taking profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:44:06
You’re dumb. I’m not talking about OP. I said the exact amount as in 8 decimal places, and the time it was transacted. Not that hard to lookup.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:55:33
Not really, more money has to pour in each time to double. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:19:15
If you believe it's a bubble then you don't believe in the value. This isn't a get rich quick solution. Know what you're getting yourself into first.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:58:51
Bitcoin does belittle BCash as well but not at the rate they do is my point
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:36:56
The term hodling came from some drunk guy trying to day trade and sucked at it. A lot of people here try selling the highs and buying the lows to get more BTC cheaper. Problem is, that's not always guaranteed, and super risky. Hodling just enforces the fact that keeping what you have and buying more along the way will usually result in better gains than trying to time the market. Some people will hodl hoping bitcoin will be accepted worldwide, others are just trying to use it's volatility to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:56:56
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:37:25
Got it thanks again

HODL, don't try to time the market
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:09:18
They told us this a few days in advance. Not surprising at all. Should be back up at 3:15 AM EST.
And what selloff
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:44:14
It's definitely a unique concept. Once they fix all their transaction issues, come out with a decent wallet, and get listed on more exchanges I have no doubt it will shoot up some. It's still in the beta stages but has potential. Not a short-term game but 2018 will be huge for them  
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:36:49
Good stuff. I cashed out my principal today too. Bitcoin is only about 15% of my portfolio and am 75% in IOTA now. Best of luck to everyone!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:33
If you're investing that much you shouldn't be asking strangers on the internet. Do your due diligence and consult professionals. If you ignore all this GDAX is a good place to start but expect to not be able to access your money when traffic is high

You wont lose your bitcoins. Blockchain wont die out, but your coins can lose value if more people switch over to a different coin. As long as you keep your private key or seed safe, you will not lose your bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:58:01
Lol no? That's the last person he should listen to. I'm talking about financial advisors, CPAs, people with a track history in crypto, developers, founders of currency... OP has $100K and doesn't even know where to start. How about a crypto course? Some data analytics? Maybe a company like Circle that has dedicated services to people investing over 100k. But yeah starting by getting anonymous info on a Reddit thread where most people here are young with no experience and have like 1 or 2k invested is a great idea!
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:31:32
Yes, I am what's your point?
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:52:35
You mean for deposits into GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:54:11
I agree with holding bitcoin long-term, yes. But it's not an investment like a stock investment whatsoever. It's not an investment at all, it's pure speculation as with every single other cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:32:35
[This]( will help you understand why the media is all over it this year.

Because it's still being adopted. Hopefully one day it won't be sold on exchanges and people can use it globally to buy everyday items without any fluctuation. That's the goal

Can we please stop pulling numbers out of our asses?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:07:19
Yeah, what I'm saying is that eventually, you will use your bank just to buy Bitcoin and never return to a bank again. We're not at that point yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:44
So what are you gonna use?
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:25:34
Yeah I was liking the post up until the end. You broke rule  OP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:29:24
I don't think this is a good idea at all, but if you are going to do it aren't there some cards that offer 0 apr for 24 months?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:30:33
Second this
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:46:22
You should probably ask r/bitcoinmining, the vast majority of people here are just ~~investing~~ speculating
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:36:38
What’s the value then if $11,600 isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:46:35
That’s called day trading. You’re essentially gambling
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:59:24
Right, I will cash out eventually and pay capital gains tax. I'm not trying to avoid it completely just trying to pay less by holding for a year. If I made $100k in one month, transfer to a less volatile crypto, then transfer back to BTC after 1 year and cash out, I'd pay the long-term tax vs the short-term. There is no way to tell that I got out of Bitcoin unless the exchange reports it, which is what the IRS is starting to require.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:33
Damn, why would you buy at 19?!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:30:48
Read the article but still don't understand what that means. We would need to disclose how much we hold? How will that be enforced? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:05:56
It doesn't make a difference if he withdraws from his paper wallet or Coinbase, he would still have to report it to the IRS so I don't get what the premium here is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:02:41
Are you seriously asking this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:23
Well I mean it worked out so...
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:16:00
According to [Investopedia](


Again, Bitcoin is speculating not investing
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:03:29
Idk, take a chance, have some balls of steel. Worst case scenario you lose it. Best case you make money. Just make sure you're ok with a potential loss. Your call, not ours. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:38:28
Yup, I'm scared not gonna lie. It's going to be wilder than anything in the history of Bitcoin, for better or for worse
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:08
No, too fast
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:29

I've lost more trying to day trade. Unless you're using bots trading high volume, it's not really worth it. It comes down to luck. You'll win sometimes, but I don't think those gains are worth the potential loss and being in the position you're currently in. Sucks, I know the feeling. Psychologically, it feels better when the price drops and I'm holding, than when the price rises and I'm not.

If you also tell someone when you bought Bitcoin and the exact amount, they can find your wallet on the blockchain and see how much is in there. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:08:25
Gotcha thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:44:25
I wouldn’t be able to steal it, just check how much you own.

If you think its a bubble why are you willing to jump balls deep into it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:48:19
How do you think that would be enforced? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:01:30
Black markets. Interesting to see how this all plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:36
If you're on desktop its on the right side under the huge Bitcoin title, where it says subscribe/unsubscribe.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:36:59
True. But most people didn't put their life savings into bitcoin. A couple hundred bucks back then would've made you a multimillionaire now. Had it not taken off, they would've only lost a couple hundred bucks.

@_date: 2017-12-04 02:26:09
So what happens if someone steals or I lose my ledger? Should I restore my wallet on a second ledger and then move my funds into a third ledger? Is there a way to quickly block the first ledger from being used (assuming they were able to crack the pin key)

Paper wallet
Edit: If you have a good amount surely you can afford to dish out $80 to store them securely. Otherwise, paper wallet and make backups and hope you don't lose them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:01:41
Maybe someone else can chime in on this since I'm not too sure. I use a hardware wallet. You need to transfer your coins to an exchange in order to sell them.
On their [website]( Coinbase says:


@_date: 2017-11-30 17:19:27
Not this again
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:09:59
Hire a CPA. There are ways to reduce your taxes. One option is to hold and hope for federal acceptance which means no capital gains tax.   
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:32
I didn't mean it that way at all but ok
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:50:04
From my understanding, it doesn't matter if you use Coinbase or not. You'll get the same amount of B2X as BTC that you have as long as you have access to your private keys.

I think there will be one, but it could be from $40k down to $30k, or it can be now down to $6k. No one knows. But I agree. With more people jumping on board and the futures opening up, I see Bitcoin rising with even bigger price swings

From personal experience:
**Buying Bitcoin**
* Coinbase: mobile app, arguably the simplest and easiest to use. Pretty self-explanatory and convenient. High fees
* GDAX: The exchange version of Coinbase. Coinbase owns GDAX. No mobile app. Desktop version only. A bit more complicated to use, but not hard. No fees on limit orders. FDIC insured for USD balances. 
* Gemini: 0.25% fee. Easy to use. FDIC insured for USD balances. 
**Storing Bitcoin**
* Exchanges: You can keep them on Coinbase, GDAX, or Gemini. You do not have access to your private keys though, so there is risk for malicious compromise.
* Software wallet: you can download a variety of wallets to your phone or computer.
* Hardware wallet: Ledger Nano S or Trezor are two USB-type wallets that you can buy and store your currency. Your public and private keys are never used online and there is virtually no risk for an attack.
* Paper wallet: Make and print out your own keys and send BTC to it. If you lose the paper, you lose your money, forever.

GDAX and Gemini
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:44:04
There have been trades happening why wouldnt it be accessible
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:45:51
Eesh, also bought at all time high?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:16:04
Glad you got some good responses but you might want to take a look at the sidebar as well. Almost every question on how to get set up is answered there.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:38:14
That's really interesting thanks!

I lost more day trading than hodling so there's my answer
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:18:29
CASH OUT!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:32
Oh cool gotcha will keep that in mind
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:17:42
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:25:19
Based on my personal opinion I believe the next dip will occur on Friday, Nov 24 at 8:55PM EST in which BTC will dip slightly below $7200 and then regain momentum on Sunday at 2:20PM EST before reaching an ATH on Wednesday, Nov 29 to $8566. Just my personal opinion though
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:26:54
Not yet, we still got a long way to go buddy
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:55:37

Oh I don’t think that’s the same app. I have Crypto Pro
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:18:55
What would?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:11:33
You good OP, should be there soon. Congrats on your first purchase!
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:17:50
No, I'm not comparing the both. I'm simply stating that *currently* fiat works as well or even better, which brings me to my original question of why I would choose to pay with Bitcoin when it is favorable for me to hodl. I'm not bashing BTC. Again, I just want to know what drives someone to use it as currency rather than an investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:15:40
Buy and HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:51:41
If you send me 1 BTC I'll send you back 1.5 BTC in 1 hour. Deal?

I attended one of their free online seminars. The guy Teeka that runs it is knowledgeable. He's met with various crypto entrepreneurs like Vitalik and had Charlie Shrem as a guest speaker in this talk. The whole thing is meant to get you to sign up for their course. They try to sell you on emotion and false promises that "guarantee" a get rich quick method if you buy their services. These guys make most of their money of their paying subscribers. They even went as far as having a $1M giveaway to one of their next paying subscribers. Idk how I feel about the whole thing. I've always been taught to never give money to any of these so-called gurus. Now-a-days, there is enough free information out there for you to learn on your own and make your own informed calls without having to pay someone to tell you what to do. Just my two cents.

What is your opinion on mining the bit coins if I were to have access to unlimited free energy. Lots of colleagues are saying that it's not worth it now because too many people have very sophisticated mother boards that can handle mining better than mine. If it's profitable, I might buy an asik motherboard and start making some money on the side
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:55
Lots of people think that many people will sell once it hits $10,000, bringing the price down. If you sell at the right time, you can buy back at a cheaper price and make a profit.
Edit: a missing word

@_date: 2017-11-30 06:37:16
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:19:43
Not really. It's still pretty difficult to make a transaction happen if you're not tech savvy. You still have to input a 25-35 character address, make sure you're sending to the right wallet, and hope you don't mess up along the way. Besides, there should be no need for exchanges in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:04:54
No he's not, he's being honest. Why in the world would you take advice from some random person on the internet when they can tell you ANYTHING they want. The best thing they can do for you is give you links and sources so you can become informed and decide for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:08:40
I second that. I moved over to Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:01:23
Hell yeah sweet setup!
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:33:44
Also it’s not technically a Tesla :P
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:20:44
Yeah, it's the slang term used for "HOLD" within the crypto community. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:02:27
OP if you dont sell to this guy sell to me!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:29:17
Yeah I saw that too. Price keeps fluctuating as well. I lost $1k because I couldn't sell when I first signed in to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:28:36
This was proven back when Silk Road got shut down, a small dip and then back up again. It showed that this illicit market was only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin. The majority of people with Bitcoin aren't doing anything illegal with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:34:04
LTC, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, NEO... I hold all these. They are the more "known" coins. Not necessarily better but they all have their own characteristics. Again, choose for yourself, don't let anyone telly you what to buy, including me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:33:07


I would say yes
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:32:08
More specifically, what would be your incentives? Anonymity? Low fees? Taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:36:28
Idk about you but I saw something like 500 BTC to sell at $10K in that order book. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:57:03
Here we go with this fucking chart again
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:39:15
Nah, I'll just by more and HODL

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:33:07
Nah that app is pulling the wrong info, go to coinbase for accurate price, ATH is 9924
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:35:26
If you plan to hodl what difference does it make if it's lower the next day? Based on your comments I don't think you're ready to throw $2.7k at such a speculative and volatile asset. Just being honest with you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:56
Idk but all I️ know is that some guy on the internet is gonna eat his dick on national television

I cashed out my profits brother I’m still in the game long term!
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:46:30
It's considered hot, but honestly, I just keep all my coins in an exchange. Although there is always an extremely small risk, I trust them more than I trust myself with private keys. If I were moving tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars then yeah, I'd go with a cold storage
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:58
Haha oh shit you are actually Canadian. That's amazing

On December 4, 2017 at 14:55 EST BTC will drop to $8499 before reaching $11,235 at 23:59 EST on December 31, 2017. Just my personal opinion though.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:42:47
Didn't think of discounts. I agree, that would definitely drive up incentives. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:10:00
You sound jelly. And based on your post history you don't seem like a very likeable person. You're just a big sack of grumpy shit lmao  
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:29
No I missed that part sorry OP! Cash out and even if you invested yesterday congrats on making a solid return! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:35:46
As safe as you keep it yes. You won't need to worry about getting hacked but you will need to worry about keeping that paper wallet safe. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:22:19
Why didn't you buy this weekend, just honestly asking? No one has a magic ball. I would suggest learning as much as you can before investing. Investopedia, Khan Academy, Reddit, etc. Then get involved. Talk about it. Learn what your friends are investing in and why. If none of your friends are into crypto, look to see if there are local societies. Read what experts say and either agree or disagree with them, and ask yourself why. I still truly believe if you invest in BTC now, you will come out winning in time. The question is if you invest at an ATH, will you have the right mentality to keep holding even if it takes another 30% dip?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:21
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:17:13

I don't even know how that video didn't get flagged or much less how made it to the top of this subreddit. It was absolutely disgusting and painful to watch. I agree OP. There needs to be better moderation on this sub. The mental image of that video is still stuck with me. I can't even eat a damn bowl of cereal!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:35:13
Yeah I fully expect it to. CME and Nasdaq could also trigger a crash. Super speculative
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:40

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:31
Yeah I mean at least gold has *some* intrinsic values like being used in electronics or making tools, but it's not "worth" $1,300 for an ounce. We give it that value. The USD used to be backed up with the gold equivalent. Not anymore. Why is $100 bill worth $100? You cant eat it or live in it or use it toward anything. It has 0 intrinsic value. Again, we give it that value. How is Bitcoin any different? Instead of being a piece of paper with ink, its a mathematical formula. The difference is, there will only ever be 21M Bitcoins in circulation and it's estimated that 30% of those are lost. The US government can print out currency whenever they want, driving up the supply, making the USD inflate and worthless. Bitcoin, on the other hand, only has a finite amount of supply. When the demand rises, you cant just make more Bitcoin, so the price rises.

Coinbase: User friendly, convenient, mobile app, high fees
GDAX: Desktop version, low fees, bit more complicated (also owned by Coinbase)
Gemini: Desktop version, FDIC insured, user friendly, low fees
USB wallet (cold wallet): Nano Ledger S
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:53
You'll regain your losses I'm sure of it. I guess you always come out learning something at the end anyway!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:33:31
Hopefully but I'm fine selling now as well. Still in the green!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:31:36
There are so many variables. Do you plan on holding? How much do you believe in the technology and BTC specifically? Are you okay with investing now and losing 30% overnight? Will you get scared and cash out to try and minimize your losses? What if you lose 50% in a few days? How much do you even know about crypto? Are you investing in something because of the hype, or do you truly understand it?
What would I do? I'd buy now and hold. I'd forget about it for a few months. I see BTC growing quickly these next few years. I think the CME futures will add lots of value and volume to BTC and trading. It's a roller coaster though. Unregulated, decentralized and very very volatile. I'll continue to hold through crashes I truly believe in the tech and all of its applications. Take it from me, I've lost a few thousand trying to time the market and "buy the dips." Are there people that do it successfuly? Yeah plenty, but its a much larger risk and a lot more stressful. It's not for me. HODL. Believe. Moon.

@_date: 2017-11-06 04:29:54
Who's pooping their pants?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:22:02
It can also bring the price down a shit ton due to more people having access to shorting BTC
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:26:37
Great idea. I’m going to start handing out paper wallets with $5 worth of BTC to people
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:20
Quoting someone that told me this on another thread:


@_date: 2017-11-29 17:28:01
If you can afford to lose the money, then throw it in. No one knows where this is going. CME and now Nasdaq futures could trigger a crash but hell it could go all the way up to $40k before it does. You can ride the train, just don't be delusional and do believe it actually has true value. I would absolutely not consider it a savings account where you are theoretically guaranteed a return. High risk high reward, right?  
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:14:02
Bitcoin would have to reach: 
* $100,000 for you to make $9
* $1,000,000 for you to make $99
* $10,000,000 for you to make $999
If all the money in the world were to be converted into bitcoin right now, BTC would *only* be worth ~$3.5m.
The chances of you making anything significant off of 0.0001 BTC is very low. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:11:31
If we randomize 50% of the world population and agree that all of the money in the world is roughly equal to 80 trillion dollars, then 80T/21M = $3.8M/BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:24:31
I think its back up now
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:48:37
What are you then
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:00
It's riskier. Bitcoin always proves to take a hit when people sell off their profits at an ATH. Based on trend history, it's better to wait for that correction that to buy high. These are the rules that I stick to and the logic that I follow. It's been working out pretty well. Take it with a grain of salt. BTC can (highly unlikely) shoot to $9k overnight and you'd wish you'd bought at ATH. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:22:59

You mean the recovery phrase, in a brick, in your new house. It would start to get pretty annoying to begin breaking down your house every time you want to buy or sell crypto unless you've invested all you ever will and plan on hodling forever

Yeah I’m also wondering how your’s didn’t get filtered ��

If it was dumbass content why did it get 300+ upvotes?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:30:55
Right. I should’ve said the miners control the transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:05:13
Unless you have a couple hundred thousand dollars to throw at a mining rig, you won't be making much.

Why not 5 months?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:05:57
If you have your coins on an exchange you don't have access to your own private keys so you cant trade the coins until your exchange distributes them and allows for them to be traded. If you have your own wallet with your own private key, you get them instantly. 
Edit: Private keys is the address you use to withdraw a bitcoin from your account and send it to someone else. Public keys are what you give out to people to send you money. If someone somehow got access to your private keys, they can steal all of your bitcoins. That's why people like having their private keys stored on a "paper" wallet where you essentially print out your code and store it in a safe, or on a digital wallet. 
Here's a [link]( explaining it

You're like 11 hours late

I agree. For that reason and a few others, I'm trying to get rid of mine. Bittrex doesn't let me and price keeps dropping as the day goes on.

First time I heard of this one. Why did you decide to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:29:16
If we can agree that all of the money in the world is roughly equal to 80 trillion dollars, then 80T/21M = $3.8M/BTC. Am I doing this wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:30
Just out of curiosity and I don't mean to sound like a dick, but why did you wait to buy when it was rising faster than it has these past few days?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:32:13
Coinbase takes just as long sometimes. And the dip will be tomorrow at 22:55 EST.

Last week I posted a photo of paying off my car early due to BTC. I deleted it for personal reasons, mainly because I didn't want newcomers to invest without due diligence and expect to see the same results. Also, pretty sure I got doxxed but that's another story. I'm fairly new to crypto, yes, and I've been seeing a lot of comments like u/bacon80dog 's. This was directed at my "paying off my car early" post. Why are discouraging new people from joining? I've been doing my BEST to try to get people who don't know anything about crypto to learn more about its applications. How else are we going to expect people to adopt crypto as a commodity if we don't welcome them with open arms? Anyway, sorry for the rant. I've just seen dozens of comments like this that get upvoted and a few were directed at me. Not sorry for putting bacon dog on blast though. Thanks for the block buddy.

There is no sweet spot. Can’t really understand what you’re trying to get at

Buy and HODL

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:30:50

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:33

Edit: u/catvdog123 edited his comment, he had 8 thousand something, to begin with. Trolling us

Bank gives me fiat to buy bitcoin; IE lets me browse the web to download Chrome. Once the task is complete, the first one is no longer needed. I think its accurate
