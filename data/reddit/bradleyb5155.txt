so basically the "fork" needs to happen now, because in the future it will be to late?
What new rules are potentially being discussed for the fork?
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:31:56
What does the blue line represent? volume?
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:41:22

Sorry I mis typed the questions. I meant, how to create new send addresses
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:41:49
1 bit equals 100 satoshi, correct?
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:30:35
Will there be a change to "bits" or a different value given to the "coins"?
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:59:16
Lol ditto. That's what I would assume too
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:41:04

@_date: 2014-12-09 21:22:08
Sorry I mis typed the questions. I meant, how to create new send addresses 
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:44:39

@_date: 2014-11-03 19:43:19

@_date: 2017-01-25 20:49:26

@_date: 2018-12-20 07:44:14
You are right but I’m afraid crypto may not be the answer. But something certainly is... Gold? What do you think will perform best in the crash?
@_date: 2018-12-21 06:51:41
I suspect the price will be half of what it is now too.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:33:46
