And now gdax and coinbase are starting to go down

It's a weekly view so I'd assume even if there is potential for dips within the week, the net would be positive from week to week.

Aaaaaaand it's gone.

Okay, if you have your Bitcoin in an exchange, the exchange controls your coins. If the exchange goes down, so do your coins. Do you want to take that risk? Put them in a wallet where you have your private key, and they're protected and YOURS. Don't put your money in an exchange's hands and introduce that unnecessary risk. Your BTC is still going to fluctuate in value no matter where you store it, so keep it secure.

Because you'll make money.

I respect it, invest in yourself too. May regret it in a while based on price but do you :)

Something that happened to me was that I had BTC stored in a few different addresses, so when I went to send them to my ledger, the transaction was huge. That made the fees greater because even if I was only paying 100sat/b, the transaction was over 900 bytes due to sending from multiple addresses (6). Something to consider.

Hope for the Day is an awesome charity working to spread awareness about mental illness and help those with them, I don't think they accept Bitcoin however.

Not really, paying with credit/debit it's 3.99%, it's gonna be the same if you split it up or buy all at once

Dollar cost average, buy a little each day so the fluctuations level out.

I think on coinbase there's an option on the buy/sell tab that sets automatic transactions per time period, like daily, weekly, bi-weekly etc. Not sure about any other sites, don't use em.
