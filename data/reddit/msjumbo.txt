So there's a chance that the coins that hit my wallet are fake? How do I verify them? Is there a test? I'm still new to bitcoin.

I don't think you understand how much of a noob I am. I literally work as a barista. I made a bitcoin after a conversation with a customer. I'm excited but I literally know nothing about any of this. I don't think I want to do that stock stuff. This is enough to last me a life time. Can I get a bitcoin credit/debit card and pull out of an ATM?

I still don't know how to explain to them that I got it from a lottery?

Will do. However, do you have an answer for my question?

It's not about legality it's a moral thing. Abusing the system in ways that the average person simply can't. Someone needs to pick up this story asap

You're one of them you'd probably buy their shares and options just to get rich and fuck whoever else, there's more to life than money

Options listings depend the volatility, if there's enough historical data even when a company is private, you can have options listed pre-ipo and they're converted after the IPO
edit: and yes, the CEO was literally at the United Nations General Assembly last year and he isn't a politician -

Taxes do benefit society. And the act of keeping the early access to the IPO and options between a few people who benefit from it is pretty fucked.

It's to avoid paying taxes so that's a lot of money that could've went to society

That is a crime. But taxes aren't theft.
