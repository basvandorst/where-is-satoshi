For sure, have seen it many times. I think it comes from seeing new ideas come and go, and mostly fail.  
Because they're not "plugged in" to the latest things they cant separate the good new stuff from the crap. 
It's also part of getting old, you can only change your own paradigm so many times before you start to ossify.   
Facts of life Im afraid.

Aren't we supposed to have flying cars by now?  But seriously, there will always be outliers, but I think people transacting directly in Bitcoin is the last thing about Bitcoin to achieve mainstream adoption. All the other "making b2b work faster" and immutable data storage and remittance stuff will probably happen first. And yeah it will be slow, but value will be priced in long before mainstream adoption occurs, which could even be next year if we have a massive avalanche of investor confidence.

I agree.  In one sense you could think of Bitcoin as being the packaging that could be used to transport money on the network.  
In other words, bitcoin is the subway tunnel and fiat is the train (data is the passengers). So owning Bitcoin is like owning a section of the tunnel to transport money with, which will increase in value as more people wish to use the subway.

No I am not, neither are you.  I think new technologies will come out of the blockchain we will not expect.  
@_date: 2015-04-14 09:08:39
I don't know.   
But my speculation is that speculators are worried about the price going down, so they're selling too.  
The bigtime investors and technological true believers are the minority and we're getting down to the diamond-hard core of those invested soon..  
My guess is we'll stay at that level for a year or so, and then seemingly out of nowhere Bitcoin will re-enter the mass consciousness of the mainstream and start the next wave up.  This whole thing feels like waves of the ocean rather than a steady climb.

Well you've got what it takes to be a successful investor then.  It doesn't matter when you were born. 90% of it is taking calculated risks with your own money and learning from your failures. Big difference with real $$$ on the line. The 1st step is why 80% miss out. The second is why another 10% lose all their money.

'$300 would be a stretch' What are you smoking? Look at the long term trend. Although I think $10k is far fetched in the next 5 years, $1-5k in the next 2 is very realistic. Once the current wave of innovation comes online in the next 12 months the markets will price in the new found utillity and new understanding of Bitcoin.   The average guy still either hasn't heard of it yet, or thinks its dead.

"If there will be a need to upgrade traditional trusted currencies, with actual network effect, then they will be upgraded. Nothing to do with competing with bitcoin. The tech can't disrupt an industry by itself. You need to give a reason for people to actually use bitcoin. "
I see where your argument is coming from, but I must reiterate that Bitcoin and legacy currency is just not comparable. Apples and oranges.  
You're right that legacy currency can be upgraded using it's digital attributes to better serve us if/when needed.
 But there are things that it simply can't do/wasn't designed for. That's where Bitcoin comes in. 
For example the programmable money/smart contracts/being your own banker aspect. These are things that are fundamentally different. 
So we're not just talking about different weight classes here, this is a different sport.  If those other aspects become adopted, then because the blockchain and currency can't be separated, Bitcoin the currency will gain some traction. 
This isn't to say it will take over the world, no one credible is saying that.

Bad idea. Dont invest on a speculative asset using debt. if it doesn't pan out you will hate yourself. Put a percentage of your income into it, and if you lose, you'll be ok.
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:08:52
Well you are technically correct, which is the best form of correct.

He doesn't get it. Digital isn't taking over 'because its cool'. Its taking over because it wins over the old way. Its better. He comes across as parochial. I wonder how long till he does an about face?
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:12:44
While I have to respectfully disagree on several points, I want to stick to the topic at hand.
"Bitcoin does not have strong network effect"
I think the network effect mostly applies to its own industry/genre/application. For another 'Bitcoin like' currency to usurp Bitcoin would require a monumental effort because of the money and expertise already expensed into it. 
For example r&amp;d is already going into Bitcoin and so for someone else to build another superior currency from the ground up would require an order of magnitude MORE researching power/capital.
Now we all know legacy currency is digital for the most part, but I also don't think it's worth debating whether it's the same as Bitcoin, because it's obviously not.
Now my orginal question is really whether the government/banking system is capable/willing to do this. The network effect aspect as far as I'm concerned has researched a satisfactory concensus.

@_date: 2015-03-07 21:25:00
Ok, excellent.  I subscribe to the theory (in my layman's view) that the currency and the blockchain cannot be separated. 
So it stands to reason that the only way Bitcoin could be beaten from outside itself is for a competing currency to get some kind of government/banking traction ala 'blockchain dollars'. With the banks themselves mining it.
So hopefully the network effect will hold up to this threat as its easier/cheaper to just go with already existing architecture in the Bitcoin sphere.   
Not to mention that the banks would be competing against themselves by creating a currency they don't currently peddle.  
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:32:34
I hope it doesn't happen too quickly, BTC is no where near ready to handle that kind of traffic. What we need is a gentle incline for the next decade so problems can be solved as they become apparent.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:22:34
This is a direct attack on the principles of Bitcoin. "They" are trying to keep the banking power in the central banks. This deal will no doubt go through and its our job to out innovate them so that nobody wants to use FedCoin.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:20:47
Yeah I think we're very very early, many people will sell before it reaches it's much higher price. I think this will take a decade...too much work to do for it to happen within a year or 2.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:26:38
Fair enough. Now we're getting to the nitty gritty of it. If these things like smart contracts/being your own banker/programmable money etc attributes are truly an innovation that people/businesses want, then i think we'll see it grow. 
If you're correct and these are a waste of time then surely Bitcoin will slowly dwindle to nothing.
I respect your opinion, and I think time will tell this story. It will be interesting either way to watch though!

Very interesting. I hadn't thought about how the block chain would function between warring/embargoed nations. I think you're right that this could be a problem.  
If what Steven Pinker said is true (and I agree with him) the cause of the decline of violence and war since ancient times has usually been an increase in trade. Trading gives us motivation for peace. I would hope that the blockchain would do a better job of facilitating trade outside of political agendas than the current banking system does.
edit: spelling
I also totally agree that banking has become political in nature.

Missed the point of the post. This post was meant to be encouraging for the visionaries who will create the next generation of apps and support the future of Bitcoin. 
I never called myself a visionary. And Bitcoin is a much larger animal at full size than the superbowl or iphone. Let's compare apples to apples here. We're talking about a potential tectonic shift in world finance here. It's very, very early days.
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:19:40
There are many tasks besides just coding. Bitcoin must have a massive social component to survive. This includes education, marketing and other forms of support. 
PS I never called myself a visonary. I was speaking to the ones who will make the biggest impact for Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:06:41
I respectfully disagree. I think hording is just a phase of the lifecylce of a new currency.
Once appreciation has occured because of more like-minded people hording, then spending will commence which will lead to a new peak and trough cycle of hording/spending.
This will eventually stabilize with a higher price and more usefulness of the currency.

I fundamentally agree, but i think you've got it backwards. It's a store of value now and will become a currency later. We're still in the hording stage and few people are spending it regularly.

I did not specify a reason to be a visionary, only reasons to not be one. Visionaries have many reasons for pursuing a goal. Sometimes they just need a little coaxing, so they don't fall into conforming to get along. That was my point.
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:14:43
I think it's still early in the game despite Bitcoin having an obvious first to market advantage. Who knows what the future will bring and what new technologies may arise.  One thing's for sure though, Bitcoin stirred the pot and it can't be unstirred.

It's amazing how a post like this really brings out the trolls. 90% of the people who speak on it missed the point of the post entirely. Alot of people dropping chestnuts disguised as gems here. Not trying to sound pompous, but I think it's true. 
World finance has been sown up for so long by the banking system that most people don't realize how badly they're getting humped on a daily basis. This protection of the status quo by the trolls is tantamount to stockholm syndrome. 
A good example would be the court case in my home country (Canada) going on right now that is getting exactly zero media coverage but might just be the most important case in 20 years for the average Canadian. 
Check out:
I think it's becoming evident in the mass consciousness that the emporer has no clothes and people are going to be looking for alternatives. Banks are starting to be seen as "clip joints". Their downfall was their own greed and hubris.
