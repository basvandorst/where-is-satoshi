pywallet normally scans a block device, but it may be possible to scan the partially recovered file directly.
You have to change the command line parameters to match those of your system and situation
I have used recuva in the past too to get a wallet file that i mistakenly deleted
Note that i am very busy performing wallet recoveries, so i might not be able to work on your wallet if it is of low value.

This is fake. mavensbot has been using photo slicing and dicing tools such as Photo Shop and MsPaint since mavensbot was 14 years old and mavensbot has an eye for these sorts of things. The shadowing seen on the wizard staff does not match the shadowing on the transparent background, indicating that 5 different msdrawings were drawn and stitched together. Of course, most of you wouldn't notice this as you don't have an eye for such details. 
Please stop uploading doctored images as you are making a mockery of the professional mspaint profession, and are insulting the sensibilities of those who dedicate their time to draw true masterpieces. Reported.

The more people (including those involved with governments worldwide) have vested interest in Bitcoin, the less likely a concerted attack is.

This is an excellent article explaining very well the Byzantine general's problem and how bitcoin provides a solution.
However, even if I agree with the answer, I don't agree with its "jump to the conclusion".
Here is my take on that:
Whether one's believes in decentralization or in centralization, another of bitcoin core assets is that it is not deflationary for prices.
All currencies have price deflation built it, for some macroeconomic reasons about motivating agents that I don't fully understand yet. It could be a good thing for economic growth, or it may not be. Let's leave that issue aside.
The important thing is that Bitcoin doesn't. Being convertible with other currencies means its value can only rise (following the definition of deflation!)
So the only question is whether the rise in relative value - bitcoin inflation - will be faster than the fall of the goods prices' in the other currencies.
And that's where the decentralization part plays its role and the article gives the right answer : if you believe in decentralization and in parties acting in their own best interests, it will be faster.
If you believe in centralization and people acting for the others best interest, it won't be faster.
Bitcoin is a fun experiment on human behaviour :-)
In the end, bitcoin value will still rise - if only because it provides a way to escape from the deflationary currencies. The only question is how fast.
There are negative interest government bonds being sold right now - IIRC, Germany and France do that.
Why one would make sure to take a fall when a conversion in bit coin means that the value can be preserved?
The question of whether it is a good thing for economic growth remains. It doesn't seems to be.
I don't have bitcoin wealth. I wish I did because it seems like a very good placement at the moment.

Bitcoin is the future internet currency. We can see that other crypto currencies such as LTC have taken off into the stratosphere. I have inside information about new asic contracts in China and mining strike in Indonesia. Without having gone into this in detail thereby saving you the time you now have an intimate knowledge of bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently trading at $11.70, this will go to a $16.20 in the next few days.

_All currencies have price deflation built it, for some macroeconomic reasons about motivating agents that I don't fully understand yet. It could be a good thing for economic growth, or it may not be. Let's leave that issue aside._
Just to be clear, the reason that governments increase the currency supply is that citizens will do it with or without them. The most fundamental currency is a promissory note, an I.O.U. Every time you write someone an IOU you inflate the supply of currency, because the holder of that IOU can pass that around to others in the form of payment. Instead of sending your bushel of apples to the shoemaker who made your shoes, you now have to send half to the bread baker, and half to the candle maker as that IOU was spent.
A currency that doesn't grow will be naturally replaced by one that does. This is my biggest problem with bitcoin.

Hi ferroh. What a great comment. But you do realize that you are endorsing buying and trading bitcoins that may cause a lot of people (if they follow your advice) to lose money, right? Enablers like us are just another way of controlling, or attempting to control, the bitcoin economy around us. It gives us the opportunity to play the victim while others take advantage of our "helping", but the truth is that we are the creator of the problem. This subject is extremely complex and it sounds like you’ve seen your fair share of it.

link down, mirror up 
    [02:14:23] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Hello
    [02:14:55] *** Mode  +m by pirateat40
    [02:15:03] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Q: What's going on?  A: In short, one of my largest clients decided they would make things difficult for me.  In the heat of the moment I made a move to secure the USD backing the coins when they were not returned and has made things much more difficult.
    [02:15:09] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Q: Where have you been?  A: I realize not having information is annoying and somewhat concerning. I’ve stopped responding publicly until hard information was available due to some legal concerns that developed.  Once the attorneys (both mine and my clients) got involved, everything slowed down while everything was sorted out.
    [02:15:15] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Q: When will we get our coins? A: As of today the earliest estimated time that coins can begin moving is Friday, Oct 12th.  I can only keep you updated on this date as I have more information.
    [02:15:21] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Q: Why did you require PPT operators to submit their account holders information?  A: There’re a few reasons for doing this.  The largest of which was to remove the PPT operators from the added risk of their users claiming they were not paid once the main account was paid. The other reasons can not be disclosed.
    [02:15:27] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Q: What is going to happen with bond issuers? A: Since bonds can be traded and have taken a large hit due to the closure of BTCST, I’ll be working with the bond issuers to find a solution that best suits their investors.
    [02:15:32] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Also...
    [02:15:38] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Those looking to file a suit against me or BTCST will not be eligible for repayment.
    [02:15:43] &lt;pirateat40&gt; GPUMAX has never been associated with BTCST nor have any of it’s partners.  GPUMAX shared a wallet with one of the BTCST operating wallets for security and is now running it’s own secured wallet which is no longer associated with BTCST.
    [02:15:49] &lt;pirateat40&gt; Threats are taken seriously by myself and my attorney.  A few of you will find out how serious I mean.
    [02:15:55] &lt;pirateat40&gt; That’s all for now, I’ll be providing updates here when more information is available.  Thanks
    [02:16:13] *** Mode  -m by pirateat40

You are telling me that second life is not REAL?
Seriously Bugpowder, I am typing this comment sitting in a real chair, looking at a real computer, watching real characters pour onto a real screen at approximately 80wpm. You are also reading this in a state that should be obvious to you that is real. If second life is not real, if our experiences there do not constitute reality, if “virtual” really provides something sub-real, then I say that coloring a coloring page is not real. For if any of the aforementioned are not real, then when I sit down with a package of crayolas and disappear into the lines and counters of Tickle me Elmo armed with the color red, I am no longer living in the here and now. I have entered into that place where reality and fantasy are no longer distinguishable.

ASIC miners were supposed to come out at the end of last year. If the group that's built them is hoarding and using them, instead of selling them, that'd explain why so many of these coins are brand new &amp; how they amassed so many so quickly. In which case, we wouldn't have any idea what they plan to do with them - maybe they're going to start a traditional-style bank, or fund some big new initiative to bring BTC into the real world.
Food for thought.

Yes, as usual, the concept behind Bitcoins was interesting, a free currency out of the grasp of the IMF, but sadly, as all things unregulated fell in the drain.

"A currency that doesn't grow will be naturally replaced by one that does." seems right, as long as the minimal discrete value of the currency that doesn't grow cause a problem for the economy.
But if you can move from discrete to continuous space (bitcoins can be cut up to 1E-8, and according to what I've read this is not a fixed limit), why bother moving to the other currency ?

Sure, if they decide to stay anonymous they will surly not survive. In the case of bitfloor I don't see why the operators would burn it down. Bitfloor was a great business and growing monthly. They would have made that btc back within a year in fees.

I met one of the executives of Flattr at the Bitcoin session in OVC11 last year.
There were some discussions about it, but in the end it came down to a legal issue. The guys who founded Flattr are also the founders of The Pirate Bay, and everyone knows what legal shit TPB had to go thru.
They don't wanna get involved in anything that would even get them negative legal attention, at least not until a precedent is set. I'm glad they are looking into it.

Dear hardleft121
I don't know if you saw this coming (I didn't), but I've also decided to step down from volunteering at the bitcoin shelter. I have the private keys to the donation addresses that I'd been issued and can get it to you at your convenience, or I could drop it through the email slot if you'd like.
I'm so sorry about this! I really enjoyed my time with the r/bitcoin community but my workload has changed and I find myself having to cut back on my volunteer activities.
You can still count on mavensbot for occasional bitcoin  donations, of course. And please let me know if you ever need any help at events. Or, I could help with press releases or media promotion, as I have a background in marketing.
I also know of a few families who expressed interest in volunteering, and I can put you in touch with them.
Thanks so much for the opportunity to help out at the bitcoin shelter.

Dear hardleft121,
I hope this comment finds you in good health. It is being so long since we last met on the internet super highway. Yesterday I met with ferroh and while talking with him I recalled all the great moments of our bitcoin time.
Today we are not together because of our responsibility but still the memories of our friendship are still fresh like the rising bitcoin prices. The time we shared together, the fun we had in cyberspace, everything brings thrill to me whenever the memories of the early bitcoin days surrounds me.
 I want to thank you for being my friend and hope to comment on your posts soon.

I had the *exact* same thing happen to the build I did for my friend.
First of I remove all the power cables and removed the cmos battery from the motherboard.
Then I set the cmos jumper to clear, and I switched on with the ssd removed to make sure that it was cleared.
So then I switched off the pc, put the ssd back in and powered on, the ssd have the led and was still not being detected, so I cleared the cmos one more time with the ssd out, and put jumper back, this time I booted into the bios before connecting the ssd, then I went to my motherboards storage mode settings and switched it to raid mode, then connect the ssd by the sata power first, then the other cables. My led didn't come on but when I tried to boot windows it failed so I went back into the bios I set storage mode back to ide, then led stayed on and windows booted fine with no lose of data.
I hope this works for you, I'm so happy I got mine working and hope you can get yours working to.

the traditional wallet contains, among other goodies, private keys for your bitcoin addresses. a pool of 100 yet-unused keys is stored inside it by default.
every transaction you send, some of the incoming transactions, and every receive address you generate inside the client use one of those pre-generated keys which causes the key-pool to be repopulated with new keys.
a sufficiently old wallet backup will be out of keys which might render some of your bitcoins unaccessible. (back it up every ~~100 transactions~~ 100 actions)
deterministic wallets are only supported by alternative bitcoin clients. (back it up once)

for $100 worth, the quickest method to turn cash into bitcoins would be  via cash deposit. once you have the coins then you can transfer them to mtgox if you wish.
havent used dwolla in a long time, but i hear they are freezing bitcoin related accounts and all sort of delaying. wiring money to mtgox will take days and you will probably need to get verified. hope this helps.

Don't forget, ASIC chips are relatively cheap to manufacture (around $50 each). I think avalon is using 110nm, wait until they compress it to 28-nm.

Simply, past performance of bitcoin price is not a very good indicator of future performance. Just because it fell last time does not mean it's going to fall this time. It may but you really need to look at the reason it rose before and the reason it fell. The last time bitcoin was at $30 was 20 months ago. So much has changed with bitcoin in the last 20 months, it's ridiculous to assume the situation is the same. Not only that but 20 months ago bitcoin dropped largely because of the immature market. If you're dropping bitcoin because you think the same thing is going to happen you better be getting out of the market altogether because you're saying that there is going to be another bubble. Since 2009 bitcoin has been fundamentally restructured and has a lot of big bets out that have the potential to pay off big time if successful. It's not a sure thing but you could certainly do worse with your money.

Tell him you work for the us gov and you were assigned to buy many bitcoins from many buyers without going through exchanges. And then ask if he can supply you with 1million bitcoins within the next 6 months.

**I get paid 5k ripples for every time i mention ripple in a article.** Here is an example:
 	
The subject of ripple is a controversial issue. Advancments in ripple can be linked to many areas. Indispensable to homosapians today, there are just not enough blues songs written about ripple. It is an unfortunate consequence of our civilizations history that ripple is rarely given rational consideration by those most reliant on technology, who form the last great hope for our civilzation. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on ripple and its numerous 'industries'.
**Social Factors**
Comparisons between Roman Society and Medieval Society give a clear picture of the importance of ripple to developments in social conduct. I will not insult the readers inteligence by explaining this obvious comparison any further. The immortal and indispensable phrase ‘honesty is the best policy’ [1] failed to understand that if one seriously intends to 'not judge a book by its cover', then one must read a lot of books. No symbol is more potent than ripple in society today. It is crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle.
Some analysts have been tempted to disregard ripple. I haven’t. Society says that every man must find their own truth. While one sees ripple, another may see monkeys playing tennis.
**Economic Factors**
Economics has been defined as 'I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.' To my learned ear that sounds like two people with itchy backs. Of course, ripple fits perfectly into the Lead-a-Duck-to-Water model. Taking special care to highlight the role of ripple within the vast framework which this provides. 
There are a number of reasons which may be attributed to this unquestionable correlation. Well the cost of living has always depended upon ripple to a certain extent, but now more that ever. The financial press seems unable to make up its mind on these issues which unsettles investors.
**Political Factors**
Politics, we all agree, is a fact of life. Placing theory on the scales of justice and weighing it against practice can produce similar results to contrasting chalk and cheese.
We cannot talk of ripple and politics without remembering the words of award winning journalist Elijah Tuigamala 'The success of any political system can only truly be assessed once the fat lady has sung.' [2] I argue that his insight into ripple provided the inspiration for these great words. I feel strongly that if politicians spent less time thinking about ripple and put more effort into their family life, that we would have a very different country.
Where do we go from here? Only time will tell.
In my opinion ripple is, to use the language of the streets 'Super Cool.' It fills a hole, influences the influencers, and never hides.
I shall give the final word to star Uma Astaire: 'I demand ripple, nothing more nothing less.' [3]

I don't need 5 bitcoins for me... it's for my brother... he has cancer and he will probably not see bitcoin floorish... or even in see bitcoin recover from the latest drop. I'm doing my best, spending my time on the "get free bitcoin" sites, hit F5 every minute for new bitcoin giveaways, and I'll never going to surrender, because my little brother is half of my soul, and as long as I can I need to see him happy.
Thanks for your time.
