I'm about 90% sure you got a 0 because your teacher took umbrage at the fact that someone younger than them had a firm grasp on a concept they didn't understand.  Tell your parents everything that happened and they'll take care of it.

I'm not sure about getting gold, but you can buy CNY at a Travelex.  It's pretty straightforward.

At least you got some drugs out of it.  That guy spent the equivalent of $10,000,000 on PIZZA.

Firstrust used to be my bank like 10 years ago.  They were always pretty good to me.  Call them up without being a dick and I think they'll probably work with you.  Honestly, I'm surprised they're still open.  I switched to TD Bank because I heard Bank of America was going to acquire them (fuck BOA), so I noped the fuck out.

I'm still learning, but if I understand what I'm seeing, there seems to be like 3 main factors right now:
 - between hitting $150 and $1000, you had a bunch of new investors come in, which drove the price up.  Many of them are cashing out now, probably because it seemed like the big boom had passed.
 - then you have others who are trying to drive the price down so they can buy it cheaper (e.g. by spreading around misinformation about all wallets being compromised, hyping the crash, etc.).  This might encourage others to cash out for fear that they'll lose big if they don't.
 - finally, some other people may be cashing out in order to buy presents for their families/etc. on xmas.
WARNING: Don't actually listen to me.  I'm a Bitcoin-noob who only has like 0.005BTC, and all of this is purely conjecture.  There's a very good chance I'm completely wrong.

...and they keep posting it...
They're not the only ones that are glitched though, there was a "yellow pages" one that was messed up a few days ago too.

But if you live anywhere near a major city (like most people living on this planet), you're likely close enough to a company offering the same basic services, so it'd be manageable.  How many cities have Bitcoin ATMs?  1?  2?

Holy shit, Kevin Rose!  I've been a fan of yours since The Broken!  Glad to see you on here.

I'm also new to Bitcoin and found it so frustrating I haven't bothered actually buying any yet.  I've earned about $5 worth using that Bitcoinget thing where you watch videos and whatnot.  But, they really need a more straightforward way for me to just buy some.  It's easier to hire a team of designers in India than it is to buy some Bitcoin (and they cost roughly the same amount).
