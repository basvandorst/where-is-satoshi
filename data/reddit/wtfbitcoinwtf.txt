and this:I am writing further to your e-mail of July 18, 2013, where it appears that you are seeking a determination with respect to your business, namely, you would like to know if your business needs to be registered as a Money Services Business (MSB) with FINTRAC. I note that you were previously advised by FINTRAC on both June 25, 2013 and July 18, 2013, that your entity is not engaged as an MSB in Canada as per the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and its associated Regulations.  Based on these previous responses, in addition to the information you have provided below, namely that you, “provide ‘payment’ for digital product,” your entity is not, at this time, engaged in the business of foreign exchange dealing or remitting or transmitting funds by any means or through any person, entity or electronic funds transfer network as per the PCMLTFA and its associated Regulations.  In fact, your entity doesn’t provide the services of remitting and/or transferring funds for the sake of the service; the transfer of funds is simply a corollary of your actual service of buying and selling virtual currency. 
 
Therefore, you cannot register your entity with us.

I remember sitting at work on a computer and watching clarkmoody, telling my client I was watching a historical event in the making.   I remember zooming out of that buy / sell depth graph, and seeing what resembled a 1000 foot tsunami buy wave ready to crash down into the sell  ocean floor.  It was amazing and it was history in the making.  Yeah :)

I can confirm my bank account has been frozen and my funds locked with no notice because of dealing with bitcoin exchanges.  Further.. I can not  "unlock my funds" without a mass supply of paperwork the bank has demanded.  (TD Bank)  
The bank can decide who you can deal with and who you can't.  Further, they can lock YOUR own money in their system without warning and refuse to give you your own money until you meet their requirements.... bullshit.
The banks are a 100% attack.

everyone knows Darkcoin is just hype pre-mined coinjoin crypto.   If you want anonymous transactions check out XC coin - the coin the drk fanboys  are really scared of. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:58:54
Because the network is self aware. ;) when an address is used the network learns by design.  Yes this is future.

they continue to mine profiting off transaction fees instead of block rewards. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:06:46
right - you think it is OK for VISA and Mastercard to instruct merchants that they can NOT charge 2% more for the same product if the client decides to pay using the visa or mastercard system.  So to ensure merchants are not loosing out on income due to processing fees all sale items are priced 2% higher ? 
What about paypal where the fee is roughly 4% ? 
Would it not be ideal to price everything 4% lower and say "its 4% lower now because we do not have to pay out 4% to gerraderp processing co?

XC is still in beta stage for anon transaction - but it has working proof that the anon features are working.  On the XC network EVERYONE with wallet can be a "masternode" - in XC they call this "Xnode"  - xnode is a decentralized mixing service, actually pretty sure XC was the very first to have anon decentralized mixing service working... unfortunately darkcoin press overshadowed xc... and darkcoin supporters spread lies about XCs source which drove its price into the ground recently... I suggest you go to   and make your own decisions about the coin

Hello fellow Canadian - I can vouche for virtex and vault of satoshi - virtex been around longer.  I have not had issues with either exchange.  More volume on virtex I think so maybe try there first. 
QuickBT is an easy way to get coins fast but does not allow large purchases of coins, still very reliable and trustworthy though.
Hope this info helps eh!

Purchasing power (sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation) is the number of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency. For example, if one had taken one unit of currency to a store in the 1950s, it is probable that it would have been possible to buy a greater number of items than would today

Your statement is not true.  There are many things such as scrypt PoW , x11, x13 pow, or even PoS that can not be built on top of bitcoin... (at least not without forking it).. true anonymity can not be built on top of bitcoin... not without fork.   You are basically saying that we have TCP IP.. but there is no need for any other protocols.. ever.

@_date: 2014-06-23 19:28:17
They want letters from the companies that were depositing to my account and they want receipts from people that I purchased bitcoins form.  Yes RECEIPTS for a digital currency transactions.  Yes you are right I guess.. I dont want to be their bitch and I wont be.  What I am saying here is, dont trust banks to keep your money safe.  At the BANKS discretion they can lock your funds without warning and at their will.

Name ONE that will?  I can name about 5 major ones that will lock your funds and prevent you from accessing your own money if you dare touch Bitcoin.

Would in not be smart to implement something INTO the protocol so that any single pool can NEVER have &gt; 49% of the pie??? 
Your theories of "no one will do it else they will destroy the value they spent"... hell man if I am a big bank and want to crush bitcoin I am sure I can spend a few BILLION on chips to hit that 51% and destory bitcoin.
something needs to be done - what CAN happen WILL happen - eventually.  No hard code to prevent this is really really bad.
At the VERY LEAST there should be rules or standards that miners MUST follow in order to mine any bitcoins - one of those rules should be that they can never have more than 50% of the pie... anyone else agree?

@_date: 2013-07-07 14:30:48
exactly - they are following laws that do not exist yet in canada... just for the sake of following the american laws - and trying to allow the banks to "like them".   Fintrac does not know what a bitcoin is nor does it care at this point - KYC rules do not apply on bitcoin trades - although it is advisable by some people to follow such rules to avoid any association with money laundering and terrorist financing.  - so basically they really don't have to follow these rules, but they are choosing to anyway... which was probably advised by their lawyers.

TLDR version ? 
@_date: 2013-08-31 17:10:10
I disagree with you both.  The higher the difficulty - the less coins the individual miners get  - I know this because I mine bitcoins and I am getting FAR less coins then what I used to get back in 2010 due to extreme difficulty increases over time. So much less in fact that I dont want to sell them at low value, so I hold them until the price goes up so that I can turn profit...

This is all wrong (I live in Canada) .. Canada sales tax is not 5%... Alberta Sales tax might be... with that said you should NOT be taxed on a TRADE - the trade is not a SALE it is a transfer of funds..  Further it a digital TRANSACTION - not a SALE.  They should only be paying taxes on the profits collected off the trades - not each and every trade taxed.

my thoughts: Bitcoin WILL encourage SAVING.  Is this really a bad thing???? People will still have to SPEND when SPENDING is Necessary (example. you need a new car, your going to buy a new car... your kid needs education, your going to spend on the education, you need food, your going to spend on food.)  My opinion - BITCOIN PROMOTES SPENDING WISELY and not FOOLISHLY .  The End.

Satoshi is my step brother... we got talking one night after some rum and cokes.  He told me he was working on this protocol for  web 2.0 money.  We laughed, played chess, played some super mario kart.. it was a good night. That is how I learned about Bitcoin.  True story.

it would be hard to make them all cheaper than what they are worth - however I was thinking it would be possible to have "weekly deals" where some cards are priced below their equivalent $$ amount when paying in BTC..

last time the reward halved the price insta doubled... it was around 16 dollars I think... it could happen again... but yes this time people will see it coming and pre buy in at much earlier time.  Last time it happened no one really knew if the reward half meant the price should double or just kinda slightly go up or what..  Less money for miners, means less dumping from miners at lower prices.
