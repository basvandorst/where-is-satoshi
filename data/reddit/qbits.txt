i fail to see how this move would help liquidity at all.  what you take from one side is given to the other.
for example:  you now turn everyone into a "market maker" while discouraging "takers".  this could actually have unintended consequences of decreasing activity.   we'll see.

why are you selling?
@_date: 2012-01-15 05:44:16
your story sounds fishy to me.  i've moved way more money than you have thru their accts w/o ever a problem.

i think you have to look at what else Schmidt says:
9:38 am Q: You're talking about the internet almost like a human right?
9:39 am A: If the current governance is working pretty well, then I wouldn't move it. There's a lot of concern that moving governance would further balkanize the internet, and that would be a disaster. The core thing that the internet has done is flatten access.
9:40 am A: The internet is one of the greatest achievements of mankind. DO NOT GIVE THAT UP EASILY. I cannot be more emphatic. Be very careful about moves that seem logical but balkanize the internet.
THIS is positive for Bitcoin as the only way to shut it down is to shut down the Internet.  And they won't let that happen.

i've followed your gold musings for years.  which do you think will eventually win out; gold or Bitcoin.  personally, i think there can only be one winner; Bitcoin.

its great to see a former skeptic, Timothy Lee and author, turn bullish on Bitcoin.  i had to smile when i read his disclaimer.
@_date: 2012-03-11 23:36:26
well change the title!

its already made it to 3 yr and i bet you're surprised.

Greece will leave the euro and while the author says things aren't bad enough yet to move to Bitcoin, just wait.

"Bitcoin’s proponents will have to await an SEC or court interpretation for certainty."
i don't think proponents are waiting for anything from the gov't.  nor do they care.

what is SEO?

have u ever heard of innocent before proven guilty?

the banks are a bunch of corrupt cronies trying to protect themselves from the Bitcoin revolution that will over time crush them.  efficiency and fairness will not be denied.

the title of this post probably meant to ask when the block rewards drop to zero.  careless.

you gotta wonder about the political motivation of this article.  it was written as all pie in the sky for the NSA with no hindrance or obedience of the law or Constitution.  perhaps psychological warfare is found to be more effective by the NSA and gov't.

is that his real name/identity?

Google couldn't possibly create a rival otherwise it would've been centralized within Google.
Bitcoin is unique and Schmidt acknowledged it was a great idea.
he also said they wouldn't let the Internet die.

nice job matonis
@_date: 2012-07-07 05:01:30
this is certainly good news.
@_date: 2012-02-29 03:27:47
just another acknowledgement from a large powerful tech company that the USD is toast.

so what does this mean for Intersango?

that same incentive will exist when the Bitcoins received will be from tx fees.  so how is then any different than now?
