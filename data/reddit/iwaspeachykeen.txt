Actually, something pretty shitty happened to me in real life too. Back in October I decided to put a little bit into litecoin as well. It was around $80 at the time, which was an all-time high for it. Within a couple weeks it dropped down to the mid 50s, and stayed there for a while. After it got back to just above 80 again I decided to pull out and put it into bitcoin. that was about two weeks ago. Within a week of me pulling out, it was at 360 and I’ve been trying not to think about that too much. Bitcoin’s done great of course, but it would’ve been really cool to be a part of, and would’ve been quite the profit if I had left it alone

it dipped to 15.7 after being at 17.7 this morning. nothing to be seriously concerning, but for people like daytraders who are trying to sell high and by low, that could’ve been quite a bit of money to make in just a few hours
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:06:08
had a dream that it dropped to the hundreds, and i had thousands set aside for a dip. literally shaking, i panicked trying to move money to an exchange and it kept rejecting and the price was rising like it did last week, by hundreds every few seconds, and i couldn’t catch it and it was back at 10,000 and then i woke up in a sweat and teared up a bit

just because something has never died before doesn't mean it can't. Everything that has died never died before it died

don't apologize, that guy is stupid.. haha

in the simplest terms, there are a limited number of bit coin, and very few are released at a time. So because there aren’t a ton more bitcoins being created, when demand is up, it drives up the price. Because bitcoin is being talked about so much, a lot of people are running out to buy some because they hear it’s a good cryptocurrency to invest in. On top of that, there’s a bunch of stuff going on with the fork in the block chain, which is a whole other conversation that can get complicated. Suffice it to say that there are changes going on in the market because of some things, and even previous bit coin holders are putting more of their money into bitcoin. all of this is making for an increase, currently, and estimates say it will just continue to grow and grow until a single bit coin is worth tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. that will be a few years, at least, but we’re definitely seeing the changes happening now

so if I understood correctly, the steps are:
1. A=&gt;B
2. A=&gt;C
3. C=&gt;Bx
4. profit

good point, but I know a couple people who have considered selling theirs right now while it seems to have at least *some* value, because their estimation is that it will dip first, even if later on it does rise higher. So in that case, having sold it for $300, if it drops to less than 100 they buy up more, and wait for the rise. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:12:34
in that case you have control of your private keys, not a third party, which means they should both be safe. 
edit: once you move them to a different *safe* Bitcoin wallet[B], you can then export the keys of the first wallet [A] to a BCH enabled wallet [C] and now you have successfully split your coins. it is recommended to do this on separate computers, because it's not always safe to do it on the same one as the your BTC keys can be exposed depending on the software used.
[this is a good thread ]( that explains that
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:08:11
do you just go around and put this on every post?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:59:58
it's definitely not a bad idea to invest what you can, in my opinion. But I was just saying, if you're doing it that slowly you probably won't own a whole bitcoin unless it DOES crash
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:26:47
telling someone to go to another sub when they are on a sticky'd thread specifically for discussing  Bcash doesn't make any sense dude. If you don't want to (or can't) answer just don't answer
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:00:18
where are your bitcoins currently?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:53:02
with estimations, it will not stay around current price for even a few short months, and within years it could be over $10,000 apiece
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:06:25
is it die troll or diet roll
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:00:41
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:57:19
I mean, $100,000 is a bit much, we could probably adopt a smaller unit at $10,000, or even $50,000. but yeah, $3,000 is probably not a big deal
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:23:59
people? Maybe corporations, and even then it's not that quick. Accounts get frozen when approaching 100,000, much less 160 million
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:53:38
well, since *everyone* is trying to do that right now to get their BCH, it's going to be a lot of transactions waiting in line to go through. could be a while, not to mention Kraken is one of the few places doing that so their site is probably overloaded as it is
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:56:58
teach them while they're young and they'll learn their lesson. "Fool me once" am i right

damn, let me know if it works. I might have to join in on that
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:46:44
just read about a guy who mined until he had over 1000 coins, and waited till they had hit $10 apiece and sold. Probably made a good profit, but he'd be a super millionaire right now if he had waited
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:41:11
sounds morbid, but the rest of us will benefit from that, because it adds to its value when there are an ever increasing amount that will never be touched again. even if thats a slow process, even the smallest bit helps
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:18:34
how do I go about moving my bitcoin off of Coinbase and on to Gemini? Is it pretty straightforward?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:06
Well if you also have a wild sense of curiosity, you should look up the bull penis. obviously not safe for work, but interesting enough that you feel more scientific than perverted when you look it up
edit: since to sense, freakin voice to text. also, wanted to add that bull penises can be hardened into a wood-like rod, and used as a walking cane (or beating cane)
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:22
a few? the story i read, it was 2 pizzas bought for 10,000 bitcoins in 2010, at the time worth maybe 20 bucks. or today, 70MM  $$
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:45:32
i dont know what to think, because that would make sense to me, but I saw a bunch of people in another thread saying that they’re expecting even more of a jump after the fork than we’ve had already the last couple weeks. don’t really know the reasoning, but..
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:23
uh... why? should we start blurring milk cow udders, too? its a chunk of raw meat dude

Not only are people living longer, but technology and society in general are changing at an exponential rate; blows my mind when people think that innovation will really take so long in today’s world
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:28:54
every time it goes up a little bit, more people hear about it who have never heard of it before, and they’re all buying in. I have family that I’ve tried telling about bitcoin for years suddenly asking me how to buy in because when I said it didn’t mean anything, but now it’s all over the news and of course that’s a much more reputable source. It’ll probably go up for a little bit more, maybe even hit 20k within the next month or two. Then, once everybody who would be willing to put into this has done so, it will probably settle a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:23
my buddy told me he loves it during celebratory sushi last night. blew my mind more than the bitcoin rise. said he can’t wait to tune in to that kid Sheldon show, whatever it’s called

why didn’t you just say 1btc=25¢? jw

not impossible. just not used by the creators for the main characters. did you forget the ballsack from the fourth dimension?

oh, rereading your comment and I realized I could’ve deduced that. Thanks for the response though
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:32
not true

Good info, I appreciate it. I’ll read up some more, it’s nice to have a starting point though. thanks again

it’s at 4300, at 4250 an hour ago. so there’s that

pretty sure we’d feel the bit coin world shaking if any large amount of coins moved
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:19:51
i mean i see where you’re coming from, and i probably agree, but comparing it to homelessness, child poverty, and wage issues is arguably ridiculous. since when did poor people’s problems affect the kind of people with enough income to put into an account not to be touched? its an entirely different scenario. there probably wouldn’t be an uproar big enough to change anything, but not for the same reasons as the populace not giving a rats ass about the poor.

huh? he said ‘what amazon did to retail’
as in, instead of going to the store, (sometimes three different stores), to order all of the things I need, I just do it on Amazon and wait a couple days. It disrupted the retail industry. not the post office
