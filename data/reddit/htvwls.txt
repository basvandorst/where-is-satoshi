Why not?
I don't get this.  If you used a particular private key to create a legacy address, and had that loaded into an old-school wallet.dat on some old copy of Bitcoin Core client, then sent coins to that address...
...what would subsequently show in a modern wallet if you imported the exact same private key?  Would that newer wallet not show your balance? If so, would it have to show it as a legacy address to see its balance?

Can they all use the same private key?
Like, if I have a really old legacy address, and have the private key for it, can I make a corresponding Segwit address from the same private key?
If so, would any funds showing on the legacy address also be showing at its segwit equivalent?

1 BTC means at most owning 1 BCH, etc... which is approx 390 USD right now, and BSV is about 194 USD. The less valuable coins are quite a bit lower than that, so at a guess you might squeeze ~$700 extra value out of your 1 bitcoin.
You might need to factor in download costs, if your ISP plan has a data cap, etc... and of course your own time. Only you can decide if it's worth it or not.
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:00:41


To offer a simple analogy: The address is your glass jar. It may only be *one* jar, but that jar can be filled with pennies or bills, and that still makes a difference when it comes time to spend it.
A "wallet" in the context of bitcoin, is just a collection of jars.

Sorry, I've only personally claimed BCH so far... not the smaller ones.
But essentially it goes like this:
Create a brand new BTC address (something backed up of course) not in the same wallet, and send all your BTC to it. Then, with your empty wallet file, import that into a BCH client, and repeat the process (send all the BCH funds to a different, newly created BCH wallet).
As I said, I've only claimed bcash so far, because I did the entire operation myself locally, downloading many gigabytes of bch blockchain for essentially just 1 transaction.
I'll just stop there because realistically, there will be many people out there a lot better than me at writing a guide (sorry).

No problem. One more word of advice: try to aim to claim them in descending order of value.
e.g. Don't load your wallet into a bcash client before emptying the BTC out of your address.
...then, empty the BCH out of your address before letting any smaller coin clients see your key.
Just overall less risky.

It is *possible*, because miners choose what transactions to include, and even if no other miners want to include free transactions, it's *possible* that you could mine the block that includes your tx.

Thanks, this is the missing skill for me. I know a fair bit about handling bitcoin, but I haven't used Electrum before.
So, I'll install it on the laptop, create a transaction there, and somehow save that transaction to a USB for putting onto a live laptop, for broadcasting to the web?
I'm guessing Electrum comes with instructions for those first steps, but how about the broadcast step? Once I have a file on my main PC that represents the transaction, how do I get that broadcast?
Thanks for your replies.
Sorry, I'm a little confused about how an air-gapped wallet works with a software that doesn't come with the full blockchain.

Not sure why you would pick an example that I've already opined shouldn't be a crime.

I fundamentally disagree that *intentions* can be proven.
Regardless, intentionally causing panic is far and away completely different to causing bodily harm directly.


Yes, absolutely - all words should.

Same thing. As I said earlier, the responsibility for acting on speech or not acting on speech falls to the listener.

Just a locally saved copy of the javascript site *bitaddress*.
The laptop has no blockchain files or normal 'wallet.dat' on it. 
Actually not much more than just a private key in a text file at the moment.

You're definitely at fault if you can't objectively discuss an opposing opinion without dismissing it as looney.
(And you wanted a "civilized" discussion)
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:04:22
Not a fan of either of those in the slightest, but insider trading shouldn't be a crime. It's essentially punishing people for knowing things.
@_date: 2019-04-13 08:30:30
Bottom line though, if you want to argue that releasing certain information 'puts lives at risk' then I can argue just as legitimately that *refraining* from releasing that information puts lives at risk.
The only reason you can't admit that's true is because you hold an opinion something along the lines of "Bad guys' lives don't count".

I didn't notice the double L at first, and thought your post was a commentary about AML/KYC laws being a phishing scam.

Absolutely. But nowadays I have less than 10 BTC and a fairly mediocre existence. Certainly no $160,000,000 sitting around.

If no-one else will, I'll deny it. We only have one Bitcoin fork (BTC), anything other than that isn't Bitcoin, regardless of its genesis block.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:20:35


No, they call it Bitcoin Cash because they want to trick people into thinking it's Bitcoin.

It's basically a neutral term similar to 'laundering' but without the negative/criminal connotations.
Plenty of good reasons why moral people would want to launder their money, but we can't use that word.

0.84 USD... you probably discovered it almost exactly the same time as me. It was actually due to Slashdot's "$1 bitcoin!" article, but then it had dropped a little after that.
I proceeded to load up on about 20,000 of them, and then offloaded pretty much all of them for about $10 each. I felt like the king of the world for making "so much profit".

Yeah, it's pretty horrible. Mostly I just try not to think about it, but occasionally I can't help myself and calculate 20,000*current price.

Wow, congrats, despite the obvious pain of hindsight.

The point is the amount of coins available is much lower than all bitcoins. I wouldn't even say 14m are available. Not at anywhere near current prices anyway.

Thanks for your reply. I have already decided to 'bother' for this particular address but just need to find the most practical way.
For dust-like addresses I've only got to the point of selling the bcash... using a very manual process on my own PC with the bcash client and blockchain.
I guess if there's no automated way, what I'm really looking for is just a really good up-to-date list of forks, so that I can download their respective client software/blockchains and go from there.
(I think mostly I'm looking to do 99% of the operation myself, preferably not relying on 3rd parties such as exchanges to do the splitting for me)

The problem is that 'dirty' money is labelled as such by third parties to the transactions (e.g. governments), even in cases where a moral person wouldn't consider it dirty at all. e.g. selling drugs in a 100% voluntary agreement among adults.
