It's nice to see other riders in r/bitcoin
Have fun with your dirt beast! There's nothing quite like dirt biking.

Similar password issue, they resolved it within 2 days. Their support is good. Since it's a real person that takes care of your issue, yeah it's expected to measure the time in days. Don't be spoiled, and take extra care not to forget passwords next time :)

Friend, why don't you take a few more days to settle down, and read up on what you're investing into?
Bitcoin is largely divisible. Much like you can exchange Euros for 0.50$ and nobody forces you to buy full dollar coins, you can buy decimals of Bitcoin, for the appropriate price.

About the quantum mentions in your post:
There exist no quantum computers that can even run basic algorithms right now. The most advanced quantum computer is 52 qubits long. Quantum attacks are literal decades away.
Plus, HMAC-SHA family algorithms can (and some already are) quantum resistant, meaning even ternary computers such as quantum ones cannot break them.
Keep that in mind, I think you needn't worry.

Being able to reverse engineer a SHA256 is improbable. If they managed to do that, they would not only be able to destroy Bitcoin, but modern cryptography and computer security as we know it. They'd be beyond billionaires.
Plus, because hashing algorithms take any-amount-of-data as input, they would simultaneously have discovered the greatest compression+uncompression algorithm known to mankind.

You're absolutely correct. The two idiots on the Twitter thread are trying to impress people with double-speak and pseudo-terminology.

"Ναι, φυσικά είναι δύσκολη". Proper gender for adverbs is the neutral gender, and "φυσικά" is a better equivalent for "naturally" or "of course", as "φυσιολογικός" is used in the more formal or biological sense, as in "normal, not different than the accepted norm". Congrats again on learning Greek, I don't think I could do it as an adult if I hadn't done it as a kid and spent literally a decade on it.

You seem to be confused about what a Schnorr signature scheme is, and the differences to the current function. 
You should read up on this summarised comparison between ECDSA and SCHNORR on the bitcoin stackexchange: 
Otherwise, please know that many technical concepts cannot be concluded simply in phrases such as "hey, this is 30% faster" or "hey, this takes less space.
Complex design choices such as the proposal for migrating from ECDSA to Schnorr sigs have depth and touch on multiple levels Bitcoin.
