He paid for a hit on a fake person. In his mind he killed someone. It says this on the court documents that he fell for an elaborate scam.
He never got charged because that person didn’t exist.
Please explain to me how that’s fake. I’m losing my shit.

Ok so even if someone puts out a hit on a fake person they would still get charged?

He was never charged because Red&amp;White scammed him? It was an elaborate scam he fully believed he paid for someone to be killed. 
You read through the message logs correct?
So even to him he believed those hits were real. I believe that he shouldn’t get life in prison because no one actually died but this doesn’t make sense?

So why did the guy send $1,000,000 to a guy in Canada then? I could understand if the logs were fake but why did he do that, you can’t fake the bitcoin transactions

I appreciate you taking the time to respond.
I keep going back and forth here because of the freeross.org stuff that seems pretty iffy.
It seems like the popular opinion is this guy is 100% innocent which is making me think I’m going insane.

I understand, but do you think it would have been different if he actually killed someone?
Like if he actually got his hands on a hitman would he have killed off anyone that tried to hinder his business?

There’s literally a bitcoin transaction sent at the exact same time to red&amp;white for 1500btc?
I’m referring to the friendly chemist blackmail scenario.
Red&amp;white was arrested in Canada he didn’t work for the feds. 
So you don’t believe he actually paid for those hits?
