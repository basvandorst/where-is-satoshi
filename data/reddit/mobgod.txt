Question what market are they using??
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:23:08
Thanks for pointing that out big guy
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:51:29
why would you even buy any GoxBTC
@_date: 2012-12-29 18:19:00
Lol still don't see it
@_date: 2012-12-29 17:54:52
What side bar I'm on a mobile phone could you just tell me? ?
@_date: 2016-07-17 11:48:49
Correct do you see what you typed, you spent weeks looking into it just don't want people to get the wrong idea
@_date: 2016-07-17 10:38:10
OK that's fine but I'm sure you see my point, if I was rich and told you to buy apples are you going to do it? RESEARCH FIRST
@_date: 2016-07-17 01:41:33
Question why does this matter? 
@_date: 2016-07-17 03:53:06
OK I don't want to debate it but I'm just saying don't think he's a guy that can sell btc. BTC sells itself
@_date: 2013-10-14 06:39:36
Sorry wrong person I was on the wrong screen :(
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:49:38
Yes I tried to edit the post but couldn't do it from the mobile app, but I'm so set thanks
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:09:49
What will that do for me, if I did buy from them before without this problem?
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:08:36
I gotcha, what I'm trying to point out people need to go research first and not buy BTC because they are told to. I've been in the game a long time I've seen people go as quick as they came
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:16:57
Any links out there to see how I can get the chain on the stick also
@_date: 2013-10-15 20:06:42
Crap here is the link 
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:53:28
People were using tons of btc to buy drugs maybe this will get more input...
@_date: 2016-07-17 03:46:26
Ok fans are not going to buy btc because Joe says so.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:14:12
Is that cashintocoins.com ?
@_date: 2013-10-14 04:43:09
Here you go for your moon 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:43:52
Going to try that again but the problem I've found is when the screen goes off than I turn it back on the widget didn't refresh
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:12:00
It's on btc38 also that is big plus vir
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:17:04
i guess making 800k off 27 bucks is not a bad thing !!!!
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:20:26
Thanks but that link looks like it's for a pool don't see how you can order anything
@_date: 2013-10-16 03:12:55
I would also like to know how much you would charge?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:17:33
Thanks are you able to help with this ?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:45:28
Ok look into DGC don't think you can go wrong just my 2 cents
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:18:09
Cash out lol !!!!
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:10:44
That's what I said had to be China
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:34:24
So no rig to buy to see a return at all right now ?
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:38:19
Yes I did I said it was for dgc but I posted in bitcoin because off the knowledge
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:54:07
OK I think I did it right could you check on this than I'll try to send back
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:46:14
Can't believe someone down voted this when I think it was a great question to ask
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:48:47
I have I don't think they have anything to process CC it's for a food vending truck
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:09:25
No you just did give me a answer thanks..
@_date: 2013-10-14 04:29:22
What could be causing this spike ?
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:53:56
How would that work if I'm using square right now I don't think they have api access or anything like that
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:34:19
Kinda crazy when you think about it 115k
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:32:21
It's not for btc
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:10:56
OK but looking for the best share info, what does it mean the higher the number the better ?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:40:30
True but very close 
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:58:30
Thanks seems like the best way for me
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:09:02
Ok is it possible to have more than one wallet file on a card example btc ltc just name them btc.dat than when I need them rename again to wallet.dat ?
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:12:53
Do you suggest anything ?
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:20:15
Thats a good question i would like to know also
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:35:59
I did state the coin first of all, so not sure why you posted anything without reading it all
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:28:53
OK how would I get that ticker to work with it, if that's what your saying to me
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:27:23
OK thanks can we test send to me and I'll do the same back
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:22:02
DGC I thought there was a way to do this views I could be wrong also
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:57:37
How does it work did you figure it out ??
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:23:44
not my first time
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:14:19
Well each address is going to be loaded with coins, so I'm trying to see if I need to open my wallet and just make 60 of them with labels or if there is a easier way? Btw it's not for btc but I did post in here because of all the knowledge.
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:52:32
Lol thanks
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:50:27

@_date: 2013-10-26 08:31:39
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:34:41
OK what I would like to know is if it's possible to accept CC than turn that into btc, so If you pay for your food with a CC can that be turned into btc, guess what I should be getting at any payment processor that does this?
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:42:03
I don't remember seeing that in the video can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:17:05
What is the link for them ?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:47:21
I checked them out already what I need is for the private key to be printed on the sticker than when peeled the key is there,I need to apply the sticker myself if that makes sense to you
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:09:27
How could I do this to my nexus 7 ? Not the root part just the ticker like you have 
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:18:31
very true indeed 27 dollars for 800k not bad at all
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:00:59

@_date: 2013-10-15 19:53:20
The site I posted in the link, did you not see it ?
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:34:03
Your joking correct
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:24:28
