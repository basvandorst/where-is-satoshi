You're missing his point.  What if, in the future (however unlikely it may be) that it becomes illegal to own an iPhone, and anyone who searched for information on them, can be put on a suspect list.
While its a bit silly for this example, its not too hard to see how it could be used against that searched for something legal in their teenage years, that was made illegal later on down the track.

Never thought I'd see my local rag on r/Bitcoin.
But yes 10% GST makes it unfeasible to buy here now 
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:12:56
One of the other posters on that list hit the nail on the head


@_date: 2014-02-27 00:45:18
Isn't hindsight amazing?
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:50:46
It seems silly now, but back then, how else would you get information on email systems without having access to an email system?
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:44:31
I suppose that is what I am after, moving them to somewhere that I can then send to another address, but what I am asking what is the best online/offline wallet that has this functionality?
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:21:07
This.  You cannot get "good" at gambling.  You got lucky.
@_date: 2013-06-30 21:36:05
Nice, seems like something you'd see on a merc down at emporium in the valley. I'll keep my eye out ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:16:34
Wow thanks man!  I already knew you could see the balances and transactions but it never occurred to me to look up his.
Thanks again!

Nevermind the noise in a small dorm room, it would be like trying to live in a data centre
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:31:05
Great article. What is the typical dividend per share?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:13:42
Jesus man, what the fuck are you talking about here?
Its clear with a name such as "cccp charm" that you have something against America and the capitalist way of life, but I have never heard of the other stuff youre on about.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:00:46
I meant that chances on flipping heads from his original post
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:48:15
wow 60usd/btc, seems legit! /s
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:02:22
For all those curious, its a Rick roll. Don't bother clicking. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:58:33
clearly its not legit
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:43:19
I'm not sure what youre talking about?  I've used my coinjar address to receive btc with no "registered business name".  You can also send btc to any wallet address with no hassles whatsoever, shit you can even do it via QR codes on their mobile app.
And yes they have their own exchange rate, which is averaged across all the major exchanges.  Sometimes you win on this, sometimes you lose, but I think its reasonable.
IMO, its by far the best service in Australia for buying and selling BTC with cash.

I have a question about tipping "internets"...does the bot accidentally interpret an internet as mBTC, or is it specifically written so that 1 internet = 10 mbtc?
@_date: 2013-06-13 10:32:04
I was just thinking that myself, "testing" them should yield a tidy profit...
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:06:47
Did you get the idea from [here]( by any chance?
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:55:11
I've been watching it all day (I'm in Australia) and it's really starting to ramp up over the last hour or so.  
Perhaps all the "day traders" are waking up on the US eastern seaboard?

That is some serious hashrate...and serious power consumption, 2200w per unit....jeeeeeez

lol you even copied the help and sign up links, nice attention to detail

I am also with CBA and added a 0 to the front of my account number.  Did it earlier this afternoon and it still validating.  I hope it gets confirmed soon so I can cash out.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:26:30
We also have Boxing Day as opposed to a  "Black Friday" in Australia
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:03:57
That is a big call.  I think you are being overly optimistic
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:48:29
Hahaha what are the chances!
(Hint: The chances are 50/50)
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:15:30
Is this copy pasta? From where?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:11:49
It HAS to be this.  Nothing less will suffice.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:23:41
Excuse my ignorance, but can you please explain what FUD means? I see it get used around here fairly often and I don't know what it's supposed to be saying.
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:37:51
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:15:52
Thanks man! I've never got a tip before!  So if I am understanding correctly, its just a "premium" feature for supporters, and essentially its just a different command for the same thing?
@_date: 2013-04-17 10:10:02
seems legit
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:00:47
hahaha of course you can!  God damn, I'd always wondered and never thought to check.  How rookie is that?!
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:59:11
I dont know about you, but my life is worth more to me than six million dollars.

No matter the reason the bubble burst, the fact is it DID burst, and it WAS the top.  It may not be the top in 1-2 years, but we cant possibly know that for sure at this stage.
@_date: 2013-07-09 22:41:43
Me, for one :(
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:20:43
Quick question mate (and feel free to PM, or ignore entirely if you'd like) but do you get many donations to your address at all?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:01:02
where abouts?  Would love to make use of one.  What are the fees like?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:56:41
You are correct, this is MtGox only and quite clearly manipulation.  I am seeing it live also
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:04:54
So from what I understand, this is an advancement for processors to offload/optimize encryption/decryption tasks similiar to how MMX was added to Pentiums in the late 90s?

Why is he even with her at all?  Sounds like hes got the "pussy neediness" he speaks of.  X-1, what an asshole
@_date: 2013-06-13 12:08:21
Oh? I was not aware there was any other way to test it.  Do you have some sources I can read up on?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:52:31
Illegal insider trading?  There is no company here.  Insider trading laws do not affect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:26:19
coinjar.io...just signed up today and got onboard, deposit into NAB and had a btc within the hour.  Check it out
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:55:03
This is a valid point.
@_date: 2013-06-14 12:59:00
Agreed, this thread reads like amature hour, the type of comments in here are exactly the same in the btc run up to 200+ "BUY BUY BUY bitcoin will be worth 10000, don't miss out!"
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:55:47
I don't have six million dollars and my life is definitely worth living :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:51:33
Good tip.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:37:41
It's quite clear I do not, I also am not American so I have no idea about the government shut down, debt ceiling or Zionism, which is why I asked... 
I also am not that well versed in Russian porn, so you'll have to forgive me for that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:30:55
They are not just random math problems though, they process all the Bitcoin transactions of others to ensure they are legitimate and that transactions complete in the intended manner.
So the processing you do while mining actually servers the bitcoin network as a whole.  For your troubles, you get some of the transaction in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:13:27
Yep, thats what I did to get in

Unusually high quality article from the SMH, I am quite impressed
@_date: 2013-05-15 00:13:59
It hit it very soon after, currently at 107.5 with the possibility to drop further.
