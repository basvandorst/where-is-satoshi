Thank you so much for setting this up because I certainly had no idea how to. =D

So am I the only one that thinks the Bitcoin community should buy this guy a few model trains for all his trouble?

Hey getting recognition for Bitcoin is a reward in of itself. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:15:26
While I still feel like I had a good Idea and I am not really sure how to implement it. I was thinking though that maybe we could get someone well known in the community (like: Eric Voorhees or someone like that) to set this up so we are able to donate.

I would still have a tray for cash. I was thinking of just adding a QR code on the front of the tray.

that is awesome!!!! It is a fantastic hobby to have. :D

I expect that but hey if I end up with no Bitcoins. At least I can say I tried. :D

Sorry wut. You know the economy goes through cycles and recessions in a normal market cycle is healthy?

I agree with you on that. Glad to actually have a reasonable conversation with someone on Reddit

This is absolutely stupid. Killing fractaional reserving would cause huge Deflation (just as bad as inflation). Not too mention you would cause a major slow down if not a complete stop to your economy as banks would be severely limited in the amount they could loan. Also interest rates would sky rocket as the supply of money is vastly diminished. I'm a libertarian and don't like the Fed but this is not the way to fix it.

I agree with you on the inflation comment however when has the US inflation been wild? We have experienced nothing close to Hyper inflation. If anything the Fed purchasing securities and bonds was more a con than fractional reserving. Also Deflation has issues the opposite way, if a currency can't keep up with the macro economy, then you will lose out on economic gains you should have had.

Go ahead and go through regulatory requirements and you can. It's not like the banks can anything they want, if you think they can you should see the stress testing and liquidity requirements a bank has to go through.

98 isn't my birthyear, I have a degree in Finance, Minor in Accounting, and studied Austrian economics but please keep telling me more about how much you know about me. 
I am an American libertarian and dislike banks myself. They should never have been bailed out for their risky investments during 2008. That said Fractional reserving has not been a cause of these issues.

I'm honestly not sure you know how economics work. Fractional reserving isn't a bad thing for an economy. As a matter of fact it's a good thing as funds are far cheaper and easier to get for businesses.

I think you are confusing my stance on BTC and fractional reserving. I am all for Bitcoin and the idea of Bitcoin. However ending fractional reserving would be a huge detrement to everyone not just the rich. Also yes I agree inflation is a hell of a drug but in the case of Switzerland they don't have mass inflation, this stuff is still monitored by the central bank.

What Western Countries are you talking about?  The US currently has a reserve requirement of 10%.

It doesn't mean there is strong demand to buy at the current price. I have friends who set up accounts on coinbase just to buy when it crashes.
