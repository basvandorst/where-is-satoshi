Definitely, not having a go at you, it’s just exhausting to see the same question over and over!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:12
I'm totally with you.
We need to stop talking about the value of Bitcoin, and start talking about the value of the *Satoshi*.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:59:59
Gotcha, yeah point taken

It’s a fascinating mystery. I like mystery’s!
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:21:15
Can we get a sticky about this?
This exact question is literally asked about 20 times a day, and has been for the past year!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:44:13
Interesting, cheers.
I do find it odd that the answer you linked to says that Hal Finney wrote good C, but Satoshi wrote sloppy C++.
It’s contradicted by Finney himself in the Forbes article linked below:

Just finished reading, really good.
Forbes’ mobile site sucks though!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:18:44
Hal Finney himself made that statement?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:30:47
Couldn’t you use bitcoin as a standard?
In the same way that the Gold standard was once used to secure traditional currencies, other crypto currencies could be secured by Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:39:47
You shouldn’t try and convince other people to invest.
If you want to yourself, cool, but it *is* inheritently risky and personally I wouldn’t like to be responsible for another person loosing a lot of money because of my advice!

I'm reading a good book at the minute all about weaponized information called *The Darkening Web*. It sounds right up your street.

The same thing we do every night [*try to take over the world!*](
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:58:22
Any examples of the differences in coding style between Finney and Nakamoto?
I’ve always thought it was him, or that he at least came up with the name. It’s too big of a coincidence that he lived in the same neighbourhood as somebody actually called Satoshi Nakamoto!
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:03:20
I wonder if he's figured out how to *Hello World* yet in C?

This is kind of why I love the crypto/bitcoin community.
It's just full of nutters (meant with all of the love in the world).

Sounds like malware? (ie to steal your recovery phrase and drain your account)

It’s going to go back up at midday (GMT) on Wednesday, so buy in at about 11:30AM and sell at 3PM ;-)

 what you can afford to lose!
I can't stress that part enough!

Did anybody seriously think he was?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:08:30
1 confirmation now
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:40:16
All good points!
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:01:43
It’s a really weird one. He seems skilled enough that he could probably actually achieve something genuine if he put his mind to it, instead he wastes his time/energy claiming to be somebody he very clearly isn’t.
On the other hand, he posted some code he found online when challenged on whether or not he really knew C++ (didn’t even take out the comments from the example code IIRC) so maybe not? Maybe that was some sort of weird troll? Who knows. 
Completely bizarre behaviour. Like why not spend that time actually learning the thing you claim to be an expert at?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:33
You can use Google, just search for Current Bitcoin price

I'm not worried, I'm pretty confident we are going to see a $10k USD bitcoin so I've decided on a monthly budget I can afford to spend and am buying that amount of bitcoin per month for the foreseeable future.
I buy on the same day of the month regardless of the current price.
It will go up, down, etc, but that's ok. If I'm correct then happy days, if not I haven't lost anything I can't afford to lose.
I recommend a similar strategy.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:32:03
In which direction? Lol
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:08:02
Unfortunately, searching their YouTube channel for Bitcoin doesn't return any results under a month old, hopefully they upload it!
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:07:55
I'm buying £300/month and leaving it there, it might all go tits up but I'm willing to risk it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:12:20
It hit $5k and a lot of people sold.
Chill out.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:46:12
Hahaha I would not recommend this, but I also kind of want you to.
Shine on you crazy diamond!
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:24:54
Good article, I'm fairly confident in a $10k coin, my guess is mid 2020.

I was making a joke :)
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:54:27
It’s because it’s so volatile, you need drugs just to calm you down when the price goes up by $2K in half an hour!

Peter Zatko (aka *Mudge*) knew Assange from his days as *proff* and talked about it at Defcon a couple of years ago
Yep, definitely a prick. Albeit an incredibly smart one.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:35:55
Is it even worth the risk to try and convert it to another currency? It's what? £16k or so?
Maybe they are just moving it around randomly to throw off the authorities.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:34:11
Holy hell, that's incredible!
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:04:08
I know! I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:02:35
Their strategy of pumping and dumping seems to be working pretty well for them.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:24:59
I think that a lot of the volatility in Bitcoins price is the result of co-ordinated pumping/dumping by people with the resources and influence to do it.
I also think these people have made a lot of money pumping/dumping BTC, and they will absolutely continue to do so until they have milked that cow dry!
All it would take for the price of Bitcoin to shoot up is for a big bank like JP Morgan to buy 1000 bitcoin today, and then come out tomorrow with a statement like, *We think Bitcoin has a strong future* or some bullshit. People would flock to buy again, the price doubles, and they sell.
None of this is good for Bitcoin (the technology) however, as the end result is the general public loses all trust/faith in Bitcoin and CryptoCurrency in general, and stop taking the whole thing seriously.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:15:55


It's funny, because I've heard the opposite from not-very-technical family/friends. Some of them have Bitcoin (or other crypto), and it's that whole process of having to scan their ID etc which made them feel comfortable spending their money on it. They feel as though Coinbase is more legitimate because of that whole process, and that's what makes it a legitimate investment and not a scam.
Not saying I agree with that (I don't), but all of that *razzmatazz* bullshit really works on people. 
However, you're right that that isn't *using* bitcoin. Getting people to actually *use* it as a currency is a whole different world from getting them to essentially see it as an investment/gamble. Achieving actual, real world, *use* is the real challenge.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:23:31
