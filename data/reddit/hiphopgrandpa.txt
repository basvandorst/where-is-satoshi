I thought this post was too heavy-handed and obvious.  Then I read the “I don’t get it” comments and my heart sank.  I guess we have a lot more teachin’ to do.

Thanks for the heads up!  I did not know the difference.

Not if it’s a visa debit.  Same coverage policy for debit and credit.  Just might take a bit to get your finds reimbursed.  But Visa is Visa, whether debit or credit.

Yep, that is all very true. I made the silly assumption that most people have not had their home appreciate over a half million dollars.  But that's probably naïve on my part.

If you've lived in your personal residence for at least 3 of the last 5 years, you do not have to pay capital gains taxes on the sale in the U.S.

Aren't the source material and the meme two different things?  Like, for instance, the episode in Star Trek TNG where Picard throws his hands up and says, "Why?" was early 90's, but we don't say the meme started in the early nineties because it didn't come along into the internet pantheon until at least a decade later, right?  Anyways, I don't think it's correct to say this DBZ meme was born in 1997.  That's just when the source material first went public.
