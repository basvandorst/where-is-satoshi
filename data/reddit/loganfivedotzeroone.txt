Its probably not very nice but I get real kicks reading the paranoid delusions of coiners. Bitcoin and its seven transaction per second limitation is not a threat to anyone, its a toy for kids. Please read the following definition and realize you may be suffering from said condition:
A paranoid delusion is the fixed, false belief that one is being harmed or persecuted by a particular person or group of people. Paranoid delusions are known technically as a “persecutory delusion.”
It involves the person’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals.
Small slights may be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system with a person suffers from a paranoid delusion.
The focus of the delusion is often on some injustice that must be remedied by legal action. The affected person may engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by appeal to the courts and other government agencies.

When dealing with cryptography it is important to keep in mind that there is always a shortcut. Thousands of years of history prove this. Recent events such as gamed elliptical curves and shady default settings by RSA are standard practice in this world. I suggest reading The Code Book by Simon Singh and then solving an aristocrat cipher by hand for a good understanding of the basics. I am a very proud member of the ACA. I wonder how many coiners even know what that is. Hint, its not the affordable care act.
