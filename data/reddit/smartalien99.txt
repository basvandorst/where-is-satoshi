All of those things can be handled better by a free market. It has be philosophized by many very smart people on how that would be accomplished in a free market.

My age is irrelevant, but I am much older than 14. 99 would be the year I created the moniker.

I didn't come here to reeducate the public on a capitalism, just simply pointed out a disagreeing philosophy to the one stated. He's the one who attacked me. If you wanted a full discussion on how the no government things would work, gladly offers that with sources.

Who pays for it now? The aggregate of our tax dollars, mainly our gas taxes. That money people, mainly businesses, are saving by not funding state and federal bureaucracies can easily fund the construction and maintenance of roads. Communities can even get together and voluntarily create road funds if they wanted to. Market demands roads as much or more than any other commodity. As a business owner, I would gladly pay for roads services if it meant no taxes.

Value goes up with increased demand. Bitcoin is seeing a rise in popularity because people are using it for more things and creating demand for it.

There are many ways for that to be accomplished, but for a short example: Walmart wants you to buy their products so they build roads, just like they currently build their own parking lots, connecting their stores to your housing road network. Housing roads would be built by housing developers because no one will buy a house without roads and access to other roads. Many HOAs already handle road maintenance for their own neighborhoods. Also it would be much cheaper for the businesses/voluntary organizations to maintain roads due to free market forces not in play when provided by a public system.

The exchange price even got up to $900, which is a lot of billions.

The government still pays companies to make roads that make a much larger profit because of their government granted monopolization.

You sound like someone who is very violent. Don't attack me with your asinine assumptions. I simply pointed out a counter point to your rhetoric which has been logically concluded by many people which is a waste of energy to type out when a google search will do.

I can pick the lock of your door pretty easily. I can also make an imprint of your key and makes myself a copy when its convenient for me. Most locks really aren't secure, especially the ones on your car/house.
