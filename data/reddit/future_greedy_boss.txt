More important at the moment is the massive transfer going on from Bitcoin to Litecoin.  Check the Bitcoinwisdom charts, there's a direct and inverse correlation happening and it's spiking a lot right now.  I am regretting counting Litecoin out of the game so soon, though I don't know why there is all this interest so suddenly.

The sentiment is strongly favoring XT right now, and has been for 2 days.  The censoring and arbitrary ex cathedra definition of 'what Bitcoin is' plus the ham fisted so called Satoshi email which contradicted itself twice,  none of these were smart moves.  The guys who thought they had this ship well under control just got a taste of mutiny, the community got a "stress test" and it blew pressure gaskets aplenty.  
The lesson here is that hashpower shows how people decided once they put their opinion into action. It doesn't indicate how they will be convinced to decide in the first place, it takes time for their decision to show up in the numbers. That decision is done on the battleground in places like here, the old school hard way.

Life in the mini bubble universe must be grand.  Out in the real world, money spent on community projects that doesn't produce said projects is a tax on the commons for the benefit of the few.  
Just because you or I personally didn't pay for the board doesn't mean there isn't a loss to you or I personally. Without either the new forum up, nor the funds blown on it available for other better projects, Bitcoin as a whole is worse off. That means your coins and mine are tied up in something slightly less valuable, and that amounts to being taxed.  Not by coercion, but by others' fraud and stupidity which is even worse.

Well, I learned a good lesson today, and you guys taught me well.

 Maybe that's why he deleted his writings, so fewer of you can cite them. I'd like to hope he is that sensible and not the hypocritical academic who thinks users have to take whatever their betters feel generous enough to give them.  We already have Mircea Popescu to tell us that, we don't need another.

The funny part is that his mistake wasn't about whether the internet would grow, that simply followed from his main premise, which is where the mistake really lay.  Hilariously so, because he was in an academic's snobbish way, exactly right about it: 


It's not that this is incorrect, from his perspective it makes sense. But it's the same underestimation every cloistered intellectual makes about what drives mass adoption (including our own devs who are right now making this exact same mistake and really being proud of it too): that just because they don't value what matters to "most people", doesn't mean that what matters to "most people" doesn't have value.  
It is what matters most, if not by merit then by sheer force of numerical weight.

When I first encountered his post-bitcoin writings, prior to Blockstream getting funding he came across as being just slightly bitter about Bitcoin, calling it "Hashcash with anti-inflation control".  It seemed to me at the time he was just a bit stung that Bitcoin, and not his own Hashcash, was what took off.  This doesn't mean BlockStream is a comeback or anything bad as such, but he does come across a little more assertively now that he's back in the forefront of this thing.   
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:23:54
Because he says so?  Because you say so? Is Bitcoin is a collective AI doing a very lucky random walk in code-space? Or are regular humans with their usual foibles and personal politics still involved in this process.  is either deluded about the latter or is relying on a particular definition of "governance" that excludes the kinds of governance he doesn't like to take the focus away from the kinds he thinks acceptable (I might even agree with him on what would be an ideal governance, but I am also realistic).

I'm pro-blockstream, pro small blocks, pro-LN. I'm not a total fanboi I just think they are the direction things will go whether big blocks are used now or later. But Szabo is still embarrassing himself and the image of Bitcoin by using Twitter to make snarky zings at other people in the community, and then preposterously mocking the tactic of rallying an "internet mob" to support a particular technical direction literally as he is **doing the exact same tactic himself**.  Does he not think people see this? A colossally inept misjudgement of his audience and nothing good has come from it. 
I don't see him participating on the devlist or in Bitcoin-Wizards or submitting code or BIPs or anything except taking random condescending potshots. Which is a load of hypocritical bollocks that just makes people looking in from the outside shake their heads and confirms negative biases about "Bitcoin people" while doing nothing to help the discussion.

Planet Money on NPR did like half a dozen episodes where they made their own t-shirts to promote the show, but instead of just buying a trailer of them from some alibaba one-stop shop they did it the hard way, manually ordering and tracking every single piece of the shirt from the raw plucked cotton up to through the fabric weaving, stitching, logo printing, and all the guts in between like shipping materials around the globe. The point of the series wasn't to sell shirts (which would have happened anyway) but to explore the subject of economic globalization from a hands-on perspective.  
I see nothing wrong with a show trying to illuminate, through hands-on experimentation, the ideas that show talks about every episode.  If LTB used Bitcoin itself that would have been interesting too, but it would have much less depth than creating a coin from the bottom up to test out the concepts in a more fundamental way. 
It's not as if they made a fortune off that coin, what's the actual regular unique audience for the show, 10000-15000 people tops? 90% of whom (which is very generous) would never donate money regardless of what coin it was in?

If you are a large miner you get a discount on the cost of a Tx flood that gets higher and higher the more of the blocks you mine. 
Forcing the block size higher as fast as possible, if you are ready for it by having your hashpower sited in those very rare and lucky places with early buildouts of cheap 10GBit or faster connections (like the kind you can get in North Carolina and Vermont US USA for $400US/mo) this compounds your cost/Tx advantage over other miners significantly, if it doesn't just completely knock them out of the ring due to their inability to get access to anything close to those speeds at the physical locations they have their mining farms sited. 
It keeps spiraling toward centralization from there:  you mine more % of total blocks, the Tx fees in those blocks you mine cost you nothing (but everyone else's Tx that now get included in your blocks pay you better and better) and your supersize blocks force competitors who cannot get the cheap, super speed access you have in time to catch up to profitability, so they get orphaned more and more, to drop out of the game altogether due to inability to remain profitable. 
If your goal is to force the Bitcoin network to accept your operation as the de facto benevolent protector of the network (because they have to, or else they have to give up on Bitcoin completely), and you have a $100m VC warchest to starve your competition for a year or two (not an unheard of amount, see coinbase), it can be done. If Bitcoin is here to stay,  and the VC world is OK with it being Bitcoin in name only as long as they can sell the sizzle (hint:  they are OK with this)  then this is a rational strategy to pursue.

What should determine the weight of a vote, if not one's wealth (or to put it a another way, extent of financial stake in the outcome of the vote)?  One's degree of "moral high ground" would be a nice metric, but obviously a lot of problems quantifying that.  Voting determines how much a given outcome is wanted by those possessing the necessary agency to influence the vote, in whatever form that agency must take for a given voting system. Backchannels are damned hard to identify and factor out even when all voters are publicly known, let alone when they are private.

This is excellent advice on all sides.  Both the "mobs" and the "Nick Szabos" are deluded if they think Bitcoin can live without support from both the base and the leadership of the community. 
"Mobs":   Realize that the Nick Szabos don't give much of a shit if Bitcoin's price drops to zero, they have been working on this concept for decades and have the patience (and stubbornness) to make sure it is done properly or not at all. Their investment is in a long term social shift that will pay off in many ways that don't have much to do with the next 1-2 year's market price.  
"Nick Szabos":  Realize that Bitcoin has taken on a mind of its own, which is what it is supposed to do, and that mind includes a large chunk of casual interest that doesn't understand or have any specific ideas about the long term picture, it just wants to throw money at something that looks promising and supports the overall slant of where they think technology should go. If you want that "mob's" money to financiall support Bitcoin you should think about letting someone else do the twitter talking, because frankly it is not your strong suit. OTOH If you don't care about their money, or don't mind of they put it into some other development that robs Bitcoin of its momentum, by all means keep up the tone-deaf twitter snark.

This sounds better but in reality it's a way for any interested party which prefers a block size increase to guarantee one happens, by buying enough sustained Tx volume to force the algo to readjust upwards. There's no corresponding "downvote" option to throttle Tx back - you can't buy negative Tx volume.  This is like offering one side in a football match the option to field an extra player if they are willing to pay enough, and not making the same offer to the other side.

Never said they were the same. Capitalism is a system of consensus about group values, plutocracy is a failure mode resulting from corruption of that system. 
You could even take the judgement aspect out of it by calling Plutocracy merely a stable state of Capitalism, one of many, but one favored by the tendency for a self-centralized strategy, in the hands of a skilled (and fortunate) actor, to dominate all others over time.

Airbitz is next.  The wallet / directory is just not happening.  They are already changing some of their internal corporate identity materials to add  "Edge Security" as a different product alongside "Bitcoin Wallet," but notice this is not on their website yet.   
Exactly what "edge security" is supposed to be about is not clear.  Something to do with a multi-sig key escrow service from what I gather.  Whatever it is, it's not terribly apparent how "edge security" is related to a wallet + business directory, so I assume there is a pivot in the works. 
They also have what seems to me a rather large staff and payroll to support a rather simple product, one which cannot be making very much money at all given the abysmal state of Bitcoin's usage as a payment rail.

Who are the real economic majority, and who matter more and more as (or if) Bitcoin outgrows its roots as a cypherpunk experiment and into a mainstream tool used by people who just want it to work and don't have time to take on a side hobby to understand the finer points of how Bitcoin influence battles are fought nor are interested in technocratic utopian dreams of either the socialist or the libertarian flavors.  
**The biggest economic majority isn't the XT side or the Core side.**
**It is: everyone who is choosing not to bother with Bitcoin at all**.  
*Those* are the people whose priorities need to be acknowledged as relevant above all else. That doesn't mean agreed with, it doesn't mean catered to, it doesn't mean served. This almost militant elitism is exactly what we don't like about the current financial power structure and what do we do?  Imitate it note for fucking note. 
Some of the biggest morons with the biggest mouths in this community don't just imitate banker elitism, they wear it seriously and unironically like a badge of honor, talking in condescending terms about "the masses" and "the people who shouldn't have Bitcoin because they can't afford it." At least real bankers have enough sophistication to be diplomatic about their attitudes.

Have you ever considered that fractional reserve banking exists because the market wants it to exist?  Bitcoin cannot stop the fundamentals that drive the market to evolve the features it has.

Whats weird is that it is CLI-driven, which doesn't make much sense if the target Amazon buyer is not already unusually technically inclined, and such people are much more likely to figure out how to mine and play with Bitcoin in other ways that cost a lot less than $400, most with with better ROI.

I honestly think that a successful, global scale Bitcoin will necessarily evolve both big-block and permissioned settlement layer traits. I view this slap fight as a turf war between rival gangs vying for mental real estate that, like gaining territory early in any network effect game, will pay huge dividends for the victor if things take off in a big way.  In the short term, as a matter of taste and risk management I generally prefer to deal with the devil I know (known and accountable Blockstream developers) over the devil I don't know (unknown super-connected miners with unpublicised agendas, controlling unknown amounts of consensus-controlling hashpower split into multiple pools).

What's the difference then?  Trusting a network of unknown actors, with enormously disproportionate concentrations of ownership, to all act in what you *think* is their best interest, or trusting a small network of known actors to act in everyone's best interests including their own?  I fail to see why this is an open and shut case of risk management in favor of Bitcoin. To make Bitcoin better than a state backed system you need to place a lot of faith in a lot of people doing a lot of things right.  Until we have a solid answer to the MtGox class of problems (things Bitcoin cannot do on chain, which is most everything banks do other than issue currency) Bitcoin is a worse solution in practice, no matter how nice it sounds in theory.

He's one of these hopeless kool-aid drinkers who thinks Bitcoin is intrinsically SO AWESOME that it doesn't need any help from community or network trust effects; it's fated by the laws of the universe to engulf the planet. He believes this because, among other things, he has an idiotically simplistic and one dimensional perception of why gold or any precious metal has value in the first place. He thinks that nobody has to do anything except sit back bite the bullet and buy Bitcoin - Oh yeah, they are buying it from their "betters", mind you.

I think I see what direction you are coming from on this now, which is that in a wealth-based voting system, votes and wealth are effectively the same thing. It still doesn't make the acquisition and maintenance of that wealth (and thus the vote influence) free, nor does it mean that opt-in risking of money changes the fundamental problem that more wealth means more influence.  Not unless you can account for every possible out of band channel that can be used to buy votes for less than their in-band face value.

Citation needed.  Bitcoin is whatever the majority of people who care to pay for it and support it think it is at any given moment. There's nobody in charge of a mission statement.  
If you want to be a middleman and think you can add value somewhere, you can do that. No licensing or permission needed from Bitcoin, Inc. Just pay the price to buy the coin you need to do what you think needs to be done.  Don't think it's a good price?  Don't buy it and sit on the sidelines or go do something else.

I have a hunch it is going to be shoveled, at discount OEM bulk rates, on to PC manufacturers as a gimmicky add-on, and also pitched to set top box makers for the same reason, with promises of forthcoming API-driven "synergies" and "ecosystems" and other buzzwoo.

Why they didn't just release the API for their services exchange is a mystery to me, unless it's the simple answer that they can't charge $400 for that.

no knocking your effort, any improvement is welcome.  
Nobody ever suffered for having better optics.  
But people also place a lot of confidence in statistics, which creates opportunities for bad actors to hide behind them.  The more confident the charts and graphs make you feel, the less you will second guess your conclusions, and handwave away doubts that are perfectly valid to have.   
Biggest example of this is how people believe mining pools prevent any single actor from getting large enough to mount a 51% attack. The precision and extensive real-time reporting provided by the pools and sites that aggregate pool stats are a huge red herring distraction from the fact that a single miner could simply split their hashpower proportionally among multiple pools, and noone would be the wiser until it was too late.

Thanks for posting this up. I knew international settlements were anachronistically clunky and slow but I didn't know the underlying reason why, until you said this:


Now it makes a lot more sense why the waiting time can be so unpredictable.   To be fair this isn't a bad concept in some ways; it's not far from the way the internet works for routing through peering relationships, and as such it apparently doesn't depend on a centralized system which is what I thought they were using. 
But it's slow to do it manually. A blockchain approach would speed this up considerably. I'd personally prefer the Bitcoin blockchain but really anything automated would be better than this.

Truthcoin is a great example of a mirage masquerading as innovation. 
Truthcoin and augur both have no way of stopping people from rigging outcomes to fit predictions.  These are markets for self-fulfilling prophets. 
No way to guarantee there is no relationship between the predictor (or whatever their invented term is for it) and the thing predicted. 
Streamium and the other suggestions are all good tho.
@_date: 2015-10-02 00:54:12
No, in fact that document is... jesus what the hell did i just read.  Ok, charitably, it needs a major overhaul. 
It makes a claim that self-fulfilling prophecies can be eliminated through "augmentation" but then it gradually strips away that claim by being chock full of constraints like this:


And what certain way is that?  Given that they are made openly, in public.   Obviously that's exactly what a prediction rigger would do, advertise the means by which they change the conditions influencing the outcome.  I suppose they will conveniently tweet these into an oracle?
Then the paper goes on to use, as its example, the un-augmented prediction market of  "Y/N? Will an accredited university will demonstrate cold fusion by the year 2020."  Ok, interesting example so far.
Except right after that, in the description of the example, the real decision that the proposed prediction is assumed to turn on is revealed to be not what it said at all, but rather, "Will Congress vote to approve the funding for the research required to demonstrate cold fusion" Congress, of course, being a public body that debates issues openly.  Then the example adds an "Augmented" protection market on to the original prediction market which conveniently uses the public nature of Congressional discourse to permit the underlying bet to be "protected" by conditions superimposed onto it by the protection market. 
This doesn't do anything to address the basic moral hazard problem as far as I can see.  At best, it means these prediction markets can only function fairly under extremely narrow circumstances similar to those given in the example.

So you make Bitcoin cost more to use per Tx, stripping an entire class of interesting micropayment use cases (and users with them) from its toolbox, but in exchange you spread the user base for nodes correspondingly wider. 
All you are doing is shifting around the same pile of assets to different preferred categories of user.   
There's no problem being fixed here, this is like converting your bank balance into octal and thinking it is "bigger" because the number looks larger than it did in decimal.

Confused or not both are equally important, the latter moreso because it is extremely vulnerable to corruption which renders the former's relative security much less valuable.

If you look in the front page of the sub today there's a post by Vaultoro that explains a lot about why this happens, it's not just rent seeking.  If it was that simple, banks would undercut each other to the bone to steal the business of huge companies and other banks from each other.  
It's because there's a messy six degrees of separation system that handles these transfers. It's actually quite decentralized, which was a surprise to me.  But as a result there's a bunch of intermediates in every wire Tx and each one takes a small cut.  All these cuts add up to a big one, and it also makes the time to transfer the wire erratic as well.
