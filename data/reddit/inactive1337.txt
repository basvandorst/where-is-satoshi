That sounds awesome, I would appreciate your offer for the demonstrate account! I can just confirm that actually showing people how easy and simple it is to do payments with Bitcoin is more powerful then just saying it. I dont actually understand the method to automaticlly transfer bitcoin into fiat. Or better said what merchants have to do to automaticlly get it in fiat (What they want I guess). Can you give me a link where it is explained, or can you explain me?
