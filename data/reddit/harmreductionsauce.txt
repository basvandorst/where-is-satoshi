Ohhh man...muh roadz!!! don't take muh roadz!!!
You are really asserting the government (which, remember, doesn't actually exist- there are only individuals) is the only actor who could possibly pave flat ground? 
You don't see how much money and wealth would be freed up if you got rid of the leviathan state? No more Wars, no more pork barrel legislation, no more asinine and counterproductive entitlements?
Come on. The rich get richer because of cronyism. It stifles competition and inovation. Why do you think one of the best investments a big company can make is lobbying? 
These laws that you love so much are designed to keep the poor poor and prevent competition with the big boys not the other way around.
Regardless the state is fundementally immoral. Why do you or anyone else have a right to my money, wealth, or body? What gives you the right to take what I earn and spend it how you want? Or tell me what I can or can't consume? Or who I can marry? Or whether or not I can start a business? Where do you justify that? 
Answer this honestly.
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:45:48
Where is society? Can I touch society with my hands? Can I hold it, or talk to it? Hold it accountable? 
There is no such thing, there are bureaucrats, office buildings, men with guns, men in suits and these people make decisions for everyone else.
I have no idea how anyone could still believe in government after the last hundred years. It doesn't work. 
What are you doing on a bitcoin sub btw? 
I mean you talk about fiat as a service provided by government and your here? 
Have a bit of cognitive dissonance there?

It's legal when the state does it because the state decides what's legal.
That is circular reasoning.
To your second point:
Doc A: 
"Well if you think bloodletting is killing patients, what's your great idea, Mr. Hot Shot doctor trying to change everything?"
Doc B: 
"I don't know exactly I just think we can come up with something better than draining peoples blood."
Doc A: 
"Yeah ok, it'll just 'figure itself out' yeah right! This guy is quick to point out problems, but can't come up with any solutions"

Well I'm in Mexico to get away from statists like you, so hopefully not.
I care because your brand of poison thinking is the very thing responsible for the atrocities of the state throughout human history.
Liberty, not submission to the state collective is the natural state of things.
Democide (death by government) is the greatest cause of pain and suffering in the last two centuries and your faulty logic supports it.

1. We are on a fucking bitcoin forum and you are telling me to do something about it.
2. I moved to mexico. 
3. How the fuck does a libertarian take the stance of "you don't like it get the fuck out" You have no idea what I or anyone else has done before you ask and most libertarians believe freedom from force fraud and coercion is the natural way not whatever the status quo is until you change it.

Give someone LSD and tell him it'll mess up his brain and it's potentially addictive. Sit someone in front of a slot machine and tell them that they're statistically likely to lose money. Put someone in charge of a company with big profit margins and good employee services.
Come back in a day and you'll find them high, bankrupt, and corrupt.
Of course you need to force good ideas onto people.
So you believe people need to be protected from themselves? Wait we have slot machines and drugs in that status quo and not everyone is a degenerate, drug addicted gambling addict. It's almost like people can make choices for themselves.
Who is qualified to decide what is good for me? You, the government, technocrats? 1. They don't know either 2. That shit gets coopted and abused. 3. Fuck them, my choices are my own, I have to deal with the consequences.
Think about slaves, they have food, shelter, and decisions made for them. That sounds just dandy huh?
Why don't you just leave people alone and live and let live. Make interactions voluntary and don't use force, it's real simple.


I don't make the money off that, defense contractors do, I'm beginning to think I am arguing with a troll, that doesn't even KIND OF make sense.

Wait advertising = undignified?
I don't know if you have ever ran a business, but advertising is how you let people know you have solved a problem they are experiencing. There is just no other way. It isn't inherently undignified, it's how people find out about goods and services.
Less sophisticated people are just people who don't frequent libertarian blogs and forums and wouldn't have otherwise heard of bitcoin. You understand that this new surge in value is because Bitcoin has made it on traditional media channels in front of these people right?
You can keep your dignity along with your snark, I want bitcoin to succeed. For some reason successful businesses spend billions in advertising every year, but bitcoin is just sooo above that. How 'edgy of you'. 
Again this is the Reddit "Ads R Bad" mentality that shows an ignorance of how business really works. And is probably the reason why so many on reddit seems so incompetent in business/finding a job.

Which country? 
I'm not the one who is trying to enforce an unsigned contract (the bullshit social contract) under duress.
I would love to pay for free market alternatives to the shit services provided by our government, but I am prohibited. Also large portions of my income are taken through the threat of violence so I can't afford the alternatives, further more the currency that I am forced to trade in is being constantly devalued making alternatives even more difficult and costly.
I'm not the one initiating force the government (and by a corollary, through your ACTIVE consent, so are you) 
How about you get out, statist. I just want a voluntary society, how about you leave me alone and I will leave you alone?  
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:15:12
You are wrong. 
Non college grads can Educate themselves, go get experience working for free or for little pay, they can complete projects that show actual industry level competence, they can apprentice, or do professional training outside of universities.
All of these take some hustle, but so what you have to hustle for success not "sheep on" with the crowd assuming someone is just going to trade your diploma for a job the day you graduate. 
Many excellent programmers for example never went to college, or especially didn't go to school for comp sci.
You also have to think of the opportunity cost of the time and money going to college. You could invest a fraction of that money in actual industry level training, books, tutors, instead of bullshit gen ed credits that no one gives a shit about.
If you think diplomas are so helpful I suggest you talk to a recent grad with a degree in some kind of liberal arts hell even some hard science majors and ask him how his job hunt is going.

You are saying we are wasting money on infrastructure with charities? 
WTF do you think government bureaucracy is!!! 
Think of how much waste is incurred when giving money to the government. Free markets have a great incentive to maximize efficiency (or giving in this case) where as the government has a monopoly by force and no incentive or even a disincentive, because they want more people employed and more funding.
Also what about all the harm it does to us with money printing, corporate welfare, and endless wars? Charity is unimaginably more efficient and net beneficial. Not to mention that we would ALL end up richer if the government stopped granting privileges to big businesses and made them compete in the free market. 
Even if none of this is true, it still doesn't justify stealing. Why should 51% of people be able to vote to steal from the 49% that's ethically wrong.
I'm not even going to get into how social welfare incentivizes people not to work because they can make more with EBT and unemployment. 
Your opinion is just that, opinion and is not based in economic fact, reason, or reality so please refrain from misinforming people about how the world actually works.

The most sexist thing of all is acting like women are so delicate and precious that they need you the white knight (or knightess) to protect them.

@_date: 2013-04-08 18:55:47
It's not oversimplification, it is not buying into bullshit. 
**Taxation is theft and government is force.** By any fucking definition those two facts are unequivocally true. 
I signed no social contract, and money is taken from me in the form of taxes under the threat of force and without my consent.
If the government is so wonderful why make it mandatory? Do you usually need to force good ideas onto people?
Also, are you saying that war was fought to defend our freedom, protecting our sovereign soil? 
Read "War is a racket" by the two time medal of honor winner general Smedley Butler. Wars are fought for profit, and false flags do happen. Gulf of Tonkien, USS Liberty, Operation Northwoods, Operation Gladio, MK Ultra, Operation Paperclip. All this evil is declassified and on the record, yet the willfully ignorant continue to say: "they would never do that again, not these days, we are passed that."
You are like most people on reddit spouting the mainline pseudo-informed hipster intellectual view without doing any of your own research.
Go back to watching Bill Mar and talking about how you are a libertarian when it is convenient or cool.

Less Sophisticated != less intelligent and your argument hinges on that.
I'm not a concert pianist that makes me less sophisticated than a concert pianist when it comes to the piano, not dumber. 
I am also not a mechanic, I am less sophisticated then one when it comes to cars not necessarily dumber. 
The average individual doesn't understand fiat currency, inflation, austrian economics, bitcoin, etc... This doesn't make them dumber just less sophisticated regarding economics and asset protection. 
You are the one making that connection not me, and I think you glossed over that connection for a reason.

I'm a libertarian and I donate money to charity, as do many libertarians.
The difference between us and statists is that statists say "fuck you, I'm going to steal yours and give it to somebody else"
There is no courage in that.
Many people also forget that you have to actually create something that people want (in absence of the state intervention) to generate wealth.  
You don't make money from nothing, you make money from producing goods and services that improve peoples quality of life.

They may expect it, but they don't take whatever "favor" you are asserting I owe them by force. They gave me life and are my fucking parents yet you agree the state has more domination over an individual than the people who raised them. See how ridiculous that is?

Reddit is so anti-advertising, yet advertising is what makes the world go around and how businesses, movements, ideas grow and spread.
It is a simple fact that we need less sophisticated people to join Bitcoin in order for it to get widely accepted. Preaching to the converted doesn't help.
It's a sad fact that many pyramid schemes are successful because of advertising, the difference between them and us is that we have something legitimate.
If the ads themselves suck, that is another story all together and they should be improved, but don't write off the medium because of bias that "ads R bad"

I can't do line by line your ignorance and hubris is exhausting:
1. How do you morally/ethically justify inhibiting someones actions when they are harming no one other than themselves? Where do you draw the line? What if the technocrats are wrong? 
2. America is not economically free. We have a mixed economy and what is called crony capitalism.
3. We live in that nanny state, and people are overworked and underprivledged. Disproved your own arguement. 
4. It is that simple, until people violate freedom for their benefit. Free markets and voluntary interactions are the most efficient way of allocating resources fairly. Unfortunately when you get force involved you make few rich at the expense of the many. The only reason we have an abusive superclass is because they are backed up by government granted welfare and privledges.
5. War profiteering is at the expense of everyone else. It is stealing.
What if I don't want your technocracy? Are you going to force me? I want to drink a large soda, gamble, smoke? Are you going to arrest me? What if they say reddit is bad, too much internet is bad, being out late is bad? Are you ok with that? Do you want a police officer escorting you to the gym everyday? What about deciding what groceries you can buy?
There is no bright line to where the nanny state stops. I want my freedom to make my own decisions that don't hurt others. You stay away from me and we will be fine. 
Why on earth do you think that a government has a right to determine how someone pursues happiness in their own life? You, and people like you are control freaks, thank God their is still places where you don't have power. You should definitely move to New York under comrade Bloomberg, if you already haven't.

The big question you are begging here is that governments are some how not inefficient. They are massively inefficient, for fucks sake our money goes to bomb brown people, how is that helpful? Not to mention the government seems to do more than it should be able to because it assumes massive debt in the process and is able to kick the can down the road to the next generation/politician in office.
Government will always be more inefficient because you have no alternative, there is no incentive for performance because you have no choice, government is backed up by violence we are stuck.
Government is not a type of specialization because specialization requires voluntary choice. I don't buy hammers, nails, or hondas because I am forced to at the point of a gun, I do it because I want to. 
There is nothing courageous about voting to take money from someone and give it to someone else, there is courage in giving it yourself. It is cowardly to use the government to steal from others. Not to mention that the government is used to entrench power and end competition.
You need to relearn quite a bit.
