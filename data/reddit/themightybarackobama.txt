really dude? gonna try to argue its not accepted in japan or some shit (tho it prolly is). hurr durr decentralization! not how it works. currency is circulated in the US market by the government, held by US banks, and the primary currency for the US.
its circulated by the US in the US and is generally accepted everywhere in the US. no semantics. try again if you want.








name a non functioning government that has a currency that is working. name one. thanks.








so when you go on nicehash and buy crypto. is that not circulating on the crypto exchange?  im not impressed by its ability to be used on the dark web. i am saying if anything that is a negative, that its main/primary use is for illegal activity.








ok? so show me some of the coins or paper money....








essentially is not the same. dont get me wrong. banks may own a shitton of this. i bet they do (and are the ones pumping it), but they do not hold it as a measure of securing liabilities to its customers. it is not held to vouch for a customers account. is this swiss bank just letting you stash your coins in a wallet? or are they actively giving you interest on it, using it when you arent, and circulating it like they would with cash? im sure btc can get there but its not happening now.








dude thats a load of crap. i dont mean it is 'pegged' to the dollar. i mean relevant. something that was $500 last year and was almost $20000 this year has NO RELEVANCE TO TO THE DOLLAR.  its range is far to wide to have any meaning.  it has nothing to do with floating or pegged. you are just bringing up random stuff. it has everything to do with storing a value and being secure. it clearly does not do that, as the range indicates.








not sure whats confusing. would you rather have 100k credit card points with chase or lehman brothers? would you rather have 100k points with BTC or dogecoin?

[it is legal tender]( just not physical.
i just think if this is a currency than all cryptos are currency. [even the hooters crypto you get for eating extra chicken wings and burgers]( or whatever.
so its easier to think of as an asset or a point system, and that point system relates to a specific block chain or marketplace.
like chase cash is the same as wells fargo cash. btc crypto is not the same as doge. etc. so they are not all individually currencies.

but its not circulating.
the bank isnt adding or subtracting from the total. afaik there is a cap on BTC that will be available by the blockchain. i understand that the blockchain is basically a decentralized version functioning as a bank. but its not taking BTC in and out of circulation. BTC doesnt need circulation, because there is no paper product that people need access too, therefore no use for circulation.
maybe it is pre-currency and it will get there. but not with this kind of volatility when it comes to value, and its niche use.
its just an asset with currency in the name.  like chicken tenders may be traded in some countries for other goods, but they are not legal tender 8-)

just because it has currency in the name doesnt make it a currency. forbes among others say its more of an asset. 
if you look at definitions of currency or money it meets almost none of them.
its not generally accepted.
its not issued by a government.
its only circulated on a few crypto exchanges, dark markets, and even less retailers.
it has no coins or paper money.
its not held in a bank.
its value fluctuates and is not stored as a currency would be. it does not tie to the dollar in any relevant way.
if anything its like a point system that any brand would have. for example a credit card point system, or coins at chuck e cheese.
not saying i have anything against btc. just dont see it as a currency. the most key part of a currency is its ability to hold its value in regards to a market, and btc does not do that at all. it could be $100k by the end of the year or $100.

Yea dude. Avoid taxes like the rest of us by making no money. It's the smart thing to do.
And no. 30% of the gains not the sale. Sorry I wasn't clear.

rule of thumb for trading stock is to keep 40-30 % for the taxes separate when u cash out.
u can roll forward losses too so if u are losing money on this, track and file it.

banks and governments likely doing this.
my theory is when a bank has a comparable blockchain ready they will sell and crash &amp; burn btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:39:49
ive been blazing off the same .5 btc for 2 years. lol.
