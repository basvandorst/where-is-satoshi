Seems to me any country with People or Democratic in it's name is neither for people or of a democracy. As for Fiat being Communist in nature that seems silly imo.

What about ppl who live where Fiat is stable, I'm not interested in how it helps Zimbabwe if every day I wake up and Fiat is outperforming crypto blindfolded.

Old War Bond marketing ad, the shadow was bombers overhead. So by purchasing Bitcoin they're saying you'll protect your children from evil inflation, how war bonds were gonna fund bullets and planes to protect our life. Pretty deep ad if I say so myself

"89% of African children are not getting adequate medical care" picture of a healthy white kid dons the cover of article. See if people pointed out this as a false claim you wouldn't get ppl calling you a racist and tin foil capper. But alas white culture and heritage is not trendy so fuck me...

While the stock market I believe is way overpriced, what killed the housing markets was idiotic sub prime loans to fools who could never pay it back. I don't think that's happening like back in early 2000's but I do hate the idea of how much money we print...

No millionaire's become that way because of a hatred for sharing, they will love the idea of something that they own trustlessly and isn't controlled by the government. Remember Switzerland???
