Taking profits is a smart risk mitigation strategy. Some people buy extra btc so they have it to sell on the way up. Makes the whole endeavor less risky.

Coinbase is fine for storage as long as you are OK losing everything there. I keep a few hundred USD on my phone. It isn't ideal, but it's convenient for spending and I'm willing to lose that coin. Same with an exchange.

Personally I wouldn't buy while we are heading down like this. Once we start heading back up would be my buy signal. Probably doesn't matter much though for your first...just a rule I try to stick to. Pretty rare to time the bottom, not trying to, but at least a good chunk of the drop can be avoided.

The blockchain will really soar after bitcoin finally goes to zero and stops dragging the blockchain down.

The fear that BTC is suddenly going to zero isn't there any more. People have seen these corrections and have much more confidence to ride them out.

Imagine if a president banned the internet. A new idea isn't going to stop just because a few countries walk away, it would just slow down for a bit and divert, but I think the internet would still have progressed rapidly after that. The US just gets left back in pre-internet times. I don't think the US banning bitcoin is feasible at this point, they'll work up the balls to fuck around with Libra, they just want their cut first.

The "tech monopolies" aren't interested in censoring btc, but rather they are interested in stopping spam.  I suspect the same thing would happen if the OP was informing his customers about Viagra. Certain keywords are ripe for abuse and the spam filters cast a wide net for those words.

@_date: 2019-06-27 19:29:10
I'm sure there's a term for it, but I agree that mentally it does get harder to buy as the price goes up, based on how low the price of your first coins were.
I focus on the big picture and try to forget the price of 1 BTC. If you believe in the basics of BTC, it is still worth DCAing in.  I kind of do a modified DCA - when shit gets manic like this week I quit buying and save my DCA and wait until BTC is dropping or at least not actively ping ponging around.

You're right about a lot of that to degrees. IMO, rght now, bitcoin's best use is as a store of value separate from whatever fiat is forced upon you and the blockchain. Currency and privacy are features with much promise, but they aren't here yet for joe citizen.

I call it DCA, but who knows. Every week I set aside x amount for BTC. I may wait 3,4 weeks to invest based on where we are at in the pump/dump cycle, but I don't go much beyond that without buying. I'll force myself at that point to buy. If we are dumping hard I'll double up my weekly buy.

I think when the demand is there, banks/exchanges are going to store BTC for people. That they are simply trading one trusted third party for another won't matter to the masses. I think it's a very small minority who can take responsibility for their coins. Most can't or won't.

Anyone trying to stereotype crypto adoption as young vs old thing is using a worldview that will fail them. The vast majority of people, old or young, will stick with the mainstream system. People are sheep. I think the young adopt crypto at a greater rate out of necessity because they aren't sitting on the fiat wealth of the older generations who have the luxury of ignoring new assets and not because the young are smarter.

There are risks to both Coinbase and keeping your own wallet. 
Coinbase will cover you if they are hacked, but you won't be covered it they decide it is your fault - like if a hacker somehow gets access to your credentials and then go in and drain your account - that's on you. And there are a ton of reports of CB locking accounts indefinitely which is another risk.
A wallet like Trezor is very secure, but you have to follow the instructions closely or you are open to attacks. Do it right though and it is the safest in my mind. If you don't want to accept the responsibility of maintaining your wallet, then you are better sticking with Coinbase.
