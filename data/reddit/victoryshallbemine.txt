Quick question: is this the first "virtual currency" that has been approved (for lack of a better word) by FINCEN?

rest assured, i don't think this will go the way of Esperanto.  I'm actually surprised this hasn't taken off quicker than it has... a global currency needs to be established, it's a natural evolution.

I looked at their prospectus ( and it looks very unprofessional.  However the rates are very reasonable and if the prospectus is right there is a lot of traffic through the site.
Thanks for the link, i will certainly look into this more.

If I may ask, what specifically did you have to deal with their customer service  people with?
I appreciate the input!!  I'm surprised that 6 bucks is above market; what is market price for a trade (or i guess withdrawal)?

This is the type of information I am looking for.  
I was not aware of the bloomberg press release; the statement "The surge in the exchange rate this week coincided with concerns that the Cyprus government would take euros from saving accounts to pay its bailout bill." sends red flags to me as a short-term investor.  Very interesting as a long term investment though.
Thank you for the input, I agree with the philosophy that the value of bitcoin will increase as it matures (i.e. gets publicity).  I find the concept of bitcoin fascinating and definitely think this is the currency of the near-future.  
I hate to say it, but if people are using this for illegal activities it is probably here to stay (and grow).

I'm always open for speculation as long as it has a good story behind it :)  there must be a reason why the value has shot through the roof in the past few weeks.

I would speculate that if/when bitcoin matures there will be many clones (litecoin) that will try to gain popularity, and ultimately there will be 2 or 3 to choose from.  I also think that when that happens we will have the ability to pay with bitcoin (or any other virtual currency) as easily as we currently do with a visa.
However, until that happens I think there is a lot of potential in virtual currency.  Unfortunately I think that I am more indecisive now than i was a few hours ago, but i do have something to sleep on.

if bitcoin becomes more popular there will definitely be products/currency trying to compete.  
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

Potential = investment potential.

That's why this is so exciting, it's an emerging investment.  Excitement generates growth!

I would interpret someone with deep pockets swinging the market as a good sign.  
As for the Mt gox hack, do you think the valuation of bitcoin relies on it's "clearing house"'s reputation security-wise?  Do you think having more options to convert bitcoin to currency would bury these concerns?
