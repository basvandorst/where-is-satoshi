I enjoy selling them for a fiat at a good premium..... nope, not for me.

I grew up transient.  Having real estate is security.  It's my base so I can afford to risk in the portfolio.

Rich people have offshore accounts for shtf and teotwawki.  Seriously, it doesn't have frictional costs and has worked reliably over decades.  I am global, just as an diversified indexer.  You're still expousing cray.  This isn't trying to demean you, but your position taken.  Bt coin has a place but it isn't the sole answer.

OP makes a case for getting out of currencies that are dangerously wealth stealing.  The leap to "then bitcoin is the answer" is a jump I won't make.  Transaction frictional costs are costly in hardware and fees.  Bitcoin is only readily accepted in limited markets, and with much more risk than 'fiat' currency.  Look at economic models.  Wealth, the store of value, is in real estate, company ownership, hard commodities that peeps actually want and in accepted stores of what is real wealth.  Bitcoin is not one of these stores that is widely accepted.  Bt has a place, but if it's at the table, but still is and most likely always will be at the ~~kiddie~~ a specialty table.
 In certain spaces, deep web,  bt coin is readily transacted.  I am libertarian. Especially now, i am more distrusting of government overreach in my country and extremely aware of friends who are truly living in oppressed countries.  I keep access to market places of ideas and goods that are private, outside of the reach of heavily controlling governments.  Btcoin is needed. I still think it is specialty use for now, though.
 Edited because I was too demeaning and didn't intend it to be quite what came out.
Caveat emptor.
A better alternative than red currency is yellow currency.
