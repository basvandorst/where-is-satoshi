I'm not selling a ton, but I have seen some sales, a lot of which came when the market was hot the end of last year. I'm more positioning my shop so I'll be ready when Bitcoin becomes a bit more mainstream and gains more traction.

Hey just hit you with a PM with some screenshots hopefully that helps! I will work on this for sure.

I remember looking into Amazon Merch like a year ago, but it was highly competitive and had a waiting list I believe... I'll check it out now though because it's definitely a lot less hassle

I just tried on mobile - when it asks for your shipping address Amazon and Paypal show up because they both have that info already. But once you submit your address and shipping method, you'll see Coinbase come up as a payment option :)

Thank you for saying this!! Are you on mobile? The desktop version shows Coinbase Commerce, if it's not showing on mobile I'll look into that ASAP.

You have to enter your address and shipping method, than you'll see the option to use Coinbase to checkout - here's what it looks like: [

Thanks, I'll definitely look into moving towards this for sure, since Coinbase isn't great with the fees.

Oh good. Yeah it said they review process is 14 days so that's not too bad.
Nah, just basic info about the business and my tax information. Only took like 5 minutes. I'll check out Redbubble too, the more platforms the better.

Wow I'm really kicking myself in the ass for not signing up when I first found out about it. I just now submitted my application, hope the wait isn't too long. Thanks for the heads up! 
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:19:58
Yes, they most certainly do. I don't have a ton of sales yet, which is why I like to come to Reddit to see what I can be doing better.

What do you mean by BTCPay service? And of course! Use BUYDIPS as the code ;) 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:53:01
Awesome! Thank you! I will definitely try to iron that out.
