The quoted phrase doesn't appear in the linked tweet.
If he really said that, then it means very little. To trust that tether isn't a scam, you'd have to not only trust him, but also trust that people running a multi-billion-dollar scam couldn't create a convincing fake web site.
Also... based on the actual content of that tweet, I'm not sure that flibbr would be very difficult to fool. He writes like a teenager, and not an especially intelligent one.

I think it stems from people looking at Tether's lack of transparency.
It is certainly possible to run an honest business along the lines of Tether. The way it works is that you create and sell tokens to anyone offering $1.01 or more for them, and buy and destroy tokens from anyone offering them for $0.99 or less, and in between you keep the money (which is your customers', not yours) in cash or a safe-as-cash investment. You make your income on the spread, and possibly on T-bill interest, and everyone understands this.
But the main service you provide in exchange for that income is a guarantee that you'll buy arbitrarily many tokens at $0.99, making it impossible for the price to tank. And I wouldn't want to buy into the system without some evidence that you'll actually provide that service - just like I wouldn't want to buy natural disaster insurance without some evidence that the insurer will actually pay out in the event of a natural disaster, rather than just declaring bankruptcy. And I would expect people running an honest business to be completely open and understanding of customers' desire for that kind of evidence before they pay for the service.
The tokens themselves are useful, of course. Not because they're demonstrably backed by anything, but because there are enough people out there who will take your tethers in the *belief* that they're backed, or in the belief that *they'll* be able to unload them on people who believe they're backed, or etc. Which is basically how the subprime mortgage crisis happened, I think.


The market cap is far larger than the amount of investment money that's gone into the market. As people often point out, if I create 100 tokens and sell one to you for $1, the market cap of the tokens is $100. If I buy 0.1 token back from you for $1, the market cap is $1000 on a total trading volume of $2. And so on.


So one question is who Tether is selling the created tokens to, and for what. The honest business version of Tether would sell them for dollars only, so that they're always backed by dollars from the moment of creation. But it's hard to understand why anyone would give a company like Tether USD for USDT.
It's more plausible that they're buying other cryptocurrencies. They could then convert them to USD as quickly as possible (the almost-honest approach) or keep the cryptocurrency (the speculate-with-customer-money approach) or just move everything to personal accounts and leave the company insolvent. No one knows what's happening because there's no accountability.


Beats me, but you could've said the same about Mt. Gox. All of these exchanges seem to be held together with spit and chewing gum.


This is a fair point.

You should look at the replies to that comment, too. [Here's mine](@_date: 2019-01-08 06:30:47

From the presentation, here are some of the brain wallet passphrases that this white-hat researcher, working alone, with minimal budget and no profit motive, was able to guess:
* “how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood”
* “Down the Rabbit-Hole”
* “The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dot”
* “gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha”
* “The Persistence Of Memory”
* “QTC”
* “644122178”
* “8964009”
* “que me lleve la muerte”
* “one two three four five six seven”
* “it’s a secret to everybody”
* “Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn”
* “my hovercraft is full of eels”
* “Interior Crocodile Alligator”
* “No need to worry, my accountant handles that”
* “tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier-identification-badge”
* “permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and i care not who makes its laws”
* “who is john galt”
* “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”
It also mentions that 44-bit diceware-style passwords like xkcd's "correct horse battery staple" could probably be guessed in a matter of hours by real attackers. The brain wallet hashes weren't salted, so they could attack every wallet on every compatible blockchain at the same time.

What matters is the amount of entropy that goes into making the password. If you make up the password in your head, there's no real way to estimate the entropy, and it's probably too low to be safe. If you generate the password randomly by a technique like [Diceware]( you probably need more than [xkcd]( suggested 44 bits of entropy. (Not for every password, but definitely when a lot of money is at stake.)
[This page]( uses `witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least` as an example. If it was generated according to [BIP39]( it has 128 bits of entropy. That's more than enough. (I think seven or eight words would be enough, but it's not my money and you shouldn't trust me anyway.)
Edit: For things like online banking where there are extra levels of security like 2FA, and where the bank's insurer is on the hook for your savings if your password or a hash of it is stolen, you're probably safe with lower-entropy passwords even if a lot of money is at stake.
