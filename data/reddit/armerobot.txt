no no no, not yet, we need a bigger discount ;-)

What is mining:
**Treat it as a game** \- you have to arrange Tetris like blocks into regular rectangle. There is one reusable (your wallet address) and a bunch of new blocks of different shapes every ten minutes, the process looks something like this:
1. You gather all the new transaction from the network (btc transfers) - these are different shaped blocks
2. You add your wallet address - one block
3. You add current timestamp - one block
4. You add previous game solution (the big rectangle converted to small block)
5. You add nonce - one random block
   1. Now, you try to arrange all blocks into regular rectangle, if you fail, you throw out that nonce and look for another. Nonce shapes are very rare and difficult to find the fitting one.
6. Once you find the nonce you announce to the network the solution, all transactions you've chosen are set to be valid (1 confirmation level), and the game starts again. 
The process of finding the fitting nonce is difficult and tend to last c.a. 10 minutes, but the nonce verification is very easy and takes fractions of microseconds to check if the solution is valid.
Each - even smallest change in any element of this puzzle completely invalidates your solution. 
Every subsequent solution contains shape of previous solution, invalidating one solution in the past invalidates all the solutions following it.
**What is this for:**
This is needed because it's all about money and there is completely no trust in the system. You get data from network, from different peers, but you don't trust anyone only the math. The Core Bitcoin client checks the whole chain of solutions and validates it for its own purposes. If anyone tries to fool it (f.e. someone prepares transaction and sends some BTC from account that is empty) it has all the data to check if the transaction is valid. 
**Why the reward:**
The more miners, the more computing power and the more difficult is to find a solution (the difficulty is growing). 
Without the reward people wouldn't be interested in mining and securing the system. Someone with big computing power could be able to change transactions in the past (f.e. buy a lambo for BTC and after traditional 6 confirmations   
 \- network finding solutions 6 times in a row - deleting the BTC transfer in the past) using his power recalculate long chain of solutions, polluting network and finally replacing previous valid chain with his own one. You need 51% of computing power of the network to make it possible to happen.

due to "fractional gold reserve system"
in 1971 there was $44 of bank credit issued against every $1 of gold reserves
here is the story of the dollar scam as seen in 1979 [

"Be you own bank"
You don't need any third party to accept bitcoin

no, you don't spend it now
you just need to keep buying it for a few years till the price will reach $1mln  for 1 BTC,  then you are supposed to sell something - but never try to sell all your funds, it will rise until Humans will realize that  Keynesian inflation economics was a joke

Because it's easier for customers to send btc.
Could you imagine someone who is trying to withdraw $400 000 from bitcoin atm? Sending some 34 btc for one lambo is much simpler.

You will never run out, the numbers are declining, but there is always 10% of your free funds

Zero. We assume that no one starts investing with zero funds.

"... won't sell at any price" - really?  It is sad

I am sure, bitcoin can be defeated ... but rather by math or quantum computing than your grandmother ;-)
Crypto can't be just switched off, it will stay here for a long time.
