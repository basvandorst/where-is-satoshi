This is more media bullshit than feminism.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:48:01
Thanks. So it looks like I don't have to do anything or be worried?

I had money and I didn't buy more because I thought it would go lower or stick around in 400-450 range for a bit. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:07:20
Hey maybe you should read the other comment that said the exact same thing, but in a more helpful way! Have a good day!
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:28:47
I am in the camp of "crowd funding creates a bunch of whiny babies". People put money in at the ground floor and expect immediate results based on a prototype or proof of concept. It goes from impatience to pitchforks real fucking fast. 
(I'm speaking about many crowdfunded projects, not this one specifically.)
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:46:40
I agree. Ease of use is the main barrier to most right now.

I was just about to post something. They have been about 25-50 more expensive than any of the exchanges all morning. WTF?
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:40:03
Dammit. I am in a similar situation right now with coinbase. They sent me an email saying they verified me, but I didn't receive the deposits. I thought I would just have to wait until Monday. Were you able to resolve it with them? Should I look into another avenue?

I'm in the US, and yes, buying bitcoins seems to be shrouded in mystery. I did a search, and in a thread about a year old, they were suggesting to open a DWOLLA account and then use the DWOLLA account money at MtGox. Is this still accurate?
I opened a DWOLLA account a few hours ago, and it has yet to be verified.

Damn dude. Nicely done. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:49:33
There's one in Vancouver, isn't there? That's just a hop, skip, and a jump from anywhere in Canada, I hear...
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:59:27
I don't know. Every time it dips slightly lately, people rush to buy, bringing the price back up. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:10:28
Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:17:40
Then hopefully the ship will run a bit smoother.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:43:11
Good to hear. I'm hoping they'll show up tomorrow. I know I'm not the only one with new interest in bitcoin, so I'm just freaking the price is going to jump tomorrow as well.
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:46:38
Thanks a lot for doing this--there's a lot of new information to take in!
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:10:17
That's how they usually work, but right now, if you put an order in you're getting whatever the price is next Monday.

In the thread about the dude who bought a house in Norway, there was (a now-familiar type of) poster saying he almost bout in April and now he's kicking himself. I had recently seen this quote in regards to something else and posted it beneath him. And then I decided to buy some bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:23:31
I can't even buy yet because they haven't verified my account. So I'm just waiting, and watching the value go up...

Asian girlfriends? Those would be hard to come by...*in Asia.*

I'm still waiting on my bank account verification :(

Also, once you become an Eagle Scout, you are one for life. So it should read, "Ross Ulbrich, an Eagle Scout..."

I bought 1/4 of a btc at 225, and figured I'd buy more when I got my next paycheck. Did not think it would more than double. Whoops.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:56:07
hmmm I didn't see an option for that. It says I have to wait for them to cerdit my account, which will take up to 3 business days.
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:58:55
I'm one of those waiting and it's driving me crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:59:16
I gotta work harder on being clever in ...
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:08:01
It would be great if I could buy for the price today. Don't really want to put in an order for an unknown price a week from now...
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:59:06
Hey just wanted to say I got my verification deposits this morning. Just put in my first bitcoin order--.25 btc!
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:09:54
I restarted the process, but there was no fast or slow option, just one option.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:55:47
Damn I've been waiting for a price drop to buy a little more. This doesn't help.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:56:35
Why can't I, hold all these commas?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:50:39
I wasn't referred by anyone, though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:55:57
The gumball is bitcoin, the wind is change, and the mosquito is society. DUH

I just joined this subreddit four days ago, looking to buy bitcoin. Coinbase was highly recommended. I submitted my banking info and have yet to receive my verification deposits. I got an email telling me the deposits had been sent, but they haven't been.
I have a feeling the recent uptick in interest is straining their current staff.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:15:14
5 days is quick?
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:47:43
Gah Coinbase needs to verify my bank account already!
