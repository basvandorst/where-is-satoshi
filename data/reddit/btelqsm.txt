If you want money in your account faster, you can do a wire transfer instead of an ACH transfer.

People were being greedy earlier when the price was going up like crazy, but it just doesn't seem to me from all the articles being written, talk of bubbles, massive selling over the last few days, huge drop in the price over the last few days, that people are being greedy right now.  
Why do you think everyone is being greedy?

CNN needs to realize that bitcoin.com is not a good place to promote for new bitcoin buyers to buy bitcoin or set up a bitcoin wallet as they may accidentally buy Bitcoin Cash.

Ah I see, what about Gemini?  I've not done wire xfers with GDAX but I've done a few wire xfers to Gemini and they all showed up early next morning in my account, fully settled.

Hm, live and learn I guess.
I hope I can get credit for it on coinbase.

The hosts on this show seem a bit dismissive of Mike Novograth when he talks about video game skins, until he mentions how the number of people buying skins exceeds the number of s people buying bitcoin.  This made me think about the Bryant Gumble internet video clip from 1995:
I think viewing audiences should demand hosts who are more informed go on to talk about the crypto industry, otherwise there is the risk of misinformation being spread to the public.

Great link to that old post from 6 years ago.  The fud comments haven’t changed much since that time!  Same fud, different year.

Ellen’s from an older generation, they just won’t get it until it’s so mainstream that you can’t function without it.  Hard to find any white collar jobs right now that don’t require you to communicate via email.  Until then, I think there will be resistance to the unknown, and resistance and fear of  change from the older generations.  They are set in a way of life that they understand and makes sense to them. 
The younger generation of our time, they will be more comfortable with the idea of digital decentralized currencies and will not fear change since they haven’t been set in their ways yet.

If enough bitcoin became inaccessible, and the price of bitcoin goes up due to supply/demand, there may be a point where it may be more profitable to “mine” for the private keys of dormant UTXOs that haven’t had any activity in the past 30+ years than it would be to mine for new blocks on the blockchain. 
An extreme scenario could be if say there’s only 100 circulating bitcoin left and this is post 2040 (no more new bitcoin can be mined) and the price of a bitcoin has gone to the moon.  At some point the worldwide computing power that is dedicated to mining new blocks may find it more profitable to try to randomly guess the private key of very large, old UTXOs (say the ones mined by Satoshi Nakamoto), as this could be way more lucrative to them than the fees earned by mining new blocks.
