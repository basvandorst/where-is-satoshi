He's saying take your time, let the shock process, and find yourself in the simple facts of life on the other side.  As opposed to, say, melting down in some destructive way.

You grossly overestimate my familiarity with general relativity.

I mean, I guess, on paper.  Without an explicit set of rules coupling all spending to revenue statements like 'we're going to increase taxes by x%, but 30% of that x% will sepcifically go to &lt;resource&gt;' don't seem especially meaningful.  But, on paper, it might look like one group or another is paying more for a particular government expenditure because of bill being written that way.
Edit:  But, to be clear, I'm saying it's one big treasury being paid into by all (except the tax avoiders who manage to pay in nothing).  It is from that treasury that the government pays for things.
Edit2:  Military spending accounts for over 50% of discretionary spending but a little less than 25% of total spending, as in the graphic you linked.  So, the percentages around the dollar bill should add up to spending/revenue &gt; 100%, although they add up 100(.1) in the graphic.

Keep in mind that this might make claiming some forks impossible.

OK, OK.  I don't see it but I believe that you guys do.  My mind just doesn't accept taking the connection just because the coincidence seems compelling.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:58:06
Can you explain it please?

It appears they have fixed whatever the issue was and are now reporting a number in line with everyone else.  Who knows?

We all pay into one big pot, friend.  The percentage of my federal income tax going to the military is the same as yours and everyone else's.  Well, everyone except all the large corporations using legal tricks to avoid paying *any* federal income tax.  Which is literally OP's point.

Wow.  I read the linked article and, while I didn't agree with everything he said, I thought he made some thoughtful and unconventional points.  Good food for thought.
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:14:28
Maybe so, but there are [plenty of big firms that do not](
Edit:  Oh, and, you're wrong.  [Amazon paid no federal income tax]( this year.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:19:39
I don't see the pun, I only see a coincidence.  What suggests OP even had "401k" in mind when he created this post?

From the linked comment:


So, Satoshi is saying such a change would have to be made carefully because it would be easy to do it wrong.  How does this undermine the argument that the current RBF implementation is bad?  I have no opinion but I think you are being misleading.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:02:22
Fair enough.  I guess I was contrasting with, say, JPG.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:45:00
Not exactly.  [401k]( is the name given to a particular kind of retirement account which affords tax benefits over a normal savings account but with restrictions for how much can be paid into the account per year and how/when the money can be withdrawn.  It is called a "401k account" after the subsection of the Internal Revenue Code that defines it.

Amazon made several billion dollars profit the same year they paid zero federal income tax (2017), and perhaps other years.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:46:22
Who cares?

It is my understanding that gif produces more compact files when the images contain a limited color palette, which is typically the case with comics.
