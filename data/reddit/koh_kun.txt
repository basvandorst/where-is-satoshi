Wow you went kidding. I just checked the prices for the first time in a while, and they've tanked hard. Glad I got out when I did!
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:59:33
I totally agree with you about how some random dude could transfer funds to some other random dude and then that guy can spend it at some random near shop without having to deal with any middlemen. That's really cool. 
BUT, worker at the meat shop made like 20 taps to get the transaction to happen. That's way too complicated. If it were just a cash register, three or four key presses would have sufficed. I hope one day Bitcoin will reach this level of streamlining.

If you're talking about the same person as I am thinking of, they were really really annoying and their bullish outlook amounted to nothing but speculation made to look like a fact. But that alone doesn't warrant personal insults, childish name-calling, or a ban. I think we're on the same page about this.
I think what ticked people off was how the person was passive aggressive and had this pompous "I make better decisions with my money. why can't you be more polite and have a civilized conversation *like me*?? *I* never said anything mean to you" vibe that didn't settle well. I figured it was just a matter of time until the guy was banned for being a general nuisance. 
I never replied to them because I didn't see the point, but since your one-sided view of the issue makes the entire sub look bad, I thought I'd pitch in my opinion too.

Can someone explain? Why would you need to pay for something in Minecraft?
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:28:47
No, I meant the alts! I had done Ethereum and Monacoin but cashed those out to get a solid profit. I'm holding on to Bitcoin for sure! I actually get paid in Bitcoin by some of my clients.
@_date: 2018-09-26 00:33:41
It didn't occur to me that hosting your own servers would come at a cost (duh), and giving users extra features for some money is a neat incentive as long as it doesn't break the game like some DLCs.

saifu is actually "wallet" in Japanese.

Ah I see! I had never hosted my own minecraft server so I didn't think about the costs that might come with that. Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2018-09-08 07:38:55
I wanna ask you something for the sake of discussion...
You say Bitcoin is incorruptible because it does not involve people. But it does. *People* use Bitcoin. *People* mine bitcoin. So couldn't corrupt people mess with Bitcoin to screw others over? 
@_date: 2018-09-15 22:42:05
Oh ok thanks. That's not so bad.

@_date: 2018-08-27 15:39:26
I certainly am. It seems kinda hard to dual boot with a Windows machine too, but I haven't looked into it too deeply.

Oh cool. This was precisely the kind of sub I was looking for. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:33:26

So you're to blame for this?!
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:02:09
Woohoo, I found a client who is willing to pay me in bitcoins for my services! No more bullshit international bank transfers or dealing with PayPal.

This is so relatable. I'm so frugal in RPGs but used to have such a bad habit of buying the newest shiniest gizmo IRL.

How do exchanges operate in a situation like this? If people are buying Bitcoin with bolivares, the exchange just end up with a bunch of shit fiat. Wouldn't that be too risky for the exchanges?
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:30:09
Listen to this guy.
I had a "this couldn't possibly happen to me" mentality, but one exchange here in Japan is temporarily suspending transfers to new addresses and another says there was something wrong with my ID so I need to resubmit documents until I can trade/transfer my btc. Thank god that 90% of my bitcoin was transferred to my own wallet before any of this happened, but they still have a good chunk of money hostage that I'd like to have full control over...
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:44:34

I've been wondering this for a while: is the lower transaction fees thing a great selling point for consumers?

Is dual booting Windows and Linux very complicated? I was under the impression that I couldn't install different OSs on two separate disks on one machine (or doing so was more complicated than, say, BootCamp on Macs). I'd love to give Linux a try.

@_date: 2018-08-23 05:48:53
OP is wondering if it's possible now. Not just on paper. Sure, Bitcoin COULD be used, but if the electricity company (or whatever service provider) doesn't accept Bitcoin then none of its technological marvels matter.
@_date: 2018-08-25 05:02:25
@_date: 2018-08-13 10:14:19
As far as I know, there's only one electronic chain that accepts Bitcoin, not multiple. So it's not even really close to "almost," imo. But you're right, if convenience stores accepted it, it would be a game-changer.

@_date: 2019-03-06 10:27:23
What I find distasteful about this one in particular is how they used celebrities that just died who have nothing to do with crypto to "pay homage".

@_date: 2019-03-14 04:08:05
Yeah I used to come here for Bitcoin news but now it's all about believe in Bitcoin! All others are trash scams! Screw the non-believers! Look at this ATM I found! Bitcoin will topple the world's power balance, hahaha!!!!

@_date: 2019-03-06 05:55:24
Do they have anything to do with crypto?
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:58:44
Not OP, but for me, I have to pay a few bucks to transfer fiat to my exchange, a few bucks to buy the crypto, and a few bucks to get that BTC out off my exchange, and a few cents when I make a purchase. It's not much but it adds up.
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:46:25
That thumbnail though.
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:57:56
That's basically my plan, haha.
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:24:29
Of course it is. Our exchanges that kept getting hacked aren't just there for show!
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:27:57
Isn't this pretty common? I'm sure Nintendo prepaid card codes do something similar.
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:46:27
So, when they say "blockchain phone" it doesn't mean it has its own little blockchain of some sort, just some wallet function with a kind of "enclave" that keeps your keys away from Android OS, right?
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:37:57
Damn, I really gotta get on this... It's been on my to do list for months.
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:55:12
What does this mean exactly? I use Ledger Nano on my Windows 10 Machine. Are you saying even this isn't recommended (I don't think anything is saved on my computer...)? Sorry for the dumb question.
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:17:16
I'm not sure to be honest. I THINK it might have something to do with money laundering.
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:27:46
I dunno what any of that means but damn that sounds impressive.
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:16:55
The Japanese exchange I use doesn't let me send bitcoin to another wallet for seven days after I buy. I'm thinking this is the same deal for other Japanese exchanges. It would suck if something were to happen during those 7 days... :(
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:11:45
Amazon for sure! BitFlyer (one of our largest exchange here in Japan) used to do this but they've stopped :(
Rakuten would be great too!
I can't find the link, but there's a service like this for Canada but I think it's one guy running it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:23:10
Haha, some people I knew were turned off by the high price because they didn't realize you could buy a tiny fraction of a coin.
@_date: 2018-10-13 03:13:51
They might try to scam you out of it. They could find out what you like by checking out your comments history then get chummy with you to get your guard down.
Maybe I'm paranoid, but it's better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:57:04
It's BitFlyer that has this restriction. I have Zaif too but rarely use it for Bitcoin (used to buy Monacoin). Do you any other ones? Any recommendations?
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:05:41
I need this for Canada and Japan.
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:53:59
They probably have bootleg versions called BCHocolates
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:36:10
I'm sure they'd just change their policy if they're about to go bankrupt. 


Obviously... I don't think they're asking you to chip in if they start losing money.
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:45:04
Guys, I done goofed and forgot to get a Father's Day gift for my dad who lives on the other side of the planet. Is there a way to buy Amazon points using Bitcoin (specifically, Canadian Amazon points) and send it to him?

I have a noob question. 
So, if I want to start accepting Bitcoin for my business and use lightning network for faster processing, I just run a node (not even too sure what that even means, but I'll Google it) and use a wallet on my phone that is compatible with Lighting? Do my clients need to be using a Lightning enabled wallet also?

I'm trying to start accepting Bitcoin for my small business... What's the easiest way of setting the price? Let's say I have a 3000JPY product; would I just convert that to BTC each time a customer asks to purchase it? Is there a more efficient way of doing this?
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:50:17
I just got paid in Bitcoin (via my country's exchange, not Lightning or anything interesting) for the first time! That was kinda cool.

I'm not sure why this would cause a dip, since it's only for new accounts and fine existing accounts might need to provide ID again.
Here's the email I received from them if anyone is interested. 
bitFlyer Inc. responds to improvement order from Japanese Financial Services Agency
On June 22nd, 2018, bitFlyer, Inc.

As a company, we strongly believe that regulation is fundamental to the long-term future of Bitcoin and the virtual currency industry.
 
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused to our customers.

I thought this was pretty interesting. Here's a rough translation/summary by me:
GMO, a crypto-exchange (among other things), is going to be sponsoring a local soccer team in Okinawa. They're going to be paying the team in Bitcoin, which is the first time a transaction like this is happening in Japan. GMO hopes to raise awareness of crytocurrency businesses in Okinawa, and to stimulate the Okinawan economy. They didn't say how much they paid FC Ryukyu, but the bitcoins will go to the team, and a fraction of it will go to the players as well. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:05:16

This is great news but I'm a tad pessimistic. We have SO MANY payment options here and I'm not sure if the people with the most disposable income (older folk) are aware of the benefits of Bitcoin. I hope it's super simple for everyone to just start using Bitcoin because a lot of us Japanese people are surprisingly technically inept. 
In any case, I hope this thing takes off!
@_date: 2019-02-10 08:31:57
I don't really understand how that thing works. So someone buys it for me instead and they get paid in btc? What happens if I wanna return an item?
@_date: 2019-02-22 02:52:03
One thing I disagree with your comment is the fact that you think electric cars were a joke before Tesla. It was an actual threat to the oil industry that it was squashed before it became mainstream. Check out the documentary *Who Killed the Electric Car?* If anything, I think Musk was ridiculed for trying to fight what seemed like an unwinnable war against, not because his tech was a joke.
@_date: 2019-02-22 02:56:01
Did you get any user feedback yet? No offense, but I'd be so pissed if this happened to a paid app and if I didn't already use bitcoin. Like, why are you promoting things completely unrelated to the app?

Holy shit, just let the guy be.

@_date: 2019-04-08 03:11:02
Thank you for reminding me, but I realize that. I don't have to like "Bitcoin art" to appreciate the technology... I like having money, but I don't paint dollar and yen symbols everywhere to remind everyone around me. It's just different strokes for different folks.

Damn, I'm on mobile so I rarely look at the sidebar. Thank you friend.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:15:05
Thanks so much for answering. I'll have to do some reading come winter holidays!
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:35:22
I see bitflyer
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:36:16
I can help!
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:43:39


Don't be silly, it doesn't have feelings.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:13:19
Their comment sounds a bit silly especially that part about Chinese people looking alike as if no other race would have this problem of looking similar to one another... 
That being said, i think his concerns aren't without merit. Even if only 1% of facial recognition failed on the Chinese population, that's still like 15 million people who'd be affected by that. That's like the entire population of Tokyo metropolis.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:40:50
That's awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:03:36
I'm sorry, I have to ask...Were trying to type "vulnerabilities?"
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:22:41
Editorial? Rubbish?
@_date: 2018-11-05 03:57:34
Oh no way, I had no idea!
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:40:25
"Cool, the Daily Discussions thread is so active. Hey guys what's... Ooooh my gawd."
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:03:02
I'm not sure if you understood the article correctly. This isn't saying that we have good economic health. We might have a strong policy -- as in, the prime minister is sticking to his guns -- but that's not the same thing as sound policy.
@_date: 2018-11-07 03:18:09
Was there some kind of announcement made for this up tick, or is it just Bitcoin doing whatever the fuck it wants to do like usual?
@_date: 2018-11-04 12:02:04
I would love to be able to use this for Steam and Amazon in both Japan and Canada.
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:41:27
Yeah I think I remember reading Canadian homes are surprisingly bad at insulating heat. Something about needing more heat efficient windows? OP might wanna look into that too.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:02:24
I'm not even a car guy but damn that's really nice.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:38:55
Yeah just goes flat for a few hours then crashes. It's been like that a lot this year imo.
Edit: I'm feeling like a pretty big dummy right now. Sure showed me, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:26:57
I mean, even Walmart is pretty gung-ho about using blockchain for its supply chain so i don't think industrial-scale blockchain adoption is such a far-fetched idea.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:44:12
That's good to know! I thought I would have to teach my potential customers about setting up their own nodes and stuff if I set up a lightning payment system for my business. Thanks a lot for clarifying.
@_date: 2019-01-12 21:57:28
You really should check what monopoly means.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:16:46
Good on you for thinking of your kids' happiness. I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:22:34
I had no friggin idea their margins were so thin.
@_date: 2019-01-10 15:57:56
Not everyone in the whole world is as enlightened as you are, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:47:57
Are you serious? People send money overseas all the time.
@_date: 2019-01-05 04:43:02
It's weird how the colours are reversed in Japanese charts.
@_date: 2018-11-02 05:32:14
This is US only right?
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:11:03
uh, no. Being frustrated at piss poor design is not an outrageous concept.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:23:46
They have a Twitter account, maybe you could DM then for info?
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:29:28
Technically, as of 2016 they're second to Amazon by a small margin. But if you consider the fact that they had huge lead in the beginning, you could say they're fighting a losing battle (still a huge market though, which you're right about).
I was just sharing an opinion as someone who lives in Japan.
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:44:27
From what I've learned in stocks (I'm no expert though), more people are likely to panic sell than panic buy.
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:28:40
I see, thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:00:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:38:57
Right? And some buttholes are down voting me for expressing my opinion.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:29:34
They'll probably add three more notches on the screen just so they can outdo Apple.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:32:50
I dunno about Bitcoin itself being a scam, because I think there are devs out there that are really trying to get this thing going. But people who promote it as if it's surely going to be profitable and mindlessly cry Hodl are pretty fucking dodgy. I personally hate all these so called analysts that predict 150k by whatever year.
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:10:00
The only problem is that I never buy stuff from them. Each store designs their own webpage and it's so stressful to look at. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:21:19
In the EC space alone they have Weibo, Alibaba, Rakuten, Walmart, Costco, and pretty much every other retail store. In terms of AI, they have Google, Apple, Microsoft, and even open-source projects like Mycroft. Streaming, again are the other giants like Google and Apple. They also need to worry about Netflix, HBO, and I think I heard Disney is probably going to start their own. Sony and Rakuten make their own ebook readers and pretty much any device with a screen can read e books so there's nothing forcing us to only use Kindle app or service. Not only do they have to fight international giants, they also have to worry about smaller regional players, so they face stiff competition in whatever new market they enter.
Pretty much any space that they try to take over, by definition, has existing players that they must compete with.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:03:29
What? There are plenty of Amazon competitors.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:52:20
Sorry I haven't really done any research into the technicals of Bitcoin so this might be a stupid question... Will 100% ever be mined and when/if it does, does the value of Bitcoin change at all?
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:43:32
And they said Bitcoin couldn't scale.
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:28:22
That's the presentation where they said all existing hardware wallets could be hacked right? 
I wonder if there will be security updates to ones they already sold.
Edit: At the risk of sounding like a whiny little bitch, can someone tell me why my comment was downvoted? Is it not a relevant question/comment? If someone can clarify, I'll do my best to refrain from making similar comments in the future.
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:53:38
Seriously. How do they pay for everything?
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:16:55
Your parents probably just got to the meat shop an hour late and the Bolivar's value dropped again.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:48:02
I'm still kinda lost about this lightning hoobajoo. So do I not need to run a ~~nice~~ node to simply use it? Just get Eclair for my phone?
Edit: typo
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:19:19
Ok, hating the concept of fiat is one thing but hating our money's design is another. Our bills and coins are cool.
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:23:22
Now with 20% more drama than it's worth!
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:13:42
Yes inweed!
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:57:59
If you guys figure this one out, EA and Adobe would be all over BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:36:37
Is there a reason why those memes are always Vegeta?
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:51:11
I think it's a European thing. I even had to pay in a mall.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:36:08
Oh shit, they did? Is cashing out crypto difficult in Canada? I wanted to send my dad some Bitcoin from Japan.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:39:59
I was kinda hoping it would dip a tad lower so I could achieve my target bitcoin amount by this month. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:35:15
Wow that's pretty harsh. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:42:50
"No, I don't know anything about how this works but let me tell you why it sucks."
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:55:18
It's the friggin' DMM billboard in Tokyo that people keep posting once a week.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:04:50
Do it, for us.
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:15:43
But when you say "I can't loan you a Bitcoin" aren't you comparing it to the way we use currency? I just found out about assets-based loans, but afaiu that's putting up assets as collateral for a loan. Sorry if I've misunderstood your comment, I'm new to all this stuff.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:07:40
10% discount, damn.
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:32:48
TIL, thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:33:57
Yeah I got pretty riled up reading the op. How could you lump those two together with someone who got famous for having a sex tape?
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:57:00
@_date: 2018-07-09 12:03:20
I can't seem to find in the article why this dealership is an important dealership as OP's title suggests.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:03:26
How else would you guys free us from oppression?
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:14:53
Name your kid Satoshi. Also, congrats!
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:49:48


Would this be good for Bitcoin or...?
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:59:42
This is so weird that there are two measurement systems involved in this. But I guess it happens more often than I imagine.
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:45:05
I was wondering about this. I kept seeing ads of legit exchanges like DMM and even for something weird like Bunnycoin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:15:06
Isn't that the same with any currency?
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:51:53
I think "blocks and chains" would have been better.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:28:52
Awesome. I live in Japan too, but I don't know of any stores around my area that accepts Bitcoin :(
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:10:15
VII didn't age well IMO. Hardly any of the 1st gen 3D games did.
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:53:25
Damn Internet, there's always someone that proves me wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:46:29
The story and the system is great, for sure! But I'm totally shallow so if it doesn't look nice, it's not 100% enjoyable. We're making 8 and 16 bit inspired games in 2018, but I can't imagine anyone making PS1 inspired polygon games any time soon. The remake looks insane though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:54:39
So much irrelevant information Jesus Christ. I couldn't even get myself to finish reading it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:40:01

@_date: 2018-12-27 11:25:56
Can iPhone even do payments other than Apple pay?
Edit: nvm, according to a user below, the Xs and Xr have open NFC, not just Apple pay.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:38:08
In Japan, we have dividends and stock owner perks like annual (or even biannual) gifts and special discount cards. It's pretty nifty.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:16:35
Also, whales buy and sell Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:34:05
Did you just ask if they accepted Bitcoin out of the blue or did you see a sign outside too? It'd be cool to start asking that in tourist areas kinda like how people say "do you accept USD?"
I likely won't start ~~showing~~ spending btc again until I'm out of the red though :p
Edit: typo
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:27:12
There are companies working on AR food experiences. Like, if they could project fried rice colours onto that rice, you'd probably "taste" fried rice instead on plain white rice.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:15:41
I guess if you're offering a service you could get away with it... But if you sold stuff, wouldn't the government wonder how you're able to afford the products that you're settling if you're buying them with fiat?
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:57:38
Ok thanks, but that didn't answer my question, unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:52:06
Unfortunately, All these companies are releasing their own digital cash less payment systems now so the masses will flock to those for sure. Bitcoin doesn't have the instant gratification like "10% off if you sign up in November" or free transfers between users AND it's made and promoted by brands that we've come to trust. I don't think the world can count on us to lead the way in two life crypto adoption quite yet... 
Although, I'd like to do my part by starting accepting Bitcoin for my English lessons and even offer a discount for students who pay in Bitcoin :) Some of my translation clients from overseas already do which is pretty darn cool.
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:27:50
It's also kind of rude in any kind of forum to just start busting out a language that clearly isn't being used as a primary language.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:20:28
Why? What does that random line even mean? Where did it come from?
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:29:50
Can you give specific examples? You make it sound like buying a Qur'an with a Visa is impossible because of their Christian friends. Which I highly doubt is true.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:05:29
As if vaping didn't already do that.
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:18:12
Pardon my ignorance, but when you say you invested in these projects do you mean you bought their company stock? I've been reading all these implementations of blockchain technology for food supply chain and want to invest, but have no idea where to start.
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:14:25
How is it any different from LINE Pay or WePay? Does it even need to be crypto currency?
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:15:30
I wanna say it'll only take you four weeks, but I also want the price to go up. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:02:56
These are usually just called cartoons. Are you thinking of 'satirical cartoons'?
