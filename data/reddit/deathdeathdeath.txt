Bitcoin hasn't been big enough for long enough to know how it reacts to a full market cycle, what you need are assets with a [beta]( of near zero.
Beta is a measurement of how correlated a certain asset is to the market. Gold for example tends to have a slightly negative beta, as it tends to rise as markets fall.

What's your rationale behind ever levying up to buy bitcoin? Lest us forget the failure of [LTCM]( as a cautionary tale on combining leverage and high risk investments.

It's not *Free*, but I could certainly see it being far cheaper than minting physical currency. Think of all of the machinery and resource that goes into that. Not to mention the network infrastructure and computing/electricity costs associated with sloshing money around in large banks.

That's not shady at all, that's how long payment verification takes between two banks normally.

Not sentiment, it's calculated from how close the relationship between the movement of the asset and the movement of a basket of major market indecies (S&amp;P 500, DJIA ("The Dow"), QQQ (NASDAQ),R2000 (Russell), Etc.). So a negative beta moves with a negative relationship to these indecies, positive beta moves with them, 0 beta means no correlation at all. Sentiment isn't actually quantifiable (unfortunately, ha!).
It's one of the many measurements used in [Modern Portfolio Theory](

Second global crash? Do you mean 'second' as in fifth?

That's just a sole proprietorship, you are then liable for everything your company does and your personal items can be repossessed for your company's debts. It can work for small businesses and freelancers, but nothing sizable can feasibly be structured that way.
Edit: And you'll still owe personal income tax, plus capital gains tax if you use BTC, because it's now classified as property.

Maybe among retail traders, but the industry has long moved on...
Sure the LTCM example may not apply 1:1 to the case of buying bitcoin, but it illustrates the idea of leverage amplifying the fluctuations in an asset's value.
I grant you that I mistook you for a moustache-wearing PBR drinking get-rich-quick bitcoin 'investor', hence using the extreme case. But I couldn't imagine a reasonable person exposing 50% of their capital to an asset with 114% historical annualized volatility, much less 150% of it.

This notice applies to "Digital Currencies" not just Bitcoin. So digital currencies are now property. If you trade XBT to LTC, it's the same as trading BTC for a Table. Both are property.

I don't think he was stating a problem that he needed a solution to.
I'm more than happy running a company in the country I live in (Not the US, but the point stands) rather than screwing my own government out of its legitimate income by incorporating in the Bahamas.
On top of that, the convenience of running your business in the country you live in is great. It prevents the need for constant (expensive) wire transfers when you need to pay yourself/employees.
