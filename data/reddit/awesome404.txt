When I spoke to the woman from Apple she said I could accept them through the App Store instead of Bitcoin. But, this means nothing until it's actually implemented and accepted.

That certainly doesn't look like something that could have just "slipped by".

Cause Apple makes it a pain in the ass to make new apps for old firmware.

The app will only update the badge icon if it's in the background.

TIL there are more Bitcoin ATMs in Canada than The States.

Actually, considering they seem to have been trying to keep it off the store I'm surprised they didn't. More functionality is to come; breaking v1 thru the door is one of the hardest things to do. It's hard to poor hours into creating an app only to have it denied flat out. Now that it's only updates that need to be approved not the app as a whole, I am willing to invest more time and energy

Right now I am implementing a 24 hour graph when to turn the phone to landscape orientation which I plan to make an in app purchase.
I'd like to keep it free of ads, but I might end up adding them.
I have considered adding other exchanges in the future or branching it off to a new app. We'll see.

The donate button showed a dialog that gave you the option to copy a bitcoin address to the clipboard or show a QR code. The wallet is was one I controlled. Everything else is accurate.

There is a difference between reoccurring debits and reoccurring deposits. Unlike traditional banking a creditor can't debit a bitcoin wallet. However it is technically possible to have reoccurring deposits to the creditor.

I had an option to donate bitcoins. I guess it wasn't so much of a battle as a run around. They kept rejecting the app for various reasons and once I fixed the "problem" they came up with something new. After about a month and a half they finally called me and said "You can not submit and app that initiates a bitcoin transaction." It was a 15 minutes conversation, but that's all they really said.

It's not editable. From what I understand the more you use the app the more iOS will let the app update in the background.

I have a simple one at the moment. My main focus has been getting past the approval process.

I didn't say anything about actually getting haircuts, only needing them.

I was only aware of the one at Spadina &amp; King.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:02:45
I actually talked to someone from Apple on the phone. Their problem wasn't that I was asking for donations, it was that I was "initiating a Bitcoin transaction". Who knows though, maybe if I was initiating ANY type of non-AppStore transaction I would get the same response.

When I got my Bitcoin app, ฿ Average, rejected they referred me to [Section 22.1]( of the App Store Review Guidelines.
I was just asking for Bitcoin donations...
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:30:30
That is correct. But to add to it, you did have to hit a text button that was the address, which brought up a dialog that said something to the effect of "Please consider donating bitcoins to support this project", with three buttons "No Thanks", "Copy Address" and "QR Code".

Yes, the badge icon will update when the app is in the background. (The update intervals are determined by iOS.)
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:24:31
It may not be released on the German store yet. It should be there soon. The only store that I have not released it in is Iceland because Bitcoin is illegal there.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:54:03
The badge is updated via background fetch and must be running in the background.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:33:48
฿ Average uses the BitcoinAverage Price Index to update the app’s badge icon to the value of Bitcoin in your chosen currency. I am looking for feedback from the community to make this app better.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:26:17
The way we update the badge icon in the background relies on features of iOS 7.

If miners are needed to validate transactions, what will be the incentive when all the coins are mined? Please don't say transaction fees...

I second this. I have been wrestling with Apple for a month and they finally called me and said "Your app can not initiate a BitCoin transition." (period) My app was just asking for donations! It's now in review with the donations removed...
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:32:08
[BitcoinAverage]( has an API that's pretty easy to use.
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:51:52
While I agree with you, I think it needs to be rephrased. Wallet *software* should do this. There is no way for something like a paper wallet to do this, but wallets being managed by a service like blockchain or software running your computer could do it easily.

I know a lot of languages... I like Ruby for a beginner language. If you want to go ELI5, try Scratch.

Well, here's my thinking... I want to add features for a "pro" version but I don't want to add them all at once. I can't add them as free and then charge for them when they are all implemented and I can't add the "pro" features one at a time or people will uninstall it and stop telling people about it. Your input is making me think I should go back to donations or add ads...

There isn't an option for WiFi only at the moment. It will be considered for future versions. Each update is under 200 bytes and never happens more than once a minute. So the *absolute most* it could use in a day would be 140kb.
