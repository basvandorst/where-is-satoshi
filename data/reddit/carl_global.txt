Why yes I accept Bitcoin... *whips out dick*

I thought transferring was considered a taxable event. For example, buying on an exchange and sending to cold storage. Is this correct?

These will arrive long before the max coins are mined in 2140.

Or wait for the rebound. Lots here bought well below those prices anyway and would still be ahead.

HODLERS vs whales vs banks. This is gonna get ugly.
Will whales HODL? Will banks and whales collude? Will HODLERS panic sell?
Have that popcorn on standby.

Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government...
Nobody is buying it anymore! Printing money is a scam. Next up... more war! Great for the economy. 2020 perhaps?

Environment + personality/mindset + interplay between the two.
There is definitely a culture of living in debt in the US and it needs to stop.

Gotta live a little! People enjoy different things at different costs.

Man's not hot.

In the end these experiences make you a better person. Just be careful not to fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation. Be comfortable but conservative. Humble yet confident.

GDAX is Coinbase.

Awesome! Must be a lot.. Hammerbacher is a billionaire after all.

Acquire bitcoin, trade for guns?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:02:38
Couldn't whales do this as well? They can buy futures too.
I absolutely believe cheap coins will be gobbled up. It's gonna be a wild ride.

Sadly I agree. Perhaps the true purpose of BTC is to make people more aware of the current monetary policies. In the long run it would be the same but right now with early adoption it has the potential to free people from debt as seen by numerous anecdotes in this sub.

Same process just use your passport for verification if you are comfortable doing so. You can close your current account and re-open using the same credentials (name, email, etc...).

Keep it secret! Keep it safe!!

Yes. It is a great wallet.

Dip after the fork and then rebound?
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:48:08
You get an equal amount but they won't have equal value.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:37:12
If you don't control your private keys you don't really control your bitcoin. By moving to a hardware or desktop wallet only you have access to the key (barring any security issue such as a keylogger). Hardware and paper wallets are the most secure.

Sell on an exchange and have equivalent USD deposited into your account, less fees.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:00:48
Do what you wish with the money you earn, within reason of course. It's anonymous you know ;)

Emergency savings should not be touched. That's how you wind up in credit card debt.
Yes, you could make a healthy profit from it but you could also end up needing it if/when BTC plummets.

Hey just want to chime in to let you know I had the same issue with Coinbase verification. Use a secure US proxy to set up the account and then all you need to upload is a US driver's license. They designate the country in your profile based on IP ;)
