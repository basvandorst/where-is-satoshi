Yes definitely. I just sent a small BTC transaction to a hardware wallet and it was 10 minutes before the tx was even broadcast to the network.  Then it showed up suddenly already with one confirmation.

It’s saying that if there is a ‘bubble’, it hasn’t come anywhere near peaking yet.  Further, it’s saying that if this projected ‘bubble’ bursts in the future, the value of the crypto market after the burst will be 12 trillion.  We are not even at 1 trillion yet.  
All speculation but it’s fun to ponder.

Is it business as usual in South Korea?

You can collect fees for routing lightning transactions.  But the fees are almost nothing, kinda the point of the ln.  So it’s just playing around with the network right now and being able to say that I am contributing.  There’s about 8000 ln channels open right now.  I think in a year or so it could be 10 times that amount.  If I can do it, anyone can.  I am a computer dunce and still figured it out.

Bitcoin is whatever it is to you.

This is the biggest reason to hodl.  There WILL be apps, gadgets, and interfaces in the near future that will make interactions with bitcoin seamless. Its going to take some time, but anyone holding bitcoin when it becomes as easy as Apple Pay , will be very well off.

The only consensus needed is for the development of Bitcoin, how you use it is up to you. Some people use it as a store of value, some use it for purchases, some use it to send to family in different countries, some use the LN.

Your intolerance for different opinions speaks volumes of your character.  
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:50:52
I had been trying to do exactly this and your video helped a lot.  I now have 7 open channels on eclair!   It’s nice to be part of something this early on in its development.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:14:15
Thanks for the reply. Yup that’s the one I tried. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful and tried several times.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:26:07
How do I check to see if the transaction indexing is turned on?
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:13:43
I think this was the issue!  Thank you!  It’s indexing now, I’m guessing it will be a couple days.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:27:29
Update-  I am up and running!  I have 6 open channels on the lightning network running eclair!

Then why the fuck are you asking?  It sounds like your mind is made up already. Go ahead and do it. Do you want reddit to hold your hand?

Satoshi is an alien.  He came from the future to save us. We are but a pimple on the body of all that was created.

Is that worth your time and anonymity?  That’s not that far if you are serious about this.

This information is very useful.   It shows a big adoption of BTC.

Your reply is low effort and you sound like an angry person. Cheer up. I’ve been a supporter of Casa since the beginning. It’s one of the best in the space.  My comment was that the LN is not good at routing larger payments, YET.  It will be. You assume I am shitting on a specific project and you assumed wrong.

But you’re implying they have that money sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy back in.  I would imagine that if anyone bought high, then sold at 11k, they probably used that money for something else and can not buy back in.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:38:02
Agreed.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:00:29
Where do you place them?  Do you pay rent for space?
Do they dispense cash as well or just allow buying of BTC?
Did you go through an intermediary like a company or is it all on your own?  
Sorry for so many questions but I have been looking into this recently.

Op- your intolerance is deafening.  Telling others what to think is the definition of fascism.
