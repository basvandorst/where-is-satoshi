Deep packet inspection = government mandates that ISP's control the CryptoCoin data traffic flow. Hopefully we can use VPN's &amp; such to get around this potential cohersion.

Thank you for this clarification. I will work closely with my accountant to ensure that I am in compliance.

Thanks, this may be a good point for many folks to consider. (coincidentally, I actually do have a computer repair LLC &amp; my stuff gets written off as much as possible by my accountant)

Mining directly to an exchange address: 
=no transfer fees? = GOOD?
(no wallet file size)
=ensures "Miner" tax accountability? = BAD?
(non-anonymous wallet)
(many report success when mining directly to exchange wallets)
==What Are Your Thoughts??

- the official IRS document says that $20,000 &amp; over requires the exchange to generate a 1099.
... so, doesn't this mean that anything below $20,000 is not required to be reported?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:04:35
This makes sense. Thank you.
I will always defer to my accountant's advice.

Then what does this mean? 
(from the USA IRS official document): 
"Q-15: Are there IRS information reporting requirements for a person who settles
payments made in virtual currency on behalf of merchants that accept virtual
currency from their customers?
A-15: Yes, if certain requirements are met. In general, a third party that contracts with
a substantial number of unrelated merchants to settle payments between the merchants
and their customers is a third party settlement organization (TPSO). A TPSO is
required to report payments made to a merchant on a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and
Third Party Network Transactions, if, for the calendar year, both (1) the number of
transactions settled for the merchant exceeds 200, and (2) the gross amount of
payments made to the merchant exceeds $20,000."

As long as your earnings are under the IRS's $20,000 statement, then what miner in their right mind would report the earnings of an ANONYMOUS wallet?

GPU manufacturers will have more money for R&amp;D -thus producing better products for gamers. Also more money for larger production factories -thus producing more products for gamers. =You are welcome gamers. Your temporary inconvenience was ultimately fueled by huge out-of-pocket capital investments from miners. Ask me nicely &amp; I would actually sell you a GPU at a reasonable price. -sincerely.

As both a gamer &amp; a miner, here are my thoughts on people saying "I wish crypto currency would die":
