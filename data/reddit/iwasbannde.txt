That is not what im here for
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:56:26
I mean.. we are talking about it now right? I don't know anything more, maybe just a kneejerk reaction but the system seems so unsustainable somehow. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:15:20
Yea, my concern is cost. Somebody is paying for that energy. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:06:39
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:25:42
Somebody is paying for energy costs to mine coins and verify transactions. The price of the coin needs to outweigh the costs of energy, if this doesn't happen the only thing that would stop bitcoins price from falling is the faith that it'll recover. 
Where am I wrong? Think about it for more than a second old man 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:10:50
May I ask how the scaling is broken? It seems like the blocks can get bigger and bigger forever
Very nice downvotes here. I legit don't know enough about the topic. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:09:46
Hey thanks I didn't know people don't want to talk! :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:42:14
Ayyy this is me. % gains are more than what I can complain about.

Strong = great capacity for adaptation

What high horse did you find yourself on today? I'm actually just asking a question, if you don't feel like answering tell me instead of creating a power dynamic with you at the top. 
I now don't want to hear your point of view anyway, if this is the level of petty you're resorting to. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:50:21
So how will bitcoin not die at that time? Transactions are wrapped up in this equation too. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:37:45
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:41:50
I'm legit asking. I don't know enough about it. Nice downvote btw.
Please eli5
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:29:47
I'm not sure what that is 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:43:06
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:03:40
My point is that price of the coin is tied to the hashing power. I understand what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:16
It's what happens when people got thousands of coin for essentially free. Greed gonna greed
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:45:39
This is their working wallet. If many people wanted to withdraw it would run out pretty quick
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:09:41
Hold your keys or you have no coins, even in a bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:43:11
How will you lose anonymity with bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:40:37
I don't know about you but I'm taking my gains and waiting for this all to blow over (3-8 months). I'd say I'm in this market for a week more max till I cash out, maybe I'll buy some gold or something
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:32:55
What wallet do you use? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:30:10
Well we need to make progress on that lightening network I've been hearing about. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:03:04
So there is no reason for them to mine then? = bitcoin dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:17:45
Perfect match though, down to the order of operations, 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:38:05
nice shitpost I guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:18:55
You're fucking stupid, we don't know yet that's the point. "hey I think there is a better way to make engines here.." "oh yea? Show me right now like right now" 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:49:09
I'm getting the same feeling today
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:09:16
Printing money that &gt;90% of the time coincides with jumps in btc price seem sus. Saying they were going to release an audit and yet not seems sus. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:50:25
Yea, but. I'm expecting it to drop.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:23
I'm taking shit about BOTH SIDES, that is my post, i posted this in btc too. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:12:37
Yea but at what point does the cost of energy for the miners outweigh the price of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:09:56
how 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:05:25
If a wallet needs any information from you it's a shitty and scamish wallet. The purpose of a wallet is to NOT be connected to your bank.
Do more research, I've actually never heard of wallets needing more than 2fa info
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:35:05


Completely forgetting that coins get harder to mine every day. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:56:02
CNBC don't like bitcoin. CNBC is owned by Comcast. hmm 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:41:30
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:40:28
I didn't pick up on it. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:56:27
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:38:19
And then we have JP just saying, 'Whaaa it's baaaad" 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:37:05
In underdeveloped countries I don't think the problem lies in people being able to be in contact with bitcoin. They have a problem with being in contact with the internet at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:48:01
Is this bitcoin related? also if one other person has commented on this thread, you're shadowbanned. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:09:14
we've had 9 years for common folk to discover it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:16:21
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:07:48
Your only option is to tell as many people close to you to buy before the price gets too high to own a single coin ayy
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:59:43
That is ultimately the goal. Foreign peoples across country using bitcoin as a mutually acceptable currency. More similar to USD right now
