Nice $946000. They can do so much with $796000.

So you had 5 BTC in December and held everything in alts?
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:06:02
If you entered at btc ath all alts are down.
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:59:33

A hero we need.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:25:01
Umm, there is an alt that done well in this market?
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:45:34
Or it could go to zero or one million by end of the year. That is the actual best or worst scenario.
Your scenario is just not the best and not the worst.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:30:50
If I have to make a wild guess, we will see 40-45k ath and a correction to 30-35k by the end of 2018 or early January.
Set your reminders!
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:17:25

The red is more or less what it costs to mine 1 btc at that time, btc will go up as the difficulty of mining increases.
There is no way in hell the bunker people will let it go wild in both directions without correcting it to mining cost level. They are going to milk it as slow and as much as they can.
For the simple non trading HODL folk anything 5500-6500 is good to buy. Than check back in 4 to 5 years when the  mining cost is astronomic due to increased difficulty.

And yet we are going up since BCHSV crapped out.
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:45:17
Is there going to be free Bitcoins for cake days?
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:08:55

If you trade with Binance it has a built in alert system. But yea, you need to set up each coin individually.

Have you ever seen a shitcoin being pumped?
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:57:02
The bots are scanning tweets and selling the news.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:39:44
Thats not what your post about.
