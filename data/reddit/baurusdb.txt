It's obvious why Bitcoin was *created*, but does that mean market participants must keep using it that way? The Internet was originally created to facilitate communication between universities. The state of the Internet today, was never the intention of the creators.
At the end of the day, market conditions will dictate Bitcoin's use, not the intention of the creator (they could, of course, overlap).

There's generally two ways to do this:
1. The beautiful way. You somehow have Calc return only the USD value. I am not familiar with Calc and I'm not sure if it can handle JSON like this. This leads us to... 
2. The ugly way. You have Calc return the JSON request in 1 string and you then extract a part of it (called a substring). In order to get the substring, you will usually need 2 indeces, namely (1) startIndex and (2) endIndex. An index is simply the position of the relevant character or string within the larger string. In our case, the startIndex would be the second ":" and the first "}". I suggest looking up "Calc Substring" or something similar on the Internet.

The problem with a cashless society where currency is issued by a centralised authority is that they will have absolute power (even more power than they have now). What would you be able to do with a frozen bank account? Exactly, almost nothing. You woud live in (more) fear.   
The only alternative for you would be barter, living in the wild or in a cult-like community.  
So while I dislike fiat currencies, I believe we currently still need cash, as it's one of our last means of a freedom of sorts. **This is where Bitcoin comes in, as it would be decentralised**, so after Bitcoin becomes mainstream, by all means, get rid of paper currency.

Basically, the supposed problem with Bitcoin is that we hoard, rather than spend, seeing as the price of bitcoins (long-term) rises (or at least should rise) because of its deflationary characteristics.  
It is obvious a rational merchant wants to be paid (if the long-term interests him) in bitcoins, because of the same reason we are hoarding.  
The merchant is therefore faced with a problem: "*Potential clients will not spend their bitcoins at the same level of fiat prices, so I will need to offer them an incentive to spend.*" (Usually a certain discount).
That discount, AA says (or estimates), is usually around 30-40%, depending on the type of product being sold, among other variables.

You don't convince them. They convince themselves using 'evidence' you presented or they look up themselves.
That being said, the first thing I do when 'presenting' Bitcoin, I start off by telling them the pro's of using bitcoins (fast, secure, anywhere, ...) and then show them a bitcoin transaction (most of the time I set up a new address and buy bitcoins with fiat money). After that, I usually give them the private key with some instructions on how to import it into a wallet - no sane person denies being given free money. If I feel they don't yet fully grasp it, I just keep the privkey.
After that transaction, they will usually start asking questions (anywhere from legal issues, theory of money, places that accept bitcoins, "arrest of Bitcoin CEO" (and other misconceptions), ...), that I try to reply or reply to by providing them video's or articles online.

Price is always and only the result of supply and demand (unless an entity like the govt sets the price or price agreements in for instance oligopolies).
News can affect the price only if the market decides to act on it.
My thought: Those companies accepting bitcoins dump their bitcoins instantly through the payment processors. The amount of coins on the market because of this exceeds the amount of demand, resulting in lowering prices.

That would only be true if the **entire** supply of Bitcoin were to halve (i.e. all of the bitcoins in existence). The halving (luckily) only affects the future supply.
Just because the company **needs** the price to double to maintain the same profit, doesn't mean the market will think the same.

This also isn't true, since some people run [older versions of the protocol]( at least node-wise.

Another 'rule of thumb in PR' (and business in general) is to be consistent, which they obviously aren't (as shown in the picture).  
They really do need to comment, preferably on the cause of the change in fees, why they failed to comment in time, and why they thought a $15 fee would work out in the first place. They obviously aren't obliged to do this, but it's highly recommended, especially if you don't really have a customer base.

For the record:
* Price inflation is when prices rise, causing loss of purchasing power.
* Monetary inflation is an increase in money supply (for example caused by issuing new units of the currency or open market operations by e.g. the ECB)
* Price deflation is when prices decline, causing an increase of purchasing power;
* Monetary deflation is a decrease in money supply (for example caused by decreasing velocity of money transactions).

While downloading Bitcoin core, an attacker could attach malware to the download stream which would replace your hot wallet address with one of his addresses when withdrawing. Luckily you'll be able to verify the download by comparing the checksum of the original Bitcoin core and your newly created copy.

What is your definition of inflation? I think you're confused.
There's a significant difference between **price inflation** and **monetary inflation**:




Let us analyse what you said a bit more:


This applies to 'definition' 2 (monetary inflation).
The following:


applies to 'definition' 1 (price inflation), I presume*, since most central banks try to have a (price) inflation of under, but close to 2%, on the medium term ([ECB]( [FED]( [BoE]( [BoC](
\*: "lower than average in the dev world" would have to be lower than 2% and since the Bitcoin inflation rate in 2021 is 1.79%, I came to that presumption.

Not even sure where I said/implied that we would not see a sunset or sunrise (Is there a difference between experiencing a sunset/sunrise, or the actual sunset/sunrise btw? I mean, if I die right now, I'd win, right?). 
I have no reasons to believe I will not be experiencing a sunset/sunrise in the coming 24 hours, else I would not be chatting with you here (and I would likely accept your bet, depending on why I think we wouldn't experience a sunset/sunrise).
There are, however unlikely, factors that **could^could^could^could** prevent a sunset/sunrise.
You are simply misinterpreting my point.

Some interesting points:




other innovations, is essentially positive, as it can contribute to meeting new payment 
needs and to making payments cheaper and more secure. those who choose to use a 
particular payment service can be expected to do so because it gives them an added 
value in relation to other payment services. This also applies to virtual currencies:
 
* VC's can for instance make some cross-border payments simpler, faster and cheaper. 
* Another advantage is if the payer does not need to share sensitive information, such 
as card number or bank account number, with the payee. 
* Virtual currencies may also 
be better suited for small payments, so-called micro payments, on some websites.




* Issuing these currencies is not subject to regulation and the issuers are not under financial supervision. 
* This means that consumer protection is weak in certain aspects and that the users may 
be exposed to risks. 
* For example, the allocation of responsibility between the payer 
and the payee may be unclear if anything were to go wrong with the payment.
* There is also the possibility of exchange rate risk arising in connection with the virtual 
currencies that can be converted if the exchange rate is volatile, that is, the holder 
of the virtual currency runs the risk that it will fall in value.
* There is also the risk of 
fraud and theft as virtual accounts can be “hacked” into. some virtual currencies can 
also be used for money laundering and criminal activities. it is important that anyone 
wishing to use a virtual currency familiarises themselves with the risks linked to this 
particular virtual currency. 


They then present a table with market caps of several cryptocurrencies, which are obviously relatively low.

In order to be able to respond, we first need to know a few things. Among those things is their definition of "currency", or even "real currency", since there are [a few definitions of currency] ( I find [Investopedia's definition of currency]( better.
If we take a loot at [Michigan's Consumer Alert]( we will be able to know more.  
  


(At least they [now think it's a medium of exchange](  


This is basically their definition of a "real currency" i.e. legal tender ([Dictionary]( and [Investopedia]( that needs to be issued or backed by any central bank or gov.
They then proceed with a list of what to consider before using VC:  
* Virtual Currency Can Be Lost or Stolen
Nothing new here, anyone with bitcoins knows (or should know) their wallet should be secure (they however fail to mention that Bitcoin is more like cash and not a bank account).
* The Value is Volatile.
Again, nothing new. But, the AG states the volatility is caused by the fact Bitcoin is not backed by a commodity or central bank. However, while it is true Bitcoin is not backed by such things, the [volatility is clearly caused by the lack of liquidity](
* Tax Implications
This is different from country to country, so I will not go into detail here (other than the fact that the IRS considers Bitcoin a property and will be treated as such by the IRS).
* No Consumer Protections  
There are currently indeed no "regulations in place that protect consumers".  
They also clearly don't understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin:


Having no chargebacks is one of the benefits of Bitcoin.
All in all, the announcement was okay since it didn't completely dismiss Bitcoin (or even mention money laundering, terrorism funding and other FUD):

A line should be drawn between hodlers and spenders. Bitcoin as a protocol (and medium of exchange) remains valuable regardless of the price (at least in my opinion).


"Only if the increase in supply caused by those merchants is greater than the demand (which it currently seems like)." 
There's this problem called the [chicken-and-egg problem]( It can be applied to Bitcoin adoption as well. It's usually something like:




It seems to me that merchants are currently driving adoption, but with some significant lag.

Which is what I am doing (not available for sale yet), without a display, but with a LAN Control Panel and stats online. 
The 'problem' is that it would cost quite a lot:
* Odroid: 70 EUR
* Power supply: 5 EUR
* 64GB uSD-card (high performance): 40 EUR
* Shipping: Depends
The ethernet cable is cheap.
This, **without markup**, would easily cost about 130 EUR (or about 160 USD).
Most people aren't prepared to spend 120 USD on a Trezor to protect their bitcoin, let alone spend well over 160 USD to 'just' running a full node.

First off, from [the Bitcoin Wiki](   


When Bitcoin reaches the point your friend talks about, the price of 1 BTC will be high enough te negate price increases of hardware manufacturers. If they could however influence the markets in such a way that ASIC miners would become too expensive to buy, the price (of bitcoins) would simply go down as difficulty decreases (because there would be less of an incentive to mine), making GPU miners attractive again, which will in turn lead the ASIC manufacturer to decrease to price of their mining hardware as they notice the decrease in demand.

Very simply put: you use an offline machine to generate a pub/priv keypair. The amount of possible keypairs is 2^160 so you don't have to check if it already exists (collusion is virtually impossible given sufficient 'randomness'). You then send any amount of bitcoins to the generated address. Only you will ever know the private key if you keep it offline, thus making it impossible to lose the bitcoins through e.g. being hacked, phished, ...

"Bitcoins" doesn't exist, since that would imply there'd be several "Bitcoin", the protocol (sure, there are several altcoins). Only "bitcoins" exist, when talking about the currency.
Regarding the early adopters aspect, there's something called the [technology adoption lifecycle](


The curve is [displayed as follows](
* 2.5% innovators;
* 13.5% early adopters;
* 34% early majority;
* 34% late majority;
* 16% laggards.
The difficulty here is the definition of the total amount of adopters in order to estimate which stage we're in:
* Will the total amount of adopters be everyone old enough to perform a transaction willingly?
* Will the total amount of adopters be everyone on the internet?
* ... 
I think this will only be possible to do in hindsight or when adoption has reached n=all.

Changetip works with [off-chain transactions]( since Bitcoin is simply not really suited for micro-payments because of the suggested $0,06 fee.  
Changetip essentially creates a balance for you that is 'made up', in the sense that you will only really handle 'real' bitcoins (on-chain transactions) when you deposit or cash out.   
When tipping, you lose the amount tipped and it is forwared to the Changetip balance of the tippee. Only when that person decides to withdraw, an on-chain transaction between Changetip and that person finds place. In other words, you will never send bitcoins directly to the tippee.

The [ECB]( and [FED]( main goal is providing price stability, which they say they achieve by having near 2% inflation in the medium-term (the definition of inflation here is the definition of price inflation i.e. the continuous rise of prices over a certain period of time. Monetary inflation was the original definition of inflation, which meant that money supply was increasing by e.g. printing money or open market operations). 
So why 2%? The FED and ECB say that 2% is the best target for providing price stability (as stated in other words above). Here's some reasons for (2%) inflation:
1. To prevent the currency from going into deflation (the opposite of inflation). A state of deflation would be highly unfavourable, since people would know that tomorrow, their currency would be worth more and they could buy more. However, this would slow down consumer spending, resulting in a lower demand, which in turn would lead to lower production and therefore wages (or the [deflationary spiral](
2. Inflation stimulates consumers to purchase today, rather than tomorrow, since they know their money would be worth less the next day.

A lot of things can be interpreted as [communication](


For instance:
* M-Pesa SMS payments;
* Stock trading;
* SEPA payments.
No "check or stack of 100 dollar bills" (or euros in the case of SEPA) have been touched.
Just because it can be considered communication, doesn't mean it doesn't have to (or even can't) be regulated because of free speech.
Regulation in the form of BitLicence is, however, not needed. "Good" (read: reasonable) regulation (although I have no idea what it'd look like) that doesn't halt innovation or adoption is needed for mass adoption (if that's what we want), on both the consumer side and merchant side.

* [6 seemingly experienced members of the executive team]( that are probably paid full-time(?):  
("He went on to found Patagon which was sold to Banco Santander for $750m");  
("He worked as CTO of Bling Nation and Lemon Wallet, which were acquired in 2013 for $50m.");   
("She served as General Counsel of Postini, negotiating its sale to Google for $643m.");  
("Ted Rogers, most recently as a co-founder at Arpex Capital, a leading Brazilian VC.");  
("He most recently spent seven years with Cisco, two at Internet Security Systems, and has served as the head of information security in banking and technology ventures");  
("Karsten founded and served as CEO and CCO of Bit CM, a platform that enables Bitcoin traders and investors to discover trading opportunities in real time.").
* Based in Palo Alto, so I assume they have offices IRL. HQ in HK as well;

* (List is obviously incomplete.)
Maybe the $40M is just a form of marketing, keeping it safe somewhere so to speak, and only using a part of it (which I highly doubt, or rather, I'd be amazed if it were indeed true).

* **Cost**. Virtual currencies can cost consumers 
much more to use than credit cards or even 
regular cash.
Everything **can** cost more than something else. Also, convenience, security, (pseudo-)anonymity, control over own money, ... is worth the possible additional cost.
* **Hackers**. Virtual currencies are targets for highly 
sophisticated hackers, who have been able to 
breach advanced security systems. 
What about fiat systems?
* **Fewer protections**. If you trust someone else to 
hold your virtual currencies and something goes 
wrong, that company may not offer you the kind 
of help you expect from a bank or debit or credit 
card provider.
No one should ever trust anyone with their privkeys (significant amount of bitcoins at least).

but unlike ATMs that you may associate with your

transaction fees as high as 7% and exchange rates 
$50 over rates you could get elsewhere.
How do they think real ATMs are operated/maintained?
*  In 2014, the one-day price drop has 
been as big as 80%.

So? Bitcoin was never meant to be fully anonymous.
* Persistent, motivated people will likely be able to 
link your transactions to, among other things, your

your computer’s IP address. **So it is possible that 
others will be able to estimate both how much 
Bitcoin you own and where you are.**
As far as I'm aware, this is not possible through the blockchain alone (anyone care to comment?).

Not if you know what you're doing.
* If you lose your private keys, you’ve lost your funds forever.  
It's up to you to avoid this.

You cannot. The security of the blockchain comes from the financial incentive to securing it (i.e. mining).

In order to prevent [fractional reserve banking]( (which is what Mt.Gox did to eventually fall), does Bitcoin need a protocol of sorts (either a new one, or built upon the existing protocol) where an exchange can prove (or where the user can 'audit' at any given moment) they have ~100% of the deposits (either in cold or hot storage)? 
Is this continuous "proof of reserve" plausible or even technically possible? [According to Kraken]( it is.

First off, a price should be seen as an agreement between two parties, the buyer and the seller:




Secondly, every and any exchange should be seen as a market on its own, essentially being subsets of the entire bitcoin market. So the price is not determined solely by the exchanges, it is determined by the people buying and selling. For this reason, [Bitcoinwisdom.com lists several different prices]( **Localbitcoins.com is a market as well**.


The price will fall, since an increase in supply leads to a decrease in price ([ceteris paribus]( 
So to answer your question, those kind of transactions do influence the price.

That utility is still subjective, at least in my opinion. The reliability/security of the blockchain stems from the mining, which is incentivised by awarding bitcoins for the successful mining of a block. If no one cares anymore about the unit bitcoin, why would anyone care anymore about the decentralisation like you put it?

Just thinking out loud here, but if this trend continues, more and more miners will have to shut off their rigs if they don't wish to continue operating at a loss, resulting in lesser relative security (i.e. less hashing power), which is, to me at least, one of the most fundamental aspects of any successful digital currency such as Bitcoin (the robustness to attacks and the absolute certainty that any given transaction is correct).
However, the shutting down of rigs would result in easier-to-acquire bitcoins, resulting in more rigs being turned on again.

The [arbitrarily, hardcoded 1MB block-size limit]( basically means that only 1MB worth of transaction can be 'processed' per block  (roughly every 10 minutes on average). 
This means that, in theory, you can have around 7 transactions per second. In reality, it is less, since not all blocks are completely filled with transactions (a block with 0 tx is not uncommon).
In order for Bitcoin to scale, we would need larger block sizes, smaller transactions or something similar.
Maybe [this thread]( will be more helpful.

This is a Bitcoin fundamental, the predictable and 4-year-changing monetary inflation, which stops at 21 000 000 bitcoins. 
Another fundamental is the ability to reliably tell a transaction is valid, without having to trust a 3rd party.
Another fundamental is the security and robustness of the blockchain. 
Another fundamental is the health/distribution of the full nodes.

Is it really "backed by the cryptography and maths"? Sure, we can be absolutely^TM sure a transaction is valid after a few confirmations, but that is essentially meaningless if no one 'believes in Bitcoin/bitcoin'. 
I always thought any currency (possibly commodity) is backed by the belief it will be as valuable tomorrow as it is today, and the belief that others will accept it as well (and the belief that they believe and so on).
Maybe it is "backed by" I simply don't understand, since I am no native speaker.

There's basically two ways to structure an ETF (three if you combine the two): 
1. **A physical ETF**. The ETF holds the underlying asset (bitcoins, S&amp;P 500 shares, and so on).
2. **A synthetic ETF**. When holding the assets becomes less feasible (think of oil, uranium, gold, and so on), the ETF tries to track the underlying asset by using somewhat complex financial derivatives (usually swaps).
Shortly put, it is not a dumb move in the sense that the SEC denied the other ETF because trading bitcoins involves unregulated, Chinese exchanges.

Companies can use futures to lock in a price now when they expect to buy or sell a commodity/product in the future.

2. The last four bytes are the first four bytes of a double SHA256 hash of the rest of the bytes.

The formula to calculate bits of entropy is:
    log(x^y)/log(2)
Where x = the amount of words to choose from (in the case of Electrum: 2048)  
Where y = the amount of choices (in the case of Electrum: 12)
Fill those values in:
    log(2048^12)/log(2)
The result is `132`.
Keep in mind the `4` bits in any address that serve as a checksum, resulting in `128` bits of entropy.

As I have [stated less bluntly before]( **nothing** is intrinsically valuable. 
The only reason *anything* has value, is because we believe it does, and because we believe other people believe it is valuable. Certain objects are simply *more likely* to be regarded as such, due to a range of properties (i.e. scarcity, fungibility, being able to settle debt with it, among others).
The value of **everything** depends on context and is heavily situational. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 11:20:18
Cash or bartering, both at a considerable premium.

Except leaving on an old computer for weeks at a time, could cost you 'something'. If we assume the average computer consumes between 60 and 300 watts and if we assume electricity costs between  20 and 36 US dollarcents per kWh, we can calculate running a node would cost anywhere between $105.13 to $946.18 **per year**, depending on the energy consumed and where you live.
It is much more sensible to buy a dedicated node in the form of a single-board computer.

Plus, opening up the patents could result in a massive increase in the production of electric cars and, by extension, electric car batteries, which Tesla happens to be make as well.
So if a car manufacturer has to choose between developing in-house batteries (with all the hassle), or being able to chose an almost ready product, I'm guessing they'll choose the latter, especially at first.

Why would they learn something new or change something when the process of learning/changing will likely far outweigh the revenue for months/years to come? And if Bitcoin then becomes mainstream, there will be payment solutions (like there are right now for 'legacy payments') for them to easily catch on. 
Businesses don't want to learn per se. They, like most customers, want to spend their time/money as wise as possible, which is usually on convenient solutions.

The problem with showing a distributed system on a small image like this, is that you're always going to have a higher percentage of nodes that look a lot more important than the other ones. In reality, these larger nodes still exist, but in a smaller proportion.
The main difference between decentralised and distributed, is that in a distributed system, any one node can go offline without seriously affecting (i.e. the affected node can still remain access the data for instance) the connected nodes. This is not possible in a centralised or decentralised system.

My personal case:
When I send money from my GBP bank account to my EUR bank account, I pay:
1. Sending: 10 GBP for any amount under 5000 GBP
2. Sending: A hidden fee in the form of the bank's "own forex quote" (which is 3%)
3. Receiving: 0.021% on the received amount, with a minimum of 10 EUR and a ceiling of 150 EUR
The above usually results in a fee of 5 to 5.5%.
When I use bitcoin, I can do the following:
1. Buy XBT with GBP on Localbitcoins (2.5%)
2. Sell XBT for EUR on Dutch exchange (2%)

Some priceless (see what I did there?) comments:














something of tangible value, for what you are buying . thats why all currency in notes or bonds it tied to a tangible asset. even if the asset is of lessor value than the currency. like the usa dollar vs. the gold reserve. in the case of the usa, a note is tied to the gold reserve and the goa calculated usa worth. buying anything in thenusa with a bit coin violates the federal currency laws. the bit coin value is not tied to anything of tangible value. it is pure speculation. now you can buy with currency speculation items. but you can not buy them with another speculation item such as bit coin. i am shocked the usa has not yet outlawed this fake currency. since it violates ll currency laws, and using it to complete any purchase contract actually violates the exchange laws. no contract would be valid using it.

@_date: 2015-03-24 21:05:47
And to yourself, really. Contributing to the network by running a node ensures the integrity of your own holdings (however small that contribution may be).
@_date: 2015-03-29 14:51:07
As a 'node operator' myself, there are a few reasons I can think of immediately:
 Technical knowledge limitations:
Not everyone is capable (or willing to learn) to run a full node (i.e. port-forwarding, setting up a spare machine to run 24/7, ...).
 Bystander apathy:
Better known as: "someone else will do it". This, along with the nature of an online community, will lead people into believing someone else will do it in their stead.
 Resource limitations:
One of my nodes has been continuously online for almost 20 weeks now and has transmitted/received almost 1 terabyte of data. I presume the average Bitcoiner doesn't have or isn't willing to sacrifice that much of data (also, running a full node on your home connection could affect the network's performance - I have seen people complaining about Bitcoin Core during peak hours).
 Initial sync of the blockchain:
Before version 0.10, synchronising the Blockchain all the way back to the genesis block, could take up to several weeks.
 General ignorance towards full nodes:
Just a few days ago, I saw a post from someone stating they had known about Bitcoin for about 2 years, yet had never heard of a full node.

I have a 160/10 connection, and it uses about 170GB per month. The Upload (10 Mbps) aspect is the most important, since you'll be sending data to more than 8 peers.
You could try running it for a week and check the results (after being fully synced and having more than 8 connections). If you dislike the bandwidth usage, you could calculate the average amount of nodes. You then divide the GB consumed by that average, to get an estimate of the 'usage per peer'.
Let's say you have consumed 100 GB of data with an average of 65 nodes over the same period (a month in our example). That's about 1.53 GB per node. Let's say you only want to consume 40 GB of data per month. Simply divide 40 GB by 1.53 GB, and you get a bit over 26 connections. Simply do `bitcoind -maxconnections=26` when launching bitcoind, and you should be fine (alternatively, you could multiply 65 and 40% to get 26 as well).

A 'cheap' computer (probably well over 150 USD) would use a lot of electricity if being kept on 24/7. It would quickly degrade as well. And it's bulky as fuck.
A single-board computer, on the other hand, is tiny (think iPhone size), consumes very little energy, and makes no sound.

Meh, legacy banking would include exchanging ones and zeros as well. 
I hear this argument all too often ("It's just information"). Yeah, a lot is "just information" on the Internet, which doesn't automatically mean no regulation should be in place. Do understand I am against the excessive and intrusive KYC/AML regulations, especially when dealing with Bitcoin. I'm just saying that it's not simply "exchanging ones and zeros". People's savings/quality of life sometimes depends on "exchanging ones and zeros".

While it is sometimes true scarcity invokes value, the only thing that gives anything value is the **perception** it is valuable, and the belief that other people (at the very least one person) will find it valuable as well, and the belief that other people will trade their items at a certain price for your item(s).

If cash as we know it right now is ever banned (and currently it looks like that's what's going to happen), history will simply repeat itself by following what happens when something desired is banned by any authority: a black market is created and/or replacements are found.
The war on cash could end up like the war on drugs. 
Good luck fighting against something that most people almost inherently desire (even if they're currently unaware of this desire): (financial) privacy.

I think most people here aren't technical enough to understand the implications of an increased maximum block size.

I've already created something very similar to this over a year ago, as well as looking to sell it like you do now. Everything was in place (local control panel, stats on website, updatable ...), except for the selling itself (which I didn't go through with in the end).
I'm not trying to discourage you by any means, I'm just saying that the hardware will almost certainly become obsolete (even if block size isn't raised), so a retail price of $250 might be slightly over the top.

While obviously each extra node is great for the network, it doesn't really improve decentralisation (on the contrary).
What if DigitalOcean, Linode, ... decided to block Bitcoin traffic (for whichever reason), have a "No Bitcoin full nodes allowed" in their ToS, or just experience some downtime?
If we look at the [latest Bitnodes snapshot]( (I recommend installing [JSONView]( or something similar), we see 150 occurrences of `amazonaws`, 134 occurrences of `Digital Ocean, Inc.`, 274 occurrences of `Hetzner Online AG`, 93 occurrences of `*linode*`, a few occurrences of `*vps*`,  and so on, while taking into account some other of these VPS services don't show anything of the like in their WHOIS information, we see that the full nodes aren't really as decentralised as one may think.
What I'm aiming at is that we should promote the usage of 'private' nodes (e.g. at home). The biggest entry barrier here is the lacking quality of the internet connection of the average home, but I expect this to improve in the near future.

I understand where you're coming from, but I really believe the main reason something is valuable, is because we believe it is valuable and other people will find it valuable as well (both now, and in the (near?) future). In reality, it is probably a combination of perception and scarcity ([among other factors]( anyway. 
I believe the [subjective theory of value]( explains this rather well.

No problem. I meant that Bitcoin *as is* will not function in a 'debt-based economy'. It's truly unfortunate most 'mainstream' economists or 'experts' view it that way, as a supposed alternative for fiat (without the two being able to coexist).

People want increasing Bitcoin decentralisation while at the same time wanting only one cryptocurrency, or economic incentives at work. It's as interesting as it is hilarious.
I, for one, encourage competition (i.e. alternative crypto or within Bitcoin), as it usually results in an improved landscape. If that means that Bitcoin fails (my main 'investment'), I don't really care, as the remaining currencies are probably better. It is hard for people to seperate their self-interest and that which is good for the entire landscape.
