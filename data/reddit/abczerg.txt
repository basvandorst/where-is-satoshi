He has 1.5 million youtube subscribers, 273k twitter followers and his weekly podcasts gets 150k-500k views per episode. eSports is his hobby, so he likes to talk about it on his twitter and he promotes his Starcraft 2 stuff on the end of each podcast.
TB has a much wider reach than almost anyone you can find that is purely in the eSports scene.

seems like you don't need a green checkmark anymore, the same behauvior still applies

most of the mid-tier players earn their income from streaming or coaching, plus the team salary or direct sponsorship/advertisment deals for some is quite high.

It's not a tournament, I don't know why the title says it otherwise. It's a showmatch between the two best non-Korean players. (Koreans are the by far, far best Starcraft players. The average top 16 of a tournament consists of ~2 non-Koreans and ~14 Koreans). After the retirement of Stephano a couple of months ago, Scarlett and Naniwa are the new 'foreign hopes' (the word "foreigner" is equal to "non-Korean" in the Starcraft scene). They will play a bo7 (the first who wins 4 maps is the winner).

where to you get your informations from? from 3 years ago? What you say is not true anymore. Koreans have the highest skill, but the viewership is in the west and on twitch, and foreigners do compete in every tournament, they just don't get as far as the koreans.

if there is a foreigner in the final of a major tournament it can get up to 130k+ viewers. If it's 2 koreans, it can go as low as 60k+ viewers. Watching foreigners is much more entertaining for the majority.

no. It depends in which country/jurisdiction he lives. But obviously no one cares about such a small amount of money being destroyed.

yeah, if your have a lower bandwith than roughly 500kB/s, you can't watch source. But if you have a good enough bandwith for the resolution you chose and it still lags, press the pause/play button until it works... some connections to twitch servers are just bad, so you have to reload it until you get a good connection.

Catz is definitively, 100%, without a doubt, not the foreign hope. Just like TLO isn't. And Huk isn't. And Snute isn't.
At this point in time, it's Scarlett or Naniwa, no one else comes close.
