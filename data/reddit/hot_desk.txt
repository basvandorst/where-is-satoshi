Thanks very much for the informative article.  The cryptocurrency rabbit hole is never ending.  
Hopefully the proposed solutions outlined there (segwit, lightning, Schnorr transactions, etc.) can eventually address these backlog issues.

This is such a useful article for people relatively new to the technology.  Thank you for posting it.

I decided to use the "low" fee, but had no idea "low" could potentially mean a week.  
It's a good lesson for me and provides a real life example of the block size debate that I can relate to.

That link is really helpful.  It looks like the answer is two weeks (barring a rebroadcast of the transaction):
"The transaction expired by timeout (by default 14 days after entering)."

Thank you for the thoughtful reply.  Earlier in the conversation I was pointed to [this]( which appears to point to a 14 day timeout period.
Can you indicate where you saw the 3 week eviction indication?

Great question.  Referencing a medium link that appears above, it looks like 12% of transactions are currently SegWit.  As an earlier poster alluded to, Coinbase needs to step up and implement SegWit.

There are so many instances where the user interface could be improved.  I hope there are some enterprising entrepreneurs out there working on solutions.  When this protocol is as easy to use as online banking or e-mail then we'll see the masses come.

Thanks very much for your quick response.  What is the criteria that must be met for an unconfirmed transaction to be released back to the originating wallet?  Is it based on the amount of time that it has been in the mempool?  I've been searching around and it's tough to find a clear answer.

Thanks for the terminology correction.  I have seen some explanations around the "double spend and increase the fee" approach, but I'm hesitant to go down that route yet.  I may revert to that eventually...

I've attempted to transfer BTC from my Trezor to an exchange at a low fee.  Is it possible that I've set the fee so low that the transaction will never be confirmed?  Does that transaction just stay "inbetween wallets" forever?  If not, how long until it is released back to the originating wallet?
