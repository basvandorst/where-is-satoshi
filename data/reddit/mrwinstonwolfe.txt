You obviously have a soft spot for idiots who need Reddit’s help for gaining sex partners. I’m sure you need help in that department too. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:42:40
Sounds like a scam dude...
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:01:24
Yeah $100 of bitcoins cost you $120 after a lenders fee (15%), a paypal fee (3.5%) and some other processing fee (1.5%)!!  The only reason I ever used xcoins was because I could buy BTC with my EDD card ! LOL �� 
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:12:01
Joe seems like an alright guy.... now the real question is... does he take credit cards? Or should I just give him my bank account number?
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:56:38
Also, I forgot to mention, paxful has protection for buyer and seller. They have an escrow type thing where you can’t be cheated 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:54:54
What do you mean name drop??.., like on the site?
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:40:47
That’s not great... but it’s not terrible either... considering some people “wash” their coins by BTC &gt; XMR &gt; BTC... doing it this way really racks up the fees... but I’ve seen it done before. 
So by paying a $6 fee on $100 to buy BTC anonymously (other than cctv footage) isn’t that bad...
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:10:05
Still fake. Nice bug tho ��
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:37:30
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:28:36
Well yes but you can clean bitcoin and use it on DNM’s. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:41:01
Honestly dude, I would just purchase on paxful. You can do a transaction by western union or MoneyGram which is incredibly easy and actually pretty fast. For $100 you get $92 or so.... so there’s a 8% mark up... not terrible 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:41:53
Because you wouldn’t keep thousands of dollars in your real life wallet in your back pocket would you? Same concept here. Web wallets and exchanges are more vulnerable to hacking, malware, etc. The good move is to invest in a hardware wallet. Here  are some examples of software wallets and hardware wallets: electrum, trezor, ledger, etc. The best is also a paper wallet or cold storage.  This is an “offline” way of storing your bitcoin... Hell, even blockchain.info is better than the exchanges
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:03:21
 AVOID XCOINS AT ALL COSTS!!!! THEY CHARGE AN ISANE AMOUNT OF FEES! THEY CHARGE A 15% LENDERS FEE!!!**
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:57:06
Haha yeah you’re probably right... that’s why you wash them coins baby! Or send them to another wallet after washing like electrum on TAILS first... or ya know, probably the smartest thing to do would be to use evercoin to convert BTC -&gt; Monero 
Edit: Evercoin has recently reduced their fees **Big Time**!
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:18:10
20¢ on the dollar?
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:33:51
Well at $6 bucks for every $100 I’ll give the machine some love. Hell coinbase is charging you $3, why not a few more and you can remain anonymous on top of it. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:02:56
That was sarcasm....
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:55:27

You don’t have data... but you’re buying bitcoin in person.... hahahaha god damn is it Opposite Day/dumbass day on reddit today? Jesus Christ.... bunch of comedy gold today so far
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:52:52
Or my personal favorite, buy bitcoin, then use evercoin to turn dat shit into Monero baaabbyyh!!! Or you could just buy Monero out right on kraken!

You’re screwed. No way to get it back. Someone obviously had your wallet info
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:45:34
Haha �� yeah I forgot karma is a show of character... haha a fictional “kuddo” you get on a social media platform by people upvoting or downvoting your comment..... �������� haha oh how will I go on knowing that I don’t have as much *karma* as you! Hahaha 
Hahaha 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:53:49
Lol �� But in all seriousness, how would they know? Do they track transactions to see if they make their way to the DNM’s?
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:58:28

Yes. Wack
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:37:20
Oh ok because I was gonna say 20% is fucking INSANE!!! Haha
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:13:29
 Coinmama or xcoins if you don’t mind paying a $20 fee (xcoins)
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:51:41
Holy shit! Damn haha don’t mean to laugh but shit.... how long ago was that? Have fees subsided at all?
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:26:10
Haha dude chill out. Listen I don’t know if you’re new to the internet or what, but no one gives two shits about your “success”. The internet doesn’t like boasters and you’ll most likely be ripped to shreds for trying to flex on people. Like I said, no one cares about you “proving” your trading success. I was joking about being fake. I was obviously trolling but then you came back with this “check out how cool I am” thing. 
It would be different if your YouTube channel was giving pointers to people or helping them out... but your page is literally you posting videos which such titles as: my trading in crypto currencies. My crypto this ... *MY MY MY MY*... it’s not about helping people, it’s just a page dedicated to your ego. 
Edit: what do I know. I’m obviously just a drug addict tho.... ��������
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:42:21
I mean best way to privacy is using XMR that you can easily buy on kraken.... but hey, to each their own ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:55:03
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:05:45
Dude... do you not understand what I said? No one really cares about your success... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:51:43
Yeah dude that’s a fuckin rip off... oh well there’s always paxful, then use the  western union option! Now that’s anonymous baby!!!
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:14:35
Why is there so much dick talk surrounding bitcoin?
