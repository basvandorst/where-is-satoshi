100+ confirmations here, btc still not credited. Unacceptable.

Jon Matonis is one. He vouched for Wright all the way to the end, he and Gavin was the reason Wrights absurd claims got any traction whatsoever. 
Here is Matonis on twitter two days ago: 
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:18:30
Yeah, super interesting. Reminds me of how BU supporters deflect all obvious concerns and issues with incoherent attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:13:44
So glad to have brains like Peter Todd on our side. Come to think of it, are there any brains at all on the BU side?
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:29:13
It seems to me like Core has overwhelming majority in the following camps
- Developers
- Companies
- Software projects
- Credible and influential people in the space
While BU's only major support lies in the mining space, more specifically chinese miners.
It would be very helpful to make this kind of information more visible and easy to access, like a website or an infographic.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:04:17
That would be true if all miners want bitcoin to suceed. I'm afraid that's not the case...
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:07:26
Nice catch, coin.dance are positioning themselves as the goto place for ecosystem information, so seeing them seemingly manipulate data in favor of BU is unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:34:14
People in genereal are sadly lacking in both ability and willingness to think for themselves. Still hope you are right that truth will prevail due to the blinding incompetence BU is showing in most matters.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:14:42
A chart that omits a big dip is in no way natural. If their charting method is somehow that messed up, they need to change it. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:16:50
The chart shows amount of nodes. A sharp drop in node count is negative. BU's node count dropped like a rock two times, when their buggy code allowed them to be taken down. Omitting this is in favor of BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:43:13
Do you even know what a ponzi scheme is? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:14:34
This is not the last attack we will see, and far from the biggest. I still think bitcoin will prevail. It grows stronger every minute.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:42:24
Mining the alt coin is not the attack. Switching parts of their hashrate back to the core chain to attack it maliciously after the hard fork is the attack.
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:10:34
What are you even trying to say? Segwit is defacto block size increase. Is it negative that it also fixes malleability and enables awesome second layer tech?
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:12:32
I find some comfort in you saying that BU will probably join them in time. Can you tell us more of how you see this playing out and why you are optimistic bitcoin will prevail? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:35:36
Perfect venue for BU
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:17:36
If it wasn't for Ver's efforts we would have segwit activated by now, bitcoin would be seriously mooning and altcoins would be an insignificant parenthesis in the space. So yeah, pretty mad at Ver.
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:12:27
I have always chosen high fee option, therefore I have ALWAYS been included in the first block. So yeah, network is rather usable.
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:52:05
How much longer should you be allowed to troll this subreddit?
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:25:26
Bitfury mined block 439491, why are they not signalling segwit in their versionbit?? They have clearly stated they are behind it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:04:57
Isn't all kinds of insight into the current attack valuable in regards to hardening bitcoin and preventing future attacks? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:06:53
This post is broken
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:02:17
Do you have any insights into what Garziks motivation for his despicable behaviour could be?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:14:13
Thanks for explaining. Focusing efforts on being strong against a byzantine attacker sounds like better invested energy than speculating on motivations. Thanks for all you do for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:59:18
Lol @ bitcoin.com having more weight than kraken and bitstamp
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:18:02
Don't think too many people are in denial, mostly just paid shills trying to fight the tide.
@_date: 2017-04-27 08:12:41
Thanks captain obvious. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:16:26
GTFO miserable troll

This is why you cannot have nice things
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:46:26
SW is not a problem, it is an essential part of bitcoin's future. Extension blocks is a problem. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:39:16
I am genuinely curious how you came to that conclusion?
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:05:44
When demand outpaces supply, price rises. This is most basic truth of any market.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:03:11
The insanity of calling out blatant lies from a company right after they get funding from the mining cartel that is already blocking segwit?? I am so fucking tired of obviously compromised lying bastards in this community, and by making comments like you just did it seems like you are one of them.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:33:06
Definitely being shady, was very relieved when I finally got all my funds out of there. Verification process seems stuck (I have been waiting 2 months for my level 3 verification to be approved), no reply from support. I understand that they are swamped with users at the moment, but I would personally not dream of having any significant amount of funds there at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:25:23
Your inability to grok that segwit increases block size, thus immediately reducing the fees, makes it apparent that you are either a paid shill or utterly retarded.
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:54:45
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:18:28
I believe you are incompetent if you market buy 1000 bitcoins when slippage is over $700. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:37:49
Withdrew max allowed amount every day for 10 days. The withdrawals have always worked fine, but the limit combined with total lack of communication from support got me quite nervous. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:11:49
As soon as it activates.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:17:47
Second layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:59:15
Wut? The alternative to a fee market is a fee market? Your last comment painted fee market as something horrible that "core devs went on record was needed"? 
You are making good shills look bad with your extremely poor shilling efforts. I might contact Roger and tell him to lower your wages.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:56:57
21 million coin cap. Halving reduced block reward to 12.5 btc. Demand increasing. Scarcity ensues.
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:14:35
What are you saying here? That what Craig Wright did is perfectly cool, and he is to be trusted?
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:45:15
When bitcoin starts to really threaten the existing power structures, chances are high that running a node will be a less than pleasant experience, at least in some parts of the world. The ability to run anonymous nodes is quite essential to a system like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:29:31
Interesting times ahead. Good luck with your decision!
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:34:21
Yes, kinda sad that people are willing to stoop so low. Asicboost money can pay for an army of shills unfortunately. Can't wait for august 1st.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:18:13
I have no doubt that this is just the small beginning of a huge upward trend. We will see $100,000 bitcoin and beyond, only question is how soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:48:37
My friend, what is the alternative to a fee market? A blockchain where every thinkable entry can be written for free? Every coffee, every timestamp from every use case conceivable, every spam entry, every web based microtransaction? There is literaly no limit to what crap would be written on a blockchain with no fee. Terabyte blocks wouldn't come close to cutting it. Nothing would. To believe that increasing block size is a final solution to scaling is incredibly ignorant. Core devs are not against increasing the block size in the future, but majority of scaling will happen second layer.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:09:50
Before june? Before the weekend.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:14:44
Exchanges never offer coins for fixed price. Coins for sale on exchanges are put there by people wanting to sell their coins. You cannot buy a bitcoin that is not being sold by someone. Scarcity of bitcoin presents itself exactly the same way as scarcity in other markets. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:40:22
Broken arguments, broken paragraphing and broken english. What's not to like!
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:50:36
Could be. Or you are forgetting how scarce bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:54:52
Good decision imo, not sure it will ever be a good idea to "sell" though. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:21:02
True. Except the few who actually read the whitepaper and understood how transformative an innovation it was. I didn't learn about it until 2013, been accumulating ever since.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:26:35
A die-hard eth-head "showed his newcomer friend how to make a bitcoin transfer". Sounds legit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:50:20
Yes, the "toxic cunt" that points out that you are shilling ethereum like a madman. While good upstanding citizens like yourself are lying and misrepresenting to pump your own investment. Look yourself in the mirror.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:26:10
We may see a short term correction down, and we may not. Bottom line is that you should buy based on your knowledge and belief in the technology, not based on the charts.
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:22:56
This is too dumb to deserve a comment.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:35:12
This is a  textbook example of what is called fat fingering. Also a good demonstration of the fact that wealth and competence doesn't always walk hand in hand.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:58:36
Why do you call your post "this is the top" if that was the top?
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:07:14
Absolutely no indication that they are running out of bitcoin. Do agree they are shady though.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:54:48
How could this be the top when we are $200 lower than two days ago? Please explain.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:45:12
Why is the alt party over because of poloniex trollbox being disabled?
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:12:10
Cool, I got a mail from support two months ago that they would contact me on skype to get my lvl 3 sorted. Haven't heard a word since, and no reply on my mails. Get these mods on my case asap!
