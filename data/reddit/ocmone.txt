Do you think calling me names and trolling is a great argument?
Are you afraid, that after taking the time to check the math (or have someone do it for you), you'd have to confess that no person outside of the very first BTC team could have come up with this?

This has not much to do with expertise. The way it looks to me only S.N. could have got this result.

Your communication style reveals that you seem too un-educated for actually validating the math behind the post.

Um, wot??

 can you actually disprove him or do you prefer to act intolerant and ignorant?

His point is that using his keys would certainly provoke people to claim the keys were stolen by him. 
And where is this a card trick? Are you a cryptographer?

Ok, my mind doesn't even come close to Satoshi's, but let's take a look at the math and see how good you are. Or is this a sock puppet account with ulterior motives trying to discount or distract people away from this post.
In the equation analysis be sure to include the following.
1. How many alpha-numeric hash combinations are there in sha-256?
2. How many md6-256 alpha-numeric combinations are there?
3. How unique are the hashes presented by hashing  " v0.1 " in both sha-256/md6-256?
4. What are the vectors of conversion between both hashes?
5. How difficult is it to produce a random "five string letter" vanity address?
6. How does this difficulty rise substantially when limited within the scope of only being allowed to manipulate 2 alphanumeric characters within hashing a random word?
7.  How many two alpha-numeric character combination changes are possible within a sha-256/md6-256 hash?
Ok   let me see if you are just another keyboard cowboy speaking about something you know nothing about.
Only two digits relating to non-native hash from the first version of Bitcoin could produce a 5 letter string vanity sequence. The odds are beyond fathomable.
