No offence, but why would you not take the time to read the links? This is obviously important.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:07:57
I might be missing the point but most of your "problems" are all things that can happen with fiat currency in one way or another, it's mot a "Bitcoin problem", but I see what you're saying anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:56:04
Sucks that I'm responding to your large and good post with a tiny thing but, BTC has dropped a lot before, and what'd it do after? Rose right up again, people are just panic selling IMO.
Also: 
No comment really, look where we are now compared to days ago, 20 dollar drop is nothing.

Though you're 100% correct it's a shame people won't spend 10 minutes researching something, they don't have to instantly switch everything to Bitcoin but open-mindedness online is a great thing these days

I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) he's simply pointing out how interestingly similar the two graphs are, despite how different they are (longer time period, gold vs btc, etc) - and, if he is, then the post is completely fine as it's legitimately interesting (to me anyway).
edit: fixed spelling
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:22:52
Nothing is hacked here - correct me if I'm wrong but all that's happening is he's taking the formula for private keys and finding the matching public address to each one - what I don't get is how he's storing it. The data on the site IS legit, I'd love to know how he's doing the site though.
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:13:00
I understand that, but what I'm saying is they're only accepting it because it can relatively easily be transferred into "real" currency. If Bitcoin could only be exchanged into potatos a coffee shop probably wouldn't accept them.
I was replying to him saying "they're not asking for 12 dollar, they're asking for bitcoin." because if 1 Bitcoin could only be exchanged for a potato, they wouldn't accept it, so, they're technically asking for dollar, just accepting an alternative method of obtaining said dollars. (Sorry if that doesn't make sense.)

Theres a £1 fee one in a local town Co-Op which sucks as that's a 2~ minute walk compared to nearest proper/free ATM being like 10-20 minutes away from me :(

I'm sure it *could* be legit but at that price I really doubt it's worth taking the risk

I'm still setting things up and generally trying to make it look better, but now we can keep for the serious discussion and for the less serious posts and images, etc!

Pingdom does straight up "can I load this website and how long does it take me" rather than pinging them (contrary to their name) so unless Pingdom filter cloudflare "shit's down" pages then it'll still say it's up.

This is really great to see, hopefully get some people interested in bitcoin, remember to be polite and friendly, all my friends seem to think bitcoin is a pyramid scheme...
Oh, and yeah, the idea of tipping people on is just great.

@_date: 2013-04-17 19:26:38
I guess, but that was my hope in advertising, so we can sort of clear this sub for the serious stuff and use for the less serious stuff

Nope, the only mod hasn't touched in 4 months and I had the idea for this when people started complaining, so I used RedditRequest to get full mod and I'm trying to revive it, basically.

Pfft, stuck after the first step (getting to the string with a semicolon) I don't think this is for me :( but thanks for doing this anyway, it's really cool to see stuff like this

No wanting to insult your bitcoin-intelligence but they're not stored on Blockchain nor your PC, the private keys that are now in your Blockchain again AND PC grant you access to the same bitcoins, yes. Though my multibit only syncs properly when I do the "reset blockchain" thing.

Sorry why is this in the title or mentioned at all?
Interesting technology and video nonetheless

Hi~ I'm mod and acting sub owner I guess (unless the old one is back), I'd spend way more time maintaining this and moderating it, maybe get some other moderators involved if we ever got some posts. I requested to get control if this sub as at the time it was pretty unused and wanted to divert some of the meme/trollish/less-than-mature stuff away from the main sub, it just never really took off I guess.
If anyone wants to help mod it (not really much to mod but if you have CSS skills and can make it pretty or something) if we actually start to get some more active posts just shoot me a PM and stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:08:32

People can still attack any front ends that point to the internet, I get what your saying but if someone wanted no one to access MtGox it's still doable

I am actually upset I didn't receive one of these messages yet.
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:02:08
Depends what "worth" is to you, none are gonna pay out REALLY nice amounts simply because it's like giving out free money, you can spend a lot of time on faucets and if you only want to play with a little bitcoin for "low cost" things (gambling comes to mind, not that I'd recommend it) then faucets are pretty cool, but otherwise the amount they give you just isn't worth it
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:32:46
These look pretty awesome, keep us updated
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:51:34
But the only reason they're accepting it is because of its apparent worth

@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:23
MtGox could have 50 severs loadbalancing, sure, it'd help lower the effects of the weaker attacks, but like I'm saying, if someone has a lot of money and REALLY wants to take MtGox out, it's still doable no matter how many servers or things-offline you have, there's always going to be online front ends for any web service.

In the future you should browse a little around [Bitmit]( it's got some pretty trusted sellers for a lot of code type things (though I can't name any for xbl codes specifically) but it has a nice escrow feature that's saved my ass once or twice, so yeah, i'd full recommend it if you need a marketplace or googling isn't helping

This **not** a Java exploit.
You ACCEPTED a prompt that TOLD YOU it would run with full permissions to your PC, that then using LEGITIMATE Java code (with ILLEGITIMATE intentions) downloaded and ran a file which installed it's self to your PC and allowed for a remote guy to access your PC, logging your keystrokes and more than likely giving him a file manager too. (Further reading: [RATs](
Sorry for the caps but I need to stress this, you should really turn Java off for the most part, but sorry for your loss anyway.

Yes, Paypal is bad, but whatever way you look at it, Paypal right now the most common way to purchase things online, that's all he's saying.

To be fair, if you have a Fiat wallet that generated some form of secure encryption it's also affected, just Bitcoin is more at danger due to the nature of wallets and keys.

I am mostly talking out of my arse but as far as I know Android is much less secure than people think, especially if people are running around with rooted phones, like others have said I'd definitely blame the phone here as your Ubuntu laptop is pretty unlikely to be the cause of this.
Not all of these exploits would be enough to steal your password but a lot of them are big enough to at least assist in doing so. Of course a lot are also for older versions of Android but I'm mostly pointing out the existence of these and probably unknown ones too, along with any insecurities a badly coded app could bring on a rooted phone...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:15:51
To be fair, it's not even a Java exploit, it's someone using Java legitimately to run bad code~
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:02:52
Can you send me an uncensored image to my PM or something? I would assume this is not legit at first glance but judging by [this reddit thread]( it does seem to be a legitimately user/bot, unless they are using a fake name (quality isn't perfect but make sure the name is exactly "BitTipCoins")
If you want to be super safe I'd ignore it but weighing in everything in that thread I'd say it's legit although they'll be tied to a coinbase account, which I don't know whether that's a good thing or not.

That's really awful, hope it isn't a support guy trying to get back at Mtgox for whatever reason and stealing accounts/generally trying to cause this sort of drama, cause that'd be awful, but the entire support team being this incorrect/fishy would be even worse

The wallet file is safe from both of those, a rootkit is usually a feature of malware to hide it and a keylogger simply logs keystrokes.
The only malware Bitcoin users need to fear is malware ran by people specifically targeting bitcoin, most malware is targeting banks and won't even bother taking your wallet.dat, unless it's specifically targeting bitcoin, you are 99% safe running an up to date anti virus ***as well*** as a software firewall.
Anything to be scared about isn't on any AV database yet and running a software firewall will allow you to block the suspicious connection from "malwarelol.exe" before it gets a chance to connect to the malicious server and so it can't do anything. 
Someone mentioned virtual machines which is also a good idea, we could in therory have someone develop a program to make light weight "sandboxed" wallets, which along with my other advice on the firewall would be pretty damn secure.
If anyone wants a software firewall btw, I'd reccomend [Comodo Firewall]( it's fairly simple to set up.
