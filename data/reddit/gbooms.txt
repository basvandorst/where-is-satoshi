I'm got gold too! :D. I got an email and opened it and it was just like this. Logged in and saw it under my "XAU" card. You can convert it to BTC too if you want!
I see on their trademarks page they have "bitgold" and "bitpalladium" and "bitsilver " trademarked as well. Looks like they plan to offer a whole slew of precious metals. Interesting.

ALL OF THE ISSUES that you guys are discussing have been resolved in POS V2.0 that has been created by BlackCoin, and is now being tested on their Testnet: 
You can continue to ignore POS. But, by the time you decide to get around to it (2016) It will have been too late

If you're a Bitreserve customer then you must know how hard they work to remain transparent and open (Reservechain, Reserveledger). They'll inevitably reveal in detail moreso how it all functions once it releases. Until then focus on the positive which is being able to invest in oil, with Bitcoin. It's a novel and innovative idea and if it catches on common people can invest in oil and save when the summer prices rebound. Bitreserve is just giving the consumer even more option (like with Bitgold). If it's not your cup of tea then just hold Bitcoin (mult-sig pls). No one is forcing you to buy oil.

Does this mean free stuff again?! I still have the free BitGold they gave me!

I like it. But what are the incentives for lenders? Tax breaks? Sponsorships by healthcare providers? How do you monetize?

The whitepaper is two pages long. Just read it.

I think it should depend on the business, and it should be the businesses
responsibility to properly educate their users.

I can imagine them adding cold storage multisig options like Coinbase inevitably.

This is fantastic news!
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:04:49
Yep!

It seems the norm is to protect users deposits from lost/theft due to technical related occurrences, as long as that's covered what else is needed?

Sounds like fraud to me, and a easy way to get your Amazon/Purse account banned lol

Will take a look at the tools after work and see how you all differ. From first glance looks like a lot of hard work was put into these tools. Wish you the best of luck!

They're so..."wishy-washy". I bet they have plans for their own stabilized cloud token backed by their reserve.
