A bit off topic: 
A few years back ASUS was trying to make an external GPU enclosure for laptops and other mobile devices; so you could use any standard PCIe x16 card with your laptops.
I haven't heard anything about it since.

What effect will the release of ASIC devices have on the market price of bitcoins?
I can't help but feel that these ASIC rigs are just going to drive up the barrier of entry for new Miners and not necessarily improve a miner's income later on, if these become widespread and common hardware.

I think I have to agree with this. There are a ton of inconsistencies with BFL's details for their products as well.
If you look at the BFL Single SC and compare it to Avalon's first generation hardware (which has shipped and has confirmed stats and performance): The Single SC measures out to be significantly smaller, at less than 4"x4"x4" in size, but somehow still boasts roughly the same hashrates but at 10% of the power consumption. 
Better manufacturing processes can account for some of the size and power usage reductions, but I don't think that they can account for a 90% reduction in power consumption.
I don't think this adds up at all.

This is pretty crazy considering the difficulty was sitting around 3m to 4m in February.
Most people were saying 40m was a reasonable estimate for how high the difficulty would get by the end of the year, but it seems like it's going to go way past even that.

I love this. I order stuff from DX all of the time :)

This is a pretty important article concerning the new ASICs and how they will affect mining in the near future, even though it's a little old. The discussion is also worth reading through.
ASIC hardware will not make as much as people think they will. Most people are comparing ASIC hashrates to current hashrates to figure their future miner incomes, and this is the wrong way to look at things. Bitcoin mining difficulty is self-adjusting to ensure a constant global mining rate; so if a ton of people with this sick hardware start mining, the difficulty will shoot up to compensate. This means that your income is more about your hashrate compared to the global cumulative hashrate.
The Jalapeno will make ~$50/mo at current exchange rates and 10x the current difficulty, which is BFL's projected future difficulty. This is barely higher than what you're making now with your current hardware, so keep in mind that you're essentially dishing out $150 to acquire a slightly higher mining income. 
A lot of people on their forums are projecting that the difficulty will continue to increase throughout the year, perhaps even up to 30x the current difficulty by the year's end. If this happens, your mining income from the Jalapeno will be less than what your current hardware makes now.
tl;dr: ASIC hardware is not going to make you rich, unless you invest a dungload into them, and it will not pay itself off within the first month for all but the earliest adapters.

I've tried multiple pools and found that slushs pool has the highest BTC payout per day for my hardware

Thanks! Greatly appreciated. :)

yep I'm pretty sick of these too.
