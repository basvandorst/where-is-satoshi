Dominance is currently calculated through marketcap, which is flawed IMO. Marketcap is something that can be easily gamed. Just create a currency with a lot of coins and sell one for 1 dollar. Boom. Marketcap bigger than bitcoin.
But a flourishing altcoin market is generally a good thing. It's just too bad that many of them are experimenting on the wrong things.

I tried looking for those real numbers as well. But didn't find it. For one, because most people make this basic mistake I just mentioned. The only reason I was able to catch it, is because I took an accountancy course. It's the reason I could immediately see the calculation was wrong. 
Furthermore, intuitively, the mechanism behind transactions itself shouldn't require that much energy. Just from that alone, one could surmise the number had to be wrong. The energy required for a transaction would be similar to getting a shock of static electricity (probably even less). Which shouldn't be much.
But since the real calculation is a tad bit more complicated, I gather we need people that are NOT journalists making the calculations. But not sure why we haven't seen those calculations yet.

I prefer bitbox's solution. The weakness of writing down seeds is that mistakes can possibly be made when writing it down. Not to mention that there's a history of paper wallets getting lost. Bitbox saves it to a pdf file on a micro usb, but this pdf file is never exposed to your desktop or laptop machine. 
Not to mention that no noob will ever go the oldschool route of reinstalling an OS. And reinstalling an OS doesn't guarantee protection compared to the past. They found a bug in intel (which was pretty serious from what i heard) and no OS will be perfectly protected from it (not to mention the bug found in electrum). A hardware wallet is a more elegant solution since it has its own hardware.
It's also the closest thing to being an immediate spendable cold storage wallet we have.

The biggest factor is not news IMO. It's the refinement process.
What I mean, is that price will remain stagnant (or even go slightly downwards), until all the weak hands are shaken off. This new price behavior could be seen as a training mechanism for all the new people that got in. Some will fail that training and sell. Others will learn to HODL.

I remember the first time someone came with the energy per transaction market. I even remember the name of the guy who came up with it (not going to mention him). It was wrong then and it's wrong now.
Because it's misleading a person into thinking that an extra transaction would use up 215 kWh of energy. That's not the case. Most of the energy is used for SECURING the network. It's not used for transactions. Thus, even if energy usage is capped at this moment, amount of transaction can still soar many times over. We can do 1000x the transactions and still keep the energy usage the same.
Furthermore, it would actually be detrimental for security if bitcoin mining were too cheap.

Yes, but his calculation is also splendidly wrong. It assumes that there's a direct connection between transactions and energy usage.

Andreas video's right here:
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:11:45
Probably looked at the total transactions and then divided by total energy usage. Which is wrong. You can only divide by the energy usage that is specifically used for those transactions. 99% of the total energy usage (or close to that number) is used for securing the network. NOT for transactions.
So the calculation would more be like " total transactions/(1% of total energy usage)." 
And energy usage is likely even less than 1%.

Repost from another thread:
There will be more coins than just bitcoin. Problem is that many projects still haven't properly learned lesson number one.
I don't like quoting Satoshi very much, but this quote is what his entire paper rests on.
"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."
Other projects solely focus on the consumer end of the spectrum. They don't realize that the good stuff can only work if you have the security to match it. Without security, the ultimate fate of any crypto is to follow the way of Liberty Reserve and e-gold.
Decentralization achieves censorship resistance:

If volatility was that bad, theoretically we shouldn't see bitcoin constantly rising. But it is. I think that suggests that people using that argument should go back to the drawing board.
Furthermore, a population has various risk appetites. Naturally, the ones that are willing to take the risk step in first. But them stepping in, lowers the risk for the next group. And this process repeats until full adoption occurs.

People underestimate how people are motivated by an agenda. Or how money dominates people's thinking. So they often can't recognize when they are being manipulated. Because to think that someone would put so much energy and/or resources into lying to other people, it's unfathomable to regular people.
Bitcoin's constitution and ruleset is the code. There are systems in place to prevent the important rules from being altered. But humans remain the weak link. If any stakeholder is ever compromised (dev, miner, business, etc), it's only a matter of time before the code gets corrupted. The ability to fork protects us somewhat from this scenario, but it's not perfect.
There's a constant struggle to influence the narrative. FUD and concern trolling are the major problems we face in bitcoin. There's no technical defense against it unless we get AI.

Jackson Palmer has the best review on it compared to all the others I've seen. Pamela Morgan also spoke about it here (where I discovered bitbox):
Not being waterproof or fireproof is probably the only security weakness of the bitbox. But can be stored in a ziplock bag as a solution. And I store multiple copies across different houses to protect against fire.
I also like bitbox, because it's inconspicuous. Ledger nano s logo makes it too easily recognizable as a bitcoin tool. Bitbox has no clear logo on it and can be mistaken for a regular usb, which is why I like it. Is easier to smuggle across the border. Micro usb is easier to hide too. Paper wallets are a bit harder to smuggle (if found). No plausible deniability.
But since the intel debacle, I don't recommend reinstalling OS anymore. And it's getting to be a chore to advise anyone to do a clean install (most of them never will, which is going to bite them in the ass). Hardware wallets seem to be the way to scale to the public.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:07:59
Go watch those. Not trying to be mysterious. Check the fees section.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:33:59
No, it does not scale linearly. Which is a fact most articles miss when calculating this.
Andreas made the best analogy here. The energy is used for creating a super high security vault similar to the one you see in the Harry Potter books (I think it's called Gringotts?). But the amount of money and transactions stored in that vault is tiny. It's like we are using a Gringotts vault that has enough space to store ten thousands of moneybags, just to store one bag of money.
In essence, the size of the vault can remain unchanged (including the energy usage), while we fill up the vault to full capacity.
One of the reasons it's done this way, is because bitcoin is designed to withstand an attack of a state actor. Certainly, we don't want energy usage to be too expensive, but what most people don't get is that if it were too cheap, it would be dangerous for security. The high energy costs price out regular hackers from attacking the network. Only the wealthy and the mighty can participate in hacking the network.

1. Internet was blamed for being a den of pornographers and pedophiles as well before it became popular. And the thing is, it was partly true. But it didn't take into account all the other good it brought.
2. FED officials and other central bankers admit that they are in uncharted territory right now. This experiment has a high chance of going south. Never had a period in time when interest rates has gone negative. Since this experiment has a "slight" chance of killing us all, I think this video is appropriate: 
3. The entire point of bitcoin is decentralization. Governments tried to ban the internet too. Wasn't successful exactly because of its decentralized nature.
4. Not compared to gold mining and all the energy required to support the USD. But even then there are other arguments that could be used.
5. Deflation is a symptom, not the cause of a bad outcome. Good outcomes can produce deflation as well (see computer industry). Deflation is only a problem for inflationary currencies with a policy of money printing.

At minimum, gold must first be defeated as a store of value. And that marketcap is 7 trillion. But we will most likely still not be stable enough at that point.

Because crypto has been slandered by the media as risky and for criminals, US banks have been very prone to shutdown transactions towards crypto. And unfortunately, we have to work together with them if we want everyone to switch over from fiat to crypto in the fastest possible manner.

It might help a bit, but kind of doubt it. Upwards momentum might be too strong for futures to tame. It all depends what happens dec 18th. If the shorters get rekt and it becomes a trend, bull army will get stronger each time they get defeated. Making the futures almost useless. Maybe miners will get some benefits, because they have the collateral, but anyone else, I'm kinda doubtful.
I think true stability can only come from a larger marketcap.

Network effects are quite sticky. Not that it's unbeatable, but in order to beat a network effect, you would need something 10x better. Ethereum is the only thing I've seen that might be it, but the thing they are trying to accomplish is so difficult, that failure is highly likely.

They will be sure to attack bitcoin. But keep in mind that one of the reasons bitcoin didn't get stomped on, was because they couldn't. Like bittorrent, bitcoin is decentralized. No owner, company or server to seize like with previous digital currencies.
Undoubtedly, more serious attacks will be incoming. But since bitcoin is opensource, it has the capability to evolve in order to meet those attacks.

Problem is, most people don't have self control. What you say isn't wrong, but the moment you tell them you CAN trade, is also the moment they go BONKERS.
Accumulate a position first. There will be plenty of time to trade afterwards. There's less risk involved too, because you will have the capital to play around.

Money is a confidence game. Something can only be used as a currency if the participants are likely to hold the agreement. The type of people that are prone to do that are NOT the people that only care about fees (or are in it to get rich quick).

The fireworks is 18th dec. Some people may decide to shake out weak hands on the 16th. If you buy then, you might eat a short term loss. But you don't want to buy the 18th, because of possible high fees (network might be hammered due to high demand) and possibly failed transactons.
So you either buy the 17th or 12 hours before the CME futures come out.

r/bitcoin was flooded with trolls. Theymos could only defend against the attack with the banhammer. I also was banned as a result. But I could see the necessity, since it was clear that an attack was underway (up to you if you believe or not).
Most of the trolls fled to r/btc. Mind you, r/btc has honest users with honest concerns. But they didn't realize that they invited poison to their rubreddit and they let it affect their faculties. 
From the outside, the bans looked like plain censhorship. From the inside, it looked like a fight to the death to preserve the subreddit. But Roger Ver interpreted it as censorship (owner of r/btc) and he thought the core devs were in on it. He conflated theymos with the coredevs and then proceeded to attack bitcoin core.
It's been war ever since.

Have you noticed all the problems in the Middle east? The death and destruction? All a symptom of the need to protect the dollar.
Money is serious business. The US is extremely aware of this fact. Which is why they go to such lengths to protect the US dollar.
If bitcoin fulfills its promise, it might be similar to being a reserve currency. If the global financial system is supposed to run on bitcoin, the security of the system will be an absolute necessity. Only proof of work qualifies, for the exact reason that it forces the attacker to require a scarce resource in order to attack the system.

Price was increasing a lot in a very short amount of time. Graph was near vertical. With such a steep climb, profit taking is only to be expected. 
The timing of the profit taking was triggered by BCH. Not sure if they were behind the network attack, but apparently when there's a difficulty change, people start attacking the network (don't know the details about this). This network attack came at the same time that BCH pumped their coin. The way BCH does this (I think) is by investing in bitcoin, benefiting from their rise and then extracts the profit like leeches. And then tries to pump their coin with it. This coincided with the ability to short (which may have been a factor).
Furthermore, before the futures came out, there was a buying frenzy. Someone tried to stop this momentum with constant walls that the buyers needed to eat through. This caused the bull army to be severely weakened when the BCH pump and dump came. The increase in weak hands exacerbated the dip.
But this is an amateur analysis. Take with a grain of salt.

It's never too late to invest for a HODLer. HODLers will make profit if they wait long enough. 
But if your nerves are too weak, I would recommend waiting for a 80% crash or higher. And then buy the dip. Same with Ether and Ltc.
As for other altcoins, any coin that exhibits a gartner hype cycle will do. But please don't fund the scams even if they have such a cycle.
Preferably, buy the alt during despair phase.

Andreas needs to tighten up his energy efficiency video some more. Encountered numerous times that people scoff at it. People that don't know Andreas like we do immediately peg him as a shill.
He should probably avoid using the amortization argument or that mining is the greenest solution compared to the alternatives. He can say it's greener, but not that it's the greenest. I'll leave it up to him how he's going to do it. Just giving the feedback I've encountered.
Keep in mind that this will also probably be the main avenue of attack for the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:25:00
I would wait for a 80-90% crash first. Though it's quite possible that bitcoin might go x2 (or even x3) from here. But trying to sell at the top is risky. The network will be hammered at that time.
If you still plan to buy, watch this to educate yourself in being a HODLer:

Number 3 is flawed. The rest of your points are explained in many video's. Start here:
As for point 3, even if bitcoin was copied exactly and to infinity, the copies would not be acknowledged. They would just be seen as an altcoin. This is a matter of branding. Ask yourself this, what is the value of a website? Websites can be infinitely copied as well, yet why do the copies always fail? Why do people fall back to the original? Once you understand that, you see that this argument is essentially bunk.

I do think the info is probably legit, but Rickards is probably underestimating how dangerous motivated people are.

It can hit 100k, but probably not this hype cycle.
If you are poor, educate yourself first. That's your best bet. Start here:
Focus on learning to become a HODLer first, before trying to trade. Daytrading is a losing game most of the time. Only trade when you have accumulated enough coins. And most of your coins should not be used for trading.

Network is hammered. Caused by an influx of new users. Capacity will be increased after this hype cycle has ended.
This is normal for a relatively young project. Try increasing the fee or time it in such a way when transaction fees are low.

They will claim that they have it solved. IMO, they are only fooling themselves. There are good reasons why proof of work is necessary. Any security scheme that tries to secure a coin without requiring a real world scarce resource is doomed.

Wait for the crash. Buy the dip. HODL. And slowly accumulate more coins to HODL.

Check out  for weaknesses on POS.
Anyways, for a hacker to hack any software scheme, methinks he would either need 2 things. Knowledge and computing power. 
Any software scheme that has been thought up by humans has been defeated by humans. Because the difficulty of the puzzle of a piece of software is not beyond what another person can solve. Which is why people have not managed to create software that's been proven to be unhackable.
A lack of knowledge can be supplemented by having enough computing power. But most of the time, knowledge is the critical factor. 
The beauty of bitcoin is that the security requires a hacker to solely have computing power in order to break the system. The puzzle that needs to be solved is not that difficult and convoluted compared to other systems. Andreas made the best comparison. Sudoku is a puzzle everyone understands. The amount of knowledge required to "understand" this puzzle is relatively minor. But make the puzzle larger and this simple puzzle becomes increasingly energy intensive to solve.
With bitcoin, the hacker barely needs any knowledge, since the puzzle is not that difficult. He needs an overwhelming amount of computing power instead. Which cuts down the pool of potential hackers considerably.
Other schemes that don't require a scarce resource will ultimately suffer the same fate as other pure software solutions. They'll be hacked, because the puzzle created is not beyond what another person can solve.

Which would actually be good for the market if that actually happened. But he doesn't take into account that for a network effect to be beaten, the alternative coin would have to be 10x better for it to have a chance.
Just look at VHS and Betamax. Betamax was technically superior, yet got defeated by the inferior product. This example is famous and it's then that we learned that the better product doesn't necessarily have to win. TCP/IP was also not the technically superior protocol, but it was good enough and marketable enough to take the market by storm.
Peter Schiff never had to compete on a high level, he would be slaughtered in Silicon Valley. They already found out long ago about how sticky a network effect is. 
To beat a network effect, you need one of two things:
1. The main competitor must make a fatal mistake
2. The new product must be 10x better or it wouldn't be noticeable enough to the consumer among the sea of competitors
Bitcoin has made no notable mistakes. And only ethereum may qualify for being a coin that might be 10x better. But the thing ethereum tries to accomplish is so difficult, that there's a high chance that they might explode.

Since there are no contractual obligations, bitcoin wouldn't be destroyed if it were to encounter a limit in finding new believers. The only thing that would happen, is that a peak would be reached and then a massive selloff (might be 80-90%). The question then, is who would buy the dip and what is the psychological profile of the people that do.
The thing that most people don't realize is that money is a confidence game. The paper money in your wallet equally has no intrinsic value. The only thing that's keeping it afloat is confidence that others will uphold the agreement that it has value. That's it. But tomorrow that confidence might be broken. And the government is surely not helping preserving confidence. Every central bank in the world is printing massive amounts of money at the moment, risking a break in confidence. 
Atleast with bitcoin, the number of coins are mathematically set.

Fees will be reduced by economies of scale overtime. Many inventions were rather expensive in their infancy.
Furthermore, volatility has to go down. There's no magic way to tame volatility than through a larger marketcap. Pegging has been tried, but no peg has ever survived throughout history. The marketcap required for bitcoin to be used as a currency would probably be a third or half of global money supply.

I think it's unwise not to heed Andreas's advice. Why do we want to make money? For some people, it's to blow it on drugs and lambo's. For others, it's to be better prepared for the future. Naturally, the latter is more important.
If you really insist on money making, remember that his advice is to help keep you afloat. In the coming (hacker) war, only a truly decentralized system will stand the test of time. Any part connected to bitcoin that is not in itself decentralized by nature and has money stored in that system is in a perilous situation risking his money. And seeing how money seems to be important judging from the reactions here, we would surely hate to lose money, eh?
An ETF is only useful to onboard more people to bitcoin. But as long as they stay within the ETF itself, they are at risk. That's why they should be "stimulated" to go full bitcoin.

Don't transact, unless it's to test the network. Give the devs feedback.
What people don't get is that bitcoin is not a company. It's an open source project. When people started this project, people weren't getting paid. They were using their spare time to work on it. FOR FREE.
There's a reason open source projects emerged. It's because companies are driven by consumers and quarterly reports. Which is why their focus tends to be too narrow. With opensource, there's more freedom and thus more time to work on projects with a longer time horizon. The profit motive and the desire to immediately act on the whims of consumers is usually detrimental to really meaningful work.
But since open source focuses more on the longterm, it's inevitable that they will suck in the beginning. Linux sucked in the beginning. So did android. People were laughing at it. "This joke project will never work, because it sucks compared to Windows and Apple". People can't seem to grasp why they are now trailing behind.

Yes, this is quite an important point. New people don't get that one of the reasons bitcoin got so far, is because the old guard made humongous efforts in explaining it all to us. But all of them went on to do their own things (start companies in the bitcoin space or got chased away by the trolls). 
As long as the newbies don't start doing the same, there will be no profit. Currency is all about trust. Only if you educate and invest time in people can you win the necessary trust for someone to hold bitcoin without selling.

Bitcoin can become successful, even if it's not often traded. See here (top comment):
The currency aspects will only come into play after gold is defeated. And the marketcap needs to stabilize first. Right now, it's more of a commodity. Bitcoin doesn't give dividends, so it can't be called a stock.
There are alot of noobs that don't understand the tech, but want a quick buck. They are the reason that we are overvalued right now. But greed is not necessarily bad. As long as they study the thing they bought.
If any noobs are reading this, learn to become a HODLer and realize there's more to bitcoin than just the price:
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:46
That's only what a noob would say. Any longterm HODLer from pre 2014 would be more realistic about this (atleast, i hope that this would be the case).

Full nodes are a lot safer, since they have access to a full set of rules as well as a copy of the blockchain. As for upgrading, I tend to wait first. Happened plenty of times that devs mess up the upgrade (though it's rare in the bitcoin space). Let the newest version roll out an let other people take the risk. And then upgrade if sufficient time has passed.

Money is a confidence game. Bitcoin can only be successful if the people that participate in the network can trust the other person to hold the agreement. While fees are not unimportant, if a person solely pays attention to the fees, he's unlikely to be a person that will hold the agreement. Thus, whales weed out such people from the network through volatility.

The only reason we survived 08, was because of central bank intervention. And their help only delayed the problem. It did not solve it.
But if you look at the statistics, central bank intervention has almost no effect on GDP anymore. Meaning that they are probably helpless when the next crisis occurs (look up James Rickards for more info). Presumably, only the IMF will have enough money printing powers to save the day.

You miss the point of the question. One day, even 8 decimals may not be enough. But they can expand the supply to include more decimal points through software. This is what the question hinted at.
Pricewise, this shouldn't be a problem. Printing more coins will devalue your coin, but creating more decimal points won't. Because with printing coins, your stake of the coin supply decreases, thus decreasing the value of your coins. But creating more subdivisions does not alter your stake in the total the supply.

It's not about informing anyone about rejection. It's about self protection. No miner can protect you from a doublespend attack if someone inserts themselves between them and you (similar to MITM). Only a node protects from such a scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:11:38
If I were to add what caused the price rise, it's merely part of the gartner hype cycle (look it up). It's a periodic bubble that happens every so often in bitcoin. Price rises x10-x30 or so (or even more) and then crashes 80-90%. Price stays flat for 1.5 years and then starts a new cycle. 
Coders code the software. Investors pump in money if they feel confident enough about the code. They tell their friends and acquaintances. They pile on. Whales periodically take profit while the price is rising. They also use it to trim out weak hands. After enough weak hands have been shaken out, they pile on some more. Media catches on to the rise. Brings in new people. Once enough people get in, a new round of profit taking to shake out weak hands. Consolidation occurs where price is stable. Rinse and repeat. By repeating this process, it creates a foundation for a higher price rise. Noobs think price can go on indefinitely without occasional stable periods or temporary declining prices. But these periods are necessary to gain energy for a new price rise.
Bubble bursts when something breaks in bitcoin. That hasn't happened yet IMO. Bcash was actually beneficial since they allowed consolidation to occur at a moment when too many greedy people got in. Which strengthens the foundation for a new price rise.
Of course, another possibility is that I'm wrong and that we are crashing 80%. Sometimes difficult to tell if we are at bear trap stage or bull trap stage.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:48:49
If there's one argument of his that is particularly annoying that needs to die, it's this one. That bitcoin is not finite, because it can be infinitely copied.
Even if bitcoin was copied exactly and to infinity, the copies would not be acknowledged. They would just be seen as an altcoin. This is a matter of branding. Ask yourself this, what is the value of a website? Websites can be infinitely copied as well, yet why do the copies always fail? Why do people fall back to the original? Once you understand that, you see that this argument is essentially bunk.

If the security is assured for one person, it will naturally be easy to extend it to the network.
My point is that there will come a time when particular high net worth people will be targeted when bitcoin goes mainstream. That hasn't happened yet. But it's obvious that it will.
A single person's security is at its maximum when he is a full node. SPV is inherently unsafe.

No matter how much an honest miner sorts it out for you, if someone is allowed to come in between you and the miner, you are screwed. 
Once you decide to trust a miner, the easiest way to trust someone in between the two, is if the intermediary validates the same rules as the legit miner. Only a node can validate the intermediary.

In a world of inflationary currencies, any deflationary currency will end up functioning as a black hole, absorbing all of the value. Then the rest depends on how well the coin is defended from a security perspective and a community perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:46:34
Value should only be determined by utility. Gold was money, but it has industrial uses as well. But to have the perfect money, you rather that your money not have alternative uses. Because the economics of the alternative uses can influence the money functions. That's why bitcoin is better in this aspect, because it was created to only be money.
Bitcoin's power is not as a currency (yet). It's power is that a transaction cannot be censored. Censored transactions exist only on the outskirts of society. There aren't that many of them (though the censored party would view this otherwise). It's enough for bitcoin to help them in order to have value.
But if you study Peter Thiel and Clayten Christensen's work, you'll realize that if bitcoin manages to get a monopoly on being a store of value and being the go to currency for censored transactions, it will only be a matter of time before it will expand to other markets. Specifically, the currency market.
Bitcoin must first gain market share and monopoly status in its greatest strengths. Once it succeeds in that area, it will have the necessary foundation to go for the currency market.

Dude doesn't take into account that any system that is centralized will not survive the test of time. Criminality takes a backseat where this issue is concerned.

Any centralized system will simply not survive the next war/crisis. Because such systems are easy to target. Only a fool would build his financial system on what is basically quicksand (centralization). Supposedly, the great powers in the world want to make us afraid of what Russia can do.

No problem. If I were to add in one thing, the 1.5 years it stays flat is actually an important time for a crypto project. You can see the hype cycle as a stress test. The devs glean information from this stress test to see where the software needs improvement. The 1.5 years quiet time is actually necessary to work on these improvements and to usher in the new upgrades.
If a project doesn't get this quiet time, you are risking the dev team being overburdened with a constant spam attack on services. Project might explode.

Dunno what it looks like. The US is powerful. They might be able to stop hyperinflation and turn it into a slowburn. But a slowburn is incredibly dangerous as well. Much more insidious. Atleast with hyperinflation, you can easily see where the problem is. But a slowburn high inflation (but not high enough to notice it) can bleed you dry.
It's like having a large wound, but not being able to notice that your losing blood.
Bitcoin is unlikely to be able to save everyone. The boat is too small. It's every man for himself.

Innovation is always bleeding edge. Innovation by definition redefines a new reality, meaning that the rules will always lag behind. While governments stress the need to follow the law, they know that if they do not allow innovation (which often challenges the law), they will die. 
Thus, the most progressive countries will allow innovation grudgingly and create a new rule-set afterwards acknowledging the new paradigm. Innovation leads, the rules come afterwards.

Money is a confidence game. What people don't realize is that confidence can only get stronger if events happen that shake that confidence (but doesn't kill it). In other words, volatility hardens the people in bitcoin to become spartans. 
If money persists, because the holders of that money have unshakable confidence, it's only a matter of time before it spreads to others and expands. Because people are herd creatures. They tend to rely on the judgement of their peers.
There's a catch however. The token itself and the infrastructure around it, must equally be robust. Only then can the confidence game be fully realized.

IMO, that's because of the futures Dec 18th. They are trying to shake out the weak hands. The less weak hands we have when the futures arrive, the more stable a foundation for the next price rise. 
The futures can cause consolidation to come earlier. But they would have happened anyway, even without them. The main difference is that the futures make some people believe that they help bitcoin, which causes to give it an extra boost. But people that are long enough in btc know that btc can do it without any help. The futures are only a boost for people that concern themselves with daily activity.

A desktop wallet to store most of your coins (on a new windows install, apple or linux). Electrum for ease of use, but switch to bitcoin core when a crisis breaks out. Plenty of parties that won't like bitcoin, so they'll exploit any weakness. Default to bitcoin core in such an event. Only drawback is you'll have to download the entire blockchain. 
Mycelium and breadwallet for phone, but don't store lots there. 
As for markets, any coin on shapeshift.io will probably do well. Especially, an alt with a gartner hype cycle. Buy an alt during despair phase. Having a gartner hype cycle however is no guarantee the project will survive. But it's your best bet in the longterm. 
Shapeshift.io is the easiest entrance into the altmarket, so they will probably do the best. Don't daytrade. Employ only a buy strategy. During the days of the Wild West, dominant strategy was obtaining a stake. Selling during such a time only increases your risk of losing marketshare.

Because the central point is THAT important. It has to be obvious by now that SOMEONE in this discussion has to be lying. And the only way you can catch it is by insisting on people stating truths. But they always dodge stating these truths, because then their entire premise falls apart.
I have no problem saying that a 1000 fold increase in 20 years might be beneficial. But before I'm willing to support such a measure, I must know first what the intentions are of the opposite party. If I believe they are good, then I'm all for a blocksize increase. But If I think you are harmful, I will stop any attempt of a blocksize increase. It's as simple as that.
It all starts with truth. Acknowledge the truth, build trust and I will support you. Try to wiggle out of an argument, I will distrust you.

Ah yes. But now that we are talking about it, even if we could infinitely divide the coins, your stake in the total supply wouldn't change. And that determines if you coinvalue goes down or not. So tokenwise, there might be an increase, but stakewise there would be no change.

Bitcoin is the most decentralized coin. Because of that decentralization, it's hard to put in a controversial change, because all the parties compete against each other. You would basically need more than a 90% consensus among participants, which is an even tougher threshold than seen in politics. 
Bitcoin has already demonstrated that a concerted effort of the most powerful participants (alot of miners and bitcoin companies) could not even alter a simple trivial change such as a blocksize increase. It's alot tougher to alter the cap than with the US dollar. Which is kinda the point.
Of course, with altcoins it's indeed trivial to change the cap. But that's because they are not decentralized.

That's not an efficient way to do it. The best way to do it, is accumulate coins and HODL, until they are worth enough. Once you have a sizable amount, you can use a couple to trade. But the majority of your coins should never be traded with. That's just dumb advice. It's already bad enough that most people buy useless shit they will never need. We don't need more consumerism. We need smarter spending.
And it's unnatural as well. People will only spend when they are naturally inclined to. The amount of people that you can convince with reason and that you stimulate to spend in order to increase transaction volume is just too infinitesimal to matter. The only scenario where a large enough of people transact on a sizable enough scale, is the one I outlined above. 
Bitcoin must first become a store of value. And the marketcap must grow in order to reduce volatility. We need a marketcap well passed 7 trillion to have the necessary stability to use bitcoin as a currency.

It's a bubble. But unlike other bubbles, a crash is only temporary. There were bubbles when the locomotive went mainstream too. If the tech is exciting enough, bubbles will be a natural part of its growth.
While I think prices will go much higher, I don't recommend buying. Because the network is under stress. Even if the price goes much higher, a noob will have to make several mistakes first before he realizes when the network has enough capacity to safely sell his btc. If a noob tries to sell his btc at peak stress of the network, he's in for a nasty surprise.

An attacker has different rules from a legit miner (which can be both minority and majority miners). The way miners protect nodes, is through nodes having as close a relationship with the legit miners. But nodes can only ensure a relationship with the correct miners if it validates the same rules as the legit miner.

Keep it. Study this first and understand what you have:
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:04:52
A difference in chains is a difference in the rules. A node can lose by betting on the wrong rules. But this also depends on the user's awareness of the rules. Even if the majority of the market follows a different chain, minor rules can exist for a long time despite such a scenario. But that depends if the minority rules make enough sense to justify its existence.

Bitcoin is open source. They would never be crazy enough to give up their power by making it opensource. Any monopoly would be impossible to maintain. 
But let's suppose that bitcoin really is a special operation. If bitcoin succeeds, any competitor will have a much easier time setting up an alternate currency. And an underdog can still win depending how the users spend their money (either their bitcoin or the new currency).

But I need to remind people here that people shouldn't get confused to what Andreas is saying. Some jokers care so much about money, the only part they hear is that Andreas doesn't want the ETF. Their rat brain immediately translates it to "this guy is preventing me from making money". Conveniently ignoring the rest of his warning.
What Andreas is describing is how you will LOSE money by allowing the ETF full reign (since money seems to be the only language these idiots understand). The ETF will probably be good short term. But it takes no genius to understand that ETF's are a danger to a sustained bull run. I don't need to remind people that while it's possible to make money in a bear market, it's much harder to do so. An ETF is like a windfall given by God. What God had giveth, God can taketh away. An ETF is a security risk and will eventually blow up. Only by stimulating people to go full bitcoin can a sustained bull run be maintained.

From my understanding, decentralized with them means that you control your own funds, so you can't lose them. But the site shutting down would mean you lose the opportunity to trade.

Bitcoin won't destroy fiat. More like fiat self destructs on its own. They've got bigger problems than bitcoin.
As for volatility, it will slow down once bitcoin defeats gold and becomes the new store of value. As the marketcap then continues to increase, we'll get more stability and the currency functions can come into play.
Mind you, even without stability,  bitcoin can still be a currency, if an alternative investment comes along that isn't blatant consumerism. Consumerism is mindless spending on crap most of us don't need. But soon, there will be revolutions in healthcare and AI that make it lucrative enough for bitcoiners to part with their btc. But we'll have to wait till silicon valley or places like them are finally ready to bring their products to market.

* There are alot of noobs that don't understand the tech, but want a quick buck. They are the reason that we are overvalued right now. But greed is not necessarily bad. As long as they study the thing they bought.
If any noobs are reading this, learn to become a HODLer and realize there's more to bitcoin than just the price:

I would wait for an 80% crash first. Even though btc could easily become x2 or x3 at this point.
But if you still plan to buy, learn to become a HODLer:
As for altcoins, I won't recommend a specific one. But any altcoin that exhibits a gartner  hype cycle will do. And preferrably an alt that isn't an outright scam.

I still think the futures only played a minor role. The futures only made a price rise more certain, but the confidence was already there. But we will have to see how the market reacts with the CME futures. Maybe we will see something more dramatic.

What's the harm in stating the simple truth. If you are a champion of truth and you believe in your cause, you will not be afraid in stating truths to further your cause. Because if YOU are truthful, there's no way that acknowledging that video would damage your argument.
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:26:37
First, start with this:
Also, realize that a blockchain is only as useful as a decentralized system. Most blockchains marketed out there have stripped away the decentralization. Because no company would risk putting himself out of business. Which is why a company's "innovation center" researching a blockchain is a sure way for a blockchain to die. 
A blockchain ultimately suffers from the fact that companies are not interested in permanently solving the problem. Because then there would be no reason for the company to exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:32:04
There's enough economic incentive. And if motivation is lacking, they'll soon get motivated. World is not looking so good at the moment. It's only a matter of time before fear sets in to motivate people.

The internet was slow at its inception as well. Open source is often crap at the outset, but ultimately destroys the competition in the end, because they have people working on it (mostly for free) from all over the world.

Opinion in link.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:56:54
Yeah, something like that. We can already see that increasing the blocksize is a dead end. Pursuing that path, you can avoid disgruntled consumers for awhile, only for the situation to explode far worse 10x later.
If you can't avoid consumers getting pissed anyways, you might as well accept that you can't please anyone from the outset and work on the real solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:22:23
* Why not increase the blocksize to increase capacity, like Bitcoin cash wanted?
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:42:10
Bitcoin is opensource. The early coders weren't getting paid in the beginning. Open source is deceptive that it always seems to suck in the beginning but crushes the competition in the end. Why?
Just look at linux and windows. Linux also was rather dubious in the beginning, because it was started by some random guy in a garage. You would think that the professional company with billions behind it shouldn't be beaten by this amateur upstart. But if we look at where we are today, linux has a monopoly on all the important infrastructure (android, backend, etc.). While windows is delegated to regular consumers.
What exactly went wrong? It's because there's a culture divide between companies and open source. The companies have a narrow and short term time horizon, where they focus on immediate pain relief of customer complaints. Ironically, it's the customers themselves that seem to kill the companies on a long term basis. Because pain relief is often putting a bandaid on a problem, where constant intervention is required. This is why they need a customer service division. Companies have an innate dislike of solving a problem permanently. If the company solved the problem permanently, they would be out of a job.
It's because of above company failures that open source came to be. They have a longer time horizon and have more freedom to pursue more permanent solutions. The beginning stages often sucks, because it requires ignoring customer pleas to some extent (in the short term). The immediate solution to their problems always tends to be the wrong one on a long enough timescale.
Ultimately, company software does not scale without making huge sacrifices (loss of privacy, monopoly power, etc). Open source does scale.
TLDR Fees will come down. Open source often sucks in the beginning, but crushes the competition in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:32:33
The devs behind bitcoin also don't assume that bitcoin cannot be broken. Why then are they still working on it and believe in it? Because the risk is mitigated by mining. Proof of work requires the attacker to have a real world resource. He can't hack bitcoin with just extensive knowledge alone (see my other replies in this thread), which is the weakness of most pure software solutions. Bitcoin doesn't rely on just software alone for its security. The attacker requires a resource that exists in meatspace too (energy).
Also, bitcoin operates on the idea of antifragility (see Nassim Taleb). You can hack bitcoin today, but you can't hack it tomorrow. Because it evolves under constant attacks. Antifragility only works if you assume the absolute worst case scenario and learn from your mistakes. But people that do that are often accused of being assholes (see Peter Todd). Most coins aren't antifragile, because they made the wrong trade offs, thinking they can get the good stuff without sacrificing anything.
Take IOTA for example. They claim that they have no fees. Fees in bitcoin is not only for supporting the ecosystem. It's for spam protection as well. The reason we get spam with our emails, is because sending an email is free. If a spammer were to pay for his spamming, he would soon go bankrupt. Similar tradeoffs in other coins have been made, where people only look at the advantages of a trade off, but ignore the disadvantages.

Bitcoin exhibits a gartner hype cycle every so often. We have had multiple. And each time the crash was 80%+. The crashes do get smaller each time, but we have had a large influx of ignorant users only interested in greed. The more we have of those, the deeper the crash will be. The crashes will only get smaller if people educate themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:56
Because of premature optimization. As well as the danger of centralization.

If you've been carefully listening to Andreas's message, I don't think the meaning of what I just said is any mystery. He's the only one that realizes that what's happening in the economy right now goes beyond any single individual. No single person can hope to fight this. It's probably going to be so bad that we'll have to work with people we would normally puke out. Yes, even the supposed scammers.
I reiterate what I just said. It's mistake to think that Andreas does not know what he's doing. I'm not going to elaborate any further.

Yes, I realize that might be the case. But that's the problem with trolls. If you haven't noticed, all the major companies have problems dealing with them. Because the problem is that pernicious. If people could easily differentiate between who was a troll or not, companies like twitter wouldn't have a problem solving this.
The main insight I got from all of this, is that you HAVE to get nasty about this. People have an innate instinct to prevent any disagreements or shouting matches. But until people start insisting on the truth, scammers and trolls will always get away with it. There is no other way to find out. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:34:40
Thank you for your attempt.
From my understanding, they have the tangle, which is different from proof of work. And that the reason they have it, is because they want to do away with mining. Specifically, the energy requirements. But if the tangle does away with requiring energy, it seems to me that the tangle would then be a pure software solution that requires no scarce resource in order to function. 
So the question is, does the tangle require a scarce resource in order to function?

Edit: 
Also, not your keys, not your bitcoin. Never trust a third party (like coinbase or an exchange). Hold your keys yourself. Plenty of times keys got lost that way. Exchange got hacked or the 3rd party runs away with the money. For large amounts of btc, I recommend a hardware wallet. Never use a desktop wallet in such a scenario.

Regarding whether this is a good time or not, I always buy when it has gone sideways for months after it peaked. Of course, it can go down from there (or up), but nobody can say for sure. 
Also, if you ever invest very large amounts, never use a desktop wallet or coinbase. Buy a hardware wallet. Don't be lazy on this point.

But hey, I'm not against bitcoin cash. The projects will probably be beneficial to each other.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:13:34
I think the core devs are aware of that. But you should keep in mind that they are looking farther ahead. In order to beat the establishment, alliances are necessary. You don't want too many, you are right about that, but it's naive to think that the establishment will go down easily if one isn't prepared to act pragmatically.
The reason the coredevs managed to push segwit through, is exactly because they used ltc as a backdoor. This will happen more frequently, because there are alot of people interested in stalling any bitcoin upgrade.

Bitcoin is challenging the most dangerous opponents. The way it's setup, only powerful families or a nationstate may have the resources to attack bitcoin. If the energy usage was too cheap, a common hacker would be able to hack bitcoin. The energy requirement filters the regular hacker out (and more importantly, prices them out), where only the mighty can play. And they WILL eventually come.
The wars in the middle east all have to do with preservation of oil which in turn back the USD. Just think. What makes the USD so important that people are willing to expend such massive resources in its defense?
The money system is taken for granted by the regular people. But people responsible for the security of the world understand the carnage that will occur if it is ever allowed to fail. It is the primary backbone to fund the military. It is for this reason that the US is willing to sacrifice anything in its defense.

We got the wrong crowd filtering the newbie questions. The reason I stayed in bitcoin, is because some old hands went out of their way to share all their knowledge with me. The information they gave was truthful to the point it might scare some of the new people away, but it did inspire confidence.
Now, if you try to post links to educate all the new people, they accuse you of "spamming". 
Just look at this response:
Yeah right. Any attempt to make my own thread that actually educates, never makes it to the top. Because the semi new people that are in this game don't take into account how privileged they were when they first came into the scene, privileged that some people went out of their way to give them the information. So they don't bother to upvote educational posts. They say that nobody is interested, so don't even bother.

Yes, I agree that TA has some value. But you would need to combine it with something else to make the most of it. And even then there would still be a gambling element to it. 
Most daytraders don't bother to evolve their methods. But it's only a matter of time before they are out competed by people that take the information game seriously. TA analysis would cease to work and may even be artificially painted by exactly these high class players in order to fool the normal traders. 
We are really early at this game, so TA analysis may still be of use. But you should keep the above in mind if you plan to do this for a long time.

Bitcoin's operates on the principle that no software scheme is unhackable. Even the NSA couldn't prevent themselves from being hacked.
Which goes back to my point as to why bitcoin is the most secure. Bitcoin coin production is limited by a real world scarce resource. The description you gave for IOTA only leads me to believe that it's a pure software solution. And no pure software solution has ever proven to be unhackable.

No, HODLing increases the value, because it takes coins out of circulation (making them rarer). The market is then fighting to obtain the rest of the coins that are circulated (of which the available supply to the public keeps shrinking because of more HODLers), increasing the prices.
But while HODLing increases prices, the primary meme came into existence, because HODLing protects the investors from themselves:

Also, not your keys, not your bitcoin. Never trust a third party (like coinbase or an exchange). Hold your keys yourself. Plenty of times keys got lost that way. Exchange got hacked or the 3rd party runs away with the money. For large amounts of btc, I recommend a hardware wallet. Never use a desktop wallet in such a scenario.

Many would not choose to stand up. But I would. 
On the offchance that Satoshi is a malicious actor, I already have some kind of idea what would need to be done. But a lot would depend on how you spend your money. If you spend it on frivolous shit, a loss (for the world) is guaranteed. Heck, I would go as far as saying that even if Satoshi is a good actor, prudent spending would be a necessity. Because anything concerning money will not go down pretty.
And prudent spending is NOT buying a doomsday package and a bunker.

Your bitcoins are stored in "the cloud". Specifically, they are registered on a ledger that every node in the network has. This ledger is called "the blockchain". It's the backbone of the network.
To access your btc, you need a private key. This is similar to a password for an email address. Don't carelessly spread this password or your btc might be stolen.

You're saying L1 can scale then? Try addressing this particular point. Because it's Andreas's main point. If we cannot agree on this point, it's pointless to go any further.

The best suggestions where regulation is concerned:
The best quote (and suggestion) from the video on how bitcoin should be treated:
"Senator: My last question then, consider tax returns. What value would be used if we wanted to make a conversion for tax authorities because of course it is required to file a tax return and establish a value? If there is a serious amount of fluctuation, I realize the quantities are high, there are not many tax payers that have huge incomes, let's say the average Canadian, what would be the value .. how would we monitor this declaration of income or revenue?
AA: That is a very interesting question. Regulatory clarity would be very useful. I earn the vast majority of my income directly in Bitcoin. Since October of last year, I have earned very little of national currencies. I pay my expenses in Bitcoin too. For the purposes of taxation, I treat bitcoin as earnings in a foreign currency. I will assess the market value of the transaction when I earn the income at the current market price, and I will render taxes to the tax authority. That is the power of the tax authority, to pick the currency of their choosing. In the case of use of currency, the classification in the tax code depends on the use I have. If I use my brokerage account to purchase euros for investment purposes, and I sell them two months later and realize a gain, I will be subject to capital gains tax upon that gain. However, if I visit Paris, and I use euros to pay for a ticket to the local zoo, and the price of the value of euros changes between the moment I purpose that amount with my currency, and the moment I pay for the ticket, I am not assessed capital gains, and it is treated differently. The tax code is flexible enough to allow me to pay the appropriate tax for the appropriate classification. In the United States, there has been a ruling that says that Bitcoin operates as a commodity with a capital gains tax. However, a currency would have been the wrong answer too. If it is used for a long term investment, it should be subject to capital gains and losses. If it is used as a currency, it should be taxed as such. The tax system allows me to declare upon honor how to pay taxes, and then impose penalties upon me if I make that decision incorrectly."
In short, it should be treated depending on how it's used. I suggest watching the rest for more suggestions.
Edit: 
For businesses, I suggest using btcpay server. Instructions on how to set it up can be found on their twitter.

Actually, the fiat system has bigger problems than bitcoin. Central banks are conducting a massive experiment of money printing, unprecedented throughout history. It most likely won't end well.
A fiat currency's average life cycle is 27 years:
You could argue that the dollar was reborn in 1971. The link with gold was broken. That would make the dollar 46 years old at the moment.
The USD is in danger of losing reserve currency status (lookup James Rickards). The entire reason the US is paranoid about Russia, is because Russia exited the dollar and sold all their bonds.
It's not looking good for fiat. All bitcoin needs to do is survive the turmoil in order to succeed. It doesn't even need to rise in value.

Obligatory watch for anyone wanting larger blocksizes:
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:01:57
Cashing out at the peak is difficult since the network is hammered at that moment. There's a chance your transaction might hang. HODLing is the best option. Or learn to sell when there's a lull in network fees.
If transaction fees are high, there's a good chance your transaction might hang. Or you would have to be willing to increase the fees to increase your success rate.
But in these early stages I don't recommend taking such risks. Learn to HODL first. Once you have accumulated enough bitcoin, you can start playing with it. But the majority of it must not be traded with.

Doubling the blocksize will certainly not help. All you would do is double the amount of "elites" that can access L1. But it would still remain a minority of the public. The increased number of people that could access L1 would still be negligible to the point of being meaningless.
You have to understand why L2 was necessary to begin with. Because L1 couldn't scale. Do you know what scale means? The more scale, the more people you can reach. Acknowledge first that L1 can NEVER scale under the current conditions (barring a new physics breakthrough). Once you conclude that, you would realize that fiddling with the blocksize would barely put a dent into the problem. That's why L2 came to be.
Want cheap fees? Do a layer 2 transaction. But the one enabling the L2 transaction will have to compete for the blockspace on L1 (and would probably have to pay a hefty price for it). Inevitably the strongest would win. If you are not confident in winning that battle, you should give up on obtaining a L1 transaction and simply let the better man take over that task. The better man will do all the work for you. And through him, you'll get the L2 transaction.

Before venturing in alts, it's critical to understand bitcoin first. Once you understand bitcoin, it will become easier to understand the alts.
If btc prices rise, ether and ltc tend to rise as well. The rest of the alts usually only rise, if these 3 coins leak value (not enough ability to absorb all the noobs).
Btc exhibits a gartner hype cycle every so often. We are now in the middle of one. We are likely at the enthusiasm phase, but don't take my word for it, since it's easy to mess this one up:
A gartner hype cycle is a bubble, but unlike other bubbles, a crash is only temporary. The locomotive industry had bubbles during its adoption phase as well. Bubbles are more likely if the tech is exciting enough.

There will be more coins than just bitcoin. Problem is that many projects still haven't properly learned lesson number one.
I don't like quoting Satoshi very much, but this quote is what his entire paper rests on. 
"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."
Other projects solely focus on the consumer end of the spectrum. They don't realize that the good stuff can only work if you have the security to match it. Without security, the ultimate fate of any crypto is to follow the way of Liberty Reserve and e-gold.
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:14:22
More accurate is to ask how is bitcoin defended, because that is what is implied with backing. 
Oil can be backing. An army can be backing. Gold can be backing. Why doesn't gold need backing? Because gold's supply is protected by physics. Its physics prevent hyperinflation. 
What prevents bitcoin being hyper inflated? How strong is that defense? Proof of work. It not only forces people to play by the game theory, it forces an attacker to expend energy. Other schemes can be broken if one studies encryption long enough, but proof of work is a scheme where computing power and the energy it consumes is the larger factor. This is why other schemes fail compared to proof of work. Absent the gold standard, currencies required a combination of a surrogate commodity (like oil) and martial might to defend the currency. Proof of work replaces both of these as a stand in.

Network effects are quite sticky. An alt can win by 2 methods:
1. Bitcoin makes a fatal mistake
2. The alts have features that are 10x better
A network effect is very hard to defeat. IMO, bitcoin has not made any major mistakes. And the alts are not 10x better. Being 2x better won't cut it. See Betamax vs VHS.

The reason we have to suffer through high fees and other shit, is because the devs are usually understaffed. The most efficient way for them on how to decide to go forward, is to see how the system reacts under stress, make an analyses of where the weaknesses are and then work on them. But you can't work on a system that's under stress. You have to do it when it's quiet.
If a dev tries to predict the future on the capacity (or other issues on how the software must scale) and his prediction is wrong, he wasted an enormous amount of time for nothing. That's called premature optimization.
Things would be alot simpler if the devs could look into the future.

But they still help with backing. A currency is made out of confidence. An army helps with having confidence. It's misplaced confidence, that's for sure. Not reliable backing.

If there's any inflation, it will be shortlived. Most people I hear on this subject are of the opinion that slight deflation is the natural state of the economy. I tend to agree. Because new market participants main way of competing against those that came before them is by delivering the same quality for cheaper. 
Better price/quality ratio tends to bankrupt those that stay stagnant. So deflation happens. Especially the tech sector is the driver of deflation. But tech will soon start taking over the other industries. Making it even more pronounced. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:00:20
We have a weapon they don't have. Andreas. Use him. 
But Jayspike also makes a good argument. You can post an Andreas video to force them to tackle his arguments, but it's also important to have enough mastery of the subject to not rely on his video's every time. Because people are slippery. You can only use an Andreas video to its full potential if you know enough about the subject to not allow them to slip away and sidestep his points.
Anyways, most altcoins merely copy bitcoin and then tout that they can scale. This is naive. The only reason they don't have problems, is because they haven't had the influx of users to reveal their scaling issues.
As for proof of stake,  on twitter is the prime expert on its weaknesses. He explains why it can't compare to proof of work. Study his arguments.
As for any scheme that tries to replace proof of work with a pure software solution (perhaps IOTA), this is naive. Bitcoin operates under the assumption that there exists no security scheme that cannot be hacked. Why then do we still trust bitcoin? Because bitcoin embraces antifragility. By embracing mistakes and attacks and being an open system, instead of trying to avoid them like closed systems, we learn much more and thus can evolve in tandem with the attackers. Even if they hack bitcoin today, they won't be able to hack it tomorrow. 
Many projects only see money, but haven't fully internalized the concept of antifragility. Antifragility forces you to assume the absolute worst case scenario and prepare yourself for it. The only person I've seen that fully exhibits this trait is Peter Todd. But many think he's an asshole because of this. Reasoning from the absolute worst case scenario forces people to think (which they don't like). They merely see it as paranoia. And arrogance. They rather preserve their social relations instead of saying uncomfortable security scenario's out loud.
Another reason proof of work is important, is because it forces the attacker to require a real world scarce resource (energy) in order to influence the system. Pure software solutions that don't require the use of a scarce resource are doomed, for the simple fact that a hacker can easily dream up the requirements to get past the system (since software has zero marginal cost), but can't easily dream up extra energy.

Bitcoin mining is mostly in China. China has a surplus of energy that would have been unused were it not for bitcoin. If bitcoin didn't use that energy, it would have been wasted and thrown away. At least now it's being used for an important function.
But even if the above were not the case, bitcoin mining is still electrically cheaper than the alternatives. Gold mining and all the bank infrastructure (buildings, armoured trucks, personnel, wars to protect the dollar, etc) take up way more energy than bitcoin. 
Also, the invention of bitcoin will have major geopolitical implications. People just don't realize the importance of this invention and that its invention will drive governments to attack it with extreme prejudice. Only proof of work has the necessary security to withstand such attacks.

Even if intrinsic value exists, it is only useful to kickstart a market. Most of gold's value that exists today is mostly subjective. Only a fraction of its worth is intrinsic. 
The intrinsic value argument has been a very poor consolation for people that have bought gold in recent years. My own birth country has banked its entire economy on gold, with disastrous results. 
The fact of the matter is, is that gold only has use for people that bought in early. All people that buy in now are essentially fodder, the sacrificial lambs, meant to break the blockade. People are so focused on breaking this blockade, they lose sight of all the lives destroyed in the process.
You do not help poor people, by peddling an asset that has no productive value. Investments in non productive assets is by definition malinvestment (something Austrian economics claims to hate).

That's more an artifact of the current economics. I agree, empire requires armies and a lot of people don't get that armies (and the lust for empire) are probably more detrimental to the currency than a plus. In CURRENT times that is.
But I look at it more from the perspective that future developments will probably minimize the costs of future armies significantly. Even now it's probably possible to fund an army without going into debt. It just wouldn't be an army that could compete at the world stage. Technology will probably change the economics where this is concerned.
Also, there's the belief aspect as well. From the pure math perspective, armies do indeed have a strong devaluing influence on the currency. This is somewhat mitigated by BELIEF. Even if the belief is incorrect, it's still a factor to consider. Remember, currencies are about belief as well.
There's also a practical side to having armies. A devalued currency is only dangerous to the extent that people can call in their debts. While the currency devalues due to the army, you must also take into account that one single strike can turn that all around. An army is mostly passive, but it can be active as well. Depending on how the army is used, it CAN serve as backing. But most empires have always missed the correct timing. Timing is the main problem.

On the one hand, I do sympathise somewhat with Mark. People are born into the world believing that they can add something to the world. It must be mortifying to realize that your existence has not added anything to the world, but is rather a net loss. A bane on the world. A plague. Some people may have committed suicide because of him. One could argue that his existence in this world required the suffering of countless others. Is there even any justification for someone like him to be alive?
Anyways, I sure hope he won't kill himself for this. And while I do  sympathize, I think one must act as if one does not have sympathy. Because he has responsibilities. He did a good job of ignoring those before, but he should not be let off so easily until he fulfills those responsibilities to the best of his ability.

Who said I believed that the universe was 13.7 billion years old? I take science seriously, so I won't dismiss what they say. But I remember reading news papers where they modified that number each time they had a new revelation. Not that that's a bad thing, because that's how science works. But it shows how ridiculous the notion is that absolute truth can be determined. That's why even authorithies should be questioned. If you are good at it, you may become the new authority concerning the subject. But it should never be assumed that the authority knows what he's talking about. The scientists themselves say that they should be questioned. Because that's the way of progress.

The words intrinsic value needs to die. It's a contradiction in terms. You have to call things by its proper name. One of the first things you learn in logic classes, is how important it is to have proper definitions and that the one you are communicating with has the same definitions as you.
Because they cling to the idea of "intrinsic value", the argument has perpetuated to this extent. But they will never give up on the word, because it represents an idea that is too attractive to ditch. It's not logic, but emotion. It essentially puts gold on an unbeatable pedestal and they will never let go of that idea, because the alternative is too uncertain and scary to contemplate. It will take several gold asteroids landing on earth, before they see how "intrinsic value" is a fake idea that has no bearing to reality.
What gold has is a sort of "stubborn" subjective value, but it is still subjective.

No mystery to his meaning. He's simply saying that bitcoin doesn't necessarily has to succeed as a currency in order to be succesful. It could simply function similarly to gold (store of value). 
Keep in mind that gold is not transacted daily like the USD and that its main use seems to be to gather dust in vaults deep under the ground. Yet, despite not being a real currency the marketcap for gold is 7 trillion dollars. Not bad for something that isn't used to transact daily.
IMO, if bitcoin succeeds as a store of value, it will eventually succeed as a currency as well. The main reason gold is not a currency today, is because it has been suppressed as well as the weight making it slightly unsuitable for a modern economy.

SmilingDave got bored, so he decided to pay us a visit. I believe this is the same guy that likes to argue with Peter Surda on mises.org:
I wouldn't immediately dismiss any criticism. I actually like hearing contrarian opinions. Even if the other side has a clear bias and is not entirely objective. While the conclusions may potentially be wrong, the details of their arguments are always useful for trying to determine the truth. 
And this guy is clearly not objective. 
What's actually funny is that these types of people always come out of the woodworks when the price is down. And then the price rises again, so they tend to vanish at that moment. One would think that this would be cause for self reflection and the dangers of trying to draw conclusions too quickly. And since this guy posts on mises, he's probably a goldbug. There have been many occasions where the price of gold was hammered and where naysayers came out of the woodwork saying how gold is obsolete. There is some kind of irony here.

If your economy is based on inflation (like today), deflation does indeed become a problem, but only for that particular currency. During the days of the gold standard, deflation was the norm and there were no real problems with deflation and there was no rampant unemployment. That's because in an inflationary economy, the cause for deflation is different, resulting in unemployment.
Economist who talk about deflation often do not distinguish between good and bad deflation and this is a really bad habit they have, because the CAUSE of deflation is much more important than deflation itself.
Also, you must keep in mind that inflation is good for the state and all people who have large debts. Inflation lightens the debt burden. That's why governments love inflation and tend to exaggerate the effects of the supposed horrors of deflation. Governments tend to fund economists that favor debt and this is also how the debt based philosophy has spread throughout education. 
The economists that champion money printing and going into debt to solve all problems are from the Keynesian school of thinking. Though it must be said that Keynes would have probably been horrified if he had seen how his disciples have perverted his theories, since Keynes himself was against inflation and he himself believed in a balanced budget. That these beliefs dominate most of economic theory of today is not that they had the science to back it up, since economics is not a science.
I would say to study the Austrian school of economics, since it seems that some of their predictions are starting to come to pass. And they deliver compelling arguments why Keynesian theory is flawed at its core.

Good interview. He can explain bitcoin pretty well from the old school perspective (which focuses on the limits of regulation and how people attribute value). Recent arguments focus more on the technology side of things. The technology side is important, but one cannot properly understand bitcoin without understanding that bitcoin is unstoppable from a monetary/value perspective as well. If people understood that, we wouldn't have crap nowadays like "bitcoin the currency won't work, but the blockchain has promise".

Well, some people have tried, but the problem with those efforts is that they don't have the resources as the US government. So the people supporting these currencies are limited in scope and some of these currencies failed because of mismanagement. Some have tried a more advanced route by coding digital currencies, but they suffered from being centralized. Governments came in and shut them down. A decentralized currency however has no single point of failure, so it cannot be shut down, unless you shut down the entire internet.

Holy crap. This presentation was bad. If I were to give a score for this, it would get a full fledged F. Almost the entire presentation just about regulation and the risks, not showing what the value proposition was. Because they spent so much time on risks, the little they spoke about what was so important about bitcoin was incoherent and rushed.
The guy in the middle was simply right, even if he was a bit aggressive in his view. I never took the meme seriously that the bitcoin community was its own enemy, until I saw this presentation. I mean, come on, comparing bitcoin to freaking nukes?! 
I get that risks should be looked at. And it's true, a lot of bitcoin fanatics overlook the potential for money laundering and all of that stuff. This stuff should be seriously considered. But the way they went on about it, is no longer balanced. And this is incredibly ironic, in light of how the lawyer stated that we should have an honest look at bitcoin. Alex and Riddel aren't realizing that they are falling into the same trap as the regulators often fall into. The trap of an oversensitivity to risk which all humans fundamentally suffer from.
The human species by nature is an unbalanced species, with an overemphasis on risk. If our ancestors weren't risk averse and were too overly positive, we would probably be extinct as a species. This is also seen in the price action. Negative news tends to have more of an influence on the price, while positive news is taken for granted and often has little influence (unless there's a constant stream of good news).
But this risk averseness of the human race tends to work against us at times. With every new innovation that came along, the first thing they noticed were the risks and not the benefits. The car was a dangerous, smelly murder machine and would help thieves to get away from law enforcement. Electricity would burn our houses down. The internet was a den of pornographers and thieves (thanks for the examples, Andreas!). Obviously these risks were overstated and paled in comparison to the advantages. By orders of magnitude. Why? Because people are incapable of seeing the pattern of evolutionary growth and are inherently bad at probability and statistics. The idea that something like money laundering is minor today, but would scale together with bitcoin is simply wrong on its face, for the same reason it was wrong to state that the internet is full of thieves and that supporting the internet would thus increase the number of thieves. In reality, technology reflects the values of society. Most of society is good, so that's the reason why the freedom of the internet didn't create a superden of thieves. Or that the car didn't cause an epidemic of bank robberies.
With how Alex and Riddel focused on risks, they did a good job demotivating a lot of people before they even began. Now the audience doesn't even want to start a company. They assumed that the audience already knew the why of bitcoin, just like they did. But the last question makes it blatantly obvious that they didn't even know the why of bitcoin. The regulator (and all normal people) will already fall into the trap of risk averseness. As an innovator, their job is to counteract that risk averseness by explaining the why of bitcoin (and not fall into the same trap as the regulator and regular people). It's not necessary to expend so much time on the risks. If they know the why, there will always be enough time for other events to explain the risks. 
Watch this video 50 times if one of the panelists is reading this comment, because it's apparent that you guys really need to learn how to sell a product:
Does that mean we should ignore the issue of money laundering or the like? No, but even if we couldn't solve the issue of money laundering right away, it wouldn't be a problem. Because bitcoin can scale to unparallelled levels that counteracts the negatives. We already established that something like money landering wouldn't scale. So even if that problem remains, we still have the major benefit of reaching an untapped market of 6 billion people, with the potential of lifting this group out of poverty. The potential benefit to GDP is MORE than just solving friction. If we can duplicate the miracle of Kenya (which gained 40% due to M-Pesa), we could add roughly 10-15% to world GDP in less than a decade (an estimation, discounting the added GDP of less friction). I'm not sure if people realize the magnitude of what adding 15% to world GDP would mean. Or that this initial 15% is but the beginning, because it weakens a bottleneck in the world economy. An economy is about money flowing into a circular manner, where the weakest link dictates the strength of the flow. That weakest link is the 3rd world. What do you think would happen to the world economy and how world GDP is affected if you manage to remove that bottleneck? The difference is simply transformative. Even the first world would be affected by this. Compared to this, the issue of money laundering simply pales in comparison (and it doesn't scale to that extent as well).
If you do not layout this value proposition, there is no reason for them to bother with bitcoin. Do not assume that they know what this value proposition is, even if you do. At this point, talking about the risks without explaining to them the value proposition is the exact OPPOSITE of the video I just posted. A good way to sabotage bitcoin.

Some people here are too defensive concerning the word capitalism. That's why it's a bad idea to subscribe to a particular ideology. It's okay to agree with certain aspects of an ideology, but you must never consider yourself as part of it. Because then you get situations like these where people start nitpicking words imagining points that have not been made, while misinterpreting the larger point. All in the name of ideology.
The guy has NOT been criticising capitalism. This is not the typical argument where people claim that capitalism is broken. He's saying that in pursuing greater efficiency, which is a characteristic of capitalism, that it has produced a phenomenon that doesn't seem to be capitalism: the collaborative commons. This is the endgame he's talking about. He's not saying that capitalism has failed. He's saying that capitalism is starting to end itself by producing a phenomenon that seems to be even more efficient than capitalism. 
Essentially, we have situations where there is no private property, where a good is produced in a way where there is no scarcity. Essentially, the means of production is not owned by private individuals and the goods being produced are not created with a profit motive (essential elements of capitalism). 
Who owns the internet? Nobody and everyone. The filesharing that occurs on the internet allows for something new: infinite goods. A file can be copied over and over afterall. So there's no scarcity and producing an extra file results in no extra marginal cost: zero marginal cost. These files don't seem to be distributed with a profit motive.
Essentially, I believe he's right. The collaborative commons doesn't seem to fall under the known definition of capitalism. No private ownership of the means of production, no profit motive, etc. I don't see how people can argue that this is capitalism. Stop being defensive over the word capitalism and appreciate the larger point.

That's what you get with using centralized services. It was inevitable. 
Not that coinbase is bad, I actually approve of them. They are necessary for the eco system to continue to grow. But until we get a full decentralized service, the government will attempt (and most likely succeed) to apply the old paradigm on the new centralized services that will pop up around bitcoin.
The above is an unavoidable process IMO. The good news is that bitcoin will become more mainstream that way. And once those decentralized services hit, they won't be able to use force anymore, because you can't use force on math. The old paradigm will cease to be relevant. At that point, it will be too late to turn around and ban bitcoin.

Don't let the responses get you down. It's not that there aren't good answers, it's that has become so flooded with topics and that new users with less knowledge keep streaming in, resulting in low quality responses. The longterm posters are also tired of helping every person that comes by (they keep flooding in), so you see less responses from them as well. Bitcoin going mainstream attracts more scammers as well. Hence you see a lot of topics where people keep losing money.
The thing is that bitcoin is in a stage right now where a lot of personal responsibility is a requirement. Most people aren't used to this concept of personal responsibility. So they assume that they can be their own bank just like that and then they find out that their thinking was a tad naive. 
The positive news, is that this problem will likely go away over time as devs find the right balance between security and ease of use. But we are in the beginning stages of this process. It's kinda like Darwinisim in play where eventually the software evolves to the next level.
Anyways, I don't encourage other people to buy anymore as well. But not because I'm losing faith. I think the time for talking is done and that bitcoin has attracted enough brainpower to work on the ideas to prove its potential. Those ideas will probably be unleashed beginning in the second half of this year. 
The current state of is also the natural result of growth. While negative for posters where quality is concerned, I see it as a positive in terms of the timeline in bitcoin adoption. We may need some new subreddits that focus more on quality.

* The level of incompetence was simply legendary. An exchange based on PHP? Coding everything yourself? Cold storage that wasn't cold storage? The incompetence exceeds anything that happened before. Considering how much money he was responsible over, one might think he would have taken his position in the market more seriously. Or his customers for that matter. Other failures didn't fail as spectacular as this and they often showed more responsibility while failing.
* Failure and incompetence might be forgiven if it was an honest mistake. This was however due to major character defects. I blame this on his obsession with coffee and his damn cat over valuing his customers money and the responsibility that comes along with it (biggest reason out of the ones listed). It is possible he dipped into customer funds to splurge on himself due to these character defects. This speaks of utter customer disregard.

No offense, but I think you are underestimating AA somewhat. Sure he likes his oneliners, but his viewpoint is a tad more complicated than that. 
Anyways, I'm no rabid believer in capitalism, nor do I think it's a perfect system. But every alternative system I've heard about that's supposed to replace capitalism, sucks even greater ballz than capitalism itself. Most arguments I've heard against capitalism lack a certain undestanding of why capitalism has worked in the first place. They tend to focus on the social aspects of capitalism, yet fail to identify why it defeated communism, marxism, etc.
Once you understand why capitalism has worked, you soon realize that looking at this from the social aspect is actually the wrong way to look at it. By prioritizing the social aspects, people tend to prioritize short term goals that tries to achieve this fairness. And short term thinking is always bad where sustainability is concerned. The system that tries to mandate fairness is actually a system that deteriorates at an even more advanced rate than capitalism itself. There's no faster way to anti social practices than systems that tries to artificially construct fairness.
Having said that, I think capitalism can indeed be replaced with a system that's better. I think Jeremy Rifkin has some great insights in how this might be accomplished.

I will acknowledge that scarcity in itself is not enough. Utility is a necessary requirement as well. My previous post did not express this well, but I can agree that scarcity is not the only requirement. But we seem to disagree on utility value. Tell me where I can get the services Bitcoin provides?


And yet nobody went to jail. Did the FED accept an audit? NO. What about the several trillion dollars that went missing at the FED? And while they did later explain what they did with that money, there has been some debate over the numbers they gave us. Something that can only be checked with an audit, something they don't accept. There is no oversight to speak of, they can pretty much do whatever they want. It's not even possible to vote them out, they exist outside the voting system. 
And you do realize that most of the bailouts came out of our own pockets, right? You can hardly say regulation such as this is really regulated. Yeah, they regulated that we pay for their mistakes. That's some regulation right there.


And this matters how? You can't copy the code in it's exact form, because protocols are devised in such a way that it only accepts its own kind. You can copy the bitcoin protocol in a slightly altered way, but it will be a different protocol and thus cannot enjoy the infrastructure advantage of bitcoin. The services an altcoin can provide will thus be limited as well.


No it's not the same infrastructure. I will agree that software wise, there is no real difficulty in adding an altcoin through bitcoin's infrastructure. But actually making the decision to include an altcoin is where the problem lies. Human behaviour and opportunity costs will make humans automatically favour the coin with the largest network effect. And we can see this process actually taking place today. 
According to you, the altcoins can provide me the same services as bitcoin does. Really? Ok, tell me how many shops actually accept altcoins..........Not that many, right? This means that the altcoins TODAY do not actually give me the same level of service as bitcoin does. THAT'S the reality we speak of. 
Apparently, if we listen to you, the barrier of adding altcoins should be trivial, yet..... if the barrier entry is small, why do most exchanges/shops not accept altcoins? That's because the software barrier is not the only barrier there is, that's why. There are other type of barriers that need to be overcome.


Network effects tend to fail when a fatal mistake has been made. Tell me what mistake bitcoin has made? 


I'll say it again, there's no loyalty in the market for Bitcoins. If it can save merchants money and so can other alts, then they'll use whatever they need to. Talking about it as a deflationary system where you can store and grow your wealth is ridiculous, for all of the aforementioned problems with artificial (read: fake) scarcity
And again, why don't they do that then? If we are talking about naive, it's naive to believe that the software barrier is the only barrier that exists. Our very own eyes can tell us that shops aren't accepting the altcoins.
And make no mistake, I'm not saying that eventually, the altcoins will not come along and eventually be used in shops. But it's only after overcoming the other barriers. It will not happen as fast as you think.
And I will also say that I'm not saying that it's not possible that bitcoin does not make any mistakes in the future. Like you said, bitcoin can become MySpace. If bitcoin makes a fatal mistake,  the barrier for entry for other altcoins will be lower. But it will need to be an extremely fatal mistake, something that undermines the entire bitcoin network.

Not to say that I don't understand where you are coming from and perhaps Voorhees does have it easy, but I also agree with Andreas about the dangers of pursuing a risk free society through regulation. There is no such thing as risk free and the idea itself goes against the tenets of capitalism. By trying to reduce risk through regulation, you concentrate the risk all towards a single point in the future. If you are lucky, you yourself won't have to pay the price, but your children or your children's children will.
Not to say that regulation in itself is bad or inherently evil, but the problem is that the humans devising these regulations are flawed creatures and the chance of them getting it right is small indeed. And once these rules have been set, they are rigid and inflexible and it can take quite awhile before the mistake is revealed. The only way to find the most efficient rules is to let people try out what works and what doesn't. And that's essentially a Darwinian process through the free market.
And people have a basic misunderstanding of how the free market works. Because it's a Darwinian process, failure and massive losses of money are to be expected. Darwinism is not only about happy endings and flowery stories where nobody gets hurt. Despair is quite prevalent as well. HOWEVER, through evolution, the despair is eventually kept to a minimum, because we keep getting more efficient. It's BECAUSE we experience despair that we strive for efficiency. Trying to absolutely eliminate all negative elements can only result in disaster. When people think themselves safe, they no longer THINK. 
But eventually, the market will be fully mature, efficiency will be at its peak and massive failures will be but a minor occurrence. You'll just have to accept that the market right now is not yet a mature market and that the risk is at its highest. 
And one other thing. If government can think up rules, these same rules they think up can be enforced through code. THAT'S the revolutionary part. The government is no longer a necessity in that case. But consumers choose if they want to use these rules and the Darwinian process will eventually reveal if these are the most efficient rules. They are not mandatory. And this is key, because you need that kind of flexibility for Darwinism to occur. And we WANT Darwinism. Rigid rules impede Darwinism. Only if the regulator happens to be a genius can rigid rules work.

Lol, fastest debunk I've ever seen. 
But the point remains that pyramid schemes require ever increasing inflows of money in order to sustain itself. The moment this inflow stops even ONCE, the price crashes and the entire system collapses. In other words, a pyramid scheme does not allow for even one major price crash. 
Bitcoin has already collapsed several times over its period of life, something that should be impossible for a pyramid scheme.

Wether something will fail or not is a complicated affair, but I will boil it down to the most important element at the moment: WHALES. Whales are the one with the most leverage (because they have the most money), the people that support the price. Most people are under the illusion that the regular joe (the market) dictates the price. This is only true under select circumstances (like during panics). Most of the time, a whale controls which way the market moves.
Why are whales so powerful? Because when a whale buys or sells, the price movement is large and people tend to jump on that bandwagon, thus increasing the effect of the price movement and accomplishing things a whale could not do on his own. Regular joe's tend to follow a whale most of the time. 
Can a whale lose against the regular joe? Yes, if these people have no experience, but most whales don't get to have enormous sums of money without good reasons. So whales tend to dominate the price most of the time.
The key to wether bitcoin will fail or not is by analyzing the way whales think. The most important whale to analyze are those that tend to be true bitcoin believers. There may be some that aren't true believers, but to determine if something has a chance, you need some genuine believers. And a genuine believer will only ditch btc under several scenarios (like a 51% attack, encryption being broken, etc). And even then, some believers might still stick around. It depends on how the community reacts to such an event and if recovery seems likely.
Anyways, a whale has two ways of buying. He either tries to buy without affecting the price as minimally as possible or he buys to purposely pump the price. A whale only chooses the second option when the infrastructure can take the upsurge (since past upsurges were stopped due to infrastructure problems) and if a constant stream of good news comes out. If he tries to pump the price when these conditions don't exist, there's a chance that the price crashes immediately after and a whale may even suffer a loss. A whale when pumping the price will always try to do under maximum conditions.
Which brings us to the next point. When will whales start pumping btc again? I believe that they will do so when secondmarket's exchange is operational (around July). The big money is Wall Street and these guys don't trust the current btc infrastructure, but they do believe in btc. So they will wait till a Wallstreet type of exchange (because they are familiar with that) arises. Barry Silbert, CEO of Secondmarket has spoken to people and he estimates that atleast 500 million dollars will start flowing in btc once that exchange is operational. From his words, he guarantees that this will happen, because they told him that they were going to do this. If btc doesn't get hacked in the meantime, the price WILL rise dramatcially at that time.

Seems norrmal behaviour to me where the bubble is deflating. After a crash occurs, prices will rise immediately after, because people want to buy cheaply. But it will slowly deflate after that, because people need to pay bills or they get nervous, because the price isn't rising or both. Some manipulation from China adds to this effect. 
But I think it won't be long where some whales will start buying in to support the price. Low prices are safe moments for them to step in and I think we are very close to that treshold now.

As for deflationary economies hurting poor people, the reason they tend to be poor, is because they were incentivized to overspend in the first place. But it's true that deflation would be bad for debtors. But they would in turn be incentivized to quickly pay off debt (instead of being incentivized to accumulate more) and to save instead. Deflationary economies tend to be good for people that save. And savings are an important part of any economy, since savings tend to flow into investments through banks.
Also, inflationary economies tend to increase the wealth gap overtime. The difference between the 1% and the rest of us is bigger than ever and money printing feeds into that process even more. We even have some FED people claiming this.
Anyways, your other misgivings are countered by the fact that we had a gold standard with prolonged deflation in the past with no problems whatsoever. And it never was a problem during that time. Obviously, the wage and interest rates problems shouldn't have been that big of a deal in the end. But post a thread about it. There are many here more knowledgeable about the subject than me. See what they say about it.

The regulations concerning money are the easiest to implement. With current regulation, we have things like KYC and AML. The problem with these laws are that they are centralized in nature, they violate privacy and they can be abused (by government and others).
The first key we need, is decentralized identity. Right now, we rely mostly on government, facebook and google to prove our identities on the internet. That's problematic in nature, since it gives them too much power. Decentralized identity solutions allow us to only give the information that that specific transaction needs. If for example a transaction requires your age, it makes sense to only send your age, but not your name. Current solutions however, require you to give your name as well. Otherwhise, it wouldn't be possible to verify your age.
But with programming ingenuity, it's possible to only send your age, without having to send your name. Think such a thing isn't possible? Just look at how they implemented the proof of reserves for bitcoin exchanges. Normally, you would need to audit their books to see if an exchange has enough reserves to cover deposits. But with how proof of reserves is implemented, the audit is done by the code itself, while hiding the exact numbers. The code only tells if they have the reserves, but not the numbers itself. This way, we know that an exchange has the reserves, but we don't know how high that number is. This is good for the exchange, since knowing those numbers might be bad for competitive purposes. 
 
Solutions like the above allows for information management, where you retain control over your own information and where you send the minimum amount of information for that transaction to occur. 
Decentralized identity is ideally pure opensource software, programmed in such a way that it can reliably determine your identity. Humans can be corrupted and pressured through police action, but software will remain neutral and uncorruptible, no matter ho many guns you point at it. The problem is that some info (like your residence) is difficult to determine through a pure software solution. That's where the internet of things come in. It may be that each house must be installed with a specific sensor connected to the internet and only the owner of that house can trigger that sensor through some key that he owns. We can even program that sensor to detect if the owner of that house regularly makes use of his home. This prevents fraud. Other creative measures might be taken to prevent someone from gaming the system and faking their identity.
Anyways, the above description and measures are things that can be done with other areas of regulation. Just remember one thing. Anything a human can do, can theoretically be replicated by software or a machine. So most activities that humans do can be replaced by a creative solution.
Some of the harder things to solve require human judgement and those often involve things like murder, etc. I'm not expecting much regulation by math in this area (until AI catches up to human level). But where money is concerned? Easy.

No, he has social perception. From all the vids I've seen, he has ALOT of it. He noticed that Joe was slightly annoyed at him for trying to pump bitcoin and I believe he suspected that Joe somehow felt that Andreas was impatient with him for straying, so he made sure to thank Joe and show him how appreciative he was of Joe.
The thing is, is that super smart people tend to be SERIOUS. Smart people tend to have mental stamina and this stamina allows them to concentrate and focus more on the problem at hand. They rarely have patience for trivialities, because they see this habit for trivialities as one of the fundamental problems of mankind allowing for the perpetuation of the problem. Because the problems of today tend to be problems where you have to sit down and study it for long hours (or weeks, months) and roll up your sleeves. Needless to say, regular people do not have the patience for this or the mental stamina for it. Hence, the reason a lot of problems remain unsolved at the moment. 
And Andreas is a bitcoin whore, because he sees it as a solution for one of the largest problems terrorizing mankind today: corruption. The problem is that we have too many people today that aren't serious about tackling this particular problem. And a lot of people die because of corruption.
But I do not fault Joe Rogan for not being as serious as Andreas, just as I do not fault Andreas for not lightening up. We each have our strengths and weaknesses and no man can be everything. The key is getting the best out of all of us. Sometimes these dealings with each other tends to annoy us, but patience is in order.

Mtgox was an exchange where people kept supporting it, because only they had the liquidity required to do large trades. But this liquidity will now be taken up by other players. Bitstamp has the strongest position right now. Huobi has liquidity as well, but most people suspect their volume is fake, due to their 0% fee policy. Under such a policy, one can create fake volume by buying up one's own btc.
There were a couple of exchanges here that were for large amounts of btc:
But I haven't used them, since I'm not a millionaire. Not sure what they can allow you to do.
If I were a millionaire, I would try to make a deal with Bitstamp off the books. That way, bitcoin prices will not be affected and one won't be burned when the price crashes after a large trade.
Otherwise, one might think in investing in some new bitcoin startups. But they are popping up like mushrooms, so you would need to carefully read up on them.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:21:41
If there's a decline in people using btc, it would in theory have an effect on the price (though price valuation is not so simple and has many other factors). Lower prices would cause mining to be unprofitable. In that case, some miners would exit the industry and after 10 minutes, difficulty would readjust to account for that. The difficulty would be set easier to account for the smaller group of miners and the miners that stayed in the network would be able to make a profit once more.

My guess is that alot of ammo has been used up in the last spike by the small players. Uptrends are mostly caused and triggered by whales and these whales know that the small player is tapped out. They need time to recover. 
They also know that the last crash was caused by infrastructure problems. Infrastructure problems are not solved in one day, so they expect that anyone who tries to trigger an uptrend right now will most likely fail. The infrastructure needs to catch up in order to support the next spike.
I suspect whales will start moving when sentiment is of the opinion that there have been serious gains in infrastructure as well as a constant stream of good news. Right now, news is still mixed. It might seem positive for most of us who are in the know, but the rest of the world still has a slightly negative impression. Mtgox is still fresh in their minds. That memory needs to fade. The whales will now only buy a btc here and there, without affecting prices too much. They probably like periods like these, because it gives them a chance to obtain btc for cheap while the price stays stable like this.
New players that got busted during the last crash (and people that were only watching bitcoin for the first time) also need the time to regain confidence in the fundamentals of bitcoin. They need to read up, watch youtube videos, until they become confident enough to become full bitcoin disciples. This is the same process that happened to me. I got (slightly) busted during the Cyprus crash and I needed alot of time (as well as salary) before I gained the presence of mind to invest again, but more in a longterm manner, this time ignoring the extreme price swings.

Lack of education is indeed a factor. But that actually makes it worse. The less education a person has, the more he's vulnerable to outside influences. Money is not neutral.
With regards to poor people being unable to pay off debt, I myself think they are too fargone actually. But the mistake is to think that inflation will actually help them. It does not. It can only delay the inevitable for a moment, but the effectiveness of the extra creation of money decreases overtime. We are nearing the very limit of what inflation can do for the poor. There are only bad options from here on out.
Anyways, I was specifically referring to money printing that increases the wealth gap. I have no information on how longterm inflation actually works in this regard. But here's the link:
This link seems to suggest that the gold standard (which was deflationary) was actually beneficial for the wealth gap:
But I suggest taking a single link with a grain of salt. If you have other links that has data that says that the gold standard was bad for income inequality, I would be much interested. Preferably, links that take the entire gold standard period into account and not just the great depression.
And the problems you cite with the gold standards were BENEFITS. No liquidity? That's a different way of stating that states had to manage their money efficiently. That's exactly what you want. The occasional gold shocks were self correcting and had no real influence on society. Certainly, some traders were probably bad off in that situation, but we should focus on THE PEOPLE and they did relatively well. 
If we look at the central bank performance, we actually notice that they did WORSE than during the gold standard. They were meant to prevent crises, but we actually had MORE crises under the central bank system.
But anyways, all I ask is that you keep an open mind about this. I'm still studying the issue myself. Not claiming that I have all the answers, but these are my conclusions as of this moment.
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:17:34
In theory you can create a fiat currency that never inflates. But that defeats the entire point of fiat. Because fiat was supposed to solve the weaknesses of the gold standard (it being limited). Show me a fiat currency that never inflates and if you manage to find one, I'll consider that as something new I've learned today.
Regarding inflation forcing people to invest in innovation and technology, "force" is a rather inaccurate word. More like that the extra printed money lands in the economy, increases the velocity of money and eventually lands in the technology sector through increased supply and greater amounts of circulation. In an inflationary system, money is more plentiful. Thus everyone has more money at their disposal. But the technology sector tends to spend the money the most efficiently, since they tend to be the most productive. Society progresses the most when money positively affects production. Society does not progress in any meaningful way when consumers spend their money on more food, because of inflation.
As for the McDonald's case, I vaguely remember reading an article that alludes to what you are saying, but if that example doesn't count, there are many others.
Anyways, I'm not arguing that we have out of control inflation (though I do tend to think that inflation numbers do not accurately reflect the real numbers). But the entire theory of inflation rests on increased spending. If you read all the comments by past central bankers, this is evident. As well as that this theory is described in basic economic textbooks. The point of inflation is to induce spending.
As for investment vehicles, some of the instruments we have today, is entirely because we live in a system designed for inflation. Treasuries are one such an instrument. In a deflationary system, some instruments would vanish. And they would be replaced by something that is not equivalent, but completely different.
Anyways, my knowledge about this particular subject is not good, but I've read threads that spoke about this and how a deflationary economy would function in practice. Try to create a thread about it and see what the community says. And see if you think they are valid points. That's all I can say about that subject.

The value of a coin must first derive from its usefulness as money. Gold has historically been a very good money. It doesn't decay, it's divisible, etc. Bitcoin can do all the things gold can, but even better. But money must also be sound, by being scarce. I believe the scarcity is the most important aspect of why bitcoin has been so succesful up to this point. Bitcoin has a specific system making it VERY difficult to alter the supply.
If a coin has above properties, it will only be a matter of time, before it's used as money to buy goods and services. The more goods and services one can buy with bitcoin, the higher the value of the coin will be. And it's also necessary for a group to have enough faith in the currency to maintain part of their portfolio in bitcoins (in other words, don't sell their btc).
While it's certainly true that the future cannot be predicted, I will posit this: If bitcoin itself is not hacked in a fundamental way, it will be inevitable that bitcoin will eventually increase 10x in value. Because it can do a lot more things than traditional money. In pure specs, practical matters and what the technology allows, bitcoin blows every other type of money out of the water. Only a severe hack could undermine this scenario IMO and destroy the network effect bitcoin currently enjoys. Not even government intervention or the creation of a superior crypto competitor will stop bitcoin. Network effects are stubborn things and mostly only stop when a serious mistake is made.

You don't think that the protocol team doesn't interact with the hardware teams? Realize that software is useful, because it's PRACTICAL. It makes no sense to write software that cannot be used in the real world. This is why there's close communication between those that write software and those of the hardware side. If people want to include a feature in the software protocol, yet it would result in compatibility problems in the real world, they won't include the feature. It's as simple as that. The software side HAS to take the real world into account. And this phenomenon is already starting to occur. Andreas gave such an example in the youtube vid. 
Hardware wallets WILL be prevalent. It WILL slow down developement on the protocol side.
And I agree that it's easier to change higher level protocols than lower level ones. But that's because developement hasn't halted yet on the higher levels. The reason we need higher level protocols, is exactly BECAUSE of ossification of the lower level ones. But ossification occurs on the higher level protocols as well. That's why in turn we need even higher level protocols in order to address this.
But the above leads to fragmentation. There's no guarantee that people will use YOUR higher level protocol. The lower level protocol EVERYONE uses. But the higher you go, the more fragmentation there is. And it could be that the one that succeeds, misses a feature that turns out to be important only after several decades (like anonymity). Writing a new higher level layer with anonymity doesn't solve the problem, because of fragmentation AND because the underlying protocols were not originally designed to be anonymous. This limits how much anonymity you can provide and a greater possibility of vulnerabilities that compromises anonymity.
Furthermore, there's a problem that these things can be made to work WITHOUT anonymity. Anonymity is not a critical feature that would doom the technology if it were absent. I agree that ossification due to hardware will not stop important features from making it in the protocol. But there's a good chance it will stop anonymity. Because lack of anonymity only affects the user in an indirect way. Humans only tend to pay attention when it touches them directly. 
If bitcoin lacks anonymity, this WILL be abused. It is inevitable. Right now, this lack of privacy isn't a major problem yet, because it hasn't touched most lives directly. But if this continues there's a good chance it will. 
Personally, I think it's too early to include anonymity even though I KNOW it will be abused. Sometimes it's useful to let people make the mistake. Sometimes it's more damaging to prevent the mistake than to let it occur. If you want a responsible society, you need mistakes to seep into the public consciousness in order to make better decisions.

Even in the case you were right where consumers were not interested, I see a bright future in B2B solution. A consumer might not see the possibilities, but a business cannot afford to think in those terms. Because competition is murderous. Bitcoin IS a more efficient system, no matter how you slice or dice it.
In the past, you were toast if you didn't have an internet strategy. Now? I say future businesses will be toast if they don't have a bitcoin strategy. Because the savings that are possible with bitcoin are that significant. If you use bitcoin in the most primitive way, a doubling of your profit margin is possible in low margin situation. Reinvent your business in a decentralized manner and not only can you offer a superior product, you can offer your product for much lower prices. This will result in bitcoin businesss (or blockchain businesses) starting to cannibalize the traditional companies. 
But on the consumer front, I really don't have any worries. All bitcoin needs to do is survive. That's it. The price doesn't even need to appreciate. If it can do just that, people will not be able to dismiss it. They WILL conclude that it has staying power and that it is legitimate. Perception is a large factor where adoption is concerned. Right now, bitcoin is new. So perception is uncertain (not to mention silk road, etc). But this will change overtime.

Perhaps. It depends on how bad deflation is. I think the horrors of deflation are overstated, but I do think that extended deflation is probably not a desirable thing to have just as extended inflation is not desirable. The reality is that each scenario (deflation or inflation) will result that the negative effects will crowd out the positives over an extended period of time, simply because humans are wired that way. I happen to believe that we are in a situation today where deflation is more desirable to have than inflation, but this might change overtime.
If deflation turns out to be really that bad, what would likely happen is that humans would democratically decide to change the core protocol to allow for some inflation. But it would be democratically decided, this is the important thing. No single human can know wether the times need inflation or deflation. Thus, central banks are simply fooling themselves thinking that they can know this. Only the market collectively can know that.

It's a joke currency, but it still represents value. That aspect of it is no joke. And it's a system that's inflationary, so it supports spending. I believe more transactions are done with doge (though smaller transactions) than btc. And BECAUSE it's an internet meme, the network effect behind it is pretty strong. It's quite possible that doge might be one of those currencies that won't fade away for a long time.

I reviewed your post again and I see that you are right. But I assumed you were speaking about electricity costs because of this:


And the cost to run the network IS the electricity cost. 
Now that I see that you divided the added value by the number of transactions, I can say that this calculation is actually wrong if you want to calculate transaction cost. What you actually calculated with this:


is actually the average amount of money (in dollar terms) transferred per transaction. This is not how you calculate transaction costs. Dividing the electricity costs by the number of transactions would make more sense.

A fiat currency will always be inflationary (over the long run). And it's what eventually destroyed every single one. Where inflation tends to be good, is when that money goes towards innovation and technology. Businesses can benefit from inflation as well, but the technology sector is the sector that is the least affected by the negative effects of inflation overtime.
The negative effects of inflation tend to be consumerism and the habit for the accumulation of debt (consumer, businesses and government). 
With consumerism, consumers are incentivized to spend money on frivolous things. In other words spending efficiency goes down. But on the upside, the greater liquidity eventually flows to the productive sector and they can accomplish great things with the money. Spending efficiency in those sectors will also go down (technology sector least affected), but this in turn is compensated by the greater sums at their disposal.
Consumerism also has some negative side effects, such as a deteriorating rule of law (corruption) and an overemphasis on one's own emotions. The reality that someone can sue McDonald's for extroardinary sums for simply heating up a coffee too much is symptomatic of this kind of behaviour.
At this moment, debt levels are up to the extent that it's IMO a concern of national security. Both consumerwise and governmentwise. These debt levels are in danger of swallowing up any benefit the productive sector might offer. I also believe that business efficiency where spending is concerned is starting to be affected by longterm inflation, where more and more businesses are spending their money in inefficient ways (malinvestment). 
Deflation on the other hand has the benefit of greater spending efficiency. People are more inclined to think before they spend. The spending effectiveness will be the greatest in the beginning when people switch from an inflationary model towards a deflationary model. Overtime, spending effectiveness will go down, while spending efficiency remains high. There's also less chance of systemic risk, as long as the currency is flexible (the ability to subdivide). The greatest risk is the risk of slowdown.
But this is a process of decades. Prior to the great depression, deflation was actually associated with healthy growth. The great depression was actually the exception to the rule as stated by the Bank of International Settlements. See: 
Before the negative effects of deflation start to play out, I expect to be dead. But we've seen in the past that deflation as the evil monster is actually a myth. We should distinguish between deflation as seen with the gold standard and the deflation as we see with Japan. In a system designed for inflation, deflation is indeed bad. But under the gold standard, there were actually not many negative remarks on that period of time.
Anyways, where the monetary policy of Bitcoin is concerned, I'm not really worried, since Bitcoin is subdivisible and can be programmed to ge even further in that direction. It will not be constrained the same way the gold standard was. As well as that Bitcoin allows for currency competition. What Bitcoin does not do will be done by a different currency. As long as markets allow for this competition to occur.

Quite possible he meant that. But I seem to remember that discussion around transaction **cost** occurred at a later date than discussion around transaction **fees** when that video came out (might be wrong on this). And he specifically mentioned fees, which is why I tend to think he meant usability issues.
Keep in mind that transaction cost can sometimes refer to transaction fees depending on context. But it can also refer to the cost of the miner to process that transaction (electricity costs+investment costs), which is distinctly different from the fee he's charging you for it.
With bitcoin, the cost to process that transaction is most likely higher than Visa or Mastercard, but the fee charged for that transaction is low. And it's the fee that's important. It's not really relevant if the cost is high, unless combined with other factors affects the height of the fees. In case Amir really was referring to transaction costs and not fees, it's not a point to worry about.
Bottomline, if revenues is high enough and costs stay low, transaction fees can remain low, even if transaction costs (the cost to process them) are higher than the competitor.

Let me be more accurate, they don't necessarily express the notion that manipulation is bad, but they do always list possible negative consequences or a possible controversy surrounding the issue. If I conflated that into thinking that economics said that manipulation is bad, I concede the point. Anyways, I'll take your suggestion and try to improve my language. 
Regarding bitcoin, the price is purely determined by buyers and sellers on exchanges. With fiat, there are legal tender laws, the police force and the army supporting the price of fiat. Though there is an element of market forces in fiat as well.

There are two types of people where markets are concerned. Those that buy low, sell high. And those that do the reverse. The ones that buy low, sell high have icewater in their veins. They do not let emotion control their actions. Some accomplish this feat through sheer personality, others through experiencing these bouts of fear in past endeavours.
I have considered the possibility of being wrong. If it is true that I'm wrong, in theory the people that have icewater in their veins should not even be near bitcoin at the moment, because they have already determined bitcoin to go to zero. This is not what I see happening. The smartest people in the room are flocking to bitcoin. People that have had actual accomplishments in the market are flocking to bitcoin. Investment heavyweights are flocking to bitcoin. CEO's of companies that made it big are flocking to bitcoin. And not just made it big, but people who were on the forefront of innovation.  
Of course, if you are not a believer, you wouldn't have seen this. Because you already made up your mind, you wouldn't have even bothered to look for these signs. But I especially paid attention, because there's always a possibility of being wrong.
Now, could the above smart people be wrong? Absolutely. The world is a random place and one throw of the dice could even upset the visions of the smartest people. But nobody is going to tell me there's nothing there when I see juggernauts saying how they are bullish on bitcoin.
The way I see it, this is just the normal volatility behaviour of bitcoin. It's speculators trying to find the correct price. The fundamentals are better than ever. Even with prices going down, the number of transactions are at an ATH. I don't remember this being the case in previous price crashes. Normally the metrics are supposed to be down.
Anyways, believe what you want to believe. But I choose the side with the smartest people. And the side that actually accomplished things in the marketplace. If I'm wrong, I'm in good company.

Standard economic textbooks teach you that governments engage in them, but that it is generally agreed upon that the effects are questionable and undesirable in theory.

I mostly agree with what you said. Despite the initial tone of my post, I do think that speculation is indispensable in order for price discovery to work. That speculation is demonized today, is because people simply cannot think objectively about the subject. And there is indeed an overlap between regular use and speculation. And most people criticising speculation don't even see this distinction and see all speculation as negative manipulation.
Having said that, I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with what Peter Thiel stated. I do not even believe he was really criticizing the speculation aspect. He was merely giving an observation of what constitutes success. And I happen to agree with that observation. The endgame with bitcoin is for people to regularly transact. This is basically what we all want. For bitcoin to be used just like euro and dollars in our daily lives. Speculation is an intermediate step to this endgame.
Also, while I agree that there's an overlap between speculators and regular users, they are not entirely the same. But that all depends on context and what your definition of "regular" is. When I speak of regular users, I mostly mean people that don't even take price into consideration and just use the damn system as money and transact. Sometimes I use "regular" in a different context (like the one you just used), but mostly this is how I see regular users.

Well, just to play devil's advocate, I actually think it's quite possible that we may get a dotcom like crash where it will take years for the price to crawl back up. Not to say that bitcoin isn't revolutionary (it is), but that we might stumble upon some kind of flaw (one that isn't easily fixable) that we hadn't considered yet resulting in a REAL crash.
Now, even though I KNOW that such a scenario is possible, this will still be the future IMO even if such a crash actually happened. But it still pays to be cautious and not to casually dismiss any criticism.

My guess would be because of Dell accepting bitcoin. One would expect prices to increase with the Dell anouncement, but Dell is immediately converting their bitcoins, so it's having a downward pressure on prices.
The above is a theory, but my guess is that SOME whales out there subscribe to the above theory regardless wether it is true or not and decided to preempt the downgraded price, by selling in advance. As a result, the price went down faster than it would have otherwise (if theory were to be true).
But even if the theory were true, the price of bitcoin is determined by a lot more than just merchant adoption and there are many more factors at play. If the downwards pressure really does exist, it had (or will have) but a temporary effect IMO.

There will certainly be a period where they will coexist for a time. This transitionary period could possibly be quite lengthy. But in the end, there will simply be no competing against a deflationary currency.

This doesn't even take into account that bitcoin is more than a currency and cannot be seen in just this light.

Losing all the btc is not probable. And even if we had only 1 btc left from the 21 million btc (the rest being lost), the system would still be functional. What would happen is that deflationary forces would inflate the worth of the last btc to account for the missing btc. The last btc would undergo a software change making it even more divisible than the 8 decimals it currently has. That way, even 1 btc would still be enough for the world population.

We've got many major financial guys being bullish on bitcoin as well. If I remember it right, among them is even a guy that has beaten the S&amp;P for 15 years straight. So it's not only the internet nerds, it's the financial juggernauts as well. The largest hedgefund in the world has investments in bitcoin. 
What you mean to say, is not that Mr. Ponzi is smarter than all of the above. You actually mean to say that YOU are smarter than all of the above. Because I very much doubt that mr Ponzi could even compete.
Anyways, you say I've been changing the topic, yet you dodged most of my earlier questions. But I'll answer anyways.  Regardless of political inclinations, we are heading into this direction anyways. If not bitcoin, it would have been a different computer currency. For the simple reason that any task that humans can do, computers can do. But computers can do it faster, without the corruption and without any of the other human weaknesses. Not to mention that you don't have to pay humans by replacing them with computers. There is a great incentive to get humans out of most tasks for these reasons. I find it inevitable that computers will start replacing us overtime.

I've listened to a few interviews given by bank execs. Actually, they do invest. For some of the banks, they are using a clever tactic where they are investing in companies hoping they might not take off. Why do they invest anyways? It's because these companies happen to compete with them on some level and these companies will pop up regardless. If they will pop up regardless, it's better to diversify and rise up with them, instead of spending money to destroy them and fail anyways.

I think a hardfork is unlikely as well, but Peter Todd has been stating he would look into the matter of a hardfork more in depth since it's been proposed in theory, but not in practice.

And while he doesn't accuse outright and tries to stay dispassionate about it, it's clear that he's not entirely happy with how things are going.

Sudden uptrends are ALWAYS caused by manipulation. What most people don't realize is that manipulators and believers can be one and the same being. That these 500 traders are manipulators says nothing about them being believers or not, though I believe it is likely.
Manipulation by believers is legitimate growth. It's only when the price crashes and there is no believer to catch the knife that growth caused by manipulation is harmful. It depends on if the reason and nature of the crash is sufficient to shake even the beliefs of a believer (like if the bitcoin protocol is hacked). 
I'm inclined to believe that that the people with the most leverage are true believers. Some of these believers might have been wiped out on mtgox, but I rather doubt that they are completely out of the game. Only an idiot would put all his eggs into one basket. And people that have money have the luxury to spread around their wealth. They tend to diversify. Not to mention that mtgox lost a lot of marketshare. A lot of people went over to other exchanges.
Also, one must remember that it hasn't been very long since bitcoin came into the news. This likely attracted some new players, who may have even more firepower than the old guard. I just listened to an Ed and Ethan show with Bruce Fenton. He hinted that some parties with ridiculous amounts of money will be in play and that we'll hear about them in a year time. If these guys are believers, it looks like I wouldn't worry about there being no knife catchers. It looks like we have plenty of them.

Not saying that inflationary currencies can't work, but the chance of adoption is higher when the currency is deflationary. Appreciation tends to drive adoption. Notice how the high price has put bitcoin in the news each and every time.
Also, his theory about the fees is misleading. The TOTAL AGGREGATE fees will increase with bitcoin (through mass adoption), but not the individual fees. The individual fees will actually decrease through market forces. 
As for the mining pools, even if they obtain a monopoly over the mining power, they cannot force through a hard fork, because you cannot force people to use the new hardfork. What would happen is that people wouldn't update their clients and would stay on the old fork. New miners would enter the scene and would mine under the old rules reaping massive profits, because the old miners would have ceded their place mining a fork that nobody uses and because there would be no competition in the beginning because of that.
Also, mining pools still consists of INDIVIDUALS. If the pool operator tried doing this, the individuals would leave the pool, because they would be risking their profits going along with this scheme for above reasons.

This is exactly it. Not sure about the exact timing, but it somewhat coincided with Dell accepting bitcoin (someone check when Dell revealed that they accepted bitcoin, the exact time that they actually had the option on their website and the price decline). 
My guess is that SOME whales (hedgefunds, investors, etc) were predicting a price decline due to this event, seeing how Dell is the largest company yet to accept bitcoin and is also immediately converting their bitcoins into dollars. And it caused a drop stronger than would have happened if every speculator out there had waited it out. 
But the drop also triggered a technical analysis event, where the drop is going even further. My guess is that some speculator out there decided it's better for the price to drop in the short term in order to bring forward buy pressure from speculators that judge that the bottom has already been reached. That bottom is probably around 570 usd. This is just my guess though.

Well, that purely depends on your priorities. Make no mistake, Andreas was fully aware of what he was doing. You make it seem that he didn't know that he was pushing it, because he lacked the social intelligence. Not so. He chose to push the boundaries, knowing that he would probably annoy his host, but chose to prioritize his message anyways (as is evident in all the other youtube vids when he spoke about the Joe Rogan experience). And I think he succeeded in pushing the boundaries, while trying to keep the host happy.
Bitcoin is a difficult subject to understand. And it actually does the subject a disservice to think that a single Joe Rogan episode could adequately explain the concept. It took me months of research before I decided to jump in. So Andreas was pressed for time. He calculated every word in order to convey the most information. And he took the risk of annoying his host. And it was well worth it, I believe. After Andreas did that show, there was a noticable increase of bitcoin supporters on reddit coming from the Joe Rogan show. Suddenly people stopped him on the street recognizing his name. All in all, a satisfactory outcome.
Mind you, I can understand the annoyance with Andreas. But I happen to be vested in bitcoin's succes also. I saw what he was trying to do and I happen to agree with his tactics. 
It all depends on your priorities.

In all the examples you listed, supply outpaced demand, resulting in falling prices. Manufacturers are incentivized to flood the market with a surplus of supply. Why? Because that nets them more revenue. What will earn you more: 10 computers for 1 million dollars or 1 million computers for 1000 dollars? The latter is obviously better. This is the reason why prices fall for new technology.
But falling prices in technology is possible because the manufacturer has oversight of demand and can adjust supply accordingly (and oversupplies in order to earn more revenue). With bitcoin this is not the case. With bitcoin it's not possible to adjust the supply in accordance to the demand. There are restrictions placed upon bitcoin manufacturers (the miners) preventing such a thing from happening. With bitcoin, the supply is already predetermined. Only the demand is free floating. And prices have already reached equilibrium for bitcoin. There's already regular demand out there that's keeping prices relatively stable. Demand has already outpaced supply even in the days when production was 50 btc per 10 minutes. And since we started from 0% adoption, demand will likely only continue to go up, not down.
That current prices are somewhat declining has more to do with speculation. I find it doubtful that declining demand from regular users has anything to do with it.

He's a cheerleader for that scenario, because the writer is from a strain of thought that thinks deflation is actually beneficial (Austrian economics).
I have read the writings of these Austrians and I happen to think they nailed most of the flaws in logic where conventional economics are concerned. 
And we know that economics in general must be imperfect, because most of them certainly didn't see 2008 coming or any other crises for that matter. The  predictive power of economics is atrociously bad and there's a high chance that some of the axioms the economists use must be seriously flawed from the outset. Yet, despite this habit of failure, economists don't sit down and actually question the things they've learned. They merely repeat what they've learned and think it's true if it sounds remotely plausible.
Not to say that everything mainstream economics says are wrong or that the Austrians always have it right. But the question wether deflation is wrong or not has not been decisively settled. The only real moment in history that was a real knock on deflation was the great depression, but prior to that period deflation didn't do so bad over long periods of time. We even have the Bank of International Settlements claiming that the great depression may have been an exception to the rule and not a general rule in of itself.

Humans can wriggle out of promises, because the money is out of reach for the victims. With bitcoin this will never be the case. The code can enforce promises.
And if you think data can be falsified, you don't understand encryption. The entire point of encryption signatures is to ensure in a cryptographic manner that data cannot be falsified. Is it impossible to falsify? No, but the average person doesn't have the means to crack encryption.

He's done some good work, I'll give him that. And despite the tone of my post, I would rather Mike stay on the team. I'm not really into witch hunts (as what has happened with Mike) and I can readily accept a good idea, even if that idea came from the devil himself. Doesn't matter where the idea came from. As long as it's good. His habit of goring oxes is something I can admire on an intellectual level as well, even if it sometimes irritates me on a personal level. 
Having said that, one should not be naive about any of his suggestions. It is fairly obvious to me that some element of politics is at play here and I really despise politics. But Peter Todd was prescient in seeing that with a project as ambitious as bitcoin (as well as the large financial implications), politics would soon enter the game. Anyone who thought otherwise was simply sticking his head into the sand. The coredevs require the consensus of the people in order for their ideas for the blockchain to go through. To get that consensus, they engage in media interviews and several other events in order to build social credit. It's this social credit that gives them the backing to make changes to the blockchain as they see fit. While Mike Hearn is certainly not the only one engaging in this activity, one must not discount the possibility that this is actually occurring. Mike's efforts with Lighthouse may be nothing more than an effort in obtaining social credit.
And who knows, perhaps Mike was merely doing it, because he felt he was wrongly accused of wrongdoing. Or he really felt that it was necessary. I must admit that the man is still a mystery to me. It might just be his natural tendency to gore oxes and he might not have any real intent of trying to centralize bitcoin. Whatever the truth may be, I don't really care one way or the other as long as the ideas are good. I don't particularly care if he really is a bad actor or not. I operate on the premise of merit and as long as you pursue merit, people's motivations or intent become irrelevant. 
The only reason I'm pointing all this out about him being a possible bad actor, is because one often is influenced by how a person sees another on a social level, instead of looking at the merit of the idea. That's how bad ideas tend to slip through the cracks. That's also why the devs are pursuing social credit. Because a regular person does not have the expertise to evaluate merit, so they are forced to evaluate the merit of an idea, based on the person advocating it. Even other devs tend to evaluate somewhat based on a social level. I'm no fan of evaluations based on criteria such as these, but since there is little choice in the matter, I atleast urge people to see that there's more playing in the background and not to be too overly influenced by fandom.

I suspect that these cases will blow up in the near future. I'm smelling a new scandal on the horizon, maybe even bigger than the Libor rigging. This time, there's a real possibility of people going to jail. I know Germany's BaFin is probably on the hunt based on their comments. That's the German equivalent of Fincen. But this might just be a global crackdown with America pitching in as well.

Limited supply is not a problem when you have near unlimited divisibility. 
21 million doesn't sound like much, until you realize that the deflationary aspect of it will practically assure that it can fulfill the needs of the populace. If bitcoin theoretically continues to deflate, it will one day reach parity with the entire market cap of the dollar supply. That will be more than enough money for the planet. The divisibilty aspect further assures that usage of bitcoins (as well as its deflationary aspect) will not become cumbersome. 
Fiat currencies continued existence relies on it being a suitable usecase to hold your assets in. Right now, faith in bitcoin is not yet strong enough to warrant this kind of reliance. But if it continues to survive, soon people will start paying more attention to the deflationary aspect than to the inherent risk of the system collapsing. Once people believe that the risk of bitcoin collapsing has the same risks as the internet collapsing, the usecase for fiat currencies to hold your assets in ceases to exist entirely. 
The reason people cannot see fiat currency dissappearing, is because they see it in terms of how the general populace sees it. This is the wrong way to reason. The general populace is the last to see change coming and they will be the last to make the switch. You must look at it from the perspective of a whale and how whales affect change and markets.

No, I think some people like Andreas are necessary. Admittedly, I wouldn't take his approach, but people are under some kind of misapprehension that only one approach can be the right one. Multiple approaches, even if in direct conflict with each other, can sometimes produce the best result when in tandem.
By having atleast one extreme outlier in a mix of regular people advocating for regulation, regulators will subconsciously alter their decision because of the extreme outlier. They take more time considering the issue, which is a plus, because we can't have regulations just willy nilly. The regular people will make sure that the regulator will not dismiss the idea, but combined with the outlier it will make sure that if regulation comes, that it will be more considered.

But that's why the open system will win. You said it yourself, people care more about convenience. Why did the real internet win against AOL's version? Because a closed system does not allow for permissionless innovation. Thus, the products of the closed internet turned out to be inferior over time, making it more convenient to use the real internet. 
I've been watching the bitcoin space for awhile and the number of ideas and products have exploded in such a manner that it's been simply mindboggling. No proprietary system could possibly compete against that. From what I've witnessed, every closed system has eventually failed against the open model. Now we even see Apple being forced to loosen up IOS restrictions with their latest IOS 8.0, because it's starting to feel the pressure of Android. 
And every proposal I've heard to copy blockchain technology by governments turns out to be proprietary models. Governments do not want open systems, because they sacrifice control.

Fiat means by (government) decree. It's latin for "let it be done". 
Anti bitcoiners try to mangle that definition by saying that bitcoin is still by decree, just not by government, but by users. That's mental gymnastics to twist a definition in order to suit their purposes. A dishonest marketing practice IMO. Fiat has turned into a slang/curse word among some circles and anti bitcoiners try to capitalize on the negative connotation that word carries. So they try to push bitcoin into that category, trying to market it as fiat.
The entire point of calling paper money fiat, is to distinguish that its value has been forced from a top down perspective, instead of bottomup like gold (=market driven). It's to indicate that fiat is a result of market manipulation. Economics tends to frown heavily on market manipulation and believes it never has a good outcome.
If bitcoin is determined by the users, its value is thus determined by the market itself. It makes no sense then to call it fiat, because the main characteristic of fiat is its heavy top down approach. 
Bitcoin has legitimate weaknesses and there's no need for dishonest tactics to question its viability. But no, people simply can't help themselves.

Let's not be disingenuous here, ok? The entire point of the internet is its decentralized concept. So your focus on "heavily" is a bit exaggerated.
It's true however that there is a centralized aspect to the internet. But this is true for a lot of decentralized systems. If we study biology, there are a lot of examples of decentralized systems there, but no matter how decentralized the concept is, there's always a centralized aspect to the system. No matter how decentralized the concept is, it's difficult to escape some level of centralization.

Ok, good thing you found those references. Context is incredibly important and these vids demonstrate that.
Let's take Amir Taaki's point for example. From the sound of it, he seems to be saying that transaction fees are higher than Visa and Mastercard, something we know is not true. However, if you were around the reddit forums around the time that video came out, there was an issue with how people complained about needing to buy bitcoin on exchanges and sell them again. You were hit with a double premium fee by doing that. Those extra fees would especially be large when you were buying and selling bitcoin on exchanges where the market was not liquid. As well as volatility issues when there was a time lag between buying the bitcoin and buying the product. All these issues were probably in Amir's head when he stated that fees were not lower. He wanted to prevent people from dismissing bitcoin, because of those usability issues. But as markets get more liquid, and bitcoin products come out that will reduce the time lag (as well as volatility reducing overtime), all these issues will resolve themselves.
As for Peter Todd, he's right that decentralized systems are more costly as a whole. But that's not a problem as long as revenue remains high (see my other post in the thread).
One other thing concerning Peter's motives. His priority is decentralization. And with that decentralization comes extra cost. I believe he would prioritize decentralization above transaction fees, since he sees that as bitcoin's strength. He's deliberately trying to push bitcoin in a more decentralized direction and he knows transaction fees might rise as a result. That's why he's downplaying that future scenario where these fees might rise. He wants people to value bitcoin for its decentralization and wants people to keep using it, even if fees might rise.

Probably the best person in the bitcoin space to illustrate the impact that  bitcoin will have. If you watched youtube video concerning bitcoin, a lot of quotes you find in those videos (made by various people, some of them famous) are copies from his explanations. He was the first person to many in the bitcoin space that managed to lay it out in a coherent fashion.

While that may sound logical at first glance, a closer analysis shows it to be in error. Gold can be (almost) infinitely divided in atoms, yet the supply of gold won't increase because of greater divisibility. Similarly, a pizza can be divided in 8 pieces, yet dividing that pizza in 1 million pieces won't suddenly give us enough pizza to cure world hunger.
That a bitcoin can be divided in smaller subunits won't give us more bitcoin. If I give someone a bitcoin (which is 100 million satoshi's) and tomorrow the code is altered to subdivide the bitcoin into even smaller units (let's say 16 digits, instead of the 8 digits we have now), that person will not be richer. He will still have only one bitcoin.

Make the comparison to gold. Gold can be divided in almost infinite atoms, yet doing so won't magically create more gold. The amount of gold will remain the same. Same with bitcoin. Infinitely dividing 21 million btc might yield infinite tokens, but it won't change the fact that adding up those tokens, you will still arrive at 21 million btc.

China will be a major factor for awhile, but I'm foreseeing their power diminishing in the markets regarding the bitcoin price. There are only so many times you can ban btc. After awhile, it will just cease to have any effect and the more likely outcome is that Wallstreet investments will overtake China as the major factor where btc price is concerned. Once Wallstreet steps in, I foresee the US leading the markets again. Atleast until China embraces btc again, where China will probably overtake the lead again.

Apples and oranges. Not designed to work as money. Why even bother bringing it up?


Nitpicking for nitpicking's sake. We simulate DNA through computer models and technically speaking, that fake DNA cannot be said to be equivalent to real DNA. But in practical terms, the simulation provides a useful enough service that in the virtual world it behaves the same way as DNA. As long as it works similarly in practice, this idea of bitcoin being real or not is really missing the point.


As a matter of fact, I foresee bitcoin being used as backing similar to gold. It will not only be like money, it WILL be money at that moment. But I see this in terms of timeframes. I agree that gold will be safer as money and will likely last longer than bitcoin itself, but even gold itself will not stand against the test of time. Permanent value is a MYTH.


Bitcoin has already outdone gold. More than 500% appreciation, remember? Like I said, I see this in terms of timeframes. Where timeframe is concerned, gold and even a different altcoin can certainly obtain dominance. But without considering timeframe, these considerations are meaningless. Big bang or not.

Without context, I can't judge what they meant by saying that. I can already say however that this issue must be looked at from several angles.
One is the human angle. Whenever you have a process where humans are involved, costs increase. Humans need to eat, pay rent. So whenever you can replace humans with software or hardware, you can lower the cost dramatically. Software/hardware doesn't need to eat or pay rent. Has no desires. So eliminating as many humans as possible out of the equation lowers costs dramatically. Bitcoin eliminates many humans out of the equation and has the possibility to eliminate even more middlemen in the future. Many tasks formerly done by humans are now done through bitcoin.
Then there's the centralization/decentralization aspect. A centralized design can perform the same task as the decentralized system with less resources. But as we know, centralized systems have a lot of disadvantages. To alleviate those disadvantages, we are willing to spend more on resources. But this in turn increases the cost. I think this is what Peter Todd has been alluding to. But this point must be seen in a wider context before it can be determined that this will increase transaction fees specifically.
Then there's the competition aspect. The more competition there is, the lower the cost for the consumer. The system has been setup in a way where miners compete with each other. The miner is the human element in the system and the competition ensures that this human element is somewhat contained. Competition ensures that prices don't spiral out of control.
Then there's the revenue aspect. What is important to realize is that it doesn't matter if a system is more expensive. What matters is the cost to the CONSUMER. A system might be more expensive as a whole, but can be setup in a manner where the cost to the consumer is minimal at best. As long as the miner has enough revenue, he can keep the costs low to the consumer. In the current situation, transaction fees are subsidized by the bitcoin adopter. People buy bitcoin from the miner and this revenue allows the bitcoin miner to charge minimal prices for transaction fees. In the future, miners will only have transaction fees as revenue (mining reward will be 0). Transaction fees can remain low in a zero mining reward scenario as long as total number of transactions grows. 
I already spoke about the revenue aspect, but revenue size is affected by the numbers of transaction (which I already spoke of) and the bitcoin price. The price of bitcoin is subjectively determined. If bitcoin prices remain low, it will never be able to scale. Higher transaction fees in order to obtain more revenue is not an option, because  otherwhise bitcoin would not be able to compete with Visa and Mastercard.
Then there's the electricity cost aspect as well. This needs to stay managable or these costs might absorb all of the revenue as well.
As a whole, decentralized systems have higher infrastructure costs. The costs that come on top of those infrastructure costs (the cost to operate the system) are kept to a minimum by having software/hardware handle as much of the tasks as possible. Competition further limits the cost increase of the remaining human element in the system. Some of the cost of the infrastructure is spread among multiple parties, which also lowers the burden on the operators. The system remains sustainable  if costs remain managable (investment costs + electricity costs) and revenue remains high (number of transactions x bitcoin price). This allows transaction fees to remain low.

It's chemical properties are only as important as its practical use as a monetary instrument. If you understand what makes gold valuable (which is its practical application and usecase), there's no need to create a big bang to mimic its function (as impressive as this sounds). All you need is something that works the same as gold IN PRACTICE.
Having said that, in the end it's a simulation of gold. It will not completely replace gold, because bitcoin can imitate gold, but it will never become gold. It can try reaching that ideal, but in the end bitcoin is indeed ones and zeroes and this limitation will result that it can never copy all gold's practical applications in the exact same manner. Gold will still retain some importance due to this. 
But I'm arguing that this doesn't matter in the long run. Copy though bitcoin might be, it has everything it needs to work as money. It doesn't matter if this doesn't last, because there's no such thing as permanent value. All value that exists today is due to circumstance. Even gold's value is not permanent in the long run. The idea of a safe asset that has permanent value is a MYTH. 
And bitcoin has several advantages above gold, because it is ones and zeroes. In that way, gold is limited by its physical nature, where bitcoin is not. Bitcoin can do things gold can't. 
In the end, bitcoin and gold certainly overlap. And I do expect bitcoin to take over some functions of gold overtime. But I'm not expecting a complete replacement. Because as similar as they are, they should be valued by their differences and the different things that they can accomplish in practical terms.

No, they will transfer, but the offline wallet will not notice that it has been transferred. If the transfer is in the blockchain (check blockchain.info), the transfer has happened and that is final.
The point of an offline wallet is to never let it touch the internet in order to enhance security. If you connect the offline wallet to the internet, it should notice that the sum has been transferred, but it would compromise security somewhat. Only do that if you plan to send the money away immediately.

This might be more possible than people think. We are seeing a pattern of fake news coming out of China with relative regularity. This pattern smacks of price manipulation.
I do know that China has been manipulating the gold price as well in order to increase their gold reserves for a cheap price. It might be that they are employing a similar technique with bitcoin. That their actions also happen to protect their own currency is a bonus.
If they are actually doing this, it will be quite a balancing act. Because people buying bitcoin might mean that their own currency might get weaker in return. But they are doing it with gold, why not bitcoin?

Several ways:
* Invest in professional exchanges and have a stake in those exchanges.
* Invest in a bitcoin company (or several companies) that does bank like services. That way, if their old businessmodel ceases to work, they have something to fall back on (though probably less profitable if one does not innovate more in this space). 
* Provide liquidity to exchanges
* Help with the regulatory process
* Connect with the community by going to bitcoin conferences. Useful for networking and they might pick up some new areas where they can provide services.
* Be the firstmover in the bitcoin space and establish oneself as the trusted bank for the community. It's the future and it won't be stopped. Best be proactive in supporting it, since it's coming anyways. Lots of profit will fall to the bank that can manage to win over the community.

"Why do we need the internet? We've got the telecoms and postal mail and they do a better job."
"This internet thing will never work. It's too complicated for people."
It's trivially easy to think up use cases for why we need bitcoin. And even though bitcoin sucks as a currency, even in its halfassed state at the moment there exists use cases. We've got the brightest brains being enthusiastic about bitcoin.

I assume you mean transaction fees. And no, transaction fees do not destroy bitcoin. They go to the miner. After bitcoin production stops in 2140 (or near that number), the miners are expected to continue running the network through transaction fees, instead of the miner reward you get through production. By then the number of transaction fees should be enough to compensate the investment costs miners have for their equipment. The miners are then free to spend these bitcoins and they will return into circulation.

Merchant adoption driving prices down are a real phenomenon IMO. But even if it were not real, it's clear to me that SOME speculators out there believe it to be true and are causing a more extreme price decline than if it were happening naturally.
Anyways, that people are pointing out that merchant adoption is driving prices down does not mean that they are claiming it will go down to zero. Perhaps some trolls really do believe that, but myself I believe that merchants adoption is but one factor and that there are other factors making sure that the price stays maintained. I'm still expecting much higher prices at the end of the year, despite believing that merchant adoption really does drive down prices.

Deflation would be a longterm solution, but probably too late to help the debtors in their current predicament. Frankly speaking, I think they are well and truly %@
Regarding money printing being a political problem, I find that remark relatively amusing. Since central banks have claimed that they were outside of politics. Central banks have regularly been accused of engaging in politics and denied that this was the case, but you have clearly identified that this is simply not true (I agree). 
But how do you suppose that inflationary currency comes into existence? Because it's CREATED (printed, lent into existence or punched into a computer terminal). If we have FED presidents admitting that money printing helps the wealthy, that does indeed put into a new light wether longterm inflation increases income inequality.
But I digress. I only wanted to prove that FED people did indeed say that money printing boosted income inequality. The Dallas FED president himself stated this on bloombergtv if you read the article.
Regarding the gold standard not always being deflationary, I agree. But people tend to point towards the gold standard when talking about deflation and the data seems to say that we had good growth even in the periods when deflation occurred:
Ignore the flashy headline and particularly pay attention to the paragraph concerning the 2004 study.
Regarding liquidity being good, it tends to be good when the liquidity comes from honest money. That means value for value, instead of creating money out of thin air. When there's no real cost associated with money creation, that money creation will cause price distortions and corrupted signals. And this can go well for quite some time. The process takes decades to unfold (on average 3 decades for a fiat currency). We are now probably at the very end of that unfolding.
And SOME traders can do well under volatility. Not all. But from the articles I've read, these price shocks did not really have that much of an impact. But if you have links concerning this, post them away.
And I'm mostly talking about the FED and the entire history of its existence, including the time where they co existed together with the gold standard. One of the mandates of the FED was to ensure price stability and prevent crises. I've seen data where they failed all of their mandates. But can't seem to find a link for now. Perhaps tomorrow. I'm off to sleep. Was an interesting discussion btw. Thanks for the interest.

Beanie Babies and Pogs failed, because the utility they provided was vastly limited in scope. And the little utility they did provide could easily be had elsewhere (no scarcity of service). Bitcoin as a technology can do things that the current system simply can't. The services itself that bitcoin provides are scarce items, not just the bitcoin itself. You simply can't do the things you can do with bitcoin with other systems (not yet atleast).
And it's true that they don't care about the scarcity. Only a handful care and know the implications of what scarcity implies. But even so, the real world effect of a scarce item is that it will appreciate over time, regardless if people know about it or not. When general prices rise, they don't immediately make the connection with the increasing money supply in daily life, but the connection exists nonetheless. Deflation was normal during the days of the gold standard. But now inflation is the norm. If people had actual free will, like you implied, a supposed change in scarcity scheme would have no effect on the worth of a coin, but it seems it does.
If an item is scarce, it will have real world effects on the price of that item, regardless if an individual knows the item is scarce or not. People might think they have free will and THINK that they themselves decide if they should pay more or not. But herd behaviour determines most of these actions. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that they do have free will, but a change in a scarcity scheme herds people in a certain direction, allowing them to experience a certain situation more often than what would otherwise happen, influencing their decisions, upping the chance that certain decisions are made more often than not.


I'm not going to reply to each of your earlier posts, but you seem to think that the arbitrary scarcity is somehow a necessity to the function when it isn't. Dogecoins have no limit and yet they could potentially work the same, all that's missing is a merchant and DogePay.
A savings account nowadays doesn't really help against inflation. You are losing money by keeping it in a bank.
As for dogecoin, I did mention that systems based on inflation can work. Never said that this was impossible. But for bitcoin, it certainly helps for adoption if it is deflationary. And the limit is especially important if one considers what problem it solves. CENTRAL BANKS and CONSUMERISM. These institutions are simply corruption engines with very little oversight. And inflation encourages consumerism, a behaviour that's a blight on society. The current inflation scheme has no mechanism to combat this toxic behaviour.


But that's the point. The bitcoin system can simply do things other systems can't. Even the altcoins can't really compete, because they don't have an army of developers working on them or the infrastructure that bitcoin has. Even if a superior altcoin arrives (which could possibly be Ethereum), network effects are incredibly sticky. What would most likely happen is that the bitcoin infrastructure would first be fully developed and only when bitcoin is mature, would most devs switch over their resources to a superior altcoin. It's only when bitcoin makes a serious mistake that a network effect could be destroyed.

6 must see classics on bitcoin:
Andreas Antonopolous is the best at giving the big picture. I recommend searching his other youtube video's. He's the number one person you should look into. He has recently finished his book Mastering Bitcoin as well. He's hosting a show together with Adam B. Levine (host) and Stephanie Murphy named Letstalkbitcoin. Is the number one podcast on bitcoin (IMO).
Erik Voorhees is the best person to explain it from the money perspective. 
 
Trace Meyer was an early proponent as well and argues it more from the law and accounting perspective. 
Wences Casares has the best explanation of the historical function of money and how bitcoin fits that history.
Naval Ravikant looks at it from a VC and open source perspective.
Balaji Srinivasan is with Naval in this session and adds some insights as well.
Peter Surda and Konrad Graf look at it from the economic perspective. Highly recommend them. Daniel Krawisz is good as well, though I tend to think he's a bit too sure of himself.
Roger Ver is a well known evangelist and is called bitcoin Jesus.
The best lecture series on bitcoin by James D'Angelo:
For other insights, look up interviews and writings of Marc Andreessen. Barry Silbert is a major name in bitcoin as well.
For the programming aspects, go to core developers and look up their bitcointalk and reddit posts:
Nick Szabo and Adam Back for added insights on developement. Adam Back is working on sidechains at the moment and he invented a precursor to bitcoin named hashcash.
Peter Todd has the most interesting outside perspective on the code. He has an idea similar to sidechains called treechains.
3 major companies in bitcoin are Bitpay, Coinbase and Circle.
Twobitidiot (Ryan Selkis) is a good guy to follow on twitter for info on bitcoin.
For philosophical and anarchist insights, I recommend Chris Ellis and Kristov Atlas.
Major alternative blockchain mind is Vitalik Buterin. Highly intelligent and technical.
Bryce Weiner for altcoin insights if you want to look into that as well.

I think the article makes a very good point. This has been on my mind ever since I learned how exactly the bitcoin price is influenced: 
Basically, markets are less influenced by consumers than people realize. In the beginning, there will always be 0 demand for new innovations. For a market to grow (atleast in the beginning stages), you need to convince the whales to participate, not the consumers. Because the whales first realize the implications and once you have them onboard, they can create the demand where no demand exists by utilizing their own resources. It's less bottom up than people realize. 
From my own perspective, markets are basically a battleground with evolutionary forces at play. Competition drives out the weaker participants and the more efficient ones tend to survive. Bitcoin is the ultimate tool of trade. For that tool to be optimally used, you need people that are heavily engaged in trade and understand how trade works. That tends to be businesses and merchants. There's no better example of the superiority of bitcoin when you have businesses driving out other companies out of business, because they had a businessmodel based on bitcoin. Once that happens, bitcoin being adopted by consumers is only a matter of time. Because when the world of trade adopts bitcoin, there will be a very large group of advocates (companies, merchants) with actual resources behind bitcoin. In my mind, having these companies and merchants behind bitcoin and spreading its use will have more impact on the perception of bitcoin than trying to go directly to the consumer. Because they have the greater leverage. They tend to have more power in practice than regular consumers.
Make no mistake, consumers are also important. And one day we will need products that succeed by word of mouth. By essentially going viral. Work does need to continue on these products. But we need b2b products as well. And I think the case is easier made there, because companies actually measure their own performance and can see the impact. If we compare companies and consumers, I think companies have better incentives to make use of bitcoin than consumers. Because companies are more immersed in the world of trade than consumers. They are incentive compatible with bitcoin. And we all know the importance of incentives.

Abstractness or the fact that bitcoin has no industrial use is of no matter. Only pure pracicality is relevant. Its USECASE. 
If gold collapsed back to its industrial use price, most of its value would dissappear overnight. Most of gold's value is due to its monetary properties. While goldbugs would tell you that the industrial use makes sure that gold has value and thus guarantees that it keeps value, if all of gold's value collapsed back to its industrial price (whereby all monetary value bleeds out of the price), the goldmarket would crash and goldbugs would start breaking their necks selling gold. It would destroy the gold market for a considerable amount of time.
In the end, gold is not precious, because it's beautiful or because of its industrial use, it's precious because people have the expectation that people will pay the same price today (due to its monetary properties) as they did yesterday. This is the practical usecase of gold and what makes gold valuable. 
The above usecase can be artificially recreated with bitcoin. The abstractness is irrelevant. What matters is if the usecase is the same as gold in PRACTICAL terms. 
People think that gold is eternal, because its scarcity is determined by physics. And physical laws are hard to change, while bitcoin's scarcity is artificial and thus cannot last. This is the wrong way to look at it. Smart people realize that NOTHING is eternal and that there are no foolproof assets. They see everything as probabilistic. It's purely circumstance that determines value. Water might be a precious resource in the desert, but useless to you when swimming in a sweetwater river, where it is abundant. Tomorrow, a gold asteroid might crash on earth, forever destroying the goldmarket. In recent news, they discovered a white dwarf in space that mostly consist of diamond. If humanity ever managed to salvage that resource, take a wild guess what happens with the price of diamonds, eh? In the end, our reality works in probabilistic terms. All that matters is that bitcoin is constructed in such a way, where its scarcity can be maintained for a long period of time. It doesn't matter if this is only temporary, since all value is temporary anyways. The idea of a safe asset is a MYTH. 
Anyways, gold itself is mostly used as an asset to hold on as an investment, but it has managed to maintain value regardless. This idea that bitcoin needs transactions to succeed is a nice meme, but it's wrong.

Actually, I think both deflation and inflation can be good depending on the circumstance. The problem is that no human reacts the same way to either deflation or inflation. Both deflation or inflation can lead humans to spending decisions that are sub optimal over the long run.
One of the reasons I'm in support of deflation at the moment, is that I'm seeing clear signs that we are nearing the limits of what inflation can give us. The negatives are starting to overtake the benefits. And make no mistake, I don't deny that there are benefits to inflation. But the mistake is to believe that only benefits exist and that the relation between benefits and detriments is a static state of affairs that does not change over time.

Law is one of the most important ones. The government has a monopoly on justice. And those laws keep getting more complicated overtime. As a result, we are seeing the same thing we are seeing with every other monopoly. The services it provides keep getting more expensive overtime, with the quality declining. As well as civil rights getting weaker and weaker, with the law favouring the organization that has the monopoly on it.
The most important laws in society are the regulations that govern money. Because money is the root energy that fuels all other activities concerning society. As a matter of fact, because the government has a monopoly on money as well, the size and scope of government has increased to a size not possible before the advent of central banking. Civil rights suffer as a result.
With bitcoin, for the first time regulations and law governing money can be baked into the code, instead of relying on government regulation. As a result, the power to govern the flows of money can be given back to consumers, breaking open the government monopoly. In time, blockchain technology will allow for other types of regulation that may even go beyond the scope of money itself.

You are comparing apples and oranges. To achieve something with gold, you indeed need a certain amount of it. How much gold do you need? That depends on the item you want to buy. If the item costs 10 dollars, you need 10 dollars worth of gold. To make the comparison to bitcoin, you need to assume that the bitcoin is used to buy the exact same amount (10 dollars worth).

Internet infrastructure being taken down is one thing I already have taken into account. And indeed, I'm foreseeing a future where such a scenario can be possible for the first time since the internet's inception. IMO, we are on the brink of WW3 (hope to be wrong on this). 
However, I'm seeing some very promising technologies out there that can circumvent a complete takedown (mesh networks, Jeff Garzik's sattelites, etc). If a complete takedown occurs, it will only spur the further developement of these technologies. It might be bad for the bitcoin price on the short term though.

You make a good point and these things should be taken into consideration as well for any detailed analysis. 
But consider this thought experiment. Would bitcoin have gone off the ground without the mining reward? My initial conclusion is NO. The mining reward is that important, even considering all the other factors. 
Now, the way that Satoshi envisioned it is that the mining reward should eventually be replaced by the transaction fees overtime. In the beginning, there will be more mining reward than transaction fee and the income for miners will be heavily weighted towards the mining reward. But the mining reward gets halved every four years and if everything goes as planned, the transaction volume should have increased by then to generate more transaction fees in order to cover the investment costs for the mining equipment. In other words, the system was designed in way where transaction fees were MEANT to replace the mining reward. But the only way that scenario is possible, is if the transaction volume rises just like Satoshi envisioned it. That transaction fees rise is not an option, otherwhise there will be no improvement over the old system.
The above is also the reason why he went with a deflationary scheme. Only a deflationary sheme  would have given the early adopter an incentive to obtain bitcoin and transact. It wasn't just ideology that moved him to go with such a scheme.
Now mind you, these were the early plans of Satoshi. Like you said, the technology keeps improving and costs keep changing. But keep in mind that the only two known income streams for miners are sales of bitcoin (generated through the mining reward) and transaction fees in the current setup. We know that one of those income streams is programmed to dry up in the future. It doesn't matter how all the other factors change, unless one of those factors can generate a new income stream for the miners.

Umm, did you miss the part about the bitcoin protocol being engraved into metal? Hardware wallets WILL become prevalent, because they are one of the solutions to the security problem. This is where the problem starts.
And looking at the current internet, we now realize that it was a mistake to have no anonymity features included in its design. Yet, why is nobody altering TCP/IP or the other protocols to include it? They can't. It would lead to massive compatibility problems to include it now. It would be better to redesign the internet from scratch than trying to upgrade the current protocols. This is what many devs are trying to do at the moment.

In the meantime, bitcoin will be an interesting experiment to see how robust current economic theory is.

Ah, but now you are putting words in my mouth. I never recommended bitcoin as a retirement vehicle. Do I believe that bitcoin can be a store of value over some time period?

"Many people" is rather relative. You can rather call it a minority. 
And I do think that economists do indeed discuss things between themselves. But they tend to discuss the new areas of their field, not the old areas. And the problem is that new areas are understood in the context of how they understand the old areas. This is unescapable, because we as humans are limited and we are somewhat forced to trust the work of our predecessors due to the overflowing amount of information that's out there. We do not really examine the veracity of their work due to time constraints. And this happens in other areas than economics.
Just look at this particular article:
What's described in that article is simply how long something can remain unresolved, because we implicitely trust the work of our predecessors. It's mindboggling to think that something like this is possible in the modern age, but this is simply the weakness of our approach. 
And the thing is, those people actually had access to the scientific method. The economic profession does not. The problem should in theory be even more rampant where economics is concerned.

My guess is that it's a combination of technical analysis (TA) and the paypal news. Normally, news doesn't really affect the price (sentiment does), but if we look at TA, we were very close to the bottom anyways. The price was staying stable at 400 dollars with no indication of it being pressured downwards. Sentiment was neutral at that point. The paypal news ultimately decided and pushed towards positive sentiment.
Anyways, had the news come out while sentiment was negative, I pretty much doubt the paypal news would have had any effect. It's just that the timing coincided nicely with TA.

- Introducing the first viable online voting system based on bitcoin technology (considered impossible by most computer scientists, due to the risks involved) thereby eliminating voter fraud.
 
- Illustrate how bitcoin gives you access to not just an alternative payment system, but also an alternative economy that operates under different rules than one based on inflation.
- Some people also tend to think that bitcoin is a zero sum game. You must convince them that this is wrong. Use an example like this: Suppose an economy has 1000 euros of papermoney and coins. And you introduce the computer for the first time. The computer will have no worth in the beginning, since new inventions will be worth 0 when they first come out. Eventually, the computer is valued at 100 euros based on the utility and usefulness of this new product. What is the size of the total economy? Answer is 1100 euro's. New products and inventions INCREASE the size of the economy. They are not zero sum games where euro's are converted into btc. There will still be 1000 euro's of paper money and coins, but with the added value of the new asset.

Bitcoin is created from thin air by the bitcoin software as a reward for the miners. It's magicked up. The miners have the important task of verifying transactions, but no person will do these tasks without some kind of reward. So the system is designed to reward the miners with bitcoins.
Basically, one computer is picked from many that is allowed to add a block (set of transactions) to the blockchain ledger. The computer that gets picked is rewarded with bitcoins by the software he's running. But he will only have that reward for sure if the network (other computers running similar software) agrees as well. 
Of course, there is a danger when money can be magicked up from thin air. That's why there are severe restraints placed on the system in order to ensure that bitcoin remain scarce. The mining scheme is basically a virtual simulation of gold, which is the number one scarce hard commodity known in the market. Just like how it's getting harder to mine gold each year, it's getting increasingly difficult to obtain bitcoin. Because the scarcity of gold/bitcoin increases each year, the price of gold/bitcoin tends to increase overtime. Or atleast, this is supposed to be the idea for bitcoin.

This is essentially the same as throwing money out of a helicopter. This doesn't tend to work, because it's inflationary.

This. In order to control society, you must enforce a monopoly at any cost. No tyrant in their right mind would have gone with an open source ownerless scheme. Because such a system can easily be copied by a competitor where any nefarious aspects can be stripped away. And of course, the competitor would win. Because consumers choose the product that is in their best interest. That's why monopolists are against choice to begin with.
Essentially, just like how the printing press gave the common man the power to distribute knowledge, bitcoin gives the common man the ability to produce currency. In the past, these powers were in the province of monarchs and kings only. Technologies like the printing press and bitcoin breaks open that monopoly.

The nice thing about laws based on math, is that there's no force involved. Once you enter an agreement established through programmable money, mathematics takes over the rest. Enforcement is done through code and no longer through police force. 
The problem with government regulations is the centralized nature of it. If it happens to be wrong, the entire population suffers. And once a law is on the books, it makes it hard to pinpoint the exact inefficiency, seeing as how they keep increasing overtime. There's also the problem that laws are ambiguous in interpretation, where one judge interprets it one way and another judge interprets it a different way. With mathematical law, there's no such thing. Interpretation is singular and deterministic. Even if the ruleset has a flaw, the flaw itself is deterministic in nature as well, making it infinitely more solvable than the way governement regulation operates.
With programmable money, experimentation is possible for the first time where the most efficient regulation can be pinpointed. And the user itself can decide if these rules are favourable. If one doesn't like the regulation, the user simply opts out of the contract and chooses a contract with more favourable regulations. Market forces will eventually decide the most efficient rule set.

The contracts are enforced by math. It's through software. You can create rules/regulation in the form of software and let the blockchain decide to accept a transaction based on those math rules. If this is done well, most of the court system will eventually be replaced by a blockchain based system.
Of course, this is the longterm view. I imagine that the first iterations of these new mathbased rules, the court system will still be called upon, because the rules will not be optimized yet. But on further iterations and improvements, I expect that most regulations will eventually be taken over by software.

You have to understand that people see bitcoin as something that develops in stages. Currency is one of the last stages to occur. Bitcoin is still behaving as a mix between a commodity and a currency at the moment.
And I think BTC is a once in a lifetime investment opportunity, because it still in this hybrid commodity/currency phase. The reason fiat currencies of today are hardly seen as investment vehicles, is because the marketcap of those currencies have already reached saturation points. Trying to invest in something that has little room for growth and can easily swing the other way is incredibly risky.
Bitcoin on the other hand is only at the beginning of its lifecycle. Its users are probably only around a million. It has ALOT of room left for growth. It only started appearing in the news until very recently. If more users use bitcoin, the eventual outcome is that the marketcap MUST grow accordingly. If the bitcoin marketcap grows considerably, bitcoin will start behaving more like a currency instead of a commodity.
There's also one other aspect that make people confident in bitcoin. Bitcoin has all the properties of gold and gold is a trillion dollar market where the commodity itself is hardly ever moved at all. It just gathers dust in vaults of large countires. Bitcoin doesn't have to succeed as a currency. People often make that mistake. Bitcoin can succeed as an alternative to gold alone. 
However, IMO if it succeeds as an alternative to gold, its eventual success as a currency is but a matter of time. The only reason gold is not a currency today, is because state powers have been suppressing its function as money in favor of the printing presses. But states will have a hard time suppressing bitcoin.

That would be relatively secure (on average), but a dedicated hacker (especially if funded by a government) would find a loophole regardless. Unless you dig into the OS code line by line or have your hardware analysed for backdoors, you can never be sure that a hacker hasn't somehow compromised these. 
For instance, where did you get the OS to begin with? How can you be sure that this is the genuine article and not a modified version a hacker slipped to you? You may have bought it from a store, but who says that that store hasn't been compromised? Or maybe the hacker knew you were going to that store and slipped you a different copy through sheer sleight of hand. Same questions for the hardware side .
There are even some contraptions where they can inject some information to your online network, compromising the regular controls of how your internet works. The NSA uses this kind of equipment.
Bottomline, the only way to be sure that you have absolute security, is if you followed every piece of software or equipment you used from beginnning (during production) to end. Most of us can't and won't go that far. We are forced to trust the reputation of those we deal with. And then even if that trust is warranted, there are enough attack angles where they can compromise the security.

Smart man. I think the bitcoin foundation took on a necessary, thankless job. And I do believe that centralized organizations are more efficient than decentralized ones on the short term. So they were probably crucial to the early acceleration of bitcoin. 
But things are changing at an extremely accelerated pace right now. And bitcoin is a potential trillion dollar industry, so there are large incentives that could lead to corruption. From here it's only downhill for the foundation. You need someone capable of making enemies to turn that ship around and I don't see that happening any time soon.

If we go by the above links, the FED seems to be mostly private to me. But it's also unquestionably true that the FED has close connections to the government. So close in fact, that they are almost one and the same. This leads me to conclude that the FED has simply transcended the idea of federal and private. It's an entirely new beast.  It's a mistake to try to categorize the FED into a box.
The issue of the FED being private or not seems to me besides the point. Anti-FED people tried to argue this so strongly that they lost sight of what really matters. Because they tried to argue this point so strongly, they got easily waylaid with facts like yours. They set themselves up to be stonewalled.
Why was it so important for them to label the FED as private? It was to show the conflict of interest. I would argue that we don't need to label the FED as private to show that this is the case.
That the FED managed to convince the courts that it was a private entity already shows that that there's something here that doesn't pass the smell test. They did that to circumvent an information request. Information requests are one of the checks and balances on government entities. Yet the FED has close ties to the government as being almost one and the same. What does this tell you? It tells you that the government has determined that the banks should be outside of democratic control. It essentially operates outside of any checks and balances. Looking at it this way, it becomes pointless to label the FED private or federal, because it's in bed with the government and the government is protecting them. What matters here is the conflict of interest between these entities and us.

My theory:
To clarify, when whales want to buy bitcoin, they want to make sure they either affect prices as minimally as possible or cause as large of an uptrend as possible. The second scenario  occurs when whales believe that other whales believe that the time has come to make that happen and that causing an uptrend has the best chance of happening.
When will whales believe that causing an uptrend will have the least chance of failing? When the infrastructure is more robust. What a whale doesn't want is investing his money, only for an exchange to crash shortly after, because they couldn't handle the volume. The price crash that happens because of that could result in massive losses for a whale. So they'll wait until the last possible moment until they are sure to make the maximum amount of profit. And that's when the current exchanges improve their security and stability and when more reliable exchanges come to market. Because the exchanges are the major roads of the bitcoin infrastructure. The more roads the infrastructure has, the more btc can flow, the more the prices rise.
Whales usually only pay attention to good news if they occur for the first time. Because human psychology tends to put more importance on milestones. Whales recognize this trait in themselves and in other people. So that's why people state that information is already built into the price and why good news rarely affect the price (also a sign that current small players are tapped out and that new players have not yet decided to dip their toes into the waters). The only news that directly affects the price, is news directly pertaining to liquidity. And liquidity is usually provided by infrastructure. Any news that makes sure that liquidity WILL be affected (either now or in the future) will have an immediate effect on the price.

Also, because of volatility risks. Businesses usually borrow money in order to set themselves up and they have an obligation to pay their debts. It would be irresponsible of them to have money in bitcoin. It might be that when it's time to pay the bills, they might run into a liquidity problem, because the bitcoin price crashed at the exact moment they needed to pay their bills.
This will turn around when more businesses accept bitcoin. The risk of retaining some profits in bitcoin will diminish in such an event.

My take on good news: 
As for the constant selling pressure, I consider this normal. There will be times when the selling pressure will be stronger than the buying pressure. This case is no different. No currency or stock will ever go in a straight line.
Also, remember this well. People are under some kind of delusion that the market is determined by regular joes having to accept btc. This is simply wrong. Even if no new users were stepping into btc at this moment, btc would still continue to rise. All you need is a group of believers trading between themselves in order to drive prices up. But even in this case, prices will not go up in a straight line, because they are limited by their salaries.  
Furthermore, runups are usually dictated by people with leverage, not by regular people. The people with leverage (whales) buy or sell in large amounts inducing others to jump on the bandwagon. Simply spoken, the people with leverage dictate the direction of the market. They essentially control the market. Regular joe does not have a say. Of course, there may be rare cases where regular people can overwhelm the leverage of the whales, but these are but rare instances, mostly reserved for panics. In practice however, we are at the mercy of what the whale decides to do. If we are really in a bear market, there must be a reason where whales have no faith in the current situation. I really see no indication of this. From everything I've read, they seem to be gathering firepower to lead a new runup.

If you don't need the money immediately DO NOT SELL. EVER. Only sell if you actually need to pay the bills (and perhaps a small buffer for emergencies). Crises like these are expected and will happen quite often in the future. Growth will not come without obstacles coming along the way.
The only strategy that will ever win in the long term IMO, is to buy and never sell. Because while short term gain or loss cannot be predicted, larger trends can more easily be foreseen. Bitcoin will eventually prevail.
Daytrading is a losing proposition, unless you have enough money to burn and the brains to learn from your experiments with daytrading.

Yes, there have been some suggestions on ways to prune the blockchain, though I don't know the exact details of it. I do know however, that it's not important that the average consumer has the disk space. What's important is that the consumer can obtain a copy of the blockchain, should they wish it. 
The people that will actually run the network (the miners) will have a large incentive to invest in disk space and it will be part of their operational cost. They should be able to easily invest in disk space considering how one guy makes 8 million dollars every month running mining equipment.
In short, the disk space requirement might be onerous for the average consumer, but not for the miner.

Just to play devil's advocate, bitcoin is indeed mumbo jumbo for the average consumer. But the average consumer has a short attention span and is rather limited, plain and simple. I think the interviewer was a bit rough in his questioning, but from a consumer standpoint he was correct.
The way you would answer this, is that the average consumer is not expected to be able to understand bitcoin. Does the average consumer understand how cars or the internet work in exact detail? No. How did these consumers eventually used these technologies, despite not understanding them? Because there were people before them that DID bother to understand how everything worked and joined the network effect. Eventually, the system and network effect got large enough that even regular consumers could use those technologies with very limited or no understanding of how they worked. 
And his question about bitcoin not being transparent can be answered the same way. Yeah, for regular consumers that rely on news networks, bitcoin is not transparent. But for people that grew up in the internet era and firmly live in that era, there's more information than ever.
Bottomline, the consumer that is clueless about bitcoin and doesn't bother to look into bitcoin will be the last to step into bitcoin. They will never be able to understand bitcoin, because they never bothered to do so, nor is it really needed. The next wave of adoption won't come from these consumers, but from the more knowledgeable ones. Interviewers always look at this in a limited way where a product must appeal immediately to consumers. Yeah, a mature technology would need to. But for now, bitcoin needs to grow organically before reaching for those types of consumers.

The video gave an important reason why the 21 million might not hold.
As you know, transaction costs can stay low at the moment, because miners are getting a mining reward and they are also getting subsidized by early adopters buying the bitcoin. But the mining reward keeps dropping every four years. The only way this system stays sustainable, is if the number of transactions can grow faster than the mining reward drops.
This is the only scenario where I consider there to be enough consensus to propose an alteration to the 21 million limit. 
I don't expect this to be a problem down the road, though.

While technically true, he wanted to emphasize that the invention behind bitcoin (the blockchain) will have similar results as when the printing press came out. There's a certain theme in society where technology gives the masses the ability to do things, that only the most powerful people in the past could do (kings, banks, governments). This is arguably a more powerful vision to portray than to explain the pesky details of mining. 
Because while it may not be precisely true in the present where security is concerned, it will likely turn out to be true in the future. Eventually, software to create your own currency will become so sophisticated that  the analogy to the printing presses will become even closer in comparison. That this scenario is not here today is not important IMO. The idea itself is important. I think Andreas handled things okay. Better to let the senators see the larger picture. That he prioritized this larger vision instead of the exact details managed to convince the senators of the importance of bitcoin and made them extra hesitant to rush to regulation.

I would take a look at the numbers posted by Bitpay, Coinbase and blockchain.info. Especially blockchain.info, since this site has metrics concerning bitcoin in general. Because bitcoin is a public ledger and is code based, it's easy to obtain these metrics through code as well. 
From interviews I've seen with the above representatives of these companies, there is a growing trend. I believe Overstock said that the userspace was growing 10% monthly. Bitcoin meetups have seen an explosion of growth from a couple of people to in the hundreds. Some of these meetups are almost over a thousand members. As for bitcoin projects and companies, people involved in the space claim the energy in the air is similar to when the internet first started. This is stated by Marc Andreessen as well.
Right now, ballpark estimates are around 5 million btc users.

Good news tends to only be positive on the price when it sets a new milestone or if it is a constant stream of good news where it must be clear that demand and liquidity have been significantly improved. I say the current news doesn't fall into those categories. It's news that has been within expectations, so that information is already in the price.
And humans are hardwired to bad news over good news. They get used to good news pretty quickly, but they never get used to bad news. Probably a trait developed by evolution.

If taxes were enough to pay for wars, they would not have needed to go off the gold standard. Historically, they always temporarily needed to go off the gold standard in order to fund a war. Taxes are simply inadequate to pay for wars.
And even if the wars were just and inflation was kept at a minimum, there's simply too much moral hazard in the concept of printing. The money that comes from the printing press is given as welfare to the very powerful. It feeds the dynamic where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer in comparison. Under such a scheme, only massive corruption can exist. 9 trillion dollars missing from the FED is just one such example. And they don't want to tell us what they did with it. No institution that's resisting an audit can possibly be doing something that can withstand the daylight.

I think transparency can work, but it will have to be a similar system as how they made the proof of reserves work. With that system the information of wether they passed the reserve requirements was made public by code, but not the exact numbers. The exact numbers were hidden for competitive reasons.
Similarly, it is possible to hide the exact details of the vote (wether they voted nay or yay), but make the general outline public (like a mathematical way to see if Gilen's flatline applied to them). That way it is not possible to extort them on details, because the public/lobbyists doesn't know the details. Yet the public can see wether congress is functioning through a general outline. Make the general outline transparent, but hide the exact details. I think proof of reserves showed that such a system was possible.

I agree somewhat that nations have the power to create a network effect out of nowhere through sheer legislative power. Some bitcoiners are naive where government power is concerned. They have done it in the past and they can do it again.
However, bitcoin will outcompete national currencies not only because it has efficiency advantages (this sheer point is argument enough), and not only because it is an open system (AOL's centralized closed "internet" lost against the real internet), but because it is deflationary in nature. Throwing a deflationary currency in a mix of inflationary currencies will result that the deflationary currency will act as a black hole swallowing all the wealth up in the world. Formerly gold was the main deflationary currency, but it was defeated through sheer legislative power and by establishing a worldwide fiat monopoly. The architecture of bitcoin makes it VERY difficult to do the same with it as they have done with gold.
Of course, this process will be protracted and slow and several conditions must first be cleared before it can actually occur (like volatility decreasing for an extended period of time). It will probably take several decades. Anyone expecting national currencies to dissappear overnight is dreaming. As a matter of fact, it is likely that government currency will still continue to exist, but they will have to let go of the inflationary model in order to compete.
And governments certainly are capable of innovating themselves. They will likely still find a way to control some part of bitcoin. But just like the internet didn't immediately solve all the world's problems, but managed to set the bar higher, bitcoin will make it more difficult for governments to exercise their power in a nefarious way. That is good enough.

I think engaging the community is a good thing. But some of these requirements sound over the top. I just hope that they will be sensible about this and enforce with a light hand. Because nazi enforcement will eventually force this technology (including mixer technology) to a more decentralized, ownerless design. Once the software has no central point of failure and can run autonomously without humans to arrest, all bets are off.
Bottomline, regulators should choose engagement first, before taking extreme actions. Forcing the technology to be autonomous is shooting yourselves in the foot. This will happen anyways, but atleast the people during the transition will harbor less ill will and thus there will be less potential for crime.

Basically anything that involves a trade between two people that requires trust (which would be almost all of commerce) can be done with bitcoin's system. Stocks, bonds, property, all of these usually required a middle man and these middle men charge exorbitant fees for those services. Not to mention that the very existence of those middle men is a possible source of corruption (=weak point) in our current system. Replace the middle man with bitcoin and not only do you save fees, you also have bitcoin do all the tasks of the middle man but without the corruption. Just look at how the banks have sold products to their clients, while they have been betting against their own clients knowing that they would fail.
Also, because bitcoin is a protocol, you can build applications on top allowing for permissionless innovation, similar to the internet. This aspect of programmable money can eventually replace regulation as well as introduce new types of services. The problem with regulation is that it is usually a one size fits all solution, where nuance is necessary. Not to mention that regulators usually don't see how their regulations may have adverse negative effects. Before these effects kick in, they may already be out of office. That's why regulation usually introduces more problems than it solves. Also, regulation usually require humans that enforce the regulation as well as humans to allow oneself to comply with those regulations. This only adds unnecessary costs. Replace regulation with programmable money and you can do enforcement and compliance in one go, but without requiring the extra burden of paying humans to perform these functions. And you can experiment with the most efficient rules for optimal performance.

Personally, I think that report was real as well. But determined that it didn't matter in the long run for three reasons:
1. It matters not what reality is, it only matters what people believe. That belief becomes the new reality. Regardless of what caused the price rise, it led to new early adopters. And from what I've seen, these adopters are still around supporting the price. Other investors reason in a similar manner as myself. They probably know that there's a good chance that the Willy bot was fake, but they as well can see that it has led to a growth of early adopters.
Of course, sometimes reality turns out to be more important than belief, which brings me to my following point:
2. I see only one scenario where the Willy bot being fake would really be a factor in a future price crash. And that's if bitcoin had no "intrinsic value". Mind you, I'm of the mindset that there's no such thing as intrinsic value (a contradiction in terms IMO). But for brevity's sake, I'll use the term nonetheless. From any angle I look at bitcoin, it seems obvious to me that there's value here. As long as there really is  intrinsic value, it would have only been a matter of time before there would occur a price rise.
3. Some have argued (convincingly in my mind) that the subsequent crash of Mt.Gox has already wiped out the manipulation and price rise of the Willy bot. Now the market didn't know Willy was active at the time, but that doesn't really matter, since the price crashed back to a point in time where growth was relatively normal (to a price point before the Willy manipulation). In other words, the correction has already occurred.

Ok, that's great. 
Now, if bitcoin was just scarce in itself and that was its only selling point, it could never be the successor of gold. Gold was determined by the market as the best form of money in the past. If you came with something that wasn't better, people would just stick with gold. Why even bother with bitcoin?
Bitcoin is far more divisible than gold. You can divide a bitcoin up to 8 digits, where the smallest digit (one hundred millionth of a btc) is called a satoshi. But the beauty of this system is that you can change this and make the denominations even smaller if so desired. This avoids some problems like with the great depression. During the great depression, deflation was considered a major problem. It's not practical for old money to have denominations smaller than 1 cent. So instead, the central banks print more money to escape deflation. With a system such as that of bitcoin, instead of printing more money, all you would need to do is create larger denominations. This avoids possible problems of corruption (like where you send the extra printed money) and it escapes the cage which old traditional deflationary currencies suffer from.
Also, the stable production of bitcoin avoids problems that occur with gold. What if you find a new gold mine? That would have sudden extreme effects on the price. You can avoid that scenario with bitcoin.
But besides the scarce aspect of bitcoin, it also needs massive utility. Without utility, btc will just be a new beanie baby. I can describe this later, but I will first address its decentralized nature.
The thing what makes bitcoin unique is that it is decentralized. In the past, there were other digital currencies (egold, Liberty Reserve), but they all suffered from centralized models. And just like with Napster, centralized organizations can be shutdown (and they were eventually shutdown). With Napster, the solution was bittorrent. Bitcoin basically copied that solution. But in solving that problem, by making bitcoin decentralized, it solved alot more in the process (can describe later). Bitcoin cannot be shutdown, since there is no central server. To shutdown bitcoin, you need to shutdown the entire internet. In fact, bitcoin is the INTERNET of money. 
In the past, they also said that the internet wouldn't scale and that it was full of pornographers and pedophiles. We see something similar with bitcoin, where the system is getting more advanced and where it's starting to react like a living organism. You know the saying of how the internet sees regulation as damage and routs around it? That's because the internet is also decentralized in nature and ISNT owned by anyone. 
Bitcoin is opensource. Anyone can read the code and see if it does what it says. If someone doesn't like what they see, they can copy the code, create their own currency and change the bad aspects. And because nobody owns the code, people can do permissionless innovation (like the internet) and add to the functionality of the code.
Pause for questions and criticisms.

From the sound of it, your current pessimism is the result of letting your enthusiasm get out of hand. That's why your expectations did not match reality. The human species disappointed you and is an ugly race, but it also has potential, because humans can also learn. It's just that they learn in a really messy way. Don't let naivety concerning the human race spoil your day. The key is to keep your feet on the ground and be realistic about the prospects. The idea of a bright future with no blemishes was not realistic to begin with.
We all know that the internet was a great boon to humanity. But in the beginning, it was hailed as a den of thieves and pornographers. Unfortunately, it's these kind of people that realize the advantages much earlier than the regular people and they flock to every new innovation that might benefit the masses. As an early adopter, one shouldn't have rose tinted glasses and realize that this is just a process that bitcoin will have to go through. And thus they must act accordingly.
My advice to anyone that lost money through all the ventures, is to temper expectations and realize that we are in a wild west now. Be cautious where investment is concerned. And if it goes wrong, blame yourself first and consider it a learning experience before cursing anyone else. That way, the unsavory elements will be weeded out over time and we can actually get something positive out of all the crap.

Basically, a bill in 1970 made voting in congress transparent. And because of that transparency, it made congress vulnerable to intimidation and vote buying. We see graphs and statistics starting from the 1970's depicting how everything started 
going downhill. This bill in 1970 was most likely one of the major causes.
Now most people are intuitively supportive of transparancy and instinctively think that transparency solves everything. We have evidence that in the case of voting, this is wrong. We also have evidence that secret voting has cleaned up the problems in the past.
So my advice is, look at the evidence of how secret voting has worked. Don't have the kneejerk reaction and assume transparancy solves everything.

Yeah, I read some of their reasoning and it sounded like serious BS to me. There's no excuse for not using actual numbers, because actual numbers convey reality the best way. If the volatility in the numbers is really not relevant, we ourselves are capable of extrapolating a trendline ignroing that volatility.  
But anyways, I'm not the type to hold a grudge against the government. I tend to be neutral where ideology is concerned. But I'm not bad at math and from my initial conclusions of when I looked up the CPI, the methodology is flawed. My honest opinion with no hate for the government.

If you are getting nervous, you haven't read enough. Strongest fundamentals I've ever seen. The only thing stopping btc, is if the protocol gets hacked. That's about it. 
That the price is stagnating now, is because we are still in consolidation phase of the crash caused by mtgox.

And this makes a difference how? Not intended to be rude, but I could understand this argument better if it were easy to change the protocol. It is not. In practice, the artifical scarcity will behave the same way as natural scarcity.
Make no mistake, I do not say it is impossible for the protocol to change. But from my assessment, there's a good chance I'm already dead before that happens.

I think bitcoin's payment network is very powerful and it works better than current systems. But I believe Peter's point was probably that bitcoin is more being used as an investment than as a payment network. Few people transact, which was basically his point. Can't really argue with him there, because we aren't really completely out of the speculation phase. Speculators have a greater effect on the price today than regular users. It will take some time, before regular users can outmuscle the speculators.

The idea that hoarding is hurting adoption is a myth. What hoarding does is increase the scarcity of the coin driving the prices up. It has always been higher prices that have increased adoption. All metrics improve with higher prices, including the number of transactions and spending.
That we are in a lull right now is a natural part of the cycle, because prices are down. But with something like bitcoin, this can only ever be temporary, because there are only 21 million of them. 
What we need right now is not spending, but patience and a continued focus on improving the infrastructure in order to prepare the network for a new price spike.

Your argument is somewhat similar to what the Skype guy said (forgot his name). I somewhat agree with that line of reasoning, though I do think that bitcoin really is a currency. 
Personally, I think it's pretty much useless to say to regular bitcoiners that bitcoin is not a currency. The idea and attraction of the idea among bitcoiners is too widespread. Time is better spent on meetings with the ones doing the talking to the regulators. You can coordinate your strategies better that way.

In the past, scarcity of digital tokens could only be ensured by tracking how each digital token is spent through a ledger. Banks track digital dollars this way by maintaining a centralized ledger. Paypal does this as well.
Bitcoin is unique that it can maintain this ledger without relying on a third party. It does this by distributing the ledger to every node in the network. The ledger is the basic nervous system of bitcoin and is also called the blockchain.

If the model is centralized in nature, it will have the same risks as regular institutions and probably should be regulated in the same way. But regulators should be careful not to lump decentralized models of bitcoin operation with centralized models. The risks are entirely different and should not be regulated in the same way. 
The risks are much lower with decentralized models of operation, so it doesn't need a heavy hand.

No, I wasn't making a reference to superior technology (though the real internet was indeed superior). The real internet won on both fronts: superiority AND convenience. Why? Permissionless innovation. When you have a central entity managing a blockchain, many of its advantages vanish. You would need to ask permission in order to do aything on the network. The centralized entity would soon engage in rent seeking behaviour, trying to have you pay, before you were allowed access to their system.
But the best reason? In the words of Fred Wilson: Nobody in their right minds would build anything on a system owned by the banks (see the NY bitcoin hearings for that quote). 
Now, I won't say that a centralized entity wouldn't be able to do it. But it would at the very least needs to be a centralized entity at the level of Google. They have the reputation that would attract the talent. And they know disruption theory.

I'm not that optimistic either, but since there's a chance that Lawsky is reading this, I'm hoping he obtains some common sense. I mean regulators tend to turn every $% problem into nails, because all they have and know is the regulation hammer. I'm realistic enough to know that regulation cannot be avoided, but for God's sake, can't we have a regulator for once that has SOME inkling of wisdom?
Because sure, I think having ownerless technology will be a good thing over the long run, but it's not necessary for this future to come about through force.

Creating more altcoins will not suddenly make bitcoin less scarce. Just like how creating more euro's or other currencies will not make the dollar suddenly plentiful. The number will remain 21 million. An extra altcoin won't change this number. 


Lol, you are complaining about something the blockchain already solved. The blockchain is the method to create scarcity in data where no scarcity existed before. If you think you are right, why not try creating unlimited bitcoins if you think that no exceptions exist to the rule of data being unlimited. Call me when you succeed.


Umm, I already named one other component. The ability to create a permanent record without the need for a third party. There are more components, like censorship resistance or the difficulty in confiscating bitcoins.

The most likely direction is world domination. And no, I'm not kidding. The only thing stopping this train is if a major flaw occurs in the protocol that affects consumer experience in a major way. If that doesn't happen, it's only a matter of time before btc outcompetes all other types of currency.
People are too emotionally attached to the price, so posts like these that question the viability tend to pop up when prices are low. Only to me, this is just a natural part of the growing process. I've seen nothing that makes me doubt the viability, because I'm not looking at the price. Every price action has a human beneath it. And I'm seeing some great things on the horizon there.

While I get what you are saying, btc being accepted at normal fiat stores is an essential process as well. The goal is to get regular businesses to keep part of their holdings in btc, without immediately converting it to their fiat currency through bitpay or coinbase. This scenario can only occur if the minimum baseline is reached where a lot of normal businesses accept btc as means of payment.
Eventually, businesses keeping part of their holdings in btc will have a stabilising effect on the volatility, infinitely increasing the utility of btc as a currency. And that's what we want, right? To let btc become a true currency.

IMO, the bitcoin price is mostly about sentiment and rarely does a specific news item have any effect on it. I attribute this due to the youthful nature of the currency. Other markets are saturated in their market cap, their growth has already been reached. For those markets, specific news items are much more important. 
But in markets with high growth, there's too much news flowing around, both positive and negative. So people tend to look at the totality of the news, see if this news changes their basic outlook, get a generalized feeling from it (bullish/bearish) and then mostly rely on technical analysis.
The most important specific news items that CAN (or may) have an effect on the bitcoin price are central bank related (sometimes), liquidity related and symbolic related (when milestones are reached). China for instance continues to have an effect on the price, because much of the liquidity is provided by the Chinese markets. If we assume for a moment that there is no speculation occurring and that prices have reached equilibrium, news that indicates situations that directly affects liquidity (like China) will result that less bitcoins will be bought over time. Under such a scenario, the sellers will slowly start overtaking the buyers until a new equilibrium at a lower price is reached. Speculators realize that this mechanic is occurring and know that unless a whale steps up to the plate that a downturn is inevitable. But whales are not stupid and they know that this trend is occurring as well as the speculators. So whale and speculator alike sell en masse and the price downturn gets exaggerated. 
I think the apple news on its own had very little effect on the price. If it had any effect, it would fall under the category symbolic (milestone reached). But seeing as how bitcoin has reached comparable milestones and html5 wallets were inevitable, I rather doubt that this made a lot of impact.
The news of Dish and Apple combined may have helped the price, but only because it was in conjunction with TA (technical analysis). Believe me, if TA was matched against it, it would have followed the same fate as the Overstock anouncement. The price dipped as well during that time, even though it was a major milestone. But that's also explainable, because the Overstock news was anounced in advance, so it was already incorporated in the price. 
Good news is not forgotten, but if it goes against negative liquidity, liquidity wins out and a downwards trend is inevitable. The aggregate of the good news will manifest itself after the downturn has ended and a correction upwards will occur.
Anyways, the bitcoin markets is heavily driven by whales IMO. If you know how whales think, you can understand much of how the markets tends to operate. See this post of mine: 
Heavy volatility is a result of speculation and whales. When markets are calm, that's an indication that speculators and whales are leaving it up to normal market forces and are staying out of the game, until an important juncture in TA comes along. Also, whales have basically learned how to get the most bang out of their bucks. The fastest and most efficient way to grow the market cap of bitcoin, is to allow normal market participants (people with normal salaries) to stock up on fiat after a price crash. This usually takes half a year. This allows them to recover from previous buying rounds, but it also allows bitcoin to undergo infrastructure improvements. The recent price crashes were mostly due to infrastructure problems (mt.gox). When whales decide that the infrastructure is ready and that normal participants have stocked up on firepower, they start moving and trigger a massive uptrend creating the advent of a new bubble similar to what we've seen last year. 
Right now, that bubble hasn't really started yet. It's just that the bottom has been determined by the market. With the bottom determined, speculators felt confident in investing again, because they knew that the price must correct upwards in order to take the aggregate of the good news into account. Good news is not forgotten. But it has a delayed effect, unless it falls into the three categories I described above.

Come, let's not twist words here. The opinion that the internet has improved the situation where truth is concerned (through decentralization) is a pretty established one.

In theory they increase every 10 minutes, but in practice, it's slightly faster. Because there's more mining power flowing in than the software has calculated, allowing for slightly faster mining.

No, I'm not describing that two opposite philosphies crash and somehow end up in the middle. I also believe that blacks being accepted will become the dominant philosophy at the end of reaching that equilibrium. Simply because evolutionary forces will align towards a philosophy that is more beneficial and efficient for mankind as a whole.
 There would likely still be a minority of racists (because I find it to be very possible that racism could never be completely eradicated). They would probably be allowed to ban blacks from restaurants, but market forces would simply diminish them to a minority.

Don't reccommend mining for bitcoin. The algorithm is programmed to make it harder to mine bitcoin the more competition is on the network. Competition is so fierce at the moment, that it takes thousands of dollars of investments in order to make a profit. You would need to buy highly specialized hardware in order to compete.
If you try to mine bitcoin with a normal computer, you would actually make a loss, where the amount of bitcoins you mined would actually be less than the electricity costs.
I would however reccommend mining an altcoin, since the competition isn't so fierce there. But it takes research which altcoin would be suitable and you would need to switch to different altcoins overtime. You would probably need to ask on a different subreddit specifically for altcoins if you really want to go that route.
But if you want to start immediately with bitcoin, buying the bitcoin would probably be easiest, instead of mining. Buying it at coinbase or circle would be your best bet.

Huobi is not asking commission for trades. 0% fees remember. With a rule like that, it is possible to buy up one's own bid and ask orders without limit, thereby artificially creating volume. It leads one to mistakenly believe that there are a lot of traders, while the volume is most likely caused by only a few traders. And while I believe Huobi is likely in on this game, it could be done by people other than them.
Reddit and bitcointalk have basically concluded that Huobi's volume is fake. There are many threads about it.

Regardless of their power, banks are currently seen as a plague on the system. Tell me how exactly they would motivate the majority of coders and entrepeneurs to work on their system? They might manage to get a few, but there isn't enough money in the world to motivate a workforce to the extent that coders and entrepeneurs are motivated to work on bitcoin.

No, I think he's on to something. 
Your first point is a valid point and with enough money any system can be compromised. Even if we implement the secret vote for congress, eventually money would reverse that system overtime. However, James is not saying that implementing the secret vote would solve all problems or that it's the source of all human suffering. Obviously, the problem of money buying the system would remain. However, he is saying that open voting is responsible for the increased detorioration and for the steepness of the slope. 
Which brings us to your second point. According to you, secret ballots would allow politicians to be bought without repercussions. I think the data provided in the video speaks otherwise. If secret ballots had no merit, the system would not have been implemented in the voting booth. Looking at the past and seeing how secret ballots improved the situation, I think the conclusion is that atleast in the case of regular voters, the system is superior. Now, it could be said that regular voters are not the same as politicians and that the dynamic works differently there. I think James has given indications that this is not the case. He's quoted several congressmen complaining how the sunshine laws have actually made it more difficult to vote, instead of improving the situation. 
Of course, these quotes may be but mere circumstancial evidence. However, I think it's clear that the supposed benefits of transparency simply aren't there as demonstrated through the Gilen flatline. It can't hurt to try secret ballots, because we don't have a functioning democracy right now anyways.
Besides, it's possible to combine secret ballots with transparency through crypto. Look for my other replies in this thread regarding that.
As for Gilen's flatline proving what the Libertarians say, I also happen to agree with that assessment. I don't consider myself Libertarian, but I have read Libertarian theory regarding this and I believe you have a basic misunderstanding about how they see society functioning. It's important for people to internalize the cost of social decisions, but those decisions must also not be forced upon your fellow man. Otherwise it's no longer internal. The non aggression principle is very clear on that. As well as that competition is an important element of rule enforcement. When you force your rules upon the entirety of society, it drives out competition for your rules.

Your basket of goods needs to be representative of what the average consumer buys, but you also neeed to compare the actual prices.

Was one of the first worries and questions that came up. In the end it was determined that it was not an issue. Hardware is likely to outpace blockchain growth.

This is the wrong way to calculate transaction costs. It assumes that the expended electricity is only used to achieve transactions. Transactions that are easy and fast are but ONE of the objectives.
The price of a bitcoin has several components to it:
bitcoin price = electricity costs + enforced scarcity (resulting in deflation) + permanent record (blockchain) + the ability to eliminate middlemen (allowing for less corruption) + security (against hacking and forging) + triple entry bookkeeping + lightning fast transactions + high confiscation difficulty + superior money characteristics (divisibility, etc) + storage ability (essentially allowing for the ability to bypass banks) + increased privacy (if certain steps are taken) + programmable aspect + future expectations
It may be that I forgot a few other components. But essentially, the expended electricity is used to achieve ALL those extra components. It's for this reason that transaction costs can be so low. And yes, the transaction cost is simply the mining fee. Not this bullsh-T where the cost of electricity is divided by the amount of transactions. If the transaction costs were actually that high, the miners wouldn't be making a profit.
Now, it might be that some of the miners fees are partly subsidized by the last component of the above formula (future expectations). But we can't determine by how much, unless we determine the size of the market price for the other components (triple entry bookkeeping, etc).
However, we CAN say that this here:


is simply nonsense. We must assume that the market prices correctly. If the market price is not overvalued and the increased bitcoin price is its REAL price, then the value added  IS the bitcoin price of each extra bitcoin that has been produced. The bitcoin price * total amount of btc produced must exceed the total expended electricity that was necessary for production.
Believe me, I'm in accounting. I know how prices or value is calculated.

I live in the Netherlands and I think it's because the Dutch have a unique history enabling them to grasp bitcoin much quicker than average. The Dutch are by nature a traders country harking back to the VOC days when it sailed the world and colonized countries. They are one of the countries that formerly had the world reserve currency. Not only did they have things like tulip bulbs, they invented the stock market as well.
The Netherlands is a small country and they don't have real natural resources. Because of their small size and lack of real natural resources, they had to focus on being as efficient as possible where trade is concerned. Corruption is also relatively low because of this. Very hard to be corrupt when you don't have size to obfuscate your dealings. 
But it's not just the trader's spirit, Calvinism has also a lot to do with it. It made the Dutch gravitate somewhat to a "what is the correct and right way to do it" culture. Some criticize the Dutch for this, because it makes them seem arrogant. Even though most of the Dutch are not religious anymore, the Calvinistic influence is still present.
Because the Netherlands is small and had to rely on trade to compensate, there wasn't really much place for war. That's why the culture is more on the female side, than on the macho side like the US and Russia. In the US, you are only really respected when you clash your ideas against one another. In the Netherlands, they would probably look annoyed at you for that. It's more about discussion, working together and consensus (which has its own drawbacks, but works pretty well overall). 
It's mainly this non macho culture and trader's instinct that the Dutch are openminded and willing to listen to the merits of bitcoin. I think the Dutch youth are even more open compared to their elders and they often are enterprising and just take action. Their down to earth manner makes them ask the question "does it work" instead of being all judgmental and dismissing an idea all together. They are more practical oriented and this trait probably allows them to grasp concepts more quickly. This is why the Netherlands are on the forefront on the btc scene.
But there's quite a large difference in culture between the younger generation and the older generation. Some of the old guard can be stubborn where their ideas are concerned and not all of them accept btc so readily. But still, the Dutch are doing quite well where btc is concerned.

You can partly blame the FED for this. The FED printed the money and invested it in the emerging markets. But now that they are tapering, the investors are pulling their money out of the emerging markets, Russia being one of them. As a result, the currencies of the emerging markets are in serious jeopardy right now, so Russia is making this move in order to protect the Ruble.

Nothing is too complicated to code. These disputes exists, because parties have no full control over the assets. This results that ownership can be contested (and thus losses involved with that ownership). With bitcoin there can be no such ambiguity. You either own the asset or you don't. The risk of owning the asset thus falls on the owner.
And it can be coded within the contract who owns the asset under which circumstances.

Demand will only drop if a fatal flaw occurs in the protocol. Otherwise it will just keep growing. Keep in mind that btc is pretty young as a currency, so the opportunity for growth are bigger than the chances of decline. Eventually, adoption might hit a limit and it will keep around that level.

I can't explain the deep nitty gritty, but I can explain the general outline. Was just gauging what exactly the question was, since I've encountered some users that weren't even aware that the price was determined on the exchanges. 
No need to get your panties in a bunch. I'll concede that perhaps I was too arrogant in my explanation in the beginning, so there's no need to drive that point home and treat me like an idiot.
Anyways, to understand why bitcoin is a store of value, you basically need to understand why gold was chosen as money in the past and why bitcoin is gold 2.0.
Simply spoken, Erik Voorhees made a good explanation in the video. Gold was valuable because it had the optimal properties of money. Scarce, durable, etc. The most important aspect of gold, was the fact that it was scarce. In today's world, fiat can be printed at will and there's an inherent risk of this as well as a possibility of market distortions. Governments also seem to grow more powerful when they are capable of growing the money supply. The system that constrained the government in the past was the gold standard.
Anyways, bitcoin mimics gold. With gold, the production gets harder and harder every day as well as more expensive. In the future, there will come a point where no gold can be mined anymore from the earth. Bitcoin has a system that mimics that system. There is hardcoded in software a limit of 21 million bitcoins. There will never be more than that. Computers "mine" these bitcoin. These computers solve something similar to sudoku puzzles and when they solve it, they get awarded bitcoins. In the first 4 years, the award was 50 btc. Each 4 years that reward halves. Until the reward reaches 0 somehwre in the year 2140 (or something). The sudoku puzzle gets harder the more computers are mining. This makes the software selfadjusting and forces the computers to adher to the production schedule of the software.
Since the system mimics gold, bitcoin will tend to be deflationary over time.
Anyways, I'll momentarily stop to see if you got any questions or criticisms.

He's a heavy self promoter. His twitter demonstrates this as well. But I do think that has some down to earth conclusions that isn't ideological in nature. The way he speaks tends to be utility based. Such people form their own conclusions without easily going along with the popular theory.
His only weakness, besides self promotion, is that he tends to believe more in the power of governments than in bottom up success. Or saying it another way, he has a bias towards governments, because he believes that most people underestimate the extent of their capabilities (which is true IMO).

It does through inflation, but you never notice it, because the changes are incremental. And sometimes, inflation can be contained to other sectors of the market unnoticable by regular people. Like the stock market, housing market and bond market for instance. Some argue that the FEd printing money has allowed that money to flow to the stock market artificially increasing their prices beyond normal. Recently, David Einhorn has argued that the Tech industry is in a bubble right now and I think the Fed has something to do with that.

Hoarding is just another way of describing savings. It's not necessary for bitcoin to be spent in order to be succesful. Gold is essentially sitting uselessly in vaults without ever being spent, yet it has attained enormous value.
Spending is good for the economy, but an economy needs savings as well. Overspending leads to consumerism and inefficient use of resources (and debts). Spending and saving need to be balanced for the most efficient economy.
At the moment, I would say that hoarding the coin is the best path, precisely because we are at an early stage yet. When the coin appreciates, human nature will drive people to spend their profits and this is what we see with Bitpay.

Yes, economists are heavily turning away from free market economics. That I don't deny. But the way I see it, they are each taught the disclaimers and negative consequences concerning subsidies and taxes, but they tend to forget them seeing how the government is heavily engaging in manipulation. Since manipulation tends to be the norm, they go along while thinking that they can manipulate the market better than the government can.
The economists are basically ignoring their own theory.

Btw, what the heck is wrong with all the rampant downvoting? 
Anyways, if math says you own a car and you don't have a car, it would mean that the math has been coded badly. This would happen in the first iteration of math based regulation. Ideally, you would code your math in such a way where conditions need to be met, before the math decides you really own the car and where it is in your possession. Escrow and multisig are some of those steps in the right direction. But I expect further advancements down the line.

There might be a correction. The FED has been able to keep the game running for a loooong time. But if you look at the charts, the effects of QE have been getting weaker and weaker overtime, with diminishing returns. There will come a point in time where QE will cease to have an effect anymore. And that's when SHTF.
Or what might happen is that some snowflake will cause an avelanche somewhere that crashes the system. The financial system now is so complex that it's now more vulnerable to major corrections. Complexity theory states that it takes exponentially more time and resources to keep a system stable, the larger that system is and the more complex it is. Jim Rickards is predicting a crash bigger than the one in 2008 and I tend to think he's right.
On average we have a financial crisis every 6-8 years (last one in 2008). We are very close to a new crisis. But this time, there will be no FED to bail out the economy. They are already at the limit of their capabilities.

It probably won't stop war, but I do think that it can seriously reduce war. And even if war is waged, it will be shortlived, because the cost is passed almost directly to the individual.
Also, I expect the warmongers not to take this lying down. Undoubtedly, just like we can innovate, warmongers are also capable of innovating (just look at the banks and see how they innovate to screw us over). If one avenue is closed off, they will create a new angle of attack to assure that they can wage war.
But bitcoin will most certainly constrict the warmonger. It will be some time before they can innovate their way out of this constriction. The key is that we need to keep innovating ourselves and play wack a mole with all the tricks they might pull. This must be done through technology. In time, I do think war can eventually be ended.

If I had stated that without giving the reasoning behind it, it would have been dismissive. Gold is the perfect example of an asset not used as a currency, but still being succesful. The precedent exists. Bitcoin has recreated these reasons.
Not saying that bitcoin is a sure bet or that it will be succesful. The future is certainly an unknown. But I will say this. While the future cannot be predicted due the many variables, I will predict that if certain variables do NOT change, bitcoin is heading the same way as gold. These variables being that bitcoin maintains its integrity and that no bugs or hacks are capable of taking down the network. As well as that the internet stays operational. If these variables stay constant, I will dare to predict that its eventual success as an asset is assured. If its success as an asset is assured, it's success as a currency is also but a matter of time.

I can recognize the value in the idea that cost internalization is ideal, not necessary. Though I think the Libertarians are averse to that idea, because when you accept that notion it's easy to go over the line. And I think it's a valid fear, because it's essentially this belief that allowed the (early) growth of government. Mind you, I'm no Libertarian. I tend to see this more from an information and evolutionary perspective. 
Government is an emergent property of mankind. If you'd kill it, it would just spring back up again. And it keeps springing up, because it's a necessary function for the further evolution of mankind. Desire for leadership is also something baked into the genes. I do believe however that evolutionary forces will force mankind to move towards decentralized solutions, instead of the centralized systems. The government of the future will be totally unrecognizable compared to what we have today. I also tend to believe that these same evolutionary forces will push mankind to something resembling the Libertarian ideal (though an ideal can never be fully realized).
But where I differ from the Libertarian is the path towards attaining this ideal. The Libertarian idea is indeed utopian and they try to achieve this utopia by preventing people from making the mistakes through rethoric. They are trying to force the ideal on reality by promoting ideas. Ideas are powerful and they are also part of the evolutionary growth of people. But they eschew short term gains. In their eyes, forbidding a restaurant from banning blacks would perhaps attain a short term gain, but would soon vanish by incurring a long term cost. And this is true. There is a cost with denying the freedom of an individual for the sake of the group. Eventually, that cost will build and even swallow up the temporary short term advantage of having increased freedoms for black people. 
But I differ from a Libertarian in the sense that I wouldn't prevent this process from happening. I say that this proces is cyclical in nature, unpreventable and it's even beneficial for the evolution of mankind. Mistakes are a necessary part of growth. It's faster for the person to make a mistake, learn from it, than trying to prevent a mistake at any cost. 
While I would prefer a restaurant owner deciding for himself personally, I can see the value in forcing the restaurant owner to accept blacks, for the simple reason that doing so would swing the cycle towards the black community. Society will rebalance in that new paradigm. But the restaurant owner will be disadvantaged in this new paradigm and eventually that situation will burst at a future date. Then the situation swings back towards the restuarant owner and a new rebalancing occurs. Eventually, the situation will swing back and forth until a new equilibrium is reached where all parties are roughly satisfied. The stronger the fluctuations, the greater the speed of reaching equilibrium. At the end of the process, I believe something similar to Libertarianism will emerge. Mind you, I say similar. What ends up emerging may differ greatly in the details, but may roughly resemble something akin to Libertarianism.

I think because people have been able to reflect somewhat. When we saw the market go down, it was unexpected. It came from nowhere. That led to panic. But the panic subsided and they also saw that there was a group of people that believed enough in the coin to maintain its value to some extent and prevented the crash from going even deeper. They also saw that despite the decline, bitcoin news kept chugging along like there was no price decline. The news that has been coming out was normal and not really that negative.
Now that prices are declining again, it's not so unexpected anymore. And I think people have a sense that a bottom might be reached again, but that there's a group that will maintain it at that level.
Also, it's my impression that the recent price behaviour seems like price discovery to me. It doesn't feel like people sold because they didn't believe in the coin anymore.

Calculating transaction costs that way is wrong IMO. The transaction cost is simply the mining fee. That's it. Trying to calculate it by dividing the total amount of electricity by the amount of transactions gives the impression that the electricity that has been expended is solely for the purpose of accomplishing transactions. This is simply not true.
The expended electricity accomplishes multiple objectives. The ability to transact easily is but one of those objectives. One must not confuse this capability as the sole purpose of the expended electricity, because that's essentially the same basic fallacy as saying that bitcoin cannot be succesful if it is barely used for transactions.
One must simply look at the gold market as an example. The gold market has basically huge amounts of gold just lying around in vaults collecting dust. But it's a trillion dollar market. Obviously, there must be a reason that gold is so valuable, even though it's hardly used for transactions. And the main reason is because it is SCARCE.
Bitcoin can succeed as a replacement for gold alone. So even if the volatility remains and bitcoin is hardly used for transactions, there can still be value there.
So in essence, the components of the price of a bitcoin is not just:
the ability to transact easily + future expectations
the ability to transact easily + enforced scarcity + future expectations 
Each component has a price associated with it determined by the market. The above is a simplified formula, leaving out other components (example: the ability to have a permanent record without a third party)
So it is not entirely correct to say that the transaction costs are subsidized by the future expectations. There are other components that deliver value as well that allow for low transaction costs.

Only full control over the private key guarantees full control over the bitcoins. And that's when you involve no third parties and keep the bitcoins on your own computer. But sending the bitcoins to an exchange (= involving a third party) essentially means giving up full control over the bitcoins, because the public address of mtgox (and the private key associated with it) is mainly under control of mtgox. They only let you borrow control over those adresses. The only thing stopping them from stealing your bitcoins is their desire to uphold their reputation and the slight offchance that they could go to jail. 
If you knew the private key associated with the mtgox address (which you don't), you would have shared control and ownership over the bitcoins, but it wouldn't mean much if mtgox sends the bitcoin away behind your back. Full control can only be guaranteed if YOU alone know the private key and nobody else does.
There are cases where some third parties have schemes where you retain knowledge and ownership over the private key, without them knowing your private keys (like blockchain.info). But the downside of such systems is that there are more security risks involved and that some hacker can obtain knowledge over the private key. Whenever you deal with third parties, you will always be forced to trust their security measures.

Last time bitcoin crashed, it took roughly half a year for the price to rise again. But now that Bitcoin is heavily in the news, I expect it to rise very soon and take far less time than 6 months. 
The reason the price is stagnating at the moment, is because large investors are afraid of the Chinese deadline of januari 31st and the effect it will have on Chinese exchanges (especially Huobi). A large amount of volume is going through those exchanges (though some of it is fake). This is why recent positive news doesn't have an effect on the price yet.
After that deadline has passed and prices have stabilized, I see a new boom occurring, because of all the positive news that has been going around lately and that positive news will finally seep into the price.

I actually think you are right. Bad actors have tried to flood the network with "spam". Resulting in high fees. When I talk about demand, i mean REAL demand. Not the fake demand created by the bad actors.

Can I quote you on that?
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:23:53
I see. Anyways, I do know that exchanges make projections about the size of the volume that will be going through their exchanges and they invest accordingly. Afterwards, they test out the software by simulating the load. Of course, the projections and tests itself are approximations, so they can't always pull it off without a hitch. But it's not completely untested either.
I can also agree that spending should be encouraged, since I also tend to think that spending is important. The only thing is that people advocating spending seem to unconsciously follow the same behaviour patterns of governments and central banks and think that spending can be commanded or argued from a top down fashion and this behaviour is something I'm trying to caution against. They've been trying to influence us here in Europe through the news, trying to make us spend and needless to say, it hasn't been very succesful. That's because spending cannot be encouraged in a direct fashion during a crises. When you say to someone that they must spend, they will not spend unless on their terms. Each person has his own spending disposition. There are conditions under which they will spend and there are conditions where they will not do so. If you want them to spend, you must first create the conditions under which they will spend and indirect means are usually the most effective way to do that (more jobs being one of the most important criteria). In other words, to encourage spending you need to cultivate a suitable climate (or environment) instead of intervening directly. 
For example, it makes no sense to encourage spending, when the majority of people are already at their limit of their spending disposition. Direct interventions, such as giving them a discount tends to not work in such situations (or only in a very limited fashion). People in the bitcoin space have invested all their savings early on and thus are already tapped out (like me) or they are investing some % of their salary monthly, in which case these people are also not in the position to increase their spending habits from usual. Indirect tactics ( I call that climate control) such as increasing bitcoin users or creating situations where the bitcoin price rises naturally (without short term manipulation) are much better ways to have an impact on spending.

I actually agree with what you say. You are right. Competition is the main problem.
After reviewing your post, it could indeed lead to a potential conflict of interest when the public is allowed to dictate FED policies. The public has an interest in having the FED fund welfare. The FED will be forced to adopt policies favouring the public, instead of policies that favour all of society.
On the other hand, there's also a conflict of interest when the public is NOT allowed to dictate FED policies. The FED has an incentive to abuse their power to benefit themselves and any friends they might have.
This is a seemingly paradoxical situation where both scenario's lead to a conflict of interest. The solution is competition, just like you said.

Personally, I suspect it has more to do with a combination of merchant adoption and speculators. Merchant adoption is putting pressure on prices, because merchants immediately convert their bitcoin revenues to dollars/euro's. However, merchant adoption alone doesn't explain the extreme downturn. If we take the speculators out of the equation, merchant adoption would have probably been only a slight downwards effect on prices. Prices would have declined, but at a very slow pace in my estimate. 
But some speculators have predicted this slight downturn (probably from looking how the market reacted to Overstock, Dish and Dell) and sold, exarcebating the effect. One particular exchange (I think Bitfinex?) also had some extreme price action, where a selloff (I hear this was triggered by price action on Bitstamp, but not sure if true) triggered a series of margin calls. The cascading effect of these margin calls dragged all the exchanges down considerably. Prices were slow to recover since then, because I think it shocked the market. They were also not sure if margin calls should be seen as legitimate or illegitimate price action, so they didn't know if buying bitcoin to recover prices were justified at that moment. 
The result of all the above is damaged confidence. For awhile prices remained stable, but stability is only temporary until sentiment determines where the market goes next. And the sentiment was negative due to all the recent price action as well as that merchant adoption was still occurring. This  triggered a bear market based on TA (technical analysis), resulting in speculators massively selling off.
Anyways, this is the thinking of a mere amateur. If any Wallstreet expert can bring light to this, it would be much appreciated.

I'm no rabid market defender. I will not claim that the market is perfect, though I do tend to believe in them. If Libertarians were to be believed, if the market was left to itself, monopolies would only exist for a short period of time. Some Libertarians believe that there would be no monopolies, but the more sophisticated ones say that monopolies do form, but get defeated in fairly quick order.
Evolution tends towards monopolies. Period. Hence, markets also evolve towards monopolies. I agree with Libertarians that if the market was left to itself, monopolies would indeed get defeated faster. Where I disagree with them on is how fast this would occur. Wether a monopoly gets defeated in short order depends solely on the magnitude of the problem and what is necessary in order to solve it. Some problems require decades in order to solve. Even the market if left to itself may not solve it immediately. What is then the recourse of the populace during this period where a problem is remained unsolved and where it's at the mercy of the monopolist? 
Just look at bitcoin and how long it took for this idea to materialize. The market needed quite awhile for it to invent bitcoin. 
However, even in the event that a problem remains unsolved for quite awhile, I would still hesitate to step towards a government for solutions (though there might be a few exceptions here and there). Yes, they could diminish the power of the monopolist, but it would be at the expense of the speed of market solutions. The ironic thing about markets is that it tends to solve problems quicker the greater the discomfort due to the problem is. Alleviating that discomfort through government power would thus decrease the speed of the arrival of market solutions. 
I think wether government should intervene or not is a difficult question and should be looked at case by case, instead of a definite yes or no. But either way, I believe market forces would make government intervene despite what I believe the best outcome is (at this current time). This will continue to happen until society has gained enough information and has evolved to the extent where it can make more accurate decisions as a whole.

I think I read that quote before, though I don't remember the exact link. The person that wrote it was criticising bitcoin and most of it was crap from what I remember.

He/she was probably trying to infer that if you succeed in modifying this single truth, you would succeed in modifying the truth across the whole network.

It's a concern certainly. But people tend to forget how early inventions and innovations were relatively expensive at the outset, yet became eventually mainstream with normal prices. 
Bitcoin started out with low fees. But after 7 years, we still haven't gotten our breakthrough. We need to face the fact that if we want bitcoin to succeed, we need to work for it. We need to go where the market is. The market is not where the masses are. It's at the edges of civilization.

It's not about making excuses or pointing fingers. Or that bitcoin is the center of the universe and that people are conspiring against it. I'm making an argument that's about pure profit.
I'm not even saying that this has actually happened. I only threw it out to see what other people thought about it. That I seem to disagree with you is more that your argument makes sense on some level, but that it still seems incomplete in my mind. Trying to fill the gaps in my understanding.
In a sense, the fact that it's about trillions makes sense on the surface, but shouldn't really be an argument. It's not like one single person is behind those trillions. The market has many actors. 
If you knew an asset would outperform for sure, it will yield profit by trading another (lesser performing) asset for it in return. The respective marketcaps of these assets should not matter for this particular calculation. 
There's been a recent influx of wallstreet people in bitcoin. Financial traders and hedgefunds. They have connections and know about more than just bitcoin. It could be conceivable that they got wind of the swiss bank news and decided to trade in the bitcoins for swiss franc/gold. Especially if some of those bitcoin trades were yielding losses. Compared to a a poor performing asset, trading it in for a guaranteed profit would make sense.
Again, I'm not saying this has actually happened. Just saying that the argument about the market cap or size of those trades is not an argument against it. I'm well aware of how humans are prone to make connections that don't actually exist.

The nice thing about bitcoin is that it is so effective in proving naysayers wrong. When bitcoin is down, they rejoice (wrongly IMO). But their voices get smaller and smaller over time. Now even bank bigwigs who thought they were immune from competition are getting intimidated by the tech industry. And there is good reason to be intimidated. Because in the end they fucked up.

Every decentralized system has problems escaping some level of centralization. That doesn't mean that you can call it centralized. The important thing to note is that the information itself is not under control by anyone entity. This is the decentralized aspect. That the design is somewhat centralized is not important here. Information not being under control and thus having it unable to be easily modified is the key.
If we go by your arguments, it sounds like it's better to have the information be provided by a centralized entity, which brings its own problems with it.

He had a rather neutral and well informed presentation about bitcoin. Many thought it was a reasonable presentation at the time. It should be somewhere on youtube.
Personally, he seems to be an expert in manipulation and somewhat of a snake to me. If you check his slides, you wouldn't know he was negative about bitcoin. But the way he worded his sentences in his presentation had a clear intent to forment doubt IMO. But it was just subtle enough to be unnoticable by most. And that subtlety means he's not an idiot by any measure. And dangerous.

Lol, I think you are underestimating the people of today. You have a very linear approach and that approach might work on some who tend to think linear as well. But when I first heard about bitcoin, it was the realization that bitcoin could be used for far more than currency that made me realize that it was the real deal. Because these alternate functions also support the price.
Sometimes, a different aspect might result in a sudden click for people. People react differently to different aspects. That's why it's better to give a complete picture instead of just focusing on one aspect. ONE of those aspects will tend to stick. We can always micro focus later on a specific aspect should that prove necessary.

But belief tends to be a longterm strategy. It's possible to diversify in a different asset if you know that on the short term that asset will outperform.  
Actually, if you are certain that a certain asset will outperform (only possible with insider trading), it makes sense to pour ALL of your existing assets (thereby exchanging one for the other) into that one asset. But such a move would only be warranted if you knew your info was absolutely correct.

Not sure If Jeff fully understands Andreas's point, though I do agree that if a feature is important, it will make it in the core protocol. In that sense, even ossification is no barrier. It will only slow down the features, but that they will be included will be inevitable.
The way I see it, Jeff and Andreas are talking about different parts of the lifecycle of a protocol. It's true that in the beginning, network effects will speed up the process of including features. And we haven't hit the maximum amount of network effect yet. But once the protocol becomes good enough, a slowdown due to the network effect will be inevitable. Not to mention that I haven't heard Jeff really address what will happen once earlier versions of the bitcoin code are engraved into metal (Trezor, etc). This will lead to a slowdown no matter how I look at it.
And the problem that Andreas's alludes to, is that privacy isn't really important in order for bitcoin to succeed. He realizes this and THIS is what worries him. Like Jeff Garzik said, if a feature is important, it will make it in the core protocol. But we've seen with the internet that it managed to succeed quite brilliantly without any anonymity features. The question is if anonymity is a feature required for success. Because while I agree with Jeff that important features will make it in the core protocol regardless of ossification, what happens with features that aren't really necessary for success (like maybe anonymity)? This is problematic.

He probably doesn't think that, but when explaining concepts, people often get sloppy on nuance, especially if you consider the venues where he stated such remarks. You have a limited timeframe to make the argument, so complete accuracy is always difficult to achieve.

Strongest in the 24 hours, but maybe the large drop in the days before was actually caused by the Swiss central bank decision. There's been no news about the reason of the drop. But seeing as how the timing of this news item (which seems to be regarded as a nuclear financial event by some) followed closely after the large drop off, I'm starting to wonder if insider trading made someone exchange bitcoins for swiss francs (or gold).
Of course, this may be just my imagination. The human mind is prone to see connections where none exists.

People will want to acquire scarce coins BECAUSE of its scarcity. If something was easily obtainable, it would have little value. And it's this drive of humans to obtain scarce items that the price of these items will eventually go up. Not to mention that the economy is not static and is constantly growing. The price of a scarce coin will have to go up to account for this (deflation).
What would you rather have? Money that keeps getting more worthless or money that actually becomes more valuable over time? This is is why having a limit is so important.
And mind you, I have nothing against inflation.It is possible that systems based on inflation can work. But not in the way it is currently setup with central banks.

@_date: 2017-02-15 22:25:18
That it went the opposite way is merely bitcoin having to face the reality. The early cheap prices were more an artificial result, instead of a result of market forces. The way prices go down naturally is for producers to increase production where profits are made with an emphasis on volume. But the demand must be there first.
Right now, production (mining) is rising faster than the demand. So fees rise. This is a natural result of economics. Artificial price fixing of the fees may temporarily alleviate the problem (as was the case in the beginning), but the economics will eventually take over.
You get low fees by starting with a niche market. You must be number one in that market. Then you expand to new types of users. This is how fees naturally lower.

I think his point was the danger of the tail wagging the dog. Similar to how paper gold has supposedly taken over the gold fundamentals. Or how credit default swaps took over the housing market, where the fundamentals of the derivative temporarily replaced the fundamentals of the underlying asset (which proved unsustainable).
An ETF is essentially a derivative. We've already seen examples of derivatives taking over the market. You would think that the underlying asset would be the main price factor, but humans are good at gaming the price. That people would go to owning the real asset instead of the derivative and be the majority is a dangerous assumption to make.

Don't underestimate government power. They cannot stop cryptocurrency as a whole, but they CAN make it extremely difficult. And some crypto's might even bite the dust, Bitcoin included.
The most worrying attack vector at the moment, is due to the miners that have centralized within China. While the claim is that miners are anonymous, this anonymity can easily be defeated by checking the electricity usage of people. That's how some marijuana farms got busted in the Netherlands.
If those miners get busted and taken offline (by the government or a different force), there will be a gap in the security. That will be a perfect moment to try a 51% attack.
A possible counterattack against this, is if a company can deploy cheap mining rigs extremely quickly during this gap.

Well, the problem lies in two areas. 
One, principles matter. You have to stand for something. If not, you have no foundation. With an unstable foundation, growth is still possible, but it's more uncertain. A lot of these alts have very poor foundations, as well as that they have principles that are detrimental to crypto. I'm no expert myself on this, but I've seen experts discussing the flaws of other alts and how they compromise decentralisation.
Two, users can become bitter, because they fail to communicate the importance of these principles to each other. So they become toxic and often deliver low blows when they see others fail. Whenever someone does this, the other party conflates us all as boorish. In reality, people have distinct beliefs even within one crypto forum.
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:08:19
He's not speculating on it. He said it himself not to speculate in crypto. That's why he went out of his way to explain why he owned alts. It's for understanding how they work.

Reply from Andreas. Already expected this viewpoint from him. Classic Andreas response.
The problem with debates is that people participating (the ones debating and the ones viewing) often don't have the proper mindset. Debates are not really a search for truth or trying to increase one's understanding. For most, it's a venue to crush an opposing party seen as a bottleneck to one's own goals. It leads to tribalism.

During the time of the blocksize debate debacle and the creation of I was on the forums 24/7 at the time. You could say I was obsessed with bitcoin news. 
When the blocksize debate occurred, there were a lot of new accounts that popped up that were for bigger blocks. Being for bigger blocks is not a sin perse, but it was noticable that some people were trying to influence the debate in favor of bigger blocks.   
Now, I think it likely that the smaller block advocates likely did some manipulation on their own as well. However, from what I've seen, the flood of new accounts that came in the beginning favoured bigger blocks. The manipulation of certain threads to the front page were also for bigger blocks. Some of these threads were sent to the front page in a matter of minutes.
The wording these new accounts used, was also rather suspect. Short sentences, without going deeply into the argument. Lots of ad hominem. And they insisted to see this debate in terms of bigger blocks and smaller blocks, in essence a black and white debate. Whenever someone used different wording, they forced the other party to see themselves as in the bigger block or smaller block camp (example: by using insults such as small blocker, etc).
It was obvious to some that was under attack. Some people suspected the banks. Others, the government. This thinking mighht be too paranoid, but from my own conclusions I can only see it as deliberate intent. Doesn't matter who it was, but I myself can only conclude that this was a deliberate attack. 
I did my best to stay neutral on this issue, so you'll have to decide for yourself if I'm not misinterpreting what I saw.
Anyways, the XT and Classic projects got started during this time. I myself am for decentralization. And I would certainly like to see more implementations. But from how all these instances were coordinated, the timing seemed suspect to me. It seemed more an attempted coup instead of a genuine effort to actually create a viable alternative. Especially if you actually looked into the roadmap of these two projects. Extremely barebone roadmaps, no vision of how they would create a sustainable alternative and add to the ecosystem.
Mind you, I have no understanding of coding. But I read the threads where these roadmaps were criticised. And there was no real counterargument given in those threads by the XT and Classic dev (especially Classic). A very bad sign indeed.
Anyways, theymos then used the banhammer to permanently boot out what he saw as trolls. I myself was banned as a result. Can't really blame him, his tools were limited at the time. I'm still not sure if what he did was the correct road, because it amounted to plain censorship. Yet, it seemed to have worked.
This eventually led to the creation of Roger Ver was quick to invite anyone to the subreddit he created.
Now, the rest of my argument is pure speculation. I am not a coding expert, however, I can recognize when somebody is fudging on his arguments. It is this fudging which I look out for when assessing who's bullshitting me and who is not. I scoured all the threads that had coding experts within it. And my conclusion was that most of the experts that were heavily in bitcoin at the time were against bigger blocks. Some of them were even stating that we were under attack. These were also industry people.
I did not conclude that we were under attack lightly. I'm well aware that society spits on paranoid people. I tried giving the benefit of the doubt. But my conclusions remain the same. I was heartened that some of the experts agreed with my assessment, because it confirmed in my mind that I wasn't dreaming up the situation.
Anyways, Roger Ver created The timing and his wording at the time was plainly suspect. I myself discovered bitcoin through a libertarian site (the dailypaul, now extinct), so I am well aware how Libertarians tend to think. They tend to be extremistic in their thinking, so I found it unlikely that he suddenly changed his tune.
As well as that his action corresponded with another action I saw in the past. During the hunt for Edward Snowden, there were many who claimed support for him and against him. One of the people that came out against him, was Marc Andreesen. To me, it was obvious that he was lying, because I had watched many of his videos and his theories on innovation. I've also seen many bitcoin videos of bitcoin advocates dealing with the government. They were always only telling a certain part of the truth, trying to paint themselves on the government side. Dealing with the government forces us all to wear masks.
Anyways, there were a lot of bitcoin conferences going around at the time. These people talk to each other. I'm fairly positive that everyone of note in the industry has concluded the same thing as me and have taken action and colluded to setup a play. Saying certain things in public, while believing something else entirely.

Because only hodling increases prices (the main driver of adoption). But it doesn't only increase it, it stabilizes volatility and makes price increases sustainable. Spending barely moves the needle price wise.

I would recommend watching saifedean's presentation on the front page (the first link at the top). Also he addresses the energy topic more specifically in his interview with Tom woods.
Also, the other coins are misguided where this is concerned. Other schemes will not be able to protect against a state actor as well as proof of work.  All actions require energy. To have immutability, it essentially means to keep data unchangeable even when surrounded by chaotic forces that want that change. The more destructive the chaos surrounding the ledger, the more energy is required as a barrier to protect against those forces.
The genius of proof of work is that it forces the attacker to expend a lot of energy in order to execute the attack. Other schemes rely too much on encryption. Encryption can be broken cheaply as long as one is willing to spend the time studying the protection scheme. But no amount of studying  will help break proof of work. You either invest the energy to attack the network or you can forget about bringing the system down.

There is no market in existence that didn't have manipulation. What matters is if the main narrative is believable enough where even manipulation can only slightly alter the trend.
And even if all the whales left, there's enough of a community to prop up the price indefinitely (though prices would have to collapse substantially before this effect kicks in). What most people don't realize is  that bitcoin doesn't need new entrants to increase in price. The same group of people can drive up prices if they believe that the asset is worth it and if the asset is scarce. New entrants only makes the process faster.

Maybe Luke jr. Cobra not so much. But I do agree that people should take this problem more seriously. The entire idea about crypto is that the software and game theory should have taken care of this. The appearance of Bitmain has shown us that the game theory of bitcoin still needs to be worked out. But it's better to first see how this plays out.

Haven't we already established that an item sitting still, is still using it? This in my view is the main problem why people see spending as adoption and not holding. Bitcoin being used as a store of value and sitting still IS adoption. If gold has been adopted as a store of value, an item with superior money properties can replace its function. Someone not acknowledging this, is simply contradicting himself.
As for Gresham's law, due to bitcoin's superiority as money, it's naturally being hoarded above other money's. People are then inclined to spend fiat first. In such an environment you will never succeed in convincing people to spend. It's the same problem as how the EU tried to let its citizens spend money. But because they are so far above us, they could not see the common day problems common mortals have. Hoarding money and not spending in a depression IS rational behavior (though they would claim otherwise).
Bottomline, convincing people to act on a large scale has worked badly throughout history. Focuising on the climate yields more success.

Lightning Network will solve that problem. Bitcoin software still evolving. It looks retarded right now, because bitcoin has an additional goal of being decentralized. That lofty goal makes it slower and more expensive than a traditional database. 
However, the early internet had much of the same problems. They managed to scale TCP/IP by adding more layers on top of it. Lightning Network can be seen as the second layer on top of bitcoin.

Hardware wallets are still the best solution, despite those risks. The risk of amateur mistakes losing your coins is much higher.
What will most likely happen is that when a hacker war occurs in the future (this will happen and  one can argue it already started), exchange wallets and wallets like blockchain.info will fall first (ddos, prison, etc).
Then regular wallets (like Electrum and Mycelium) are next. Only experienced users, ideally those that know code, will keep using software wallets. All the noobs that kept using software wallets will be wiped out of existence.
The last line of defense are the hardware wallet users. If that gets compromised, we will likely move to 3d printed hardware wallets (as a temporary solution) and then we'll forcibly have to acknowledge that intel and amd are dead ends, since they are full of backdoors. If we get to that point, it will be bad.....

Money is important. Anyone that claims otherwise is fooling themselves. However, being too obsessed with money actually makes you less money in this game. Keeping your head cool and not caring too much is what gets you farther. Even if Tone affects the market negatively, for a good trader, there's always money to be made (regardless if market goes down or up). 
At least for me, it makes no sense to obsess about Tone for above reasons.

Bitcoin is a consensus system. Before a change is possible in bitcoin, you need overwhelming majority (90%+). In any other system, a dictator might have already kicked out Bitmain, but in bitcoin the rules are such that as long as you abide by the rules anyone is allowed in. This also protects miners that are in a grey area (like Bitmain). Who is to say that Bitmain is truly evil? Who determines what is evil? Giving that power to an institution or people has always been a slippery slope. Even if we believe that Bitmain is evil, it puts a dangerous precedent to remove them while they remain within the rules. So consensus in bitcoin rather allows Bitmain to remain than risking putting a dangerous precedent.
However, an actor that goes against consensus, one that actually dares to 51% attack the network, will be deemed an enemy of bitcoin. It will be no problem to achieve consensus to change the rules to shut them out. I imagine the change will be such that it specifically blacklists the mining equipment that Bitmain uses, making their initial investment in equipment go to 0.

It's quite simple. Their nerve broke. Couldn't handle the pressure anymore.
This process is quite deliberate. The price works like a dragnet. A spike is artificially created to attract people. Then the long drawn out process of battering spirits (bear market) is allowed to occur to sift through the garbage. Only the gold is left behind (Hodlers).
Why do you think sustained price increases were possible with bitcoin and not with other assets? It's because bitcoin has a limited supply and it's because of the hodlers. The existence of weak hands slows down price increases. So the market weeds them all out before a new bull run is possible.

In short, the more savers there are, the more it increases the leverage of the spenders. Another way of saying it, is that the more bitcoin go out of circulation due to savers, the more the price can increase when the spenders use bitcoin. People have to realize how important savers are. 
Let me remind people that for bitcoin to become useful, it REQUIRES a larger market cap than we have now. The interesting stuff that is possible with bitcoin can only be done if the market cap increases. 
Bubbles tend to get a bad rep, because we only read about the failures. Yet, when oil first came around, the bubbles in that market is what actually attracted participants to join that market. Let's face it. Without greed, a lot of markets would never have come off the ground and become mainstream. The bubbles are necessary for fast growth.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:52:16
But most of the gold is stored in vaults by central banks. The market cap reflects that. Believe me, it's not the jewelry aspect that is supporting such a massive market cap. It's main use is as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:49:15
It's a minority that supports it (Cobra, Luke jr and a few others). Most are against. 
I also think it's a bad idea. But where I differ with others, is that I think it's worth discussing. Because while I do believe that the mining situation will improve, I'm fairly sure that better solutions are possible. But the situation has to play out first before we can craft such a solution.

For a noob hardware wallet is the best option. For an advanced user, it's software.
The issue is that the future is murky. There's a good chance there will be a full blown hacker war in the future where no piece of hardware is safe. The last line of defense is a hardware wallet. The future is closer than we might think.

Historically bitcoin has crashed 80-90% after each rise where a rise is between x10 - x60. The peak was 20k. So theoretically it could crash to 2k. Prices then stay flat for 1 -1.5 years. Then a new cycle starts (numbers are guesstimates from memory).
Also, if you check the reddit posts, there are a lot of posts complaining about price or making accusations against people that make negative price predictions. For anyone that's been in bitcoin for awhile, this makes us smile. This is the behaviour of noobs/weak hands. It's often a sign that prices can go lower. Why? Weak hands are prone to think short term, so they will sell when they make a minor profit. Whales (large investors) know this, so they are not inclined to prop up the price when they know that the weak hands will drive the price down anyways. Some whales even drive prices down on purpose to get it over with (best to flush out the cancer early). This also trains people to deal with volatility and produces more strong hands. It's only when all the weak hands are eliminated that a sustained price increase is feasible.
However, there's one caveat. Hedge funds and other wallstreet groups have now entered the market. It's clear to me that they probably prevented prices from falling too much (this is a mere guess). Not sure what their intent is. It might be that they have their own plan and history might thus not repeat itself.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:43:18
Let me ask one final question then and I can get to my main point. Do you believe that gold has been adopted and is in use as a store of value? And if not, how do you explain its marketcap?

Lightning network.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:06:25
Btc can survive 1k. It can even handle going back to 100 dollars. But we will likely have to experience either some kind of speculative attack or a serious hacking/ddos event or both to reach those numbers. Might mean cheap coins. And let's face it, those days WILL come. The banks will soon start playing dirty and governments will probably join in.
That's why, don't use up all your money even when you believe the bottom is in. Keep some aside for the cheap coin scenario.

Market confidence would be 0 for someone new that doesn't understand the technology. But even if that went to 0, the current community is enough to kickstart an economy. We don't need new participants to make btc go up in value. New participants make the price go up faster, but even if nobody new stepped in, it would be a matter of time before prices started rising again. Because the current participants would simply buy up all the coins.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:22:50
The theory doesn't seem to hold true in practice (at least for bitcoin). The problem with advocating for spending, is that it's top down reasoning. It's the same problem as with how the EU wants citizens to spend their money, but they won't. Unless you understand people's situations and motivations, you won't ever get them to spend. 
Instead of focusing on convincing people to act, which has worked poorly on a large scale throughout history, it's better to focus on climate control, where they are inclined to spend without anyone telling them anything. Only if bitcoin is a store of value can this ever happen. The climate has been created by the central banks. Bitcoin as a store of value capitalizes on that environment.

Even if the second point is true, it doesn't change the fact that even by sitting still, gold is being used by the central banks.
As for the organic use, the reason gold defeated all the other competitors, was mainly because it was difficult to increase the gold production (affecting the economics). Bitcoin has gold beat on this most important aspect. Not to mention that its other money qualities are superior.
But my main point is that if we acknowledge that gold is being used by central banks, we must also acknowledge the counter intuitive aspect that gold is in use even by sitting still. This was mind blowing when I first realized this, but I cannot see any other way but to conclude this.
@_date: 2018-06-21 23:56:20
The powers that be might save us one more time. But it's doubtful. Think it will be a disaster honestly. FED and other central banks have almost no influence on GDP anymore, so they may be out of firepower. Perhaps the IMF can still save us.
But if they can't, we might be heading to an apocalyptic scenario. There's no way in hell they'll allow bitcoin to advance peacefully. I still think bitcoin has a good chance to survive despite this. 
But make no mistake. The cockroaches will be crawling out from under the rocks for this one. They prefer secrecy, but bitcoin might force their hand. It ain't gonna be pretty. If any one thinks we can escape this without any blood flowing, doesn't understand the implications of money and the power that goes along with it. And is frankly too naive.

A pricing in only has effect with unchanged supply. If the supply alters the math must reset. This is simply economic reality. I initially thought the same as you. But after thinking about it, I realized that simple physical reality would force the pricing in to be altered. Trace Mayer has the same line of reasoning.

Perhaps you are correct on Gresham's law. I'll read up more on this.
As for why sitting on other rare items wouldn't work, it's because they also need the other properties of money. Without that, it cannot win against gold as a store of value. It's not enough for something to be rare, it needs to have the properties of money. 
But if bitcoin wins as a store of value, it will only be a matter of time before it becomes a medium of exchange and a unit of account. This is the same path that gold took. I claim that as long as the monetary properties are generally superior (in theory as well as in practice), an item succeeding in winning as store of value will ultimately become a currency as well.
As for other crypto's, the market is still in its early stage. Most of the coins have pisspoor security compared to bitcoin. Not to mention that many of them are not decentralized. Alot of coins still need to learn lesson one. If you are not decentralized, it's only a matter of time before you will be killed. This was why e-gold failed. And many crypto's don't take decentralization seriously enough. 
In other words, the durability property of money hasn't been properly tested yet by the market. But it will. Not only will it be outright war between blockchains, where they will hack each other, it's only a matter of time until the government must forcibly try to kill bitcoin. And only a store of value can hope to survive in such an environment.
If we start building bitcoin as a medium of exchange, it can evolve into a unit of account. But it cannot obtain the store of value property. But something that starts as a store of value, can evolve to the other properties. Not only can it evolve to the other properties, but it will be tougher to topple, since it has a better foundation. A currency without a proper foundation will never survive when all the governments start attacking it.
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:17:18
If you want to be accurate, bitcoin will be deflationary when the increase of the coins (inflation of the money supply) is slower than the increase of the economy. New products and services tend to expand the economy, so an economy expands overtime. If a coin is neither deflationary or inflationary, but in the middle, new coins need to be released at the same pace as the rate of increase of an expanding economy. Since bitcoin's inflation will eventually slow down and even stop, its ultimate fate is deflation.
However, speculation may obscure the moment we hit the point when the pace of inflation matches the growth of the economy. Right now, speculation is the main force driving the price increase. Of course, expectation of future deflation is part of the speculation, and speculation is pricing in future potential of the results of that deflation in today's prices.

Not that I particularly like those spam attacks. But they are beneficial for bitcoin. 
The best analogy that I can make is that people have an immune system. By getting sick that immune system gets stronger. We don't like that process, but it's better that it occurs.
Similarly, by spamming bitcoin (may be bcashers or other parties), the network becomes stronger overtime. Capacity also increases as a result. This allows bitcoin to handle more amounts of people.

Bcash wanted to do all transactions on the original layer through a blocksize increase. That would allow transactions per second to go up. The problem with a blocksize increase, is that even under the best circumstances you would never be able to increase it where we could compete with Visa. 
Andreas made the definitive argument against a blocksize increase. But people keep trying to dodge this video. Nobody on the bitcoin cash side has ever managed to properly address it.
In the end, we decided to scale bitcoin with a second layer (Lightning Network). This is the same way the gold standard (fiat backed by gold) as well as the internet (other protocols stacked on top of TCP/IP) solved similar problems.

I agree it's rational. But there's a funny thing we found out. Do you know the people that made the most money with the S&amp;P index? The people that made the most money, were the people that died. Second place went to the people that just forgot they bought it and had bad memories.
Statistically, a hold strategy was the best strategy for making money. It seems that this so called rationality seems to be the biggest enemy in making profits. The rationality you speak of is only suitable for short term decisions. But if two groups of people compete, the ones that consistently made the longterm decisions will beat out the short termers.
Now, there's no guarantee that this will play out the same. But that's why intense study is a necessity. For someone that understands the tech, the risk people claim hodlers take, is not that much of a risk at all. 
But even if it doesn't play out the way we envision, most of the advice investment advisers give is only possible if one is capable of withstanding market pressure. If you can't do that, any advice they give will turn out useless. Because half of your strategies will fail, because you let yourself be influenced by fear. A hodl strategy is thus not a bad strategy for someone new learning the market.

Compromise sounds nice and cuddly and is also an innate belief that we can "manage" ourselves out of any situation were we but reasonable enough. The problem is that hidden actors can hide behind this so called "reasonableness" to sabotage the development process. It's basically concern trolling (look up the term).
Let's suppose the devs did indeed do the "reasonable" thing and did indeed increase the base size to 2mb. What you would soon find out, is that there would be an immediate attempt to increase it to 3mb. And then 4, 8, 16 etc. Because mixed in with all the reasonable people are a lot of people that just want to see the project fail.
Until there's a method to out these kind of people and reveal their real motives, it's better to just ignore any call to increase the size and divert attention to how to genuinely scale. Don't be quick to "manage" yourself to peace and quiet. The fact that people can't handle chaos is what the parasites are counting on.

Bigger block sizes are not evil. But we have to prioritize concentrating on finding a different way to scale first. The longer we spam the core devs with kicking the can down the road (as raising the block size is), the longer we prevent them from thinking up these alternatives. 
IF the coredevs have truly gone evil, it is better to start a new altcoin or a fork, than to try kicking these guys out. Because if it were really possible to displace the coredevs, it would mean that bitcoin would be vulnerable to outside forces (an outcome possibly worse than a 51% attack). The best way to beat the coredevs, is by competing in the market. Not by kicking the coredevs out and claiming their work as your own.

It would be a different matter if those weapons actually worked in terms of GROWTH. That it didn't paints a certain picture, a picture that is most likely noticed by countries such as China and Russia. 
It would be fine if America worked in a vacuum, but unfortunately for them, they don't. It matters not what we plebes think, but only what those with leverage think. Because those with leverage determine where confidence will eventually end up going. And the ones with leverage have just dumped US treasuries on a massive scale.

Yeah, but it seems to be the only real offensive instrument they've got. The only real instrument they have that can affect growth. All the other measures I've heard about seem to be defensive in nature.
I'm pretty sure that if they had other measures that could affect growth to the extent QE does, I would have heard about it by now. The CB is under pressure and I would imagine they would love to demonstrate to the world that they have instruments that work. And if they do have, they should really do some marketing and market that instrument more. You can't show a weak side to the markets.

Yes, and he was quite wise to stay out of it. It amplified his believability to newcomers tenfold. Even Nick Szabo who remained neutral most of the time, was not able to remain neutral any longer, while Andreas still managed to do so.
There's an initial problem that some of the misinformation were so blatant in their scope, that it's incredibly hard to combat it. The technicals behind bitcoin is so complex, that one can say any untrue thing about it and get away with it. The energy required to craft a lie is many times smaller than the energy required to refute it. That's why Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd had to personally come  in to address these accusations in the beginning. Now they've got more help (whalepanda and excellion on twitter), but the problem still remains that the spokesperson requires technical knowledge to combat the lies.

It's easy sailing with bitcoin at the moment, but make no mistake. The attempt to destroy bitcoin will come and it will be a rocky ride from then on. Only the people with steel nerves will be able to keep their bitcoin. Most will cave under the scare tactics. You can't afford people by your side who are constantly yammering to sell.
On the flip side, if you decide to keep it a secret, your wife will certainly not appreciate it. And the sudden influx of wealth once the secret is revealed (if bitcoin gets to 10k per coin) may make her go crazy. It's not a coincidence that lottery winners end up even worse than before.
Your best bet: reveal that you have a hidden stash, but do not reveal the particulars. Also that it's a hassle to cash it out and that it requires a process, so you rather not move it or touch it. You should tell her that she should carry on her life ignoring this stash and live her regular life and not obsess over it. 
Now, if you manage to cash out btc and be rich, remember to tell your wife to carry on as if nothing has changed. Let her repeat this sentence 10x: Lottery winners have no good end. She should carry on as if nothing has changed and her spending behavior must not be affected with this influx of sudden wealth.

What he said. 
Also, Lynette doesn't seem to grasp the concept of nodes. "Even if it's decentralized, it will always have to go through a node." Thus implying that transactions can be tracked. Must be the dumbest statement ever. Or, Lynette herself is a plant and tries to confuse people with a statement like this. The entire point of having many nodes, is that it is problematic to track a transaction due to being spread around the world. So what if it goes through a node. How will you know which node was the important one?

Or maybe he's not. When this debate popped up, i was on the boards 24/7 at the time. I've clearly seen efforts of vote manipulation with reddit threads. Threads that were just posted and were sent to the frontpage impossibly fast in just 2 minutes. 
Now, some of the arguments that are raised are certainly valid. Attacks that employ divide and conquer tactics usually work exactly because they use plausible arguments that are indeed attention worthy. But playing too much along the idea of one side against the other is playing too much into the hands of the perpetrators.
The entire debate is foolish anyways. It rests on the idea that something like bitcoin needs marketing or needs to make an effort in pleasing the customer. That is only necessary when there's no crisis around the corner. We are THIS close to a new great depression. In such a scenario we won't be begging people to come to us. They'll be begging for us coming to them. Even if capacity problems exist, under such a scenario bitcoin success is almost assured.
But people that bitch about this like to evade this topic. How about we discuss how close we are to a great depression?

The tone of this video seems more like an ad. Andreas seems to put too much emphasis on certain words making it seem like he's trying to forcefully convince the audience.

Ironically his speech at the moment is too practiced at the point of not seeming to be genuine.

From my understanding, a lot of core devs are also not advocating that everyone should be a full node. But they are saying that it should be as many as possible. If the barrier of entry is too high, there will be no timely second wave of node users incoming to take up the slack when the first wave goes down. Because they WILL attack node users.
And this is also the reason the email analogy is weak. Because email was innocent enough not to warrant powerful enemies. Bitcoin will eventually have all the elite coming after it. If you think they will allow bitcoin to go unchallenged, you're nuts.

It's jarring, but he does have a point that one should change one's mind when new data arrives.
But the fact that it's jarring also means he hasn't polished his advice enough. I advise people to only buy a crash of 80-90%. Telling everyone to buy the dip might have worked early stage, but it won't work in the later stages. Forces will converge to suppress bitcoin prices. Bull army can only remain strong if everyone concentrates their firepower when a real crash occurs. But if everyone starts buying minor dips, they focus on winning small clashes, while losing the big one. Bull army is wasting firepower that way.

There's a lot of junk articles out there about lightning. Not sure what their motives are exactly. The main issue is that while lightning is not ideal, raising the blocksize is even worse. Not that I'm 100% against a blocksize increase, but nobody is willing to discuss the security measures taken when the worst case scenario occurs. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:48:23
The lightning network is not ideal for sure, but it's better than raising the blocksize.
But even though the solution isn't as secure as bitcoin itself, from my understanding the lightning network (from what I remember watching a few Andreas videos) is plenty decentralized and relatively trustless. These are the important concerns.

The thing I find wrong with the spending mentality, is that it discounts how powerful the effect of holding is or that it ignores how holding bitcoin IS using bitcoin (as a store of value). And how important it is for the future of bitcoin to become the de facto store of value.

Regarding whether a blocksize increase is good or not (bitcoin core preferring a small blocksize and bitcoin cash wanting a bigger one), I refer you to this:
This is the de facto nail in the coffin for the large blocksize argument. Nobody from the other side has ever successfully countered it. They avoid talking about it like the plague and if they do talk about it, it quickly goes south for them (which is why they avoid it).

Supposedly, bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset compared to the stock market, etc. If that is true, there should be no effect if the stock market crashes (negative correlation is also correlation). Bitcoin would simply do its own thing.
Of course, it would also depend on why the stocks crashed. A doomsday event might cause stocks to crash and bitcoin to rise. But not really because of stocks. More because of the special event.

From my understanding, it's only possible to censor transaction with a 51% attack, not steal them. An attack is an enormous investment in resources, where the entire investment is lost. If there is profit to be had, it's only by those that have an opposing monopoly. That rules out almost all regular hackers. Even other blockchain projects will hesitate to execute such an attack, because it's not a sure bet they can reap profits from doing so (many of them don't have a large enough size where such an attack will be profitable).
There really is only one opponent for whom it might really be profitable to attempt it. The parties that own the fiat monopoly.

Ok, let's suppose that he's right. And that LN is pure evil. How is he going to get around this one then:
This video is the de facto video debunking a large blocksize. Every large blocksize supporter has avoided this video like the plague. And for those few that tried debunking this, it all went south for them (which is why most avoid talking about this video).
At the very least, the only conclusion we can draw is that a second layer is required and that bigger blocks are simply unworkable. And segwit is required for second layers. 
Now, it's possible that LN is pure evil. But where is their work constructing an alternative second layer? Because advocating for bigger blocks while this video exists seems like sabotage to me.

I get that as a VC, he probably gets spammed to an extent he has to say NO many times. As open minded as Naval is, he has stretched himself considerably to accept more than any other. He even gives scams a chance, because he believes one cannot predict success adequately to not give them a chance (true to a certain extent).

Because having multiple currencies is like going back to barter, which is insane. We invented the gold standard to avoid dealing with exchange rates. One single currency makes everything far simpler. 
Not to mention that it puts businesses on a level playing field. It would be insane to go out of business because of exchange rate issues, while you deliver a better price/quality ratio for your product than your competitor as well as having lower basic costs. Meanwhile the inefficient businesses somehow survive for the simple reason that some government or other manipulated the exchange rate.

Of course nothing will happen when the blocksize limit is raised. But that is also what makes assessing this so problematic. We've seen what happened with how early devs of the internet actively fought against greater security measures for the internet. They basically got ignored and guess what happened when they got ignored. Nothing. That is, until two decades later when all the problems started popping up due to those decisions (NSA, Snowden, etc). 
Not that I'm opposed to a blocksize increase. I think it's better to initiate a mistake on purpose in order to create precedent. If it's not a mistake, excellent. But if it is, I hope you will still be around to own up to it?
I'm all for an increase, but then we should determine the terms under which we might recover in case of the worst case scenario. Not considering the worst case scenario and having no plans for it is irresponsible.

Scalability for instance. A larger blocksize is simply not scalable to massive amounts of people or even long distances. The bitcoin cash people try to hide this issue will all their might. If they go with a large block size, they CANNOT keep their promise of nano transactions. Heck, the promise of bitcoin cash operating as simply a cash replacement would already be problematic.

Sure we can taze people. But then what? They can go on to become terrorists or criminals. Tazing might even egg them on to become such people. They can even claim martyrdom to get more people to join them. This is much less of a problem with guns, so it's also the reason law enforcement has never moved on to other weapons.

A trade war will probably devolve into a currency war. In that case, all fiat currency will be devalued in a downwards spiral. The funny thing with a currency war, is that if you win it, you also lose. Because a worthless currency might be worthwhile in the short term, but its at the expense of your population on the long run.
If the devaluation is a serious one, we would expect the black hole effect of bitcoin to be more prominent. Just imagine an appreciating currency, with a scarcity superior to gold, being thrown into a mix of currencies whose value turns to dogshit......

Personally, I don't see much of a problem. Downvotes are actually one of the major tools used to censor information.
What is it we actually want from reddit? That the most relevant information floats to the top. We can't be expected to wade through hundreds of pages to get the information we want. That task can be accomplished with the upvote button alone. No downvote system required.
Whenever we downvote, we are not just expressing our opinion, but we are also forcing down our opinion upon others. We are in effect deciding through our collective force what other people are not allowed to see.
I've seen many relevant posts get downvoted to oblivion. While those posts were critical to understanding the gist of the problem.
There's also the problem of how human psychology was shaped by evolution. We are naturally predisposed to be risk averse. This makes us remember and experience the negative much more vividly than the positive. This behaviour is even demonstrated by the price behaviour of btc, where negative news has more of an impact than positive news. This is why downvotes tend to be more prevalent than upvotes. It's a real problem and some forums have been destroyed by this particular phenomenon. 
And with bitcoin, there are many people interested that you don't see particular posts. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:09:50
And they should lock up most of their bitcoin. I'm not saying this just from a moneymaking perspective, I'm saying this from a disaster/insurance perspective. World is looking bad at the moment. Telling people to use up all their bitcoin in a spending spree is also not what we want them to do. Because when shit hits the fan, they will have no defense for what is coming.

Correlation is not causation. IMO, that fees correlate at all, is because they buy the btc for other reasons. In other words, it's the other way around. Fees do not result in people buying btc, it's people buying btc that affects the heights of the fees.
As for the rest, Trace makes some good points. If you study how network effects grow (Facebook, Twitter, internet, etc), they have always grown by targeting a niche audience first. This is why any silicon valley youtube video talking about growing a business has always warned startups not to target a large audience (leads to bankruptcy). 
Why target a niche? Because they are often the most loyal of customers and they have the time and energy to spread brand awareness. As well as the cash reserves. 
When you have no brand loyalty, the customer base will be too flimsy and can leave at the bat of an eyelash. It's like building a house on quicksand. Brand loyalty is the basis of any business. Targeting ONLY microtransactions is basically suicide at the moment. Because you are targeting people that have no loyalty and are people that do not believe in the product enough to fork over large amounts of money. Sure, it's possible that a lot of people can enter the bitcoin ecosystem at once through micro transactions. But as they enter, so they can easily leave again the moment something happens (and as we know, in bitcoin there's ALWAYS something happening).
This is basic knowledge for startups. Paradoxically, they become mainstream by not targeting the mainstream first.
The privacy issue is important in this regard. If we raise the blocksize (he's not against it he said), we should not do it for microtransactions. I think he's right that privacy protections are probably a better niche to target.

It's certainly an interesting point. Until you realize that if they get to invest our money, they also get to reap most of the rewards. The piddling interest and piece of the pie we get from that is pocket change compared to the profits they are making.
And the thing is, what the banks are doing is not rocket science. Or atleast, they are not skills that belong to only a chosen few. They can be learnt with time. The profits they are making, WE could be making by learning to invest our own money and bypassing the middleman. But regular joe's are often hampered from entering the same markets as the banks through regulations. As well that most people don't have the time to learn the skills, because we are all forced to work fulltime jobs due to inflation (guess who's fault that is). 
So meanwhile, they get to claim to "help" the economy by investing in it, but the only thing that actually gets helped are their own pockets and the phenomenon of financialization, which artificially increases GDP without adding anything really meaningful to it. GDP as it is now has a lot of hot air within it. Most of the value is fake with a lot of inefficiencies.

Yes. Mostly minor fluctuations (in most situations not even causing a fluctuation), which may seem to be big in the short term, but are small where the long trend is concerned. 
Let's take the recent dip from $1800 to $1700. Someone who isn't familiar with bitcoin would say that the main reason the price crashed, was because of the recent news of the massive hack. This is not the true reason. The true reason is that the price was already skyrocketing and a correction was overdue. The news about the hack merely made it easier to decide the timing of the correction.

I don't think you need to tell anyone here that the money aspect is important. We know. 
But one should realize that the meme about technology and money was uttered under specific circumstances and directed at a specific audience. It should be taken in context. I believe it was Andreas that first uttered it. But he said it at a time when people were knocking bitcoin based on the price. 
It is very hard to demonstrate to people how value arises.  Because most of the mechanics occur unseen within the mind. Most people don't even bother to theorize about the mechanics behind it because of this and try to judge value based on what they can see (price). Andreas has a very good grasp on these mechanics. 
But for people that don't even try to follow the arguments, the approach needs to be different. So he pointed people towards the value aspects of bitcoin that could be SEEN and that were not affected by price.

It's possible that you are right. If there's one thing I learned in this subreddit, it's paranoia. Even paranoia about my own psychology.
Anyways, crowd psychology usually shows up on the subreddit as well. But maybe r/bitcoin is mature enough where we can no longer see that phenomenon here.
But I'm also comparing this bubble to past bubbles. We've only reached twice the last ATH (which wasn't much higher than the ATH before that). Past bubbles had growth that was atleast 5x. And considering how long it took for this bubble to start (much longer than any of us thought), the built up energy should probably reach 5x atleast as well.

I think Gavin was a great guy. But he was no leader. Trying to push him as one is questionable behavior. 
I do think we are still at a stage where thought leaders are useful. But there are many who are more suitable for that role than Gavin, including on the rbtc side. Trying to put Gavin into that role, I could only see it as an incompetent play (same with the people pushing for Craig Wright). 
if you guys really want to succeed at this, you need someone more believable. Someone like Jeff Garzik for example.

Having seen bitcoin grow, it made me realize how irrelevant the news cycle is. News has nearly no effect on bitcoin price.
Several explanations possible. News has more effect in industries that has already accomplished most of its growth. When growth is small due to saturated markets, people have to fight over every small gain. Every kind of leverage needs to be optimally utilized. So news plays a bigger role there.
Another explanation is also that news tends to have a smaller impact than most people think on the general populace. Regular people often don't tend to respond to information. Unless they are directly affected. Most news falls in the indirect category. The only people that react to information are those that make it their business as well as those ethnic groups that learned the hard way to respond to information.
Indirect news only tends to affect the population when there is intent behind it (to make it seem direct). A media campaign coupled with political activity for example.
In case of bitcoin, it has already been noted that news has nearly no effect. So traders have already started ignoring most news articles. Most of the time, if the price has been seemingly affected by news, it was mostly coincidental. 
The above is but a rough outline. Obviously, exceptions exists. What I have noted is that traders do seem to respond to news items that have a direct influence on volume. A news article is questionable if it has effect, but when an exchange goes down, the effect on volume is not questionable. The price must adjust accordingly. It must be noted however, that even this news tends to have minimal effect in recent months, because there are now so many exchanges to pick up the slack.

Personally, I think Gavin was behaving funny ever since he got back from that CIA meeting. My impressions of Gavin were favourable, but it was clear something was wrong ever since he was publicly seen together with Hearn. I think this was the video:
That seemed like deliberate means of associating Gavin's reputation to Hearn's.
Ever since then, Gavin's been going downhill. If it was his own intent or he was coerced, I have no idea. But I find it unlikely that he couldn't see the problems with Wright's story. Why can it be so obvious for even people that don't know code (like me), but somehow a bitcoin expert like Gavin couldn't see the problems with Wright's story? Seems to me that some people "convinced" Gavin to push Wright into the public sphere. If I look at it that way, Gavin's actions make sense. 
They already failed highjacking bitcoin with XT and Classic. So they went with Wright instead.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:41:37
Well, I'll be bold in saying that Hearn is what probably ties all these instances together. Of course it's possible we are dealing with multiple enemies here and that we see the results of different parties interfering. In that case, I might be misinterpreting some of the events. But in case we are dealing with a single enemy....
I tried giving the XT and Classic project the benefit of the doubt, even with Hearn at the helm. Stupidity and incompetence can often explain things at a sufficient level. That was until I read that if XT succeeded, it would mean that Core devs would be displaced. I think I even read a post where Hearn publicly admitted this. It was then that I decided that stupidity and incompetence was no longer a sufficient reason. This was truly an attempted coup. 
The troll accounts could be simply greedy bitcoin people that wanted their bitcoin to rise quickly in price. Hearn's involvement quickly made me change my mind.

Also, to clarify my other post, Ver may have had no choice but to let degrade to that point. Like I stated, he had a monetary incentive to keep the community from imploding. 
Theymos had to ban a lot of people to avert the attack on It couldn't be helped that innocent users were also banned during that event. Alot of users were also misled by the troll accounts. Meaning, alot of dissatisfied users came into existence. Instead of allowing these users to spread all over the internet and damage bitcoin's reputation further, he herded them to a single subreddit to contain the damage.
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:56:01
He took it over, because he and probably industry people didn't want the community to split based on inaccurate info. So he painted himself as a problocker in order to accomplish that.

Not sure about Matonis. His case doesn't make sense to me. My theory only concerns Roger Ver. I could be wrong of course, but the timing of when came along was just too planned for my taste. Ver has a monetary incentive to keep the bitcoin community from imploding. And the community was close to exactly such a situation when he invited everyone to r/btc.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:23:19
I don't know what Gavin has been smoking, but it seems to be contagious. Even Matonis seems to have imploded. That's no coincedence. Brian Armstrong seems to have gone bonkers as well. Foul play involved? Don't know. 
I'm suspecting that Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees are coordinating their stories. I don't think they caught the insanity bug.

Anyways, it will be interesting what happens from here. With Brexit the game has suddenly accelerated. All these forces will suddenly converge and will ultimately push bitcoin to the forefront. 
They say that bitcoin will be a peaceful revolution. Bitcoin is a direct attack on the seat of power of the most powerful families. I kinda doubt this will go down peacefully. Either way, it will be interesting to see what happens from here on out. I give it a max of two years before shit hits the fan.

If by underlying value, you mean intrinsic value, you do know that there's no such thing right? There's only utility. And bitcoin has vast amounts of THAT.
As for risk averse, the group of people you refer to, are usually the last people to join a movement. They will be preceded by people who are willing to take more risks. If bitcoin continues appreciating for DECADES, even the risk averse people will eventually join the bandwagon. Afterall, something that is capable of surviving that long must mean something which even the risk averse can't deny.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:51:53
That's only longterm greed though. You would need the patience for the long game to favour 1mb block. What the instigators are counting on, is the ignorance of the people that will forego longterm gain in favour of the short term (through social engineering). And the problem is that people can't see the benefits of the longterm, because you would actually ask them to think and use their brain. People are kinda allergic to that. They have even convinced themselves that the short term gain IS the longterm vision and that these goals are sustainable.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:49:42
To add to this in explaining how the protocol might break, it's any situation that might cause Bitcoin to lose utility. Because that's where Bitcoin differs with beanie babies. UTILITY. Beanie babies were novelties and had limited utility. You really couldn't use them for anything worthwhile or useful. Bitcoin on the other hand has enormous utility. Anything that has utility will always be in demand. Anything that is in demand will always have a market price. Thus, if Bitcoin can retain utility under any circumstance, it will never go to 0. The closest thing that can describe utility that has a very small chance of vanishing is INTRINSIC VALUE. Gold for example has intrinsic value, cause situations that can make it lose its value are very rare indeed (though if you nuke the entire gold supply, bye bye intrinsic value).
What kind of utility does Bitcoin have? It surpasses transaction speeds of banks. It almost has no fees and believe me, current fees you pay for Mastercard and Visa takes away almost half of your margin as a small retailer. Imagine being able to save 90% or more of your margin by bypassing Visa and Mastercard (if you use Bitpay). Currency controls don't work on BTC, you can pass the border with just a memorized bitcoin address (good luck Argentina). Cyprus bail ins like they recently suggested in a 16 hour meeting in Europe (daylight theft) are practically impossible. If you want to donate to a political cause, no government can stop your free speech (wikileaks). But IMO, Bitcoin's most important feature (besides speeding up commerce) is that it's ANTI MIDDLE MAN. I don't think people really realize how important this is, cause there's enormous corruption in the financial sector and I don't think people realize exactly how much of a drain corruption is on the economy (too big to fail banks, I'm looking at YOU). Most tasks done by humans can be done by computers WITHOUT the corruption. All the things Wallstreet does can be coded in BTC. 
And the above is just the few things that are possible with Bitcoin. There are more areas where Bitcoin has massive utility. I can't even fathom how they can compare beanie babies (nearly non existent) utility with the GENUINE utility that BTC offers.
Situations that might prevent BTC from exercising its utility are 51% attacks, the encryption being hacked, internet or electricity network being down for extended periods of time, a fatal bitcoin bug. In a lesser capacity that can impact the utility but not completely erase it: market manipulation, not being able to scale and governments banning Bitcoin.
Mind you, even the most serious scenarios like the encryption being hacked (solvable through an update) or the electricity going down are not guaranteed to kill Bitcoin (as long as a few functioning computers are still around with the blockchain), though they would probably affect the exchange rate in a manner where it might take years to recover.

So far, D'Angelo has demonstrated himself not to be concern trolling and in my mind a good actor. A concern troll would have put far more energy in his trolling, because a troll's purpose is sabotage. D'Angelo has been far too low key to fall into such a category.

IMO, if Bitcoin succeeds, the inevitable demise of traditional currencies is but a matter of time (though the process could take decades). Why? Because Bitcoin is inherently deflationary. It simply makes no sense to keep your money in a currency that's inflationary. 
All Bitcoin needs to do is keep surviving and appreciating. By doing just these two things, volatility will naturally come down, because it takes more and more money to affect the price of a single bitcoin. A constantly appreciating currency is enough to drive adoption, despite the volatility. But when volatility vanishes overtime, this will increase adoption even more.
When the volatility goes down, the perceived risk of bitcoin will lower and trust must therefore increase. If this trust is maintained for a long period of time, bitcoin will become a normal and everyday phenomenon and doubts about its safety will slowly vanish to the background. The moment people forget about their fear, they will realize that keeping your money in bitcoin is more advantageous than keeping it in an inflationary currency. This is why I say that the continued success of bitcoin can only mean the inevitable death of government currency.
But before this happens, bitcoin will likely encounter resistance of governments. It's only when bitcoin has proven to be able to survive government intervention that this has a chance of happening.
As for central banks controlling the interest rates, after some reading up on the issue, I must agree that the existence of central banks is actually more harmful, not less. Sure, they might increase stability.....FOR A TIME (a time could be 2-3 decades). But this stability cannot be achieved without paying a price. It's for this reason that no fiat currency has ever managed to survive till this day.

Also, it seems he did talk to people about it. Not sure if these people are devs or whatnot. But it's a good sign that he's trying to move people to adress it.

Bitcoin can succeed as a store of value alone. Succeeding as a currency would be a welcome bonus. 
IMO, if it succeeds as a store of value, it will eventually succeed as a currency as well. The reason Bitcoin gained traction, was because it kept appreciating. If it continues appreciating, the adoption rate will continue growing despite the volatility. The eventual outcome of such a scenario can only mean that succeeding as a currency is only a matter of time. 
For Bitcoin to really fail, it must fail as a store of value.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:36:06
I think the best explanation of mining is to explain it in terms of scarcity and fairness. A mining system is the best system to ensure that bitcoin appreciates in a somewhat sustainable manner (due to enforced scarcity) and that these coins are fairly distributed among the population. 
If the entire supply of a coin is released to the public, you will have a problem of fairness, where some conflict will be created in who gets to decide who gets the coin and who receives the coin. Who would ever want to buy a coin when one knows that by doing so, you'll enrich the one who holds the most coins? Not to mention that if an unproven coin suddenly came unto the market with their entire supply, price discovery of those coins would be an incredibly messy situation.
With a mining scheme, the coin goes to the people that are willing to expend the most effort, time and money in getting that coin. Coins are then fairly distributed and goes to the ones that works the hardest for it. Those coins will eventually be resold at a slightly higher price than the costs that were necessary in mining those coins.
The above will have an added boon to the exchange rate. If coins get harder to mine over time, it will cost more money to mine those coins (forcing miners to resell those coins at higher prices) AND those coins will thus be scarcer over time( which also results in higher prices due to psychological perception). Both of these added boons will be good for the exchange rate.
A mining scheme is also an exchange rate stabilizer. The price of a coin is both dependent on supply and demand. Sometimes, it is possible that the demand of the coin falters, resulting that supply exceeds the demand for the coin. The echange rate of a coin will thus be lower than the costs to mine that coin and miners will run losses under such a scenario. In that case, some miners will exit the industry, resulting in less competition allowing the rest of the miners to profit again. This will allow the coin to appreciate once more.
Also, an economy is not static. It grows. The supply of money needs to grow together with the economy. However, if this supply of money grows too fast (like with the FED), you'll get inflation and you will run the risk of ruining your currency. Moderate monetary inflation where new coins are being pumped into the economy at a declining rate will ensure that inflation doesn't occur, but deflation. The moderate amount of new coins being created will also ensure that deflation doesn't get too bad.

Again, there's only utility. There's no such thing as intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:01:00
This is false. Bitcoin's main function has always been based on ITS STORE OF VALUE. SOME of the bitcoin proponents would like it to succeed as a currency as well, and heck, maybe the creator intended this. But it's not necessary for success. Gold is not used as a currency, yet it's valued as a store of value.
As for banning, I won't deny that it will have an extreme effect on its price. Heck, the effect might be enough to drive it back to single digits. But it doesn't matter on the long run, cause even if only 0.0001% of the people used it in the black market (where it will eventually end up due to banning), its price will continue to go up due to how bitcoin is designed. Large crowds or mass adoption are not necessary for this to happen, it only accelerates the pace. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:38:55
Gold is certainly a safer store of value, because it's tangible (unlikely to vanish) and is scarce. I do believe that intangibles have proven to have value as well, but that it's long term store of value still needs some development. Bitcoin is the first attempt at this and I do think that it's function as a store of value is more robust than people give it credit for. 
But there will come a day when the internet goes down or the encryption is hacked or a 51% attack is attempted. All of these scenarios are pretty unlikely, but given that time is nearly infinite, even the unlikely will eventually occur. Bitcoin will most likely survive these events, but will probably fail as a safe store of value in spite of surviving. These failures will however spur the community to build even stronger protections that will let intangibles eventually rival tangibles as a store of value. It's through mistakes and failures that true innovation is possible.
And the reason why intangibles are so interesting as a store of value, is because you can design them to have only the strengths of an ideal money/store of value, without any of the weaknesses. The gold price for instance can receive shocks if a new gold mine has been found. Intangibles are fully controlled by the algorithms however. If they manage to build enough protections to survive the most extreme scenario's, these cryptocurrencies will eventually defeat any of the existing asset types.
