Hey sorry for the late reply.
Coinbase is available in Germany, and always was since I started in crypto one year ago :)

Good to see people with the same thoughts! :) 
I also just started to think about money, when I got into bitcoin, my first cryptocurrency :)

Exited what’s going to happen after 10k..

I think what he meant is following:
You are right, when you are buying shares or better said doing bitcoin trades on platforms like plus500 there is one big difference from buying bitcoin from
Coinbase für example:
In plus500 you open a trade and in the worst case the price goes down and you hit your SL.
When you buy bitcoin in coinbase you have the actual coins there, and when the price goes down the coins value you got is „just“ worth less, but no final loss as it would be with a trade

Hey! Welcome in the crypto world! 
Coinbase does probably not give out the btcg after the fork and keep them, like they did with bcc/bch .
Bittrex is an exchange which gave the bcc and probably will also do so with btcg.
The best choice would be as said above to use a cold storage like electrum, or just a printed wallet will do as well, as long as you got your private keys! :)
When you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask!
