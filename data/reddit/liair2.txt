Coinbase does not charge an additional fee for instant purchase when you back your verified account with a Visa card. It is just used as a backup in case your ACH does not go through. Once your mother has a level 2 verified account she'll be able to buy and transact the exact amount she as she needs to spend it (up to a daily limit).

This works flawlessly for loading your steam wallet. I've purchased 3 $20 cards in the past week for the recent sales.

So would it appear that he was fine tuning his hashrate in order to secure the infant network? Does this lead anyone to believe that he's destroyed his private keys? Curious how people interpret this speculation. Well written article, thank you

do they want to only accept coins that are being tracked and potentially flagged by coinbase as "safe"?

100 points is 1 dollar off a future purchase

It's been awhile since I used gyft to buy but I believe you get 5% of the dollar value so you get $5 worth of points or 500 points you should be able to see how many points you'd get before you check out

This is where having a coinbase account is nice. You can send to his email and he will be able to set up an account to have access to the funds you sent. From that point on you can show him how to get his own private wallet and transfer from coinbase to his private wallet.
YMMV based on your country. And coinbase is evil, centralized... etc etc

Since credit card transactions are very easy to reverse do not expect to find a lot of people willing to trade near market price, if at all. How much are you looking to get a hold of?

Except those units are divisible. There is actually a little under 2 quadrillion units.

There is a new type specialized of device that can mine at a rate much faster than a GPU can. They are still rare but after they are deployed in higher numbers the rate of return from a GPU will go way down.
