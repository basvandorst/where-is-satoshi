Thanks for the questions, I am very happy to answer, I do a little preamble to explain why I decided to put the photo here on reddit.
I have a small computer lab in a town near a big city in the Puglia region, the workshop goes discreetly. I met the BitCoin in 2011 using some faucet that first gave a few cents for watching advertising and now those few clicks worth a few hundred euro. I never ceased to keep an eye on the issue BitCoin, but in the last period, as many grew my interest and I started studying the situation better. I have yet to decide whether to belong to BC or BU nodes, but I have very clear the fact that I like to use that money that is decentralized.
Often, the centralization of government has allowed to limit or convey the purchasing power of US buyers with the imposition of taxes, arbitrary withdrawal of money from bank accounts or even the decision to not release the money until further notice ( as has happened in Greece a few years ago).
Hence my desire as a consumer thinking you want to use a currency that can not be controlled by a government, but it can be managed from me by people like me. Since I was born I have seen the transition from the currency of Italy "LIRA" to the currency of Europe 's "€ URO", this step has weighed a lot on the Italian financial situation, you think that the purchasing power has fallen by half, 1 € 1936.27 = L (1 € = 2000 L), beginning the purchasing power was identical, a Coke, it cost 1500 L now costs € 1.5. I'm not an economist so I can not evaluate the reasons, but I understand that a currency affects the lives of human beings in the modern world.
The BitCoin could be a great alternative to coins handled by governments, and become a currency managed by the people, a coin "unique" that would allow trade in freedom without the risk or the fear that overnight you are seized because a guy in politics it decided so.
So I think the best way to launch an idea is to do and not to talk (you talk a lot and do very little), so I decided to accept BitCoin in my shop to allow other people to come in contact with ideas alternatives and allowing you to innovate a little the situation in a country that is made up mostly of older people. In short, I'm breaking your balls as we say.
With this introduction to answer domandre:
-How Often does a client pay in bitcoins?
A customer pays very rarely bitcoin, being my country especially composed of great people, who are reluctant to change, it is not easy to be paid in BTC. Usually I sponsor him with a discount of 20% and explain to people a little more competent what are they and why should use them.
I also add that there is a lot of ignorance on the subject, the few who knew him thought that I allowed the purchase of drugs (silkroad docet), and of course it does not.
-Do You usually you suggest it or do most user alredy know ou accept it?
Usually I expect people ask me because of the 20% discount, but when they are a bit more free and I find people who are competent in IT I propose it.
-what Are Italy's tax as Concerning bitcoin?
In Italy, it is not illegal and there are no specific taxes on bitcoin, when there is a tax (VAT of 22%) on every purchase. What I do is make me pay in bitcoins and then do the bill in € of the value of the service. After, i pay tax in €.
Wallet What do you use for your business?
I MULTIBIT HD use, and after every transaction I move btc safe, being a small business and knowing the people that come to my lab, I trust and therefore do not expect the 10 minutes needed for confirmation. Once we arrived the notification of the payment is done.
I conclude by saying that I think just using bitcoins will go ahead, and not speculating above or by being the struggle between BU or BC or otherwise.
G. Traslate helped me ;)

Bisq for me. Decentralised P2P exchange. What could be much better for bitcoin???
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:27:45
After every fear/sell we become more coscient, because the government understand and try to kill, because we learn from our error, and become much stronger.
Buy, low and hold. I don't sell, I buy with my crypto useful things and services... 
But I don't sold 1 satoshi for not a single FIAT DIRTY AND CONTROLLED MONEY, UNTIL CRYPTO BECOME THE ONLY UNSTOPPABLE MONEY FOR FREE PEOPLE.

I use bisq, or buy from telegram group and ask for an escrow. I love this two method because is simply and you don't have to register or send documents to anyone

I only cash out with bisq. There is a moderator system.
I that buy I have to put some coin to block during the operation of exchange.
Who sell heve to put some coin to block untill the operation of exchange is complete.
If there is a dispute, there is a moderator that verify that the buyer and the seller are correct each other.
I think is much trusty that a normal exchange especially when we talk about crypto.
I really don't understand how deposit his credentials in a site to buy crypto.

This means that we are not ready, and who is involved in bitcoin trading and market are not ready.
If one who don't no how to make a single google search before the last 2 year, whit a single speach may collapse some value it's not good for us.
We have to be strong and preparate to this fight between crypto and Fiat.
This is just the first move... But not the last. 
Hodl, understand and fight for a new future.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:36:39
Who think that the bitcoin and crypto is only a speculative asset will kill the bitcoin.
The crypto need stability and real life utility... Trading in long time will kill all the trust in this kind of money.
Wait, I know that it's may profitable, but for now. Someone made bitcoin for the people to free from the bank and a speculative ideas of the money. If you transform the idea of that money you will obtain the same money and system that we are try to escape from.
Don't trade, hodl and spend is the only way to keep going to the Moon ;)

Thanks to all... I finally reinstall the last version of multibit classic. It didn't allow me to send the btc because it didn't sync.
After the sync is complete I can send the money (of present and future.)
It's funny that I recover around 100$ form an old wallet when 1 btc value is 233$. My 0.21btc of 55$ purchase of may 2015 now are 961$.
Keep on hodl guys ;)

Wow, I have an idea: we, or someone else, should to create a social networks where you can point (geotag) an address(crypto address) where you can donate. You may certificate your identity to connect to the work in the street (like Street art) and the artist.  This may improve micropaiment as an incentive or a donation to that work!
Great story, thanks to share and good idea ;)
