Yeah who knows, it's all relative. There are "Houses" you can buy for just a couple of BTC right now. 
Just for reference as of 2018 there are aprox. 138.5 Million "Housing Units" in the US ALONE.

No one is bitching and moaning about boomers. The title is mostly a Joke. The arguments in the article apply to all age groups.

This is assuming anyone who doesn’t believe in Bitcoin is stupid.
Edit: which I do not think, in fact I know a lot of very intelligent people who are detractors.

Haha no chance I'll be absent if there's another 17' like run. Like I mentioned whenever volatility picks up the texts start to come in. I'm in like 20 separate 'crypto' group texts only 1 has survived since 17

No... It's more about the fact that I am trying to focus on other area of my life rather than bitcoin. I have spent an immense amount of time over the last few years talking about bitcoin and thinking about bitcoin. Sometimes Euphorically, sometimes stress-fully. I just need it to take the back seat for a few years. 
I got so clouded by the 2017 bull run that I didn't have any motivation to do anything else but think about bitcoin, stare at charts and shit post for a whole year. That set me back in my Job and socially and emotionally. It was an still is literally hindering my creativity. Now, don't get me wrong, I love BTC and believe in it whole-hardheartedly Long term. I will be back sooner rather than later.

Yeah I've considered that too. I'ts unrealistic though.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:21:40
Yeah man you're right. I probably should've sold off some of my coins that I bought at $0 by now. I'm such a greedy fuck.

Please do yourselves a favor and read the creature from Jekyll Island. This book unpacks the entire history of money and central banking and is very fascinating. It's a little dense at certain time but if monetary history is of any interest to you it will be an easy read.

Yeah this is basically what I'm trying to do.
Edit: I have some STONKS too

It's called having conviction.

I follow both, and I agree between the lines there's often positive content from the 'builders". Either way I'm gonna take a twitter break. I won't last long i'm sure.
