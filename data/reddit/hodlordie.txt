I got bitcoin cash from the split. I just traded up on shapeshift this morning. Got me some more bitcoin.

Dammit! I just saw this article while checking the bitcoin price this morning and I was about to write a very similar post. 
This is very ill informed. Seems like a lot of Forbes articles are. Makes me wonder as with a lot of these style pieces if they aim to bash bitcoin so people don't buy in an effort to protect "old money" 
Don't know if that's mad thinking or not. Fake news and propaganda.

Thank you very much for the highly detailed post. Very informative. Quite a few phrases I was aware of but not really educated on. Really appreciated.

General reply here....
Really appreciate the quick responses all. Think the general consensus is what I already thought. Hodl on and see what happens.

This is my problem. The attack seemed like what the main aim was and now it's failed I just feel like the reaper is hanging over its shoulder.

It wasn't sad when I shot a load in your throat the other night was it? Put that on a badge asshole. 
Grow up and think of some constructive criticism. Then we'll talk.

Admittedly I did not. Ashamed I stooped so low but this is the kind of stuff I hate in this sub. We need  positivity.

SPARTAN! what is your profession? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:31:30
Shit. Not heard about this but I just did a little research and this is terrible.
Was this all your investment? Can you move that on to another exchange? Apologies for my lack of knowledge on the situation 
Here in the UK we seem to be pretty limited for buying options. Do you have localbitcoin in the states? Ive found it pretty good.

Made me think of this
But don't think it's just fake news BROTHER! they could infiltrate this very sub and downvote you and troll you. 
Stay strong and believe!
