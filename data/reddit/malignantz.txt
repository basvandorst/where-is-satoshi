Three wallets for three purposes:
1) Hot wallet on phone - similar to a wallet with cash this is the most easily compromised (pin code/encrypted phone makes it more secure) and most easily spent.
2) Electronic Cold Wallet (bitcoin wallet on old android with all radios disabled) - bitcoins can be kept in a wallet with no fear of being hacked as the phone never connects to internet, only signs transactions and relays them to your internet connected device via Bluetooth. You should backup private keys with a strong password in case your offline wallet/phone dies. Physical access to the offline phone is required to spend, so securing your value is not technical. 
3) Coin Vault - For long-term storage, not easily spendable: Create a non-persistent linux install with a CD-R (USB thumb drive less secure, but works) including Bitcoin bash tools. Boot into non-persistent linux, roll some 16-sided dice and use the script to convert the randomness of your [dice rolls into unhackable, non-predictable bitcoin private keys]( BIP38 encrypt your private key and it can be safely distributed to any friends/relatives for safe keeping. An unencrypted paper wallet can reside in a safety deposit box for retrieval in case of your death. Heavily encrypted copies of your private key(s) should reside in at least two different locations.
edit: I forgot to mention [Bitcoin Armory]( Lots of very cool features and incredibly safe -- requires two computers or a persistent USB environment to separate your private keys from an internet connected computer.

Solves the trust problem arising from a decentralized ledger. Proof of Work means those who verify transactions cannot edit account balances unless they want to throw away serious money. The clever use of hashing and public key cryptography means only the owner of bitcoins can initiate a transfer -- no transactions can be reversed or rolled back (no one has the authority to edit Bitcoin balances/algorithm).

When I donated 2.5 bitcoins were in that account and it appeared to be small amounts contributed very recently. You said you would make an announcement about it. I merely informed people that you didn't make good on your word about making that announcement. You are supposedly a steward of money -- your duty should be to immediately inform the stakeholders about what happened and how it can be ameliorated in the future. I didn't say anything immediately because I wanted to give you a chance to formulate a formal response. A lack of response about ~$1000 loss of funds seems egregious, considering just days after it happened you posted about how much you raised last year during Black Friday, encouraging donations.

Well, Pressuretreatedwood, that's a great question. Bitcoin is fundamentally better than credit cards (in terms of security), because sensitive data isn't shared during any transactions. There's no central authority to authorize "drafts" (payee initiated payments), so every transaction must be initiated by the owner of the funds. Payment fraud could be largely eradicated overnight. Only way to do this with credit cards would be to rid the world of card reader/writers, card skimmers, dummy pin pads, carbon copies, digital copies, exploitable ATM/POS software and eyes. Because the secret number is clearly displayed on your credit card, you wouldn't want your waiter/clerk to have eyes, lest he puts a chink in your financial armor.

He won't have any access to his money until Monday morning. Obviously, right now, very few people would accept bitcoin, so many don't see it as a problem. However, acceptance is skyrocketing and soon it might not seem as far-fetched to do value transfers in bitcoin. Why not have at least some of your money/value denominated in bitcoins? Make sure he will not need to be payed back / cash out the investment before BTC has a chance to "mature".

Poker sites are outside of US and prepaid cards can't be used internationally last I tried. Many banks ban gambling transactions even though some credit/debit cards might work (my experience with online poker past year).

Not new to Bitcoin. My question was more of a challenge. How much hash power would you need to accomplish this? Given difficulty levels, I can't imagine more than a handful of people on earth who could realistically attack the Bitcoin network.

FinCEN filing = not a big deal if you aren't a criminal. Doing something "weird" with money isn't illegal, just suspicious. If you have a paper trail for your BTC/USD, don't worry about it. If you recently "found a duffle with $20k" and cannot otherwise account for the money, I'd be hesitant about getting the money near a bank before you talk to cops/fincen/irs.

Check out Purse.io 10-25% discount for spending BTC. Auction style listing where you trade your BTC for an item (or gift card) available on Amazon.com with BTC seller selected fee. I said I'd pay 25% off for a food processor to make some hummus (payable in BTC at updated rate). Someone was able to buy my BTC with a credit card (at a 25% markup). I was able to spend my coins with a considerable incentive.

Perhaps more accurately should have said block reward + transaction fees must be large enough to incentive enough miners to adequately protect the network. Farms will shutdown if they aren't profitable. Fees/rewards would have to be artificially raised if bitcoin became massively unpopular to a point where hashing power wasn't high enough to protect against large double spends. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 06:03:39
I couldn't figure out where to add credit card for friends account either. Perhaps they have discontinued this service if you weren't enrolled already. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 06:17:43
Including only current block rewards and current prices, and assuming maximum number of transactions per second, each transaction would cost about $7. However, there could be popular offchain services or changes to the maximum attainable throughput. Maybe bitcoin will be used for large settlements where $7 could be 7/1000ths of 1% of average transaction. 
The main thing to remember is that everything is flexible except that fees have to be large enough to provide adequate security against attack.

I just don't understand the spouting of clearly false information. First, why would Amazon buy back their gift card money? That would not be a profitable endeavor. 
Second, I wrote one of the "horror stories" you are probably talking about it. I received a support response within a few hours and was fully refunded. I think the site would be bogged down with support tickets or actively shutting down if their service was primarily used fraudulently. Perhaps there is some fraud, but I'm curious to see how it compares to [Apple Pay]( which has ~60x more fraud than regular CC. 
What's more, Purse.io's Coinbase partnership affords them some "good faith" as no licensed money-services business would want to be associated with fraud. Finally, they recently updated their entire user experience making it even easier to use their great service.

I love Rand Paul for the positive things that he's done for our country, which are quite numerous. I don't think he's a bad guy, but equally so, I don't think he'd be great for America. His callousness with regards to our healthcare crisis seems to put him out of touch with the needs of regular Americans. Now, philosophically there's nothing wrong with his position, however, I find the particular way he tries to defend his position exposes a larger issue. He seems able to almost forgo common sense or logic in his argumentation. In one of the videos below, he makes a transparently terrible argument about how providing free medical care would enslave doctors. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) quickly finds the soft spot in the argument. 
edit: He makes a similarly terrible argument about how "...only in Washington can you spend $2B and claim that your saving money". Perhaps he's never maintained his car, made a financial investment or heard the phrase "it takes money to make money".

Bitpay is adding to the overall value of Bitcoin with this service and also making very little money doing it. It seems perfectly OK to plug this service as it entices new business owners who will increase exposure / demand of BTC. Maybe if they even said that the cost of a transfer is a few pennies rather than 1% I'd be happier (in a competitive environment the price of production should be almost the cost).
