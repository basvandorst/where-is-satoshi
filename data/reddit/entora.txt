Innocent people get arrested for structuring all the time. The answer is yes, the government will take your money if you are structuring.

How is a 1 dollar fee resisting censorship

I understand what Bitcoin is very well, but I don't understand what the fuck your alluding to or implying.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:53:51
How can your transaction be censored  and how is paying the dollar tx fee resisting said censorship

Are you a qualified developer? I bet not.
A fork and a chain can be comparable, just because they're different doesn't mean one can't be better than the other.
Segwit has disadvantages just like pretty much everything else you can do to Bitcoin at this point

The policy is there because if people in your subreddit disclose someones personal information (basically any information) even if it's public the Reddit admin's get angry af

SEC isn't the IRS tho

The majority of people see it as a store of value like gold these days for this very reason. Eventually it'll probably stabilize but it's not backed by a government so the only way we're gonna see stable prizing is centralization or exchanges banding together to manipulate the price which is not good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:19:19
Yeah so they're better off than most government agencies who don't really make any true gains besides maybe seizing property

Nah all the people spamming Reddit with MtGox trustee news caused the crash.
The MtGox trustee has been selling for months and no dramatic drop until people on the sub freak out

It's the same as the tax on any long term investment. It's not like there's some "bitcoin tax" that the government asspulls on Bitcoin users.
Taxes are necessary to run our society. You can't pull a "big banks are evil" on this one, as much as our government probably sucks we still kind of need it

He traded just under 10k and probably deposited that which looks like structuring.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:51:31
If he did this with 250k on localbitcoins he would probably hit atleast 1 federal agent and get fucked for operating an illegal money service business
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:27:36
No, lmao. The IRS will bust your ass you still have to pay taxes even if you're in fucking Antarctica making money

Because you just got a random ass apartment building that you now have to pay property taxes on??????????????
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:11:54
Can you explain how our society would run without taxes
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:14:01
Without people who actually used the currency like this guy Bitcoin would be worth much less than it is now.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:35:04
they'd tax you because i'm fairly certain gaining an apartment building is a taxable event + trading an item/abstract thing/thought for another thing (like an apartment building) is still taxable - you're not avoiding taxes by using items of equivalent values to money
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:12:56
Pretty much any Bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:07:12
 Technically for tax purposes you're realizing gains when you buy products and technically you owe income tax however in practice nobody is paying income tax on purchases made with BTC
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:02:15
Nobody is going to know or care unless you're buying cars and houses or items over ten thousand dollars

I beg to differ. You're much likely to have an app go rogue on your phone looking for bitcoin or get owned by a virus targeting phones than one on your computer.
If you keep all your software up to date and use extreme discretion when downloading the likelihood of you getting your PC "hacked" is almost zero. Unless you're inept the likelihood of someone accidentally leaving their phone somewhere and having it stolen (or worse, being targeted specifically for your phone) is much higher. 
The only safe backup of your seed phrase is physical and even then that's leaving yourself open to vulnerability. If you are holding a significant amount of bitcoins you should be worried more about physical attacks than anything online, because if you're doing "it" right you should be almost completely secure online.
I'd rather have someone steal my encrypted wallet with a long memorized password than a seed that they can use to steal all my BTC. It's much more secure just to encrypt and backup your wallet rather than storing the seed anywhere, even on a piece of paper. If it's as easy as breaking into your house and stealing a small safe to steal your 5-100 BTC, I'd be a lot more worried about that instead of you somehow getting a computer virus. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:58:54
I don't care if I get hacked because my wallet is encrypted with a very good and extremely long password.
I store my wallet on a Linux partition (also encrypted) and don't install random ass programs so I'm safe from any traditional attacks that can be expected. My software is always up to date and I have a good antivirus suite as well as a pretty good firewall with a custom ruleset.
People aren't IP scanning for Windows machines with BTC wallets, you'd have to be running an electrum node or something to find computers and pray some random XP computer is vulnerable.
Get at me when someone breaks into your house while your gone and steals your BTC.

@_date: 2017-07-31 04:39:42
lmao are you joking
ok bud whatever you say
if you think you aren't a target of physical attacks if you're holding 5+ BTC you're the joke
it's not that hard to steal your safe unless it's literally cemented into your wall and even then if you have like 50k on that shit it's trivial to remove in less than an hour
cracking a safe after you've stolen it is extremely easy especially if you have a cheaper safe
idk what world you're living in bud but industry professionals probably know more than some random on not to be rude or anything
talk to me when you become a cybercriminal or cybersecurity expert thanks
Literally the first thing you said was full of errors and then you continue down the path till you try to delegitimize my arguments because it's a "moot point" and I'm an "idiot".
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:42:40
Electrum is still fine
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:16:24
until someone steals your phone or you get attacked by a random 0day or a multitude of bad things that could occur
backing up your wallet is safer than backing up your seed phrase because if someone steals your seed phrase then they can recover your wallet AND bypass your encrypted wallet password completely
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:53:06
You should not use Coinbase as your main wallet. A physical solution on your computer with backups should be your main storage and spending option. I would only suggest Coinbase for purchasing the bitcoin itself and transferring it to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:30:25
nice way to avoid the conversation 
a fireproof safe wont stop someone from breaking into it
A Trezor could be good but its another complex vulnerability that makes you more vulnerable than just encrypting your wallet and only backing up your wallet.
Your memory is a gift, use it!
