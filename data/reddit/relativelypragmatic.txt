Whether he's trying to hide the fact that it's him or not, just a quick peek through his posting history tells me it's overwhelmingly likely to be him.
Plus, it's the least surprising thing in the world for him to link his own tweets all over the place. I'm just surprised he decided to not say "could really use some retweets!" in the title here, given that's exactly how he begs on every other channel.
Edit: Links to Trace Meyer's tweets, provides detailed love letters about **Dr** AdamB at the drop of a hat, and loves Armory; there's almost no way it isn't him. Super creepy how he constantly talks about himself in the third person though.

Yeah, the price is kept low as a combination of 3,600 new coins a day, merchant BTC-&gt;Fiat acceptance, and lack of use cases / demand to balance out the equation.

Really? There's not a single person who isn't overwhelmingly gushing about Bitcoin that doesn't understand it?
This is the beginning of the journey with a lot of hard work ahead. Not the time to start taking victory laps.

Overuse in what sense? Isn't it just a race to the bottom as far as who gets the free money?

Uh... yeah. Triple negative or whatever tripped me up :).
Should be "understands"
Point stands though. There are plenty of people who have been involved in Bitcoin for years, understand the tech and economics with a fair degree of nuance, and still think it's not quite time for Bitcoiners to start taking their victory laps yet.

An argument could be made that Bitcoin is effectively a trusted, distributed computer (program), running on untrusted commodity hardware.

Really? Anyone who isn't comfortable declaring Bitcoin as unequivocal future of finance is either a nutjob or envious?
The future is that easy to predict, and the hard work yet to do in cryptocurrency, on both adoption and technology, is that much a foregone conclusion?

So, Apple Pay requires less googling (**globally!**) to figure out how to use it than Bitcoin, despite having &gt;1,000x the userbase?

3mm accounts != 3mm users

It's not 10,000, that's just for the region. It's like 129 or something per room as that's all the servers can handle in each room.

They didn't. It turned out they were making claims that weren't true.
I know there's one Blockchain company that did actually manage to close a deal with a government though.

They made the argument that since they're a meta-subreddit, many people rely on it to find out what's actually happening in Reddit.
is definitely not serving that purpose.
