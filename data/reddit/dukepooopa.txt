I POS murderer who promotes violence and drug abuse in a stagnant cumbersome community while force feeding mass endorsements for democratic slavery of the working class. I’m good I don’t want bit coin to ever be overly opinionated and washed up.

Only as racist as literally everyone else. 
I just have the balls to say it in front of y’all and I don’t gotta be false or sugar coated at all.

Just so I’m clear here.
Using the term nigga that is a term of endearment in parts of the black community is unacceptable and offensive.
However blindly branding strangers racist a far more disgusting term is fair game. When you have no clue to the build of their true character.
I’d be willing to bet people like you are feebly reinforcing segregation and slanging “reverse hate speech” really actual hate speech is justified because you feel as if you are being just? -Wrong
Brass tacks you are ignant it’s not your fault you feel like you are answering a divine calling. It’s just too bad feelings don’t run the world. As long as we are flinging cracker and honkey around on top 40 pop songs and nigger and nigga plague hip hop and r&amp;b imma nig on nigga free speech belongs to all of us not just self inflicted ignorant social justice underdogs.
See also: Fuck, Shit, Cunt, Pussy, Dick, Bitch etc. the list goes on and on and on. All of these words offend some people. So by your logic we should only listen to some blacks and self loathing whites in regard to what words are acceptable? Take away free speech for everyone? Or offend everyone equally. What would a truly free and just movement promote?
