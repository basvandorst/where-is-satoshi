They might try but that’s going to be a complete failure.
If you don’t keep your crypto on exchanges that do KYC, you are pretty much safe .
It will take those old farts another 10 years to even understand what crypto is all about, until then most laws will make little or no sense at all, so we are safe here.

Don’t exchange your Crypto back to an USD and there will be no tax applied to you. 
Don’t report crypto gains and/or losses to IRS so that you are not red flagged in any way.
They can not take shit from you, even if there is a court order that makes you transfer your crypto over to the government, you can always say that you lost your private keys and they will have no way of taking over. Cash it later in some other Crypto friendly jurisdiction.

We are already entering another recession. This time it will be way different from the one in 2008, much more painful. Stock market has already started to hit new 52 week lows on a daily basis, soon there will be a major dump. 
Education in US is a joke, medicine is a joke, tax rates are a joke, food is an overpriced cancerous garbage because food standards are a joke, most Americans never left US which is a complete joke. America is a joke full of obese and ridiculously stupid people from all over the world and it’s falling apart soon.

Don't be an idiot, let them figure that out on their own and come after you. Believe it or not, it will take them many decades. You will be dead by then from cocaine abuse or a heart attack that will happen from screwing to much hoes ))

No matter what this shit does and how it does that, the name for this shit is fucking ridiculous. Nobody is going to buy a coin with such a ridiculous name.

Most Americans never left the country and never had over $500 in cash. All stuck in debt up their asses
