The US and Chinese economies are so closely tied that it wouldn't make much sense for them to trigger any catastrophic event that would collapse our economy because theirs would immediately follow suit.

Until it doesn't.
I deposit my paycheck in my bank account, and three weeks later, it's worth just about the same as it was when it was deposited.
You deposit a paycheck in your account, say in December, and now that money is worth roughly half of what it was when you earned it. Sure, sometimes it's worth twice as much... and this plan has probably worked out quite well for you the last year. But what if this year goes in the opposite direction? You're prepared for that, or just hoping for the best?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:57:51


Yeah, that part is currently the issue.

It's also a good opportunity to lose a chunk of the value of your investment.

Funny thing about bitcoin... when you sell it, it's not gone forever. You can *buy* it too! Sometimes at an even lower price than you sold it for, allowing you to obtain *more* bitcoin. Wild, right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:46:45


You'd rather have it stolen from you through a massive market crash? Or worse, entirely wiped out through a bubble burst? Your plan is entirely dependent on bitcoin continuing to rise and your logic seems to be "well it hasn't totally shit the bed yet". I hope you have enough bitcoin saved up to ride out an extended downswing... or at least a nice couch in someone's house to sleep on.

And how do you feel about your cost of living being nearly 50% more than it was last month? Or not having any idea what things are going to cost next month?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:48:31
Some of those articles are came out before the huge drop over the last few days and some of them have no impact whatsoever on the market (eg the Mavs accepting bitcoin).
Be careful of confirmation bias when you search for news. Look at multiple different sources. The negative news has far outweighed the positives lately, and this huge dip didn't just come out of nowhere.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:59:43
Saying you expected it to fluctuate is one thing. Saying you're glad to see your investment drop to the level you bought it at after three months seems a little silly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:56:39
You're goddamn right someone sold, and isn't regretting it for a second. Check the charts. Last bounce is correcting exactly where it's been trending for the past few days... down the shitter.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:27:59


That's a pretty big if, and if that "if" comes around, the shit is really going to hit the fan on this planet. I doubt a digital currency is going to save me.


Sure, in very small amounts.


Do you not make more money than you did back then? Gas was that cheap in the 80's... when the minimum wage was $3.25 and the average household income was $30K.


Right, and therein lies the problem. Almost nobody accepts bitcoin for payment, and even if they do, the price is entirely dependent on the exchange rate of it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:28:10
You're glad that in 3 months your investment has netted you a 0% return?
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:14:38


Because that’s how markets work. You didn’t think it would just go up and up forever did you?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:14:32
What do you mean by "takes a dive?" I've read through a lot of your posts in this thread and you've mentioned "the dollar" taking a dive multiple times, but I think what you really mean is the stock market. I don't rely on my investment portfolio to cover my daily expenses. If it tanked, I'd be fine in the short term. Probably less so in the long term if I was dependent on it for retirement and it never bounced back.
The actual dollar is extremely resistant to "tanking". I'm not going to wake up tomorrow to find that I need to make 50% more money to cover my living expenses.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:55:36
Because it's an investment that you already have a stake in. You're not buying "things".
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:08:11
The name of the game is to make money. I'd rather be rich and lucky than slightly more wealthy and skillful. And for what it's worth, knowing when to sell is a handy investment skill.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:03:53
You have absolutely no control of that. If you're earning and spending money then your "buys" and "sells" are dictated by when you get paid and when you need to spend money.
Do you not have any daily living expenses? Rent/mortgage, utilities, food, transportation? Any time you pay for any of that you're "selling". If you have a job, you're "buying" when you get paid (assuming you don't hold on to the USD in a shoebox or bank account until a good time to buy BTC). Don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds like a plan that only works if you're living with your parents or if BTC is on the rise.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:31:17
If you think you're out of the woods you're a fucking idiot. Price is still down more than 40% over the last month and has registered losses 7 out of the previous 10 days. Almost everyone who *didn't* hodl is in a better spot right now.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:21:11
To be fair, 21st century guy actually has a valid point. If bitcoin has a future as a currency then you are going to have to explain how to address the issue of wild fluctuations in its value.

Touching the drugs isn't a component of any of the charges he was convicted of. It's pretty straightforward, he facilitated the sales, therefore he engaged in a conspiracy to traffic narcotics.
The lengths of the sentences are kind of trivial when you're talking about life without parole. Both ran major drug trafficking operations, and both are going to spend the rest of their lives in prison. I don't see what the big deal is.
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:10:27
In general, I agree, the sentences for nonviolent drug charges in this country are ridiculous. But this isn't a typical case of some guy getting the book thrown at him for selling a couple dime bags. This was an organized crime operation, and they were doing more than simply selling drugs.
I just don't see this guy as a victim. He'd still likely be looking at significant time even if drugs were legal. I'd rather sign a petition to reform our drug laws and have them retroactively applied to convicted offenders. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:30:23

I’m not happy with that, but I don’t see that as a product of the banking system and I absolutely don’t see Cryptocurrency as a solution to that problem. It’s just an alternate form of currency. There will still always be loans, and the poor will be the ones taking them and the rich will be the ones profiting off of them. Crypto will never change that.
Many of the problems you listed were the result of investment banking gone off the rails. The 2008 collapse was due in large part to predatory lending. How are peer to peer loan networks going to address that? If anything, I’d argue it has the potential to make things worse. A financial network that operates without the interference of banks sounds like a great idea, but keep in mind that also means it’s operating outside of any regulation. Whats to stop an even worse system from developing out of peer to peer networks?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:28:10


To be fair, that’s not a huge advantage over any semi-decent player. Calculating pot odds is pretty basic strategy, the math isn’t even that difficult.
The real advantage would be analyzing patterns in the play of your opponents in order to determine estimated hand strengths and fold probabilities. Combining that information with pot odds would give the bot a massive advantage over a player that doesn’t know what they’re up against.
Of course a *really* good human player who knew they were playing a bot could probably turn that advantage around and work it in their favor. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:04:10

Call it trying to time the market if you want, but in reality, it’s nothing more than a price target... which any rational investor has in their mind when entering or exiting a position.
It seems like you’re making the argument that since it’s impossible to predict the future, then to hell with analysis and don’t bother trying to set targets. That’s gambling.

A smart fund manager would never say “Fuck it, this seems close enough to the bottom for me!” They wouldn’t invest, period, unless they had an idea of what a fair price was based on their research. No smart money is trying to catch this falling knife unless they have a really good idea of what a fair price is.
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:48:38
How so? When you put your money in a bank, you earn interest. The bank loans that money out, and the borrower pay interest. It’s the exact same concept. The only difference is the rates might be slightly more beneficial for lenders/borrowers if you eliminate the middle man (bank). It’s not without drawbacks though. Is your money insured if you loan it to someone through a P2P network? If so, who pays for that?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:42:00
Probably worth noting that those crashes took a long time to fully recover. The December 2013 crash took over 3 years to rebound.

This is true. But it’s an entirely different statement than “If you care about the price, you’re buying it for the wrong reasons.” No matter what you buy it for, it’s an asset, and you should care about that. 
And let’s be real here, a *massive* amount of the value of bitcoin right now is due to speculative investors. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:42:06

Most smart investors won’t jump into something without having a good idea of what it’s value is. If a 15% swing seems like nothing to you, then you’re gambling. Plain and simple.
If you had all your money in a fund, and the manager said “I think AAPL is a good buy at $150, but fuck it, $180 is close enough!” would you keep your money with them?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:27:29
It's a long time when you consider the unrealistic expectations of most of the people that bought into the crypto hype recently. You have to keep in mind that a ton of people bought over the last couple months thinking that bitcoin was some magical money making machine and that they'd become millionaires overnight.
There is a lot of delusion around these parts and talk of rallies to 50K or 100K in the near future. Meteoric rises aren't the norm and they're often are accompanied by massive falls. The sooner people realize that, and put their Lambo orders on hold, the better.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:25:28

Gold only declined like 25% from its high in 2008. Ten years later it’s gained 60% from its 2008 low. 
You’re talking about a 200% increase from Bitcoin’s all time *high*, in the span of 3 years.... or 1400% from  current levels.
