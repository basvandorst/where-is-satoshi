@_date: 2013-03-25 22:11:12
They have had issues with their network recently. The time it takes for transactions to be verified has taken a while lately as well as implementing a rolling 24 hour limit whenever there is too many coins being bought (seems like always now).
With all that said I use Coinbase and have had transactions go through recently. I'm not in a rush to move coins though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:58:06
Well they can take some of the benefits of Bitcoins (since it was designed to be used digitally) and add their own features such as less anonymity, low fees and basically pick and choose to create their own variant.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:52
Gox got greedy and let everyone in and then they melted down. Mt. Gox being such a large influence in Bitcoin is a **bad** thing. Bitcoin's strength lies in its decentralization under different exchanges.
Ideally, the market should not be affected this much but we are still in our infancy.

No, not really.


The big picture is everyone will "profit" from Bitcoin one way or another. If you think its all about making money thats just the shallow part of the pool; the advantages of freeing ourselves from taxing big banks is where all human beings can profit.
Truth is, there is still a ton of people who haven't heard what Bitcoin is or don't fully understand what it is. It can be extremely helpful to have people out there with the purpose of informing and correcting those who don't get it yet.

**Article's TL;DR** - I don’t think Bitcoin delivers us to libertarian “Shangri-la” or anarcho-capitalism, but it’s a technology that fetters government some. It’s a protection for people, their hard-earned wealth, and their privacy. That’s the value of Bitcoin, in my mind, no matter its current price.

I think the community is pretty good at determining what is worth upvoting and what is garbage. There were a couple "50" posts that had lots of upvotes for a while and plenty of other ones which got downvoted.
It is understandable to be excited about hitting $50 which was a record setter but the community took care of the excess by upvoting some and downvoting the rest - that's how Reddit works.
I don't need we need to outlaw posting about the exchange rates since most of those posts are regarding hitting the all time high. I think that also is understandable since it is a very exciting time to be involved in Bitcoin.
**TL;DR** - The community at large will take care of what should end up on the front page. No restricting is necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:21:11

What you can look into is putting aside a little extra for savings (secure it and don't touch it) and use the rest for normal transactions.

I think one of the larger problems with the rapid popularity of Bitcoin is that many people (myself included) marketed the *price* of Bitcoin as a feature.
The price of a Bitcoin is secondary or tertiary to all of Bitcoins other rich features. I think in the future if we talk about Bitcoin the right way we can do more to avoid these unnecessary bubbles.

Contact Bitinstant using the support on their website. I had an issue as well, I emailed them once and eventually they got back to me. They will not likely get back with you instantly (despite their name). Submit your support claim with them and wait patiently.
My issue was resolved after about a week.

Looks to me like BitInstant is admitting that it is having issues, which looks like a good thing. I know there are a lot of unhappy people who have had their purchases delayed but it looks to me like they are trying hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:26:06
Right, because Bitcoin is not decentralized enough. Even if you didn't have an account, likely you used a service that relied on Mt. Gox's charts. That is too much influence for one single exchange.

This is also the reason why I am not putting my money into it but only mining - which is significantly easier than Bitcoin mining. I have 0.31232942 LTC for mining less than 14 hours.
I don't have enough money to buy a rig to mine bitcoins and not enough cash to buy many Bitcoins but I can mine Litecoins at a *fairly* good rate using my home PC. (LTC mining is not GPU intensive like BTC is.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:05:11
It matters because when business men and women, people in the financial sector, legal and regulatory experts in the market come together it helps legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of the uneducated.
We who have studied and tried out Bitcoin ourselves already know that Bitcoin will thrive but there are certain demographics that will not. 
To have a bunch of educated suits standing before  Senate legislators matters because it can potentially jump start a process of Bitcoin adoption that would take much longer to do otherwise.
The hearings may not be essential to Bitcoin's survival but it will be key to how Bitcoin will thrive in the market (in the U.S. at least).

The price should not be set by a single exchange. Multiple "competing" exchanges need to exist to decentralize the price and generate overall stability for the Bitcoin network.

You can look into Bitinstant.com but I would only transfer a small amount first to make sure you are doing it right. The service usually takes less than an hour to transfer funds but if you screw it up somehow it will take longer to track down your money.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:06:39
That's interesting. However, reading the Bitcoin wiki it labels Litecoin as type of pyramid scheme seemingly because it will never be adopted like Bitcoin was. There really was no indication Bitcoin would be adopted like this early on.
Part of me hopes it can be adopted. But if you have more to say about scamminess of Litecoin I am all ears.

Calm down. I've used Bitinstant 3 different times and one of them I screwed up - but they **never** took my money.
Make sure you know what you're doing and read the website's instructions carefully and you won't get screwed.
People need to remember that is industry is *still* in its infancy and these Bitcoin start ups are just that - they are just starting up. Many have limited resources which include limited support teams. You shouldn't punish them because **you** made a mistake. Bitinstant can't guarantee a transfer in 60 minutes if you screw up your order.
When I messed my transaction I contacted support once and they eventually got back to me, I gave them the correct info and they were able to move my money a week later. That just happened to be my timeframe. But note I got my money, they did not steal it from me. 
*Additionally*, the times I used the service correctly I had my Bitcoins in about 7-15 minutes. That is a fantastic service if you ask me. 
LPT: Transfer small amounts to make sure you're doing it right.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:49:29

The convenience is great and attractive but if someone steals your phone, they have stolen your wallet. If you lose your phone, you lost your wallet.
For me, that is something too valuable to risk losing that easily. However, keeping a minimal amount of funds in that wallet would not be horrible if you are okay with that.

I haven't seen anything to suggest we could actually stop trusting them.
All I've seen is people complain and get pouty because they screwed up their transfer requests and can't get "instant" support. You can't fault Bitinstant for that.
Extra LPT: Transfer small amounts with Bitinstant to start with so you aren't screwed and can confirm you're doing it right.

As someone in IT, I agree on your above examples; I would hate to be working there at the moment.
However, as Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, I would say that is good enough reason to shy away from Mt. Gox. It simply has had too much power over the Bitcoin market. Go to another exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:53
When I say Mt. Gox users I am specifically talking about those people, exchanges and technologies that used Gox as a type of "standard".
