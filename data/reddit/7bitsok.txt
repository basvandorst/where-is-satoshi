Because, compared to couple of years back, it's slow, uncertain and fees need to be calculated in advance.

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Hide from the truth if you want, it doesn't change facts on the ground. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:16:19
Endless assertions with no factual backing...  The so-called "CoreDevs" released segwit via soft fork,  which degraded network security by removing all nodes ability to validates any block.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:10:33
People are lining up to buy Bitcoin now,  except it's Bitcoin Cash not the segwit version.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:40:36
I've seen his stuff before,  well written but with no definition of what decentralisation means for Bitcoin it's just a nice collection of text and handy stats. Adds up to nothing rigorous or testable. 
Also,  the key quote from the article is:
*"there is little use participating in a decentralized system when the validation cost is low but the transaction cost is extremely high due to contention for block space."*
Does this need explaining to someone as well educated as you? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:51:43
Fud,  fail and delay progress...  Sounds like Bitcoin development under blockstream and core since 2014.
Currently the 8mb max block size is working fine.  Any reason why 258 is needed now? 
As for decentralized,  try to put some actual numbers behind your definition...  For everybody users there should be y nodes and z miners
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:17:00
We have plenty of capacity in hand,  within the current 8mb max size and also the physical limit of 1gb that has been tested on current code. The answer on how often forking should occur -  maybe twice a year to keep network healthy and moving ahead. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:59:23
Because it was never properly marketed or supported by core and blockstream developers. Why release functionality not supported by your own wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:54:13
I know plenty and it's obvious you know nothing but a few dated talking points. Document your claims on nodes and centralization or just accept Bitcoin is a little hard for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:30:23
Actually, Bitcoin can scale right now with Bitcoin Cash. Working and growing as we type ...
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:03
Ha. Ask you multiple times for any studies or data to back up your "centralisation" theories and nothing is produced.  
When blockstream/core goes down,  the lack of any evidence to back up their silly ideas will rank as one of the key factors behind their demise. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:45:11
Nonsense.  The original  designer(s) and all coders until 2015,planned for Bitcoin to scale through use of server farms i.e. Mining pools.  
And the so-called smartest engineers managed to ruin Bitcoin as a payment system through poor economics and bad technical design. 
Can you provide a definition of decentralisation?  Can you provide any calculations on how node requirements grow with block size,  including costs? 
If not,  just accept that u will be treated and yet another shill for the corrupt,  failing Bitcoin Core/Blockstream cabal. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:34:30
Not so. More miners add more security. Nodes add nothing bit delays to the network after the first few thousand.
Regarding "economics" forcing small nodes to go away, can you quantify this? A spreadsheet, white paper or formarl academic study would be fine.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:27
And the Blockstream &amp;&amp; Core developers who arrived in 2014 inherited a fully working p2p electronic cash network ... which they then ruined with stupid economics and daft technical hacks. But luckily Bitcoin can &amp; does route around these issues - watch Bitcoin Cash as it keeps improving &amp;&amp; Bitcoin Core as it finally crashes in death spiral in 2018. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:29:41
Complete and utter BS. How do you think people who are unbanked (i.e. no internet, no computer, probably no stable power source) are going to run a node of any kind? Do you have any idea what "unbanked" means in the real world? It means having $5 or less of free cash to spend in a week, or worse.  It means banking service fees eating up 10-20 % of your free money and having to east less or choose not to send you kids to school. 
Anyway, using your proposed stats, losing a couple of hundred nodes to add 8X capacity would increase the transaction volume so much we'd be seeing a whole new generation of miners, nodes and businesses interested in Bitcoin. THAT is how node growth will happen - not some feeble mumbo-jumbo "decentralized-is-kool"  from rich, educated developers sitting in the west with full infrastructure and banking services to spare.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:50:07
Bcash is a payment app in brasil.  Are you  confused as to the proper name for Bitcoin Cash? The same Bitcoin Cash is worth over 62B in market cap. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:38
Actually,  the goal of the Bitcoin network is to enable p2p money transfers...  As the title says.  There is no such thing as a "donor"  node described in white paper and they provide little benefit to the network,  but fine if it makes u feel good. 
As for bigger blocks price out nodes - please show some studies or data to support this.  I'd guess 1gb blocks,  which are feasible now,  would raise storage and networking costs,  but how much... 
Lastly,  why only focus on node costs as centralising factor.  Surely 20$ transfers will drive users to coin are to avoid fees,  sending from one account to another? 
@_date: 2015-12-18 05:58:07
Nobody said that it doesn't. Merely pointing out that it's not a "coup" when people choose which implementation of the Bitcoin protocol to run. And if enough people choose one implementation then it can activate and a new set of Bitcoin consensus rules can become effective. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:04:08
you'll have to read it and understand it as well, not just search for random terms. As for fees, no-one denies that they will make up 100% of mining rewards at some point. Perhaps in 10-12 years you could be 1/2 right, but not just now when fees make up &lt; 2% of total miner income. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 06:54:13
No, a cartel of miners is more than happy to deal with a powerful faction(Blockstrea/Core) and get them to execute what they need. Quelle surprise. 
As for tagging BIP100 because ... that's just your opinion and you're welcome to express it here without fear of censorship. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 08:01:33
Nope, its the same concern. Pretending that everything is fine when Actually security has been degraded is not a good idea for systems managing large amounts of money/value. 
It's one more sign that the current set of developers do not see the users experience, or concerns, as worth mentioning. Probably explained by the fact that none, AFAIK, have ever worked on critical finance systems managing peoples money.  
@_date: 2015-12-18 06:23:14
Having a cartel mainly based in one country agree with a BIP that hands them more power is ... less than impressive result from a project based on concepts of decentralization and censorship-resistance. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:50:47
wow. such opinions. much freedom. 
Would you prefer people to choose from a selected set of responses ranging from 'mildly approve' to 'massive props to the OP genius'?
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:55:04
Seconded. Please adopt the most obvious, simple, tested solution and make an attempt to regain trust in Bitcoin code governance.
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:51:06
Yes, so overall network security is lowered (old nodes cannot fully validate new blocks) to allow developers to 'silently' release features that might not get accepted by majority of nodes or users. It's like silently releasing new laws - you can't know what is legal anymore, just what was illegal last year.    
@_date: 2015-12-26 19:46:58
The current set of incentives and infrastructure costs have taken us to the point where &gt; 50% of mining is done in China. This is the not the ideal situation for a supposed decentralized crypto currency with supposed censorship-resistant properties. Please note I have nothing against China or the Chinese people, having lived and worked there for years previously. 
If, as you say, they will fork off and ignore non-CNY blocks then that backs up my point exactly. We need more decentralization of mining by location - same as if we had &gt; 50% in USA, Russia, ...
Node count has been dropping for years for many reasons, just selecting max block size (which hasn't changed) is not strong evidence of anything. My view is that people run nodes because they are committed to Bitcoin ideals, so that if we spread usage by increasing capacity then some % of the new users will run nodes e.g. 0.1%. Other factors that may help are ability to reduce bandwidth usage (in XT now) and more efficient Bitcoin code via weak blocks, IBLT, etc.
 
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:12:33
Most people are choosing SPV regardless of the code version deployed, perhaps if we put more effort into making a Bitcoin Core node easier to install &amp; run we might find that trend reversing.
Regardless of your tangential jibe, the question remains why we would choose to degrade network security and introduce complexity for some very small potential payoff in future regarding transaction capacity.
Raise the max block size now and add the cool stuff later when it's tested and all merchants, explorers, businesses have updated their systems. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:16:24
Why would it be painful? There is ample warning of the upcoming fork and all users have plenty of time to switch their implementation in time. As for the opposition, perhaps they can simply live without the need for a controlling parameter under their power &amp;&amp; go on to solve real issues stopping Bitcoin acceptance. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:22:18
Ever heard of the block reward? Ever read the white paper on why exactly the halving of block rewards is phased in over a prolonged period of time? Such laser-like focus on fees now, during growth period of Bitcoin, misses the entire point of how Satoshi aimed to draw in users and grow the network.
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:40:09
why should max block size be completely limited to what suits the current set of Chinese miners? Is that not reinforcing geographical centralition (and perhaps poltical risk)  based on current skewed economic incentives they operate under? Are you not pushing for solutions that make Bitcoin more at risk of censorship, contrary to one of its key guidelines.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:59:04
so you're saying a $20 fee to use Bitcoin is possible and "... isn't the end of the world".
Thanks for confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:56:35
I think by "public good" you actually mean the classic "tragedy of the commons" issue - where people use a common asset but not contribute to its upkeep. 
Since transactions are charged by size (among other items) and miners have the ability to accept or reject tx why do you see a problem that needs fixing in the current code base? Isn't cost of disk storage low enough that we can eliminate large block chain size as a capacity issue for many years to come? 
I honestly don't see space as a factor causing average users not to be able to run nodes and I'm not sure how you think Core developers are helping resolve your concerns. Most of the recent ideas pushed y Core developers such as Confidential Transactions/RBF/Side-chain Pegs/etc all consume more disk space and require greater system capacity to roll out.  
 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:09:16
crap. a new fork would be created if and only if a super majority if 75% of blocks over last thousand. Thats following the protocol, you know.  
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:54:22
In the US FinCen specifically excepted miners from requiring money transmitter licenses. Lightning hubs with (partial) control over money being sent may not escape so easily. 
In the real world LN hubs will run on user-owned or leased CPUs using network connectivity provided by commercial carriers. It's naive in the extreme to think that any LN hub could "hide" from the Feds and the owner be able to keep the transfers secret under duress. Surely Snowden has taught us something about the reach of the USA Federal govt ...   
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:19:58
More FUD. Do you have any actual evidence of this checkpoint claim? 
Or, indeed, ANY data to show why the possible fork in 2016 will have ANY negative effects?
Making these baseless claims just ensures that no-one takes the Blockstream/Core position on expanding the max block size seriously anymore. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:23:49
consensus referring to choice of software implementation required to generate blocks, not the consensus as to Bitcoin network state.  
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:30:16
Sorry, you're the odd one out. Please read Satoshi's white paper again and you will see that low fees, scalability and use of (gasp) data centers was the kind of Bitcoin network imagined by its creator. 
High fees, enforced artificial caps on scalability and use of trusted nodes in secondary payment networks is NOT a part of Bitcoin as originally planned. Please find an alt-coin willing to test these ideas before corrupting Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:05:42
So you agree that soft forks reduce network security. I guess that you would prefer SW, when finished and tested by all affected parties, should be released as a hard fork to maintain network security at highest level. 
LN is not a scaling option for Bitcoin itself, does nothing to help Bitcoin network process more transactions. Same as if we proposed Paypal as the scaling option for Swift ... In similar fashion to SW, LN introduces complexity and lowered security for minimal improvement in throughput.  
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:21:30
yeah, completely unlike US security laws, courts etc.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:49:51
Block size is not a fixed number, unless done as a policy decision by developers like the ones in Blockstream/Core group now. Do you think fees should follow market forces?
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:57:35
Think you're missing the point, it doesn't matter what kind of hardware or infrastructure is required to run a Lightning hub. What matters is that each and every hub can have their owner tracked down and prosecuted for running a MSB service if Govt decides. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:55:51
And yet, they don't. 
We have had scenarios ranging from zero-fee transactions being included to blocks without transactions - and neither of these examples correlates to fee levels. As economists would say, fees are a weak market signal given the high ratio of block reward to block fee income ( &gt; 98% ) - unless an artificial cap on block size is imposed by Core developers.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:52:26
You're avoiding the plain, simple consequences of letting the market decide. And ignoring the fact that Core developers are now forcing a new policy on Bitcoin that was not discussed or agreed.
As for being "oppressed" - funnily enough I booted up 4 new instances of BitcoinXT nodes today. Bitcoin can't be held back by one company and/or six developers forever ...
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:40:51
Yes, after paying $20 to set up a payment "channel". And paying another $20 to get your change back from Lighting.   
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:55:01
how to measure decentralization - since it seems to be a very important concept for some people but is left undefined.
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:53:53
Soft forks split the network into mixed sets of nodes with different security levels being applied. Especially important to use a hard fork given the lack of testing and zero buy-in from users and merchants so far.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:11:47
If you believe the market can find optimal solution to fee levels and block sizes, you should support Bitcoin Unlimited. If thats leaving too much power in hands of the "miners" then support BIP101, or any BIP that allows max block size to be set to a value which does not cap transactions artificially. Show faith in the market by choosing pro-market solutions.
You do realize that large pools also suffer negative aspects due to scale, such as being orphaned by their own blocks? And also that simply stuffing massive amounts of transactions into blocks will result in other, probably smaller, pools beating them by producing new blocks with less txn's.
From what I read, you simply haven't made a valid case for interfering in the complex system of incentives &amp; benefits comprising Bitcoin network by forcing an artificial cap on transactions - as is being implemented now by Blockstream/Core developers.
Raise the max block size ASAP and we can go back to a Free Market and a Free Bitcoin network!     
@_date: 2015-12-30 08:03:50
Guess we can't solve all the scaling issues immediately ... so we do nothing? Having worked in technology that stance would have gotten me fired immediately from the banks and other large companies where we deployed systems operating on up to 20k servers. 
How about we increase the block size to let us handle the next million users, while awaiting more efficient networking, better block publishing, etc, etc, etc. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:34:31


   Well, simply by being so large that more than one of your mining nodes find blocks at the same time. Being massive is not a simple no-brainer short-cut to beating every other miner out there ...
 


    Avoid the key issue if you want. Tomorrow its still going to be out there and support for other implementations will continue to rise. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 08:25:24
And if they were paying the amount of fees required to do that it wouldn't be spam. Please pay attention to how the Bitcoin network is actually constructed now, not the way you'd prefer it to be. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:46:12
The focus should be on enhancing the Bitcoin network to fulfil its potential as originally designed, without unproven add-ons. No successful side-chain exists for any coin and Lightning is an incomplete, untested concept with many flaws in the working logic. Both side chains and Lightning should be tested on another coin first as a safety-first approach.  
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:14:52
its miners showing their preferences, shocking as that sounds. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:15:13
It's a max limit, not a preset hardcoded value. You're not adding much to the conversation if you don't know that or are ignoring the difference. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:29:26
 ... unless the original designer specifically setup a scheme to allocate value("block rewards") to miners as a way of subsiding expansion of the network. While these block rewards are significant e.g. &gt; 98% of revenue for miners any attempt to derive excess value from fees will surely kill the very market which is being developed.
Seriously, read the white paper and try to follow why Satoshi setup the system incentives the way he did. Otherwise you're like someone commenting on C++ code who can't even read the stuff, let alone write it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:14:36
False choice. Nether of those is likely or desirable. 
Bitcoin dies if no-one can afford to use it except for the rich and already well-banked in a few western countries - no matter how decentralized it's claimed to be by the purists.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:31:05
ah, well let me put in simple terms. 
* Why don't you trust the market to resolve these pricing &amp; priority issues? 
* What makes you think you know better than a miner what is the marginal cost of adding a txn? 
* If the utility("happiness") gained by a client of the blockchain matches or exceeds the cost of adding some/any data then who are you to interfere in the contract between miner and user?
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:55:16
If you support market forces generating the right level of fee per transaction, then you should support raising or removing completely the max block size parameter. 
Currently the 1MB limit is acting as an artificial cap on transactions, forcing the fee higher than it would normally be and constraining transaction volumes to less than they could be. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:12:50
correlation != causation. Adding more full nodes requires more users ( a small % will be running a full node) and more transactions (nodes need lots of tx to be profitable at some point) ... increasing the max block size is the best, simplest way of doing that now when blocks are full and peoples txn's are being delayed. 
See  for more details on how block size and miner behavior work.
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:11:32
Disrupting paypal/swift/visa/mastercard probably counts as a "win" in the eyes on the Party. so don't count on anything final and dramatic unless c/miners somehow get involved in politics or outright money laundering yuan to offshore. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 13:52:04
Yes, was there. And no matter how pleasant the guys are in person, the business effect of having a small number of entities based in a highly censored country with such influence amounts to a cartel.
small blocks favor the existing cartel, larger blocks would drive greater volume leading to more nodes and lower centralization by location. which would be a good thing IMO.

@_date: 2017-03-18 10:41:20

No-one is getting fired. 
Everyone will continue to work on the features they feel are most important. For Core, this will not be the max blocksize increase requested by users, payment processors, exchanges and majority of miners. Instead, Core can keep building what Blockstream requires for its product 'Lightning' to function.

So fine, raise the max block size to stop the economic basis of Bitcoin changing now due to some artificial hard cap AND work on other solutions providing scalability.
Why not attack the problem in multiple ways, using all the talent and ideas available?     
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:24:36
hmmm. Perhaps its time to go and read the white paper again, as they seem to think Bitcoin is defined by Blockstream/Core code version and not the longest valid chain fo blocks created by majority of hashing capacity.

I wonder if have you written any code in last 10 years or more? Or worked on any large, complex systems involving many dev teams trying to release a common product? 
Seg Wit has some nice fixes bundled in but it's a large, very complex change requiring many parties (wallets, exchanges, block explorers, merchants etc) to extend and test their systems. Why do you not support a simple, tested, agreed change that could be rolled out in weeks?
   
@_date: 2016-01-09 04:39:11
so overall network security is lowered and nodes are forced into essentially SPV-level validation, increasing the amount of node centralization. I wonder how it is that lower security and greater centralization can be justified given the fairly small benefits of SeqWith changes by soft fork?
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:53:28
given your claimed experience, it seems you still don't get the way that Bitcoin handles chain splits and hard forks. Perhaps you can help the coders over at SysCoin identify their hard fork issues with SegWit, that appears to be the code that requires your claimed skills.

Exactly - markets will decide. Bitcoin Unlimited enables users to select their preferred outcome w.r.t max block size.
This is why you are seeing SegWit trailing Bitcoin Unlimited in mining % and why BU will make Core a minority coin soon.
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:25:47
heh. my statement is more factual and reality-based than any of Backs hand-waving confabulations on what increasing the max block size would do for "centralization" of the blockchain he supposedly "invented", apart from the inflation control thingy.

Perhaps you need to read the white paper also. When a majority of the hashing capacity supports "X" or "y" then it's not an attack. Its called Nakamoto consensus.

Do follow the minority chain if you wish: best call it something like "HashCash" or "BSCoin" to be honest in intent, this time. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:41:03
Segwit has some useful features, which if separated for agreement and applied via Hard Fork I could support. But note the fundamental economic changes which added without explanation or input by BTC businesses. LN could be OK, except its business use case is completely broken and the tech design is only 25% done. 
RBF is a malicious, unwanted attack on the network, as are the policies leading to full blocks.
BU can resolve all these conflicts which were generated by Core (funded by Blockstream).
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:19:56
LN being open source makes no difference to the centralizing forces that will cause hubs to become quasi-banks with AML/LYC,100% funded by finance sector such as AXA. 
In case you don't know, the vampire squid comment paraphrases a similar comment about GS and their effect on US Govt. And reflects the imposition of LN on top of BTC by BS.

Then perhaps you need to read more widely, if you don't understand what is a valid chain. Note that the max block size value was changed on temporary basis and does not constitute part of nakamoto consensus for BTC - but I guess you will find out soon enough.
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:02:28
please explain where in the Bitcoin code there is any activation?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:36:29
you have it backwards. Emergent Consensus creates *no* fork, it merely makes communicating peoples preferences easier. UASF as is will result in chain split and Blockstream/Core/supporters on a dying, minority fork. Good luck with your limited understanding based on lies and propaganda.  
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:44:55

@_date: 2017-03-31 15:41:25
Continue with your semantics and avoidance of the key issues. BU will progress towards a fork according to actual user demand and working code based on nakamoto consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:48:35
Nonsense. You obviously don't work with code at any degree of scale, if at all. 
Certainly it must be hard to write code when you're using subjective terms like "safe" and "non-contentious" with software that *already* solved the process of forking and achieving *nakamoto* consensus ...  
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:09:08
you have missed the point entirely. A temporary limit added by Satoshi that he clearly intended to remove later is *not* part of the consensus rule set. As for the soft/gard fork distinction, perhaps we can set that useless argument aside as it looks like SegWit will cause a chain split i.e. effective hard fork anyway. 
Get used to the idea of a fork, it's coming. And get used to the idea that users and miners can signal and accept blocks of any size that works for them.

Please define "immutable" as it relates to the max block size. you haven't provided anything of substance yet.
There is no Spam on the blockchain - all transactions are selected by Miners who seek to optimise their income. Your personal views, like some Core developers, are irrelevant to the system. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:43:17
No, it won't happen that way. Segwit is a political response to a technical limitation which is not required - hence the lack of buy-in by miners. Try the same changes via hard fork and it might possibly take place.

Actually, no. On-chain scaling based on features contributed by many dev teams is *NOT* equal to Off-chain solution like Segwit/LN + economic changes pushed by Blockstream/Core. 
As for stasis being a "good thing", thats obviously wrong when applied to a nascent payment network with many competitors. Reality may come to this sub when the network forks, perhaps ...

@_date: 2017-08-02 22:12:22
Err, no. Lets stop here because you are not using standard definitions for basic Bitcoin elements.
Bitcoin (Cash, Segwit) are examples of blockchains that have statistical levels of immutability i.e. the entire chain *could* be rewritten by lucky or powerful miners. Probability says that won't happen - but it may. 
To address your concern that bigger blocks means moar data written to the ledger, that means that a) the extra data was paid for in fees b) you can prune the ledge on your device as needed.
 
"Spam" is not defined in Bitcoin code or the white paper. Any use of the term means you have applied a *subjective* filter not supported by code or theory. To spell it out: any transaction selected by Miners is valid.

You may have also noticed that 8MB blocks are not being mined, I wonder why that is and what effect it might have on mining requirements?
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:21:08
Actually, it is. 
If you work in software you would be aware of the tradeoff in solving things now vs solving them long term. Choosing the first scaling option is good if it can be done easily(efficiently) and imposes no long-term constraints(technical debt).
Hope this clears it up for the non-technical and also product managers at e.g. Blockstream.

If you understand Rogers background and beliefs then you'd know why he could not support a soft-fork imposing fundamental changes to Bitcoin, both technology and economics.

Being a perma-shill for Core over years means your record is available, did you not understand that when you took the job?

Anyone reading this please do your own research. This sub has many vested interests pushing their own agenda for profit &amp; control - especially when it comes to contentious changes like Segwit which was failing to get support (30% after six months availability) and needed special conference to agree it as a compromise.
As for LN support. Thats not possible now as LN is incomplete as a design, has major security challenges and cannot be used on real-life scenarios. Bitcoin Cash will move to 2nd level solutions as they are needed and as workable designs are presented.

@_date: 2016-12-14 00:20:50
The key economic change in segwit soft fork as proposed is the discount favoring some transaction types over others. Perhaps a discussion could be opened with all interested parties on what, if any discount, should be part of SegWit? This would follow the principle that users of the current implementation should be involved in fundamental changes to the economic settings.
As for intermediaries, LN design and the unresolved routing issues are incentives to have large, well-funded hubs acting as payment processors which would add services like insurance, txn monitoring, guaranteed execution, large txn handling ... kind of like banks which Satoshi, and I believe Roger, would like to see excluded from the p2p money transfer network called Bitcoin.
Propose SegWit as a hard fork and I'm sure most people will agree with majority of the changes. People prefer to have a vote (HF), rather than an opinion poll (SF) which results in policy changes if they don't participate.

Miners that do not mine valid blocks are not part of the network, obviously. You are just going in circles rather than admit the actual role of non-mining nodes which is nothing w.r.t. Bitcoin network state.
If you don't support the current design encoded as Bitcoin protocol you have two choices: spend some money and add to hashing consensus for the chain you prefer to win OR sell your BTC and buy another coin. 
Thats it, there is no other meaningful participation in the Bitcoin network a person can offer. Fake nodes on AWS, reddit trolling and twitter storms (backed by silly hats) are not part of the Bitcoin protocol, thank god.

Ah, Johnny. Still telling lies and trying to fool people into following Core &amp; Blockstream on their march to oblivion ...
After 2X activates, please stay on your own little chain and enjoy the low transaction rate &amp; small blocks as long as you wish. Irrelevancy suits you well.

What is your explanation for 10%(0.1) being a "fair" price for Bitcoin Cash compared to Bitcoin Segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:04:33
Yes, because some people can only do *bad* things and some other people can only do *good* things. Everyone here knows this already, so it rarely has to be explained  /s

hi, greg or person who shares the same ip address. 
... seems greg(nullc) cant debate markets so he sends his sock puppet instead, which is every time.
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:16:42
Yes, indeed. This was the reason Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin ... so that groups losing in the marketplace (ideas, investors, users, exchanges, ...) can go crying to regulators for assistance.

@_date: 2017-09-24 12:35:55
Yes, agreed. It just so happens that the people losing money will be you and anyone following your flawed advice.

Do try to respond to the OP instead of making up stuff that I never said.

As if all rules in bitcoin code base (fundamental, accidental, ...) are the same and have same effect on markets when changed ... 
Do you not understand the dynamic interplay between supply and demand in a free market?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:35:21
Only if miners have some degree of control over price, which they don't. Miners are price-takers, not price-makers ...
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:45:47
it would make no difference at all. Nodes do not vote on anything in Bitcoin, by design. People vote in the markets to buy or sell coins generated by mining. 
It's just that simple, and it worked for years ... until we had a "fee market" a.k.a. artificial supply limit imposed by those skilled in c++ but not economics.

With flexible block size on Bitcoin network, we don't have to trust another layer and take risks with our money. Bitcoin was designed to *avoid* people and services being injected between you and your payee ...
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:02:53
and who decides to change the POW? 
"Firing" miners won't fix the problems that Bitcoin Core suffers from. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:51:11
You didn't read the post or failed to understand it's point. Please try again and don't conflate everything compiled into Core's code binary as being "consensus rules".
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:41:38
The only situation like the one you have described is when either supply or demand for the product that is Bitcoin transactions is artificially restricted e.g. when a temporary 1MB limit is made into an absolute limit or held below its natural market-driven level.
This naturally results in an imperfect market where corruption will thrive, like any banana republic with import licenses and quotas on goods. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:01:05
Thats already happening, though not at the same time. Check bitfinex.com, but watch out as they use the wrong name for Bitcoin Cash. 
Indeed, you can do this any time you like ... download the code and fork off a new one, adding an ETH token on etherdelta to trade the split futures.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:31:17
People vote for or against a coin by buying and selling. Running a node does nothing to ensure the health of Bitcoin, beyond the need for few thousand nodes to share block data. Mining counts, nodes don't. 
As for removing "Automated audit", I guess you would agree that Segwit is a very bad thing - since it upgraded the network via soft fork leaving many nodes unable to "audit" blocks. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:39:27
In the wider Bitcoin space (those not paid, bought or bullied by Blockstream and its lackeys) he gained massive credibility due to the obvious honesty and integrity backing his critique. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:01:13
supported by AWS 'full nodes'. Exactly as described in White Paper
@_date: 2016-10-29 13:53:51
Amusing. Not a single thing is being advocated except for you, Greg Maxwell, to come out &amp; say why you are personally invested in avoiding a hard fork. 
Any conspriracy exists only in your own mind, you have lost touch with objective reality.
@_date: 2016-10-29 09:21:55
I will take that as a "YES". 
Note that no-one is suggesting confiscation of any kind - just that you be honest about the incentives which might influence technical choices made by you &amp; your company. Is that too much to ask when dealing with a protocol built expressly to remove corruption?
@_date: 2016-10-29 09:01:25
and this is the one simple reason you cannot accept a hard fork - because you foolishly committed to receiving 'locked' coins based on design that could be changed at any time. 
Corrupt an entire currency just so you can hold on to your coins ... no wonder you are despised so greatly in the whole Bitcoin space.

if you are familiar with github then try browsing to answer your own question above. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 10:01:38
seems you have not heard of Github.  
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:13:22
he has been contributing in last 12 months and even up until last month: 
Why should we trust Core and/or Blockstream-paid developers with commit access but not someone who worked on Bitcoin for years without rushing off to get VC funding to make himself rich off Satoshis ideas ...
@_date: 2016-05-07 07:49:32
 appears to disagree with your statement. Why is a long-time contributor who helped build Bitcoin locked out from the repo by developers working for a for-profit company.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:11:31
I don't see any reason why BtcDrak should adjust what he wrote - its a plain and simple reaction to an extremely bad idea i.e. censoring Satoshis orginal white paper and pretending the "corrected" version is the original.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:02:42
Erasing and rewriting Satoshis words is clearly what is intended. 
How hard can it be to write a new document under different name and host it under a new URL?
 
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:26:47
changing a published document to reflect an alternate agenda or revised history is censoring that persons writing, especially when the plan is to represent the "corrected" version as the original for unsuspecting newcomers to Bitcoin.
Disgusting, unethical behavior.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:35:46
Well, re-writing Satoshis white paper and replacing the linked online version so that newcomers see it as the true original would surely be "... putting words in other peoples mouths". 
Do you get the reason behind the objections to this crazy plan now?
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:19:48
"This new version can then become the new Bitcoin paper, and we can deprecate the old one".
Same effect. Censoring the original copy and changing what people see when they go looking for Satoshis white paper.
Be honest. Write a Bitcoin white paper under your name and publish at a different address instead of amending the original and pretending it's the real thing.  
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:20:09
First, provide your own qualifications so we can know this won't be a total waste of time.

yeah, obviously. because who needs a P2P money transfer network to grow?
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:14:51
It's not a "resource". It's the white paper and amending it to suit the current designs and plans of the Core team is re-writing history to suit an agenda.
Here's an idea: go and write a new white paper under your name, containing all the great ideas you think belong under the rubric "Bitcoin". No-one is stopping you - just leave Satoshis version as is.   
@_date: 2017-06-25 04:29:34
you didn't address the statement, and your last comment seems to be aimed at someone else?
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:17:39
perhaps you simply don't know what the word means, or believe that it should not apply to what you do. Ignorant or ethically challenged ... take your pick.
