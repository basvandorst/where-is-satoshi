Would be interesting to see how they account for their business.
What does their balance sheet look like- do they market the bitcoins to market that they hold.
How do they account profit/cash flow- in the fees they charge to transact?
The difference between coinbase/bitpay  and western union/payal is they have to hold inventory

china could care less about bitcoin

Absolutely not! The IRS will not change gears unless they can raise more revenue from the change.
The IRS killed two birds with one stone with their ruling
-they collect tax on bitcoin as "property" and they disable it as a currency by making it impracticable to use

No, bitcoin is a currency it needs to be spent like cash
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:54:00
but its not a currency! the IRS says its "property"
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:38:58
actually it's not if you use BTC as a currency you have to figure out your tax basis for gain or loss each time you use it!

on the exchanges, their own or in private transactions?

the spouting whale gets harpooned. bitcoin took off quick. Mt gox didn't help either

Correct they are divisible and there are/will be only 21 million no matter how you divide them BUT there are and will be BILLIONS/TRILLIONS more units of alt currencies issued by banks, private companies and others that will  dilute the demand for bitcoin.

I don't have to show anything. Everything about bitcoin is theoretical as it has not physical substance.
The question remains if a malicious third party (US GOV't?) decided to mess with the blockchain what could be done to prevent it?

I wonder how many people who own bitcoin trust gold?

at some point these companies will probably want to do IPO's -just trying to figure out if the money to be made is on volume or price appreciation.

"Actually their business requires them to have cash on hand to pay vendors which would require them to sell BTC to maintain cash flow"
Makes sense but in order for them to make money they have to make sure the exchange of bitcoin to dollars is as close to a wash as possible and then collect a fee for making the exchange.
Would seem that when the price is volatile and their volume is heavy they would have to engage in some sophisticated trading or lose a lot of money when the price is heading steadily down. When the price is going straight up the reverse impact would be felt. 
But I think their business model is not to hold coins and get the appreciation because if it was they would have lost a lot already.

the cost of doing business for paypal is too high with the tax. Does the Puerto Rican government really believe that the tax will work?
