As Bitcoin gains traction as money and economy, changes to Bitcoin as protocol and software become more difficult and costly. This is true for even relatively minor BIPS, let along hard-forking changes. Do you expect the rate of these changes to slow to near-zero? Would you give a guess as to how much improvement we'll actually see in the next three years?

Had this happen a month ago with an exposed AWS key to the tune of $20K, apparently mining Minero coin. Their bot beat the AWS defensive bot's warning by about eight hours.

93, slowly fluctuating. iftop shows around 50kbps total TX, which would only account for a tenth of the monthly traffic volume. I suspect it's occasional new nodes pulling down the blockchain that dominate monthly bandwidth.

Finally got a response back--it was a coding error, with "invalid membership level" being encoded with a -1. That in turn got mapped to membership level 1, which is Platinum, at $100K.
I'll renew with Bitcoin.

I'm not yet sure what's going on, but something is clearly awry. Pretty certain this did come from clicking the $25 annual renewal at 
Hopefully just a coding error on their part.

No, I chose to pay with a credit card this time--long story.

Theymos, deleting Classic discussions on the rationale that it's an altcoin is farcical. You are damaging your own credibility and Bitcoin as a whole.

Can confirm: phishing spam with poor spelling in my Gmail spambox, sent to a unique email address I've used only with CampBX. "we ask you no more on this url you connect..."
Edit: the address is campbx so could have been guessed. If so, others with vanity domains who have not used CampBX should find these spams, also.
