Yes BTC price can be manipulated by TPTB. But it's the same for all assets that have developed futures markets. The tail can wag the dog! But! I consider it merely a short term price risk that does nothing to stop BTC fulfilling its utility-&gt;network effect-&gt;price in the long run.

Wrong. Bitcoin is now a mature financial instrument with all the bells and whistles of the traditional asset classes. As such there are well developed borrow and lending markets that allow hodlers to lend out their Bitcoin (for a fee) to short-sellers. Often times short-sellers are not nasty people who want to smash the market and hurt people. Rather, they are simply trying to arbitrage the spot/futures markets when they get out of line. 
The real issue is who are the scumbags that are smashing the futures market and causing the tail to wag the dog. My best guesses are the Fed's trading desk and JP Morgan but really it could be anyone powerful in the legacy financial system. Fact is that mechanisms are in place for them to tank the Bitcoin price whenever they want to. 
That said, my belief is that even the most powerful can not stop a paradigm shift of this magnitude. For even if they hurt the price, cause pain and disillusionment amongst us, they can never erase what has been created here - permissionless access to a global, censorship-resistant, payment network. 
Conclusion - The powers that be can win in the short term but in the long term Bitcoin will be monetized (valued) according to Metcalf's Law. Science wins in the end. Long science my friends.
