Another reason to get Schnorr signatures in Bitcoin. =)
I think there are a few changes which might make the transactions smaller without major protocol changes such as using preimages rather than signatures, aggregating the transactions and reusing the outputs from one epoch in the next epoch. For now our focus is on safety, simplicity and usability.

The protocol [as specified in the paper]( prevents a TumbleBit tumbler or payment hub:
1. from stealing a user's Bitcoins, 
2. and violating a user's privacy (that is, determining Alice paid Bob).

I was assuming that Courtois was saying given one signature you only need "a single" additional signature to compromise the private key. Reading the full transcript in the GQ I see you are correct.

TumbleDore is amazing! Who has dips on it?
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:53:51


I agree. We are planning on developing a production-ready library, however doing that right will take time.


While TumbleBit is not technically a partially blind signature scheme (it uses blinded puzzles), I believe it does have the property you are looking for. Like a partially blind signature scheme the hub when initially setting up a channel does get to see and approve the content which it is signing ([see Fig 5 Step 6]( TumbleBit does this to allow the blind decryption of ECDSA signatures but our technique is far more general and could support more complex functions.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:07:39
My guess, he is talking about nonce reuse or related nonce attacks on ECDSA. People have recovered private keys and then stolen Bitcoin using two ECDSA signatures on the blockchain because the person rolling their own crypto messed up nonce generation. This is why Wright talks about using a custom random number generator for the nonces.
A talk on this was posted to r/Bitcoin last week:
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:18:38
What about nonce reuse or related nonce attacks which Bitcoin is vulnerable to as Bitcoin uses ECDSA for signatures?


@_date: 2016-08-29 19:17:13
This seems like a business question more than a protocol question but I'll try to answer it. 
Like most Bitcoin tumbler services a TumbleBit payment hub or tumbler would require an initial pool of Bitcoins and could charge a small fee (most Tumblers charge 1-2%).
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:08:25


The tumbler is a centralized service like many other tumblers, however unlike other tumblers it is untrusted.


The TumbleBit payment hub is a hub and spoke model. Since TumbleBits core primitive is a anonymous HTLC, it could potentially be integrated in other protocols such as the Lightning Network or DMCs.
Both the payment hub and the classic tumbler functionality require connecting via a service like TOR to hide network-layer information.


The more users that mix in an epoch the greater the anonymity set offered in that epoch, so teams could gain boost anonymity by mixing in the same epoch. I'm not sure I answered your question.

Not true, finding some of these exploits takes time, that time could be used elsewhere to make money. If a company does not pay out enough in bug bounties the researcher has no legal recourse but the researcher has a right to be anger, warn other researchers and do research on platforms that more fairly reward researcher. 
tl;dr If you are getting paid too little for your work you are allowed to be upset about this and complain.

White hats are mostly "security professionals", it is a job to them. The idea is to get paid and not break the law. 


Note that the word "ethical" here is a stand-in for the word lawfully employed, it doesn't actually mean altruistic or moral. Plenty of "ethical" hackers ie whitehats work for companies which sell substandard products that harm rather than help their customers security, plenty also work for companies that are making everyone more secure.
White hat = lawful (good or evil)
Black hat = chaotic (good or evil)

A hardfork is always possible regardless of mining power, however at a low mining power share you might need a difficulty retarget as part of the hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:49:43
I certainly would hope they wouldn't just hardfork the network. It seems reasonable to prepare for a BTU hardfork and then a BTU PoW attack on the BTC network. I don't know if any such attack would happen but given the last few months it doesn't seem like anything is off the table.
**EDIT:** I want to make it clear that I am not saying BTU is going to do this. However during periods of upheaval in the community it is reasonable to plan for misbehavior. "trust but verify" always seemed like a good motto for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:25:21
I would add an additional utility that banks can offer: reducing coordination costs. For instance on-blockchain payments take so long because they must get consensus in a distributed fashion. A centralized database would be far more faster because a single party acts to coordinate the payment. In fact it is also a win from a privacy standpoint as building a very private centralized currency is fairly simple and was developed over twenty years ago. It is significantly harder to achieve in a decentralized setting.
Decentralized settings tend to have one advantage that it more important than all of their disadvantages: preserving user autonomy.
The question is how do you empower a single party to coordinate payments without harming user autonomy. TumbleBit does this by preventing the coordinating party, the hub, from stealing from the user while boosting the user's privacy. It can only do this because it builds on a decentralized system which is already autonomy preserving. The hope is we can get the best of both worlds: autonomy + (performance, scalability and privacy).

"A canoe can be safer than a rowboat if it induces more caution in the passengers, particularly if they are otherwise inclined to squabble and fight among themselves. Still, the danger is almost bound to be too little stability not too much of it" - Thomas Schelling


I would hope and expect BTU to act ethically and not to attack BTC after a hardfork. However they, and some BTU aligned actors, do have some incentives to do so (not without risk as you point out). For instance reducing trust in the BTC network may alter the exchange rate between BTC and BTU in BTUs favor. With this would bring additional credibility and mining profitability. This might bring undecided miners from BTC to BTU further weakening to BTC to PoW attacks. If BTU gets enough credibility it becomes the official Bitcoin. Essentially this is the win condition for BTU.


I agree that attacking BTC is playing with fire, people still play with fire and get burned quite often. We saw various shenanigans during the ETH/ETC hardfork and it makes sense to prepare for such shenanigans during the BTC/BTU hardfork.

BTU is a "stock ticker" (like BTC or XMR) which several exchanges have agreed to use for a Bitcoin Unlimited hardfork as a temporary measure during and directly proceeding a hardfork. When the dust settles they will assign BTC to whichever chain has the most value/support. 
Some, such as CoinBase, have criticized this terminology because they feel neither side of the fork should be identified as BTC, however I believe it is reasonable to call the current consensus code BTC and the new consensus code BTU.

There are many options and attacks between do nothing and suicide the network. For instance preventing segwit from activating on BTC after the BTU miners fork.
I would argue that rationality and incentives only get you so far in predicting a conflict. Plenty of wars, business disputes, and feuds were not in any parties interest yet they still happened. The Bitcoin block size "debate" had not been a model of rationality either, not sure why we should expect rationality to start being a good predictor now.

Also if you restart half the network (as is easily possible with a remote crash bug) then you can also boost your eclipse probability because you lower the chances of a node finding a non-attacker node which is online.

It can enable [eclipse attacks](
 which allow a bunch of really bad stuff to happen such as:
1. N-confirmation doublespends, 
2. 51% attacks with far less than 51% of the mining power. 
Performing a countermeasure now it much harder now that it was in the past due to recent countermeasures. I'd estimate you need [~6000 IPv4 addresses (i.e. a small botnet) for &gt;50% success]( However, ability to trigger a restart/crash means you can just keep trying until you eclipse.

What ever happened to IBLT?
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:22:56
I have no idea how practical the attack is but my understanding would be that the attack could impact three layers:
1. Bandwidth exhaustion of P2P layer.
2. Thread/buffer network management problems (how well do the threads handle many messages at once from many different sources. There have been problems at this layer before.).
3. CPU exhaustion at the validation layer by forcing nodes to check all these transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:35:42
I think what the OP is assuming that the attacker chooses transactions with large enough outputs and fees such that these would by-pass the protections you list. Question could be reframed as how much would an attacker have to spend (Bitcoin is more protected than some other networks in the sense that this attack would actually cost money to pull off). 
Note that such an attack would benefit from an amplification effect as nodes would broadcast each malicious transaction to their peers. 10 MB of attack traffic becomes a larger amount of P2P traffic.

To answer some of your questions:
* Multiple tumblebit hubs could exist, however in the paper we assume just one hub as it maximizes privacy. 
* Bob tells Alice how to pay him by sending her the RSA puzzle to solve. This could work like a single use address. 
* Similar to the lightning network transaction fees should be lower in our payment hub scheme as payments are made off-blockchain. 
* In regards to wallet integration. We are still figuring that out. For the classic tumbler you would have a tumble button that would move a fixed amount of bitcoins to a fresh address via the tumbler. The payment hub requires more UX thought.

@_date: 2019-01-28 21:20:12
Thanks for your questions =)
\&gt;Why is there special notice about the shitcoin KUCoin in the article? Does it have more to do with your protocol than just an asset being traded?
This was already answered, KuCoin is an exchange not a coin. I can understand your concern and I want to add Arwen is not doing an ICO, there is no token, we are a VC backed startup. We aren't vaporware either you can download our app on [arwen.io]( and do atomic swaps between BTC, BCH and LTC testnet coins.
\&gt;Also, how does this compete with Blockstream's liquid product?
Arwen does not compete with Liquid but both Arwen and Liquid could mutually benefit each other. Arwen is a protocol for trading assets between blockchains thus we could add Liquid support and let people trade for example LTC to Liquid-JPY. I should be careful to note that we don't currently have Liquid support but I've been a big fan of Liquid for sometime and would be interested in supporting it.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:09:46
Thanks! I had been looking for an article like that it would've saved me a bunch of time googling.  
Using your terminology Arwen is a hybrid between a 'Fully centralized crypto bank' and an 'Atomic Swap exchange' with the addition of layer two a.k.a 'Lightning Network (LN) like technology'.

Thanks, we've been writing software for a year so we are very psyched to be able to share it now.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:06:55
We are building on the TierNolan atomic swaps protocol but adding some new features. We have a full discussion of atomic swaps, their promise, their problems and what Arwen is doing different in section two of our [whitepaper](
The short answer is that:  
* Arwen uses layer two protocols to make trading fast. Someone said "Lightning network but for trading"
  
* Arwen is not a peer-to-peer protocol instead a user's counter party is always the exchange. This allows for very good price discovery and highly liquid trading.  
* Because users are trading against a centralized exchange's orderbook, there is not "bootstrapping" problem. Instead even if you are the only Arwen user in existence you will be able to trade.  


Our protocols are novel but they build on quite a bit of existing work.

How does the API find out about blocks? Other APIs? The network? If I were an attacker I'd target the APIs first for eclipsing or bring them down with a DDoS at a critical moment. After  partitioning a Bitcoin node you don't have to use that capability immediately, you can relay blocks and transactions so no one detects the partition until the time is right to strike.
APIs would make the attack harder since they add an additional channel of information, but only if everyone used both the network and the API. Unfortunately if people began trusting the API over the network they may help an attacker.

Segwit doesn't take any power away from the miners. It fixes transaction malleability. 
Explain Bitcoin to a professional cryptographer, they'll start laughing uncontrollably when you get to the part where TXIDs include the signatures. It is a really basic mistake and exactly the sort of bug that has been biting engineers designing cryptosystems since 1990s. This isn't too make fun of Satoshi, it just shows that their crypto knowledge was fairly limited (no one is an expert on everything). Transaction malleability should to be fixed. It's an obvious improvement that makes pretty much any engineering with Bitcoin easier.
We can argue if transaction malleability should be fixed with a hardfork or softfork. There are good points on either side, but in either case it needs to be fixed. It should have been fixed in 2012.

The papers are very different, although they share one co-author.
**On Bitcoin and Red Balloons:** examines the incentives of miners/nodes to relay transactions from the perspective of game theory.
**Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network:** shows how an attacker can manipulate the peer discovery system to restructure a node's connections and thereby partition the victim node from the rest of the network. It then carries out this attack against live nodes in the Bitcoin network.

Hard enough is hard to define, especially when dealing with adaptive adversaries. Hard enough yesterday is rarely hard enough today.


I was suggesting that Stanford and other oracles were partitioned from other parts of the network so no forging required. They all report the same blocks, these are the blocks you see as well, somewhere else in the network people not using the API's see something else. 


If 80% of the mining power does not subscribe, and they are partitioned from you, someone can perform an N-confirmation attack against you by feeding your partition different blocks from the other partition.


Given standard network behavior Stanford and Google would disagree from time to time as eclipsing occurs naturally during blockraces. Nodes only forward the first fork they see during a blockrace. Disagreement would not be a sign of an attack. Disagreement isn't actually bad though because the more information you have the better. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:59:19


I agree that ECDSA is secure if the engineers producing code that makes use of it do not make any mistakes. However I would point out that there are signature schemes which are far more robust to engineering error than ECDSA. For instance unlike ECDSA related nonces in RSA do not allow anyone seeing those two signatures to recover the secret key.

Not using Latex is a signal but not the only signal. The signal is that this person is not a recent computer science academic. As someone who did quite a bit of research as a non-academic before going to grad school, I can attest that contributing to academic research without being on the inside is very hard. It's hard to know what problems have already been solved, what problems are very hard, and what the common approaches are. Generally papers produced by people without access to this community and store of knowledge make well known simple mistakes.
Just because most papers are crap doesn't mean they all are. For instance I drew the conclusion that Satoshi was not an academic when I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper. I still read it and found it fascinating. In fact, I think Bitcoin benefitted from a non-academic point of view.


Galois, one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th Century was rejected from French academies because he used non-standard notation. This is nothing new.
All of this is a long way of saying that even when I was outside of academia I knew that if I wanted to be taken seriously I had to publish work in Latex. The hardest part of research is communicating ideas and the first rule of communication is know your audience.

I assumed the OP meant full-node as in, not SPV. You are correct, if you want incoming connections you need to configure your firewall to forward Bitcoin ports. I would add that their are many reasons to run "connectable" nodes beyond mere altruism.
Another fix is to run two Bitcoin nodes, one inside the firewall and one outside the firewall (on cloud hosting perhaps). The node inside the firewall uses the -connect param so that it only talks to the node outside the firewall. Thus, the node inside the firewall should have access to the same information as a node which allows incoming connections.
Do you need a public IP to run a ToR hidden service? If not, that might be another option, although sybil attacks against Bitcoin nodes running as ToR hidden services are scary.

It is both. Anonymity can enable the maintenance of the legitimacy of governing institutions and thus prevent them from becoming tyrannies. Yet, at the same time anonymity by powerful actors can be used to pushed society toward tyranny. This notion is best captured by the adage: "transparency for the powerful, privacy for the powerless".
