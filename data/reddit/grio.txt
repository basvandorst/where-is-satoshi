Yes, but remember that time tulips got involved...

Let's curb the crowd mentality at least this once.
If he's as smart as you think he is, he'll achieve his own goals without mass pity donations.

Should've stopped after the bullet list.
Other than that, you're on point. I like some content in this subreddit, but to find it you have to dig through piles of "EVERYTHING'S SO AMAZING EVEN WHEN IT HURTS" nonsense, along with it's less frequent "sky is falling" cousin.
Some common sense and moderation goes a long way to anchor people's expectations and decrease the chance of emotion-dictated crashes.

Are you saying that fees are too high?
I don't think anyone is in any doubt on that subject by now. This needs to be fixed, although how and when - that's yet TBD. Lightning network has it's own issues.

Obviously, the best advice is to wait some more to see if prices drops lower, then sell it at the lowest point, because "it feels awful". You can then rebuy after price recovers.
/s, just in case
DO NOT SPEND MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. THIS IS GAMBLING.
As is, you have some difficult decisions to make, and you alone are responsible for them.

Corn has gone through 16 levels of genetic modification before it's become the corn you see today. 
Bitcoin is only on it's 2nd layer of development, which obviously means THERE'S NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THEM, STOP SHOVELING WATER WITH THIS NONSENSE.
Bitcoin isn't internet, or tulips, or anything in between. Nobody knows how it'll go, or where it'll end. It might change our lives for the next century, or it might lose all value within a year.
Invest if you like the idea, the process, or simply the gambling. Spending money because someone drew a beautiful, promising, yet far-fetched metaphor is just stupid. Don't be stupid.

This looks great, and would be even better if numbers/words wouldn't disappear so quickly. Either way, well done!
Can you also make one with 5k instead of 15k? It might come handy in a week or so.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:28:49
...with a 150% fee on top. Yea, good deal.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:36:34
Or it could stabilize at current price. Or it could go down 20 times. 
Pure speculation, nobody knows for sure.

Institution(s) likely finished stocking up on Friday, and we're back to normal Bitcoin price fluctuations. For one day.

Bcash price is spiking since yesterday, interesting.

Nothing better than wishful thinking.
"If I roll red ONLY five times in a row, I'm going to be a millionnaire! Let's bet the house on it."
It's at least as likely to go to 0, as it is to go to 100,000. Always keep that in mind.

One sentiment is, large futures traders hold a stock of Bitcoin to help "nudge" the price in the direction they need by either buying more, or selling what they have, rapidly.

Such brilliant prediction, almost cartesian in it's elegance!

That whole purchase wouldn't be enough to pay half the transaction fee.

Make sure you finish your transactions before Sunday, and complete the circle of self-annihilation just in time.

"...he doesn't go around bragging about all his money or use it to belittle others."
He literally just did that. Both people in this story are terrible human beings.

If you're not day trading, you have no reason to keep checking it.
Buy and forget until you want to use it. And if you can't - don't buy at all. Getting obsessed over such trivial amounts gives you no joy and is counterproductive.

Too many information holes for an "expert", I'm sceptical regarding your self promoted experience in the field.
Take this advice with a grain of salt.

This sounds like a serious question, which makes it even funnier to me.
Can we trade now? No? Halted? Can we trade now? No? [Can we trade now](

I'll take it further and see you for $5000.

This is a shitpost of the lowest caliber.
Not to mention I dislike whatabouts in general.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:41:07
Oh god, are you in for a surprise on Monday.
I predict $5000.

Only 15% price change in 4 hours, boring.
Even though that's not influenced by future trading, yet.
We'll see if anyone tries to seriously influence the prices in the next couple of days, and then again in a bit more than a week.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:07:52
There's no panic, but there is a coordinated price manipulation.

Dumb and lucky.
I don't think this is the last time he makes a bad decision, and next time it'll burn him.
