Basically yes, although I'd argue that's still just cause for amazement.

Does this comparison data for altcoins take into account at all the varying performance of your hardware under the different algorithms, e.g. SHA256 vs. scrypt?  (would it even be possible for them to?)
For instance, this data certainly seems to indicate that Litecoins are more profitable.  However, using my ATI 6870HD, I can mine Bitcoins at around 260 MH/s.
However, when mining Litecoins through scrypt, I lose the GPU advantage (although now the CPU becomes much more useful) and can get maybe 70 MH/s on GPU+CPU combined.
Last time I tried Litecoins and monitored this (a month ago?), it was actually drastically more profitable to mine Bitcoins despite the rising difficulty due to the decreased effectiveness of my hardware.
I would guess that the site you shared would need to indicate then that the Litecoin/Bitcoin ratio exceeds 371% (260/70) before Litecoin mining would become advantageous for my specific case.  Am I incorrect in this understanding?
Edit: Obviously, for nvidia hardware, the difference in effectiveness should reduce quite a bit.

*miners. Confused the hell out of me for a second.

Shoot, you're right. I meant 70 kh/s.

Upvote for use of 'swag' in the only acceptable context.

Thanks for the info, I'll give it a second look!
