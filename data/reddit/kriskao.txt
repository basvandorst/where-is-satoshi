Not stealing. 
But also. Not not stealing.

May I ask where you bought this?
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:46:53
Thank you, mate! this rocks
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:17:27
News got worse and less reliable
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:25:38
And social is even worse

Why use a exchange?
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:47:53
This is false 
There is no law banning bitcoins in Bolivia. 
There is no law explicitl6 allowing it either.

Associating manipulation of global economy with a race, a gender and an age group is racist, sexist and ageist
Op didn’t say anything about most rich people after all. They just pointed at evil manipulation of economy and old white men.

Shouldn't it be A/B instead of 1. 2. ? 
I mean it reads as if they were consecutive steps instead of mutually exclusive options.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:42:21
I never said that was untrue.
It can easily be true but focusing on race and gender and age takes the focus away from the real issue.
The same tweet could have been much more focused if it didn't come with all that unnecessary bigotry.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:23:50
But it is racism
Racism is not ok just because it is targeted at whites
Ageism is not ok because it’s targeted at older people
Sexism is not ok just because it’s targeted at men

It would prefer usd/btc 
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:59:15
Well yes. Older people get the ageist bigotry more frequently, but in this particular OP the target is old white men.

Not sure I understand this. IMHO:
Currency is not the same a shares in a company
Market caps are for companies 
Bitcoin is currency
Even if the added value of all existing coins converted to dollars is one billion (I don’t know if it is), it does not mean that a market cap of bitcoin exists and is equal to one billion
Please correct me if I am wrong (I could easily be wrong)

I agree. Comparing bitcoin to banks confuses people who are just starting to learn about it
Placing bitcoin in a list of corporations further confuses them
This is a bad slide for educating newcomers

I'll buy your bitcoin and pay with PayPal.
Since none of us have any reason to rust each other, it can go like this:
You send the smallest possible amount, I pay you twice that, you send twice what I paid, and so on.
I put this in the comments instead of a direct message as a way to suggest others to do the same.
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:12:21
Easily. The dollar (or any currency) can depreciate to nearly zero
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:27:18
Why even try to match or compare bitcoin with other things?
Nothing exists in the same category.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:59:36
Reply that you will send the bitcoin, but you need them to send a small amount first just to validate theirs account ;-)
