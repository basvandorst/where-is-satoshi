Oh no another fuck up and more people losing money...If you invested I hoped you knew it was extremely risky. I have lost money on other things but as with all things in Bitcoin investing I thought If I lose anything Its my fault. Didn't bet more than I could afford. Still fucking sucks...scams, charlatans and thieves everywhere

Well who knows what will happen. All I can say is its new territory for an open source peer to peer decentralized network that has truly solved the double spend probllem/ and to answer your other question...the similarities Bitcoin has to the Internet is in terms of protocols &amp; netowrk effect. The internet had standardized TCP/IP which became the standard that all other protocls are built ontop of. And Bitcoin is a new protocol again which can be built ontop of &amp; again couple with the network effect. It grows exponentially.

Bitcoin is obviously a fantastic invention but what is very interesting indeed is the Aurocoin project. In Iceland everyone will be given each 30 or so of these crytpo coins for free where it is hoped it will ignite trade within the communtiy outside traditional banking strucutres....What if this could be done everywhere. Just create a crypto for each country...pre mine 50% and give that to the people equally. Then watch and see if people all agree to trade with it. Real wealth cretion.

I want to scream out loud...it angers me so much.
Bitcoin being used for tax dodging is probably at the very bottom of the list of actual uses right now..its a fantastic currecny..built by people who know the truth.
And how can they blame people for wanting a tax haven away from the cartel? ( which is in no way advocated by me ) what do they do with taxes?
They start illegal wars and bail out the fucking banks and enslave your children.

So you you have bought BTC as an investment..ok well you can choose to purchase shares in companies which yield a dividend or look to invest in start ups. If your broke however and you just have a small amount of BTC i'd suggest saving it until you want to buy something with it or just for mere speculative purposes. 
Do you mean by trading buying amounts and selling taking advantage of arbitrage? because if so you will require substantial amounts of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 10:21:09
Actually you can't take anyones Bitcoins away from them... It is Public and Private key encryption this is the crux of the argument here..
If you do not have the private key you cannot take ANYONES Bitcoin...Government or ortherwise. So they COULD throw you in prison but they are not having anyones Bitcoin

I have more of a political reason to enjoy spending Bitcoins, Namely the fact that the money im using did not come from any central bank authority and cannot be frozen or stopped in transit. 
Then it gets you thinking what will happen when this idea really catches on. Think about how the world is now being run by governments borrowing money from central banks who own the money printing press who then inturn do all kinds of criminal acts against humanity. Then think of this alternative....its nothing short of dynamite. Take away the criminals ability to use their own money printing press and the world will look very different. No more bought and paid for politicians...hell no more crown heads of the world...Kings and queens could even be swept aside when they can no longer be financed by the "top down" money fascism. Not to mention the abilioty to really fund new technology by the people for the people and paid for by the peoples money. Ok im rambling now but i digress bitcoin is POWERFUL !!!

Ripple in my opinion is not in the same vein as Bitcoin. For one the coins are pre mined and half is kept in the company approx 50 Billion. So based on that if it were to become popular and value added to the XRP (Ripples) you are actually giving value to a company. It is not decentralized it is a for profit enterprise and it just does not compare to the freedom and architecture of Bitcoin IMO

Sorry but i have to argue semantics here. Currency falls yes MONEY is different because it has a store of value which due to the algorithm Bitcoin has. So what you are saying is correct but does not apply to the definition of money.

Well just think of it this way the debt pile is completely unserviceble and will never be paid back because it was never actually meant to be paid back. It was there to enslave right from the get go. A simple fact. If all the debt in the world was to be paid off ...there would not be a single dollar bill in circulation anywhere.

We are witnessing a true free market attainting a fair market value. Unmanipulated it will rise and crash many times. As it is a new technology its effect on an outdated model is almost irrelvent. What I mean by that is its only a bubble if you denominate its value in a Fiat currency. All Fiat eventually dies not one exception to this rule ... so where is the real bubble?

Is this card basically a pre-paid? I sell one through my website which you load with BTC then you can use at any Visa/Mastercard retailer + get cash out at ATMS. or is it different...

@_date: 2013-06-04 21:29:18
I think it is still there as technically you are still converting to fiat but it will allow to spend your Bitcoins at retailers that do not accept BTC. Its a first step and granted we all want to see just a Bitcoin transaction and the Fiat part of the retailer/cusomter equation go the way of the dodo. Small steps though. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:30:58

To be honest at this point anything looks better in comparison to the Dollar but its just not as striking or innovative as Bitcoin. Its seems built on the same premise (Dollar)...printing paper no limit to it and so on.

@_date: 2013-06-28 20:29:48
Well one piece of evidence which is crucial is that ALL paper Fiat money there has ever been in existence has collapsed. 
So for me Bitcoin is a bet against the Debt ponzi system. As is Gold and silver. But Bitcoin is sooo much more usuable in terms of trade. 
Basically what im saying is absolute mathematical certainty Fiat money will collapse...no argument whatsoever there statement of fact. When that happens in its latent stage who knows quite when.....Bitcoin will spike again.. will rise from the ashes and will be completely viable/ in my humble opinion.
@_date: 2013-08-18 09:03:45

This was all supposed to happen within the Algorithm...It should not be a surprise to anyone. The more miners and GH/TH power the harder the difficulty...its simply designed to be like that. Otherwise what would happen? every fucker mining all sorts of stuff with a low difficulty just because its too hard to mine BTC...Tell you now i dont think its worth mining other things when BTC is the only one that has real traction. Stick with it even if its a a hard difficulty the other alt crypto are essentially as of now not worth anything

$10bn market cap a little over 10% of whats printed every single month by the fed..my point of course Bitcoin is far more valuable than a $ demonination.

No I dont think so...Its the opposite to what we have almost. A currency that holds value and increases value promotes saving which is a good thing. It can also create a vast amount of wealth jobs etc as people will want to offer products and services for a currency that holds and retains real value....I am led to think it can only 'harm' the shadowy interests that have had a hold on Fiat money for so long.
