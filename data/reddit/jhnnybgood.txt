Uhhhhhhh, I don't think that's happening at all.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:54:38
I guess Lighthouse can't come soon enough
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:50:23
Ouch. I feel for those guys, but we couldn't have predicted the crash after the Mt. Gox collapse. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:20:56
The commenters on that site make me want to scream.
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:51:47
Thanks Captain Obvious. What's the next bit of wisdom, grass is green?
@_date: 2014-08-22 15:50:39
+1 for the laugh
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:33:34
What's got your panties all up in a bunch? I guess it's too unrealistic to expect something like this can actually happen, huh?
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:24:31
If I'm not mistaken, these are the really old ASICs that would only do a couple hundred MEGAhashes. If you're not mining with at least 30GH/s, you're really just spinning your wheels. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:24:10
Yup. Crowd-funding has seen many terrific successes as well as failures. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:31:48
You need to understand hashing, specifically SHA-256, but (very) simply put there's an advanced mathematical algorithm that prevents it. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:28:12
That might be a better question for Mycelium themselves. To me it sounds like an error.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:09:47
hahaha, this is gold
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:51:04
Right? haha, what a clown
@_date: 2014-06-29 13:41:01
Happy cake day!!
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:59:48
Got your facts wrong, my friend.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:41:00
No questions but just wanted to say thanks for helping spread the word about bitcoin to the general public.
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:32:03
Good, simple commercial. I like.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:22:09
Thanks for your reply
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:35:29
With only 10 bitcoin? No. Great place to start, though.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:22:20
Thanks for your reply
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:33:44
I sort of figured that out after my comment. I didn't mean to offend so hopefully you didn't take it that way.
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:19:46
Its why I haven't had a bank account in years. Fuck the banks robbing you of YOUR money! 
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:49:36
Why should it be a problem? It's HIS money! There shouldn't be anyone telling him how he can spend it, especially when it's not being used for anything illegal.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:36:05
Last year they discovered a block worth that much BTC? That doesn't seem right
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:55:47
I still think smart watches are a little pointless. I've never liked wearing anything on my wrist so I don't think anything a smart watch could offer would entice me to wear one.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:21:55
Thanks for your reply

If only bitcoin fit the definition of a Ponzi scheme at all, then maybe your trolling would be effective.
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:32:07
This is the first time I have been "saving" money in a long time, myself. I look at it as more of an investment, but its a lot more than I have in fiat (which is near nothing). 
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:20:13
Nerd Drug Ponzi Scheme... New band name?
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:11:34
Exactly why I like bitcoin. My money, my purchases, no one else's business. The whole anti-money laundering argument with bitcoin is a joke, too. It's like the US government yelling "TERRORISM!" whenever they need to tighten the leash. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:28:22
What a stupid, misinformed and meaningless post. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:05:26
hahahaha, what are you talking about? Those novelty physical coins that are pre-loaded with BTC? You buy those as curios, not to be used as actual currency. Also, those wouldn't be counterfeit because those aren't actually BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:58:55
Wow this sounds like such a terrible idea...
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:34:43
First, I don't know what ELI5 is. Second, how you do port forwarding on your home router will differ from model to model. Generally on most models it's pretty simple and a quick Google search for "port forwarding on **insert model here**" would give you exactly what you're looking for. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:34:31
I literally can't even
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:26:39
As I read it, it sounds like if you refused the Tier 3 verification and ID selfie, they would have refunded to your originating bank. It doesn't sound like you were forced to verify at all.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:57:27
Hate that site, but at least you can feed it a bogus email to read the "articles"
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:26:59
Great non-update, haha
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:12:38
Loved it and hated it because I related to it.
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:09:55
Well back when bitcoin was first being mined, all blocks were 50 BTC blocks. It's now 25 BTC blocks, and I believe at some point that will also turn into, like, 10 BTC blocks.
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:49:23
Right? This is stupid. I was kind of expecting moolah to defend himself on the missing ATMs, yet he was more concerned with fighting over whether he's fat or not.......
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:33:23
Wait, what are you saying? People would prefer not to be in control of their own money?
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:18:46
Well yeah but that was because Gox was holding user's coins and not allowing sale or transfer of them if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:45:19
Can't wait until I own my first full coin. Currently sitting at... 0.1225 BTC. I've just been putting in a little here and there and casually mining for scraps.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:24:45
You're a joke, kid. With Discus Fish rivaling ghash, the threat of a 51% attack doesn't even really exist right now.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:45:03
Well if you've got no use for those bitcoins anymore I could sure use some :D
Tough luck, though. Can't you just transfer them out and sell them elsewhere, though?
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:59:56
I apologize for being condescending, but the way I see it, right now Discus Fish is good for the simple fact that a single entity does not control even close to 51% of the mining power. As far as mining decentralization goes, it does next to nothing. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:27:49
Sorry, linked the main Indiegogo page. Click on Updates.

Had an interview at their Manchester, NH headquarters. Man I wish I had gotten that job.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:20:15
Ports are not just left open for obvious security concerns. You have to simply enable port forwarding and that's it. It's really not complicated, especially with more modern GUIs on these consumer routers (ISRs if you wanna be technical). 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:02:25
Umm, Bitcoin Can? I have that on my Windows Phone. I don't use it because I don't WANT a wallet on my phone yet until I feel more comfortable with security, but I did download it to check it out and play with it.
EDIT: I guess it's not a fully functional Bitcoin wallet; yet. Browser based for now would be the way to go, it seems. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:52:36
How do you think the Silk Road auction will affect bitcoin prices, if at all?
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:30:00
Looking forward to getting mine! Happy to have helped you guys with the campaign.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:40:07
I suppose... Personally I wouldn't. I don't want anyone in control of my money at any time. It's only because I'm forced to use banks to some degree to turn my cash into digital money that I even still use them. If I could keep my money under my mattress (so to speak) and still buy shit online, I would never step foot in a bank again. That's why I like bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:50:05
Ugh, ignorance on this level just infuriates me
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:21:40

To the moon!

oh man that's hilarious thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:20:01
Lot's of spelling and grammatical errors... Otherwise a decent post with a good amount of information.
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:40:33
Apples and oranges
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:27:59
because we're talking about a payment system using a well established currency versus an entirely new currency. These are different things.

Finally!
