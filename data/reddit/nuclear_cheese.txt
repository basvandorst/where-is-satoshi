Dependency is never happiness. This isn't an absolute, it's simply reality.
Yeah in a relationship this can work, but when it comes to individuals versus something larger the most dependent ones are usually begging for scraps whether literally or figuratively (such as in an employer employee scenario).

I don't think he ever blamed the government. He was simply explaining what it does.
What does happiness have to do with being a libertarian? You can argue all you want but we were once a free people and no so much anymore. You can argue that slavery of any kind can bring someone happiness via a stockholm syndrome type effect but this is not who we are and where we came from.

No he's stating that self reliance is happiness. This is not arguable. Unless you have some kind of codependency disorder, self-reliance and being able to direct the course of your own life IS happiness.
Now he defines that as having a farm and being off the grid. Cool. The people in r/Frugal and r/PersonalFinance define it as having money in the bank and being comfortable. That works too. The people in r/Mminimalism define that as freeing themselves from consumerism and not being dependent on the latest gadget and stuff. That also works. They are all correct.


Seems to me that we're giving up more money and individual freedoms and the opposite is happening. People are less free now. Where are your papers citizen?

No but I take my time learning and understanding instead of coming up with bullshit. It's easy to pull things out of your ass. It's harder to seek the truth and understand it.
Most things are ambiguous. Some things are not. Get over it.

What in the hell is wrong with you boy? What are you even arguing against?
