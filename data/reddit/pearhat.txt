It hurt to upvote your comment. (I usually downvote you).
However, you are right about this.

"if all Bitcoin was was yet another way to pay online, just as we do now, I wouldn't be even slightly interested in it."
I concur.
"Holding savings without any fear of confiscation or censorship"  is the real game changer.

The hard limit on the number of Bitcoins in existence makes it impossible to "naked short sell", however a serious attempt of naked shorting a commodity, where there the demand has stayed the same or is increasing, will ALWAYS result in a distortion appearing as a shortage somewhere.

The Federal Reserve was not created until 1913.
I believe the last time any regular citizen could redeem a paper dollar for hard metal was in 1963 or 1964.  Between the mid 1960s and 1971 only select parties (i. e. central banks etc) could redeem paper dollars for hard metal.

You just pointed at the root of the tyranny.
It reminds me of a scene from The Hobbit:
Radagast: I don't understand why it's not working! It's not as if it's witchcraft!
Radagast: Witchcraft... Oh, but it IS. A dark and terrible magic...
I believe in cause and effect.  I do not believe that tyranny in government is somehow accidental or coincidental.

Notice this before.  BTC is great for ordering stuff over the internet, but I would not recomend it for dinner at this time.

I see you like to mudsling at someone else's generosity. 
WTF have you done lately?
