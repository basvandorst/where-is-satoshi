I'm wavering on my involvement certainly. 
I'm surprised it isn't a percentage fee of either a) the amount of coins you had in Gox. Or of the amount of coins they manage to recover. I had a few coins in Gox and 2 is quite a large cut of that. If they've had people with 'many thousands' in then surely they could bare the burden greater. 
Without any guarantees it becomes a little difficult. I'm not a big fan of all lawyers being 'no-win no-fee' but obviously that makes the claimant feel better about things. 
Thirdly - I don't have any bit coins to pay the fee with! (I note it can be paid in cash based on this feedback)

The comment "if you've less than 7 coins - it's not worth it" also read to me as 
- this is gonna cost 3.5coins at least.
