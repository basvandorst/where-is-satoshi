That’s the idea...but that’s not what we were talking about...do you often jump into conversations without any context?

Anytime I get an email I go through normal steps to log in and verify. Never click the link!

You’re not losing money if you sell the bitcoin to yourself, watch the plebes bail, buyback at significant discount, moon that shit.

How would someone without millions to spare get in on something like that?

I’ll bet more people are watching nascar than professional league of legends tournaments...

I try and fail everytime, this meme perfectly describes my life.

I’ve been day trading crypto on robinhood.

I get what your saying but your analogy is pretty far off, I’ve made 40% from Robinhood crypto’s over the last few days. I’m curious what kind of returns your crayon dollar would get?

Away she goes!

Why wouldn’t that work? Also no one said that’s why people are rich. Just that because they have the funds they could potentially do something like that.
