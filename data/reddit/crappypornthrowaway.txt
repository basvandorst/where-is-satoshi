It's generally misleading to compare wealth (a static value) to GDP (the increase in that value over time). The total wealth of the world is much, much higher than its GDP. That being said...
The market cap of bitcoin is a measure of the current price * the total number of bitcoins - it doesn't reflect the actual wealth of its owners. The majority of coins were sold at much lower prices (or have never been sold), so the total amount invested in btc is much lower, approx 10 billion. Given the actions of price manipulators, it's possible for the price to rise substantially with no actual coins being sold at all.
On the plus side, this means that there's effectively no hard limit to how high bitcoin's price can rise. So long as people aren't willing to cash out (le epic hodl) it can just keep on increasing.
On the down side, it means that people are *vastly* over-estimating how much money they will plausibly be able to take out of bitcoin. They are treating their current slice of the market cap like a reliable and liquid asset, when it's neither. It is mathematically impossible for most people to walk away from this with anything close to the amount of money they think they have.

Prices are not predictable in the same sense that most things in science are. Asset price is fundamentally a statement of prediction. The moment there is a certain, unambiguous prediction available, the prediction will change, as per efficient markets.
The fact that prices are decreasing means, almost by definition, that the prediction of a price rise is not certain.

Fixed quantity makes something vulnerable, not immune to, speculative bubbles.

That's just an argument from ignorance. You've provided no reason to think that bitcoin will act differently in any specific way - just that it's kinda different, so the prices might behave differently.
Some pro tips: 
- Short of fraud, there is no financial instrument conceivable that will guarantee you profit above base rate.
- Uncertainty is intractable.
- If an asset lacks an underlying source of income, price changes are only speculative. 
- Most importantly, if someone is telling you that they have a grand new unprecedented way of making you wealthy at no risk, you are being scammed.

On the off chance this isn't a joke, got a link to this mathematical proof?

None of these predictions have anything to do with regulation. Bubbles don't have predictable patterns because the government has regulated them to, but because money is finite and cannot be created out of thin air.

Bitcoin is not some magical new entity that violates the basic laws of finance.

That's the point I'm trying to make.

Holy shit. Guys. Do *NOT* trust the people telling you that the price of bitcoin will inevitably rise, no matter what. They are delusional. The real world does *not* work like that; There is no such thing as a guaranteed investment - especially with these sorts of gains.
If you've got enough money elsewhere to survive a full on crash, keep doing what you're doing. I couldn't care less. Maybe they're right - bitcoin could bounce back to 19k to 100k to a million. Anything is possible.
If you are financially depending on bitcoin's price rising again - you need to understand that it is *not* guaranteed. Not even close. Every "guaranteed high return" investment in history has been either delusional or fraudulent. You will not be the first, nor the last person to have lost everything to false dreams of guaranteed opulence.

This is just astrology with graphs.

You haven't made any money until you've sold it, either.
