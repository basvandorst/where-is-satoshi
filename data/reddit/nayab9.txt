The "clean code" part scares me; we've seen it before and we will likely see it again.. a bug that can be devastating can slip through the cracks (whether on purpose or by accident, doesn't matter).
I know the previous hard fork recovered, but in the future it could take a bigger toll.
What seems scary to me ultimately is; we envision the future global financial system to be carried on this type of systems back.  One small group of men green-light and merge changes into bitcoin if they deem the pull requests acceptable - could this be considered a major weakpoint? A centralized weakpoint?

To me, it seems like this would be a huge problem. 10,000 different forks would be spawned and one is the "right one" that 51% will choose?
What happens if one fork doesn't have 51%? If 5 forks are all 20%; are they building onto sidechains? What is happening to the main blockchain in this situation?

Github is not open-source.

This is what I personally feel would end up happening; I'd like to be convinced otherwise, though.

Who would own the repo and greenlight critical changes? How would we know, for example, that it isn't an NSA agent who greenlights a bug which ends up doing a hard fork (similar to the previous bug which caused the fork).

Can you comment on the idea that the bitcoin source code has a "centralized" weakpoint - the small group of men who are in charge of accepting pull requests and merges?
What happens if those devs disappear? Do the github admins intervene to reassign leads? What if github disappears or shuts down?
This is the thread where I posed the question for discussion: [

Thanks! Will take your site for a spin!

Agreed; I've cloned the code myself to play around with it.  Does that mean I can be the person in charge of Bitcoin moving forward if the devs all die? I don't know anything about cryptography. Who would decide who the lead dev is that will greenlight the newest changes to the source code?

Mission critical software development (i.e. airline) is usually (from my understanding) proprietary code, developed and deployed by engineers who make $150+k per year and are held accountable by law. In other words, *its their job* to ensure the safety of the what they deploy.
This seems drastically different than an open source project who's merges and pulls are governed by a small group volunteers (centralized?), who are expected to be 100% un-corruptible and accountable for the worlds financial system?

This is simply not true though - the bitcoin repo on github is ran by the lead developer; I am not allowed to simply make changes and submit them to the release branch. The lead developer has to green-light my changes and merge them accordingly.  This process is centralized..

This is true but he left a successor; presumably someone who doesn't work for the NSA (for example).
Edit: by successor I mean, the person who now green-lights the changes on github, since they have to be approved by the person who owns the repository.
