whoever is saying its not localbitcoins fault ??
Why ??
They are providing the scamming platform to scammer where he can easily scam ??
there are many other people scammed as well
I hold localbitcoin responsible 100% 
bcus they not implemented what i am going to state below
First thing that localbitcoin do is he can verify ids and phone verification plus verification of local bank bills and bank statements home utility bills ,, paypal history and account checks .. then localbitcoin should do a test transaction with the person which atleast stay for 60 days then they should tag with approved status and go public ..then alert the buyer during trade that the paypal account is passed verification and only that account and name should be good on incoming payments .
To be very secure they can have hold new paypal test transaction for 180 days as well
but thats not needed
bcus most scammer use hacked business account and load funds with stolen credit cards as in my case .
so the Credit card company sue within 60 days !!
