Can you please explain more about how a browser extension could behave similar to the explanation made by the OP and trick the Trezor software? I always thought the Trezor software was inmune to this kind of cheating.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:19:53
I think a lot of people really lack understanding hoy Bitcoin really works. You just can't enforce rules on full nodes. It's exactly the oposite. Nodes enforce the rules in the network. ¿Do you want to enforce new rules? Well, start running your own nodes...but you need to internalize that you will never change other nodes minds/rules.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:44:17
But how much of the hashing rate are supporting us?
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:53:29
If you are right then you have nothing to be afraid of...unless people start realizing interesting things in our blockchain and our ruleset becomes the one widely adopted.
What do you thing will happen when all the unsuspecting legacy users begin to realize that our ruleset adds more value to the system, prevents asicboost abuse, allows lightning network, fixes the malleability inconvenience, our blockchain lacks the risk of being reorganized in a point in the future, etc?
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:41:29
Ok nullc. Do you think is convenient to kick uasf supporters to altcoins ("there are thousands of altcoins out there") while Jihan keeps increasing his monopolistic possition abusing the covert asicboost exploit? How many pools (like Kncminers) need to be kicked out of the system until you start to realize that we, uasf supporters, are not the enemy? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:39:20
With SegWit + lightning network, my transactions will probably get confirmated cheaper and sooner than yours.
Have you taken in mind what will happen with your Jihancoins transactions after that 2016 block time happens and the probability of a reorg in your Jihanchain increases constantly?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:10:48
No, thank you. My node will start using SegWit the 1st of august. If you agree to let Jihan to continue abusing his monopolistic position with the covert asicboost use for a whole year, then good for you. My blockchain will always be there for you when you decide it's time to enjoy SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:55:55
by a longer VALID chain
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:16:25
I would add that asicboost damages the game theory incentives that rule the way transactions get mined in a block from those with more fees (more valuable), to those who fit best in their energy saving algorithm.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:48:45
What will you do with your Jihancoins if the BIP148 side of the chain has a minority hashpower, but people start using it because of malleability fixing, lightning network, increased size for transactions in the blocks... and the hashpower backing it starts to increase?
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:58:27
That chatlog and the position defended by Luke remembers me a lot the Israel's 10th man rule showed in the World War Z movie. 
The problem here is when Luke, while acting as a devil's advocate in these important topics as he gets us accostumed, is constantly right.
He, as a devil's advocate, has promoted a POW change in 2016 warning us about the mining centralisation danger. Now we can all see that the problem he warned about is even worse. In that chat he is warning about an hypothetical damage to unsuspecting users in a "legacy" reorg. Maybe Core team must pay attention to their own behaviour when "the devil's advocate bureau" is constantly right.
Luke, I wholeheartedly must recognize that your work in the core team is absolutely key as we all can see in the chatlog.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:04:26
Really great post. That's the really power we, node operators, can enjoy. No one can force us to accept consensus rules we disagree on.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:39:05
How many more non chinese pools do you need to be kicked out of the system by the illegitimate abuse of the covert Asicboost vulnerability before you move your ass from your Ivory tower?
You know Core devs are being complacient when Luke, playing devil's advocate in your meetings, has rightly predicted consistently dangerous and irresponsible behaviours by some actors of the network.
Now he's warning about the risks of leaving clueless users in the hands of bad actors (chinese pools) if a chain split happens. Sorry, but I think that, in the end, Core will need to choose sides, as we are asking for to every other agent in the network (nodes, miners, wallets and exchangers), so don't pretend to be so surprised by "our unrealistic expectations" related to core devs's behaviour.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:10:52
A direct consequence of the centralization of the network. All of you can see it now: action-reaction. Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:36:52
The answer is quite simple. We will probably convince to join us those miners who didn't abuse the asicboost vulnerability. I think that hashpower will be more than enough in the long term because legacy users will end up in a chain with a monopolistic miner abusing a vulnerability and the neverending risk of being reorganized someday in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:30:52

@_date: 2017-05-31 07:26:20
A SoftFork doesn't equal to a chain split. Miners never "splitted" blocks containing P2SH transactions after they were introduced, so only if miners attack is when the softfork ends in a split.
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:47:19
Accelerate your mother if you want to accelerate. LOL
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:35:08
We choose to focus our attention and mining power in SegWit abiding blocks. Don't be afraid because, with segwit + lightning network, maybe there will be enough space in our blocks to allocate your legacy transactions before the unavoidable reorg... maybe... ;P
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:39:53
So you claim to remove one arbitrary limit by adding another one?
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:06:32
Is it legit to use the block signalling to coordinate a more restrictive set of rules between a subset of Bitcoin users? Of course it is. So we don't deserve to be attacked or removed from the network because we are using the blockchain in a legit manner.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:03:56
It's not even a Segwith first+2mb hardfork after. it's a Segwith if our masters (miners) otorgue us it + 2 mb for sure in six months
It's madness

At least, my blockchain works. How's yours going? (looks at the testnet)...oohhh, well, good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:54:00
From the 1st of august, a subset of users of the Bitcoin network will start focusing our attention to a special subset of blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain. That is one of the huge number of uses the Bitcoin blockchain offers to us and as legit as all the others uses we can make of it.
The way we, the UASF subset of users behave after august is legit and we don't deserve being forced removed by the chinese bully for using Bitcoin in a legit way.
Think about it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:52:51
Sorry I don't want and won't be running a hardfork this year in my node. I will be really busy testing and learning about SegWit, lightning network, malleability fixing, etc. Maybe my node will run a 2MB hardfork next year. Or the next year after the next year. But now the focusing topic in my node will be SegWit.

It's the excuse Jihan is using to continue abusing the Asicboost exploit and another shitcoin on the table to scam noobs.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:48:03
Yes, let's punish someone because is trying to patent a mining unfair advantage, has enough power to 51% attack the network, has built backdoors in the mining hardware and has thretened publically to attack the network if we, the users, try to recover our freedom.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:10:11
Bitcoin isn't valuable if its core devs can't propose solutions for exploits in a timely manner either (like with AsicBoost).
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:44:36
With 2MB blocksize, the quadratic time in signature validation would have destroyed the node network. All of you, bigblocktards goons, have no idea how near of a collapse we have been because of that in the past

I agree. At the end of that day, power was stood in the same hands where it was in the morning. Let's see where power in the Bitcoin network really lays. UASF

It's the way a centralized network works. That's the reason why a bunch of libertarians are pushing for BIP148 UASF

I think you will enjoy even more when your transactions get reorg'd.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:05:54
Users are the backbone, dude. Users are the agents buying miner's hashes. Don't forget that.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:16:49
With the shitty coding skills the BU group has showed us, it will take those same three decades for them to solve the first crash in the Jihancoin split because all the Core devs will be coding for the SegWit chain. So I still prefer to chose a chain where the difficulty will be readjusted eventually rather than the Jihancoin split because there are no rules in the Bitcoin protocol that readjust the lack of coding skills.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:51:59
My miner is perfect, thanks. And how is your plan to prevent your transactions getting reorg'd in the future if slush+BitFury honor their statements? And how are your coding skills when all core users start developing code for the UASF chain and the Jihancoin chain starts to behave as crashy as the BU software?
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:33:11
Meanwhile in your "not centralized mining" chinese pools:
“We have prepared $100 million USD to kill the small fork of CoreCoin, no matter what [proof-of-work] algorithm, sha256 or scrypt or X11 or any other GPU algorithm,”
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:53:45
What did you expect will happen while Jihan was achieving his monopolistic position?
The real elephant in the room is mining centralization.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:41:34
The problem is, for Bitcoin achieving all the things you say in your post, it needs to keep itself decentralized. And that's why some of us fight to get UASF BIP148 aproved.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:48:44
That's the only thing you have in Jihancoin. Insults and lack of development skills. Good luck there.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:02:09
They don't want a split. They are just fighting to recover the power from Jihan's mining cartel while pusillanimous users just lay down in their chairs and foolishly keep watching the price increase fireworks.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:46:13
Jihancoin: a big fat chinese bought our company and now he has decided that all workers must wear a special tie that only he sells. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:45:17
BIP149 is just a one year grace period for Jihan. I disagree. I agree with BIP8 because takes veto power out of the dirty hands of mining cartels although.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:48:00
UASF has effectively succeeded because has remembered all parties involved where the power of Bitcoin lays. Now all the users only need to realize how strong they really are and take action to confront the deep and real threat our blockchain is facing: mining centralisation and the pressure Jihan cartel is able to make in order to force users decisions related with scalabity and improvements in the Bitcoin software.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:39:59
If BIP148 gets 20-25% of all the mining hashpower Jihan won't attack it because it will cut the jihancoin split mining hashrate and risk its viability.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:51:27
The solution is simple. Install and use the fu.cking BIP148 software, people. Problem solved. Stop giving credit to bad actors and amateurs.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:28:13
That's the beauty of UASF. Soon it will allow to both of us to allign to our own vision of Bitcoin. You will stick with mining cartels, I will stick with SegWit, libertarians and desentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:18:17
You are right it is a superset.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:17:52
After 1st of august some nodes will enjoy SegWit, Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures, Asicboost vulnerability fixing, a passport to sidechains, a block size increase, Core Development, etc.
Meanwhile, all the other nodes will continue experiencing mining centralisation, backdoored mining hardware, hardfork proposals, bugged software and a forever risk to get their chain reorged someday in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:48:52
Everything is illegal...somewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:53:50
Not in my node dude. My node is allergic to run hardforking software. Sorry
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:50:39
It is the same damage as mining centralisation could do. Were all of you so concerned about unsuspecting users losing money in a 51% attack when Jihan was building his mining cartel?
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:46:02
"Industry" will adapt or they risk their hashes barely finding any buyer.
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:05:53
I know, I know. I love the way you play the "tenth man rule" in your transparent Core meetings. Tiphat to you, sir.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:32:20
Economic majority supports widely SegWit, but unfair centralized mining veto keeps evolution of the software protocolo out of Bitcoin. UASF gets rid of it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:36:20
Good luck with your JihanCoin.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:16:45
Correct. Now think what will happen too when Core devs start developing for UASF/Segwit chain and the development of both chains starts to diverge. Core in one side and the shitty/buggy/crashing development in the other chain (Jihancoin).
Usually uninformed sheeple attacks UASF saying that our chain will be finding blocks slowly. I will tell them, well, maybe at the beginning and it will only last until the next difficulty adjustment. On the other side, Jihancoin development will be crasshy, buggy and slow FOREVER, and there is no recalculation adjustment in the protocol for that.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:16:11
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:19:03
Restoring the power to the hands of the users by UASF is not extremist. Stop spreading nonsense trying to legitimize the FrankenSegWit
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:50:46
If BitFury honors their statements, it's done.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:06:43
Enjoy your Jihancoin, branwashed drone.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:39:41
You guys are a bunch of hypocritical.
No one claimed in Reddit to be concerned when Jihan was centralizing all the mining network and now, when the libertarian faction of Bitcoin is fighting your war trying to recover the power from the hands of Jihan, you all scream concerned while watching foolishly the price fireworks.
If Bitcoin price has became "too big to fail" for users and you prefer to continue giving the power to Jihan's mining cartel trying to avoid a split or a price drop at all costs, then Bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:41:04
A split is going to happen anyways because all the "agreements" that propose a hardfork are chain splitters too. And, in no way, I will participate in any split that takes power from the users and gives it to the mining cartel. They are only workers. OUR workers. But they can't enforce users to accept new rules or hardforks, sorry.
So, for my own security, I will stick in the UASF side.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:51:55
SegWit takes care of the covert Asicboost vulnerability too so, by supporting BIP148, you kill a lot of birds with the same stone.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:21:27
If the chain splits for a long period, development will be important too and may be key in determining the odds of one chain being adopted by miners, users and merchants in the long term.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:53:21
I mean that they can't stay neutral while we have a dangerous vulnerability running around for months that puts honest miners in an unacceptable disadvantadge against a malicious miner abusing it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:50:12
What economic majority? All the Jihan constellation (BitPay included) and BitFury saying "SegWit First"? A monopoly and a cheated BitFury doesn't make an "economic majority". Where were all the exchanges in the meeting? Where were the Core developers? What the early adopters (and the rest of the users) have to say to all of this?
Well, at least we all see what user have to say with the UASF whan august arrives.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:50:01
If BitFury honors his statements, it's done.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:47:20
Better to stick in the 18% libertarian, decentralized and freedom supporter chain than in the 80% of the Jihan mining cartel chain.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:34:18
Now, with FrankenSegWits and other hardforks proposals, users are signing their agreement to transfer even more power from their hands, to mining cartels hands. It's really sad.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:26:00
Adding a new fixed cap (tx size limit) to increase an existing one (blocksize limit)? No thank you. UASF
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:06:13
How some Bitcoin users deciding to tighten the rules you agreed on becomes a threat to you? Why do you feel that threat more dangerous than the FrankenSegWit hardfork threat?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:09:07
On the other side, I'm sure you are absolute comfortable with the mining power that Jihan has built until now and the blocking he's doing to SegWit while he keeps kicking out more mining competitors abusing the Asicboost vulnerability.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:14:54
Sorry, but my node won't be running your hardfork. Good luck in your Jihancoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:54:00
Where were you when Jihan built his mining cartel? Is his SegWit blocking mining cartel "right in Satoshi's vision"?
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:52:00
Our chain will get difficulty adjusted eventually because the Bitcoin protocol has instructions on how to deal with that inconvenience. But there is no rule or protocol intruction that readjusts the centralisation of a chinese mining cartel and the lacking of coding skills.
So good luck with your Jihancoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:29:53
You'll explain to them the situation created the same way that you'll need to explain that Bitcoin is not desentralised and some rogue mining monopoly cartel has reversed his transaction. Exactly the same way.
BIP148 is not an attack, it's a response to the mining centralisation and the unfair veto power that has achieved.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:38:11
If the risk of Bitcoin users getting their power back from mining cartel is "too big", then we reached the point of no return where Bitcoin is totally screwed.
And almost every core dev supports segwit so it's easy to guess which chain will get their future work.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:29:53
Yeah, keep parroting the blocks showing up slowly arguments buy you all must think that Bitcoin protocolo takes care of that inconvenience eventually by readjusting difficulty, but there is no protocol adjustment for the lack of coding skill, centralization, asicboost abusing and unfair veto power in your Jihancoin split.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:14:21
As I told you, you have the same example replacing "UASF" with "Jihan making a 51% attack".
The user will be cheated exactly the same way, the bitcoin.org will be talking about bitcoin being decentralised exactly the same way, etc. and the unsuspecting user will be f.ucked exactly the same way.
As I usually repeat a lot nowadays, the problem is no UASF. The problem is that all of this is happening because we never really fought the centralisation of the mining cartels. We all just stayed pleasantly cheering while price went constantly up, we convinced newbies that "Bitcoin is decentralised" and, meanwhile, the dark monster was growing in the closet.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:34:23
We don't want a centralised Bitcoin where power has been taken from users and given to the mining cartels. And, If we face a split for that fight, so be it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:56:15
A horse-trading agreement. No thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:24:33
That is the real reason why they are trying to develope so urgently their Frankensegwit hardfork proposal
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:06:06
We have 8 weeks. Plenty of time to get you surprised. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:03:01
Good luck with your Jihancoins too.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:00:57
were you so worried when Jihan built his segwit-blocking mining cartel too?
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:17:22
UASF don't offer veto power. And no, sorry, but miners veto power is not in Bitcoin best interests.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:41:00
UASF is not a deliberate chain split
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:25:37
If there is a split in Bitcoin and segwit chain gets segwit, malleability fix, lightning network, schnorr signatutes, acces to sidechains and Core devs coding support while Jihancoin split the only support they get is a shaddy, dangerous and untested future hardfork and the forever risk of getting reorg'd...where do you think the value will go?
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:10:25
This is really sad. A lot of people is going to lose money because of Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:25:40
What consensus? The consensus where Jihan keeps his centralized veto power and keeps abusing the asicboost vulnerability to kickout his competitors?  NO thanks, you can keep that consensus for your Jihancoin split.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:04:55
That's why chinacoiners are going to end with expensive air heaters
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:42:38
Even if a SegWit block takes one week to show up, I prefer that chain than the Jihan chain because there is a protocol rule that readjusts eventually the frecuency of the blocks, but there is no rule that "readjust" the lack of coding skills the Jihancoin team has showed us
With Core developers working in the segwit chain after the split, is just a matter of time for the Jihancoin split to crash to hell or get behind in the development race.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:59:58
The absolute disaster is the mining centralisation we all allowed from years ago. That's the real disaster and the origin of all the problem. UASF is the only option we, the users, have to recover the power from mining cartels.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:51:41
Those 38 years will be probably less time than the Jihanchain is going to take to launch reliably code for its nodes.
And don't worry about our hashing power. August is still 8 weeks ahead. We have plenty of time to get enough aboard.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:02:04
Out from "the core chain" but in to a chain where Asicboost vulnerability is fixed, SegWit is working, Lightning network starts spreading, Schnorr signatures are the next station, Core devs are improving software, no scamming ICO/IPO was used to start moving, there is no risk of getting my transactions reorg'd in the future, blocks get a size increase and Jihan is out of the equation?
Where do I need to sign?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:02:22
On the other side, I'm sure mining centralisation will end flawlessly /s
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:12:58
If SegWit fixes the problem, is well tested and we can have it in 8 weeks, what is the problem in promoting these facts too? Of course Segwit does a lot of things but, in my opinion, helping to solve the cover asicboost vulnerability is of great importance now.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:01:41
NY proposal includes a chain split too. We arrived to a point where, a chain split, is almost unavoidable. I can't understand why so many users are agree to follow a chain split conducted by those mining cartels, keeping alive the asicboos vulnerability and involving a dangerous hardfork, while we can activate a simpler soft fork and, with enough support, even prevent any form of chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:12:42
That people must be concerned long time ago when Jihan centralised the mining in Bitcoin. What we are seeing with UASF is a consequence of not fighting centralisation before.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:01:11
Ok, in 2016 blocks our delayed blocks inconvenience will be solved. How many blocks will you must wait until your lack of Core coders, your high fees, your centralisation, your Asicboost vulnerability and your risk of transactions ending up reorg'g will ve solved?
Bitcoin protocol offers solutions for all the inconveniences our chain could face, but not for Jihancoin's deep problems.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:14:36
The frankensegwit design seems specifically done for kicking libertarian, freedom and decentralization fighters out of the Bitcoin Network. Really sad.
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:34:56
Bitcoin has arrived to a centralised and toxic point that, if the chinese government decides to ban it, it will be like a blessing for all of us.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:11:50
We have plenty of time to convince a bunch of these pools SegWit supporting pools:
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:06:24
Are you saying that the only way to fix the Asicboost vulnerability will be ready in 2018 summer, when we can do it just in august?
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:48:20
Good luck with your Jihancoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:50:26
People need to realize this.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:04:12
True. That's why we are not forking, just tweaking our consensus by adding a bunch of new rules to those you previously accepted. We are are completely agree with all your rules, but you are not completely agree with ours so, if one day we become majority, the one being forked will be you.

Do you remember when first ASIC miners were sold and how half the production went to small customers because mining hardware manufacturers thought that it will be dangerous to jeopardize mining decentralization?
You can compare those days with the mining cartels and the hidden threats of not serving the newer hardware releases that we have today.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:43:05
Nope, it only enforces the rules I'm agree on. But I wholeheartedly think that, if the subset of rules I agree on are valuable and shared with enough people, the miners will sell me hashes to protect them.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:22:29
BIP149 support by Core devs is like Core devs extending a $100 million check to Jihan for keeping the centralisation attack on the network for a whole year. It's a defeat for all the users and consecuences may be enormous.
A whole year in Bitcoin is a lot of time with Jihan abusing the Asicboost vulnerability and increasing his mining monopoly. We can't allow that.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:37:52
False. The whole point of Bitcoin is coordinating users in achieving consensus about the rules their electronic money must acomplish.
If a chain is split for a long period, the system is telling to you that two different rulesets are developing and that, if the split continues, you as a user will must be forced to select what rules your money will follow.
And if the rules you selected end up in the minority of consensus, the transactions involved will be rejected by the network. So better be sure that your money follows the rules the majority of users will adhere to.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:31:27
Hashrate could be used to coordinate the starting of a new set of rules, but the agents in the sistem that enforce those new rules are the nodes. Using Hashrate to enforce new rules or to be used as the only indicator for a rulechange offers a veto power to mining cartels that no other agent in the network has. It's unfair and, as we all have seen, dangerous.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:54:12
Because without proper development, asicboost vulnerability fixing, malleability fixing, Lightning, etc. the Jihancoin chain will become obsolete in a short time.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:54:38
First because the Frankensegwit proposed by this hidden meeting is deliberately built incompatible with UASF BIP148 and that shows us it is only a delay tactic because Segwit makes impossible for him to continue abusing the Asicboost vulnerability..
Second because stablishes a dangerous precedent where technical decisions are taken by a shaddy comitee of mining cartels and their influenced companies.
And third because this false solution is proposed by the same agents that forced it by abusing their unfair veto power and their centralized dominance.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:26:19
I'm not against all HF for biggest blocks. I'm agains a big block HF NOW. First SegWit, then learning about all the technologies it allows (LN, sidechains, etc.) And then, and only then, evaluate the necessity of a bigger block HF.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:02:29
Yeah, right. Better ask Jihan to answer what consensus is and what isn't.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:52:42
Centralize and conquer
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:21:38
False. One of those five agents enjoys an unfair veto power and now we must take it back, because he is abusing it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:56:04
You don't know how future anonimization and fungibility improvements may work. Maybe we end up with some kind of coinshuffled 1MB transactions where you can't link together inputs and outputs. I won't sacrifice transaction limit size for feeding even more Jihan mining cartel. We need a second layer for inmediate scalability and, maybe in the future, study a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:57:09
There is not "POW consensus" The only consensus POW facilitates is about if a transaction is being double spent or not. Nodes are the elements here enforcing consensus about the rules of the sistem, not miners.
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:45:39
Your chain will end up reorg'd or with a hardfork dictated by Jihan. There are rules in the Bitcoin protocol that deal with the delay in finding valid blocks, but there are no rules for dealing with a rogue chinese mining cartel without coding skills.
Good luck with your new chain.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:55:02
Core are like Ents in a meeting. They are powerfull, but slow in taking decisions. And they won't be blind and inacting forever while Saruman centralises, exploits vulnerabilities and puts backdoors all over the forest.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:54:07
Sorry, but my full node won't be running your hardfork software.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:18:36
Yeah. Righ. Meanwhile Jihan keeps abusing asicboost vulnerability and kicking out of the system the small competence there still has.
It's too late to unity speeches. Because users didn't give a damm Bitcoin mining was getting centralized.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:36:15
Reducing the transaction size may end up reducing fungibility and future anonimity improvements for our coins. No, thank you I will keep the transaction size limit as it is now and increase the number of transactions in a second layer.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:57:44
Sorry, but FrankenSegWit will not be running in my node because it's allergic to running hardforking software.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:46:54
Were mining pools those days abusing of some vulnerabilities to kick out competitors out of the system, selling mining hardware with backoors and blocking Bitcoin protocol improvement?
I can say NO because I was there too.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:35:07
I wish you were as suspicious as here when the mining network was centralised by Jihan. I really wish all the suspicious users that are jumping nowadays on reddit UASF posts had been so suspicious when Jihan became the mining cartel too. It's sad they weren't
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:22:29
Good bye. You know, don't let the door hit you... and enjoy your centralised crypto portfolio
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:51:27
If BitFury honors his statements, it's done.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:27:56
My node is allergic to your hardforking code, sorry. Enjoy your Jihancoins. I will run UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:27:34
Understand it this way: SegWit gets actived in august. If you are agree with segwit, be sure to keep your transactions in the chain that allows segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:45:11
They will lose money because miners attacked their interests splitting the chain and because all the economic nodes will go to another chain with segwit, fixed asicboost, sidechains, schnorr signatures, lightning network, etc . Nothing wrong in that.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:16:03
FrankenSegWit proposes a chain split too (a hardfork). And Jihan has constantly threating us with hardforks for months. Bitcoin has arrived to a point where a chain split is almost unavoidable. So, if there is a chainsplit in august, I will try to be out of the Jihancoin chain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:22:57
Segwit, Lightning network, sidechains, asicboost vulnerability fixing, malleability fixing, core development, power returning back to the hands of the users...there are plenty of incentives. Be patient. And the most important of all: telling Jihan who is in charge.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:10:35
Good, Core Devs.
Now I think it's time to start doing something with the asicboost vulnerability.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:54:12
Satoshi had no idea about what he was really inventing. He thought he was inventing just a decentralised and trustless form of electronic cash, but he was wrong about that. He invented more than that. He invented a secure, decentralised, trustless, free acces, anonymous way to build and offer certainty.
And today, in our digital world, accesing a source of mathematical certainty so huge, secure and cheap as the Bitcoin network offers is orders of magnitude more important than the simple vision of digital cash that satoshi showed.
Yes, cash is the natural and first use we can make of that certainty, but there will be much, much more uses for it. And probably more important than just electronic money.
That is the way I see Bitcoin and that is why I, sadly, have to disagree with satoshi's vision.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:40:47
Yeah, right. Half of that list are irrelevant and the other half are Jihan/Ver's puppets.
Oh, and Gavin Andresen is listed there as a company. LOL. 
All you really have is a mining centralised cartel owning enough hashing power to attack the network, and a cheated mining company (BitFury) who signed a fuzzy agreement and is now asking the terms by tweeter. The only useful thing an educated Bitcoin user could do with that list is to pay attention in how we allowed to concentrate all the mining power and start thinking in how to prevent it in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:08:29
LOL. Miners are living out of the reality. UASF will bring them there.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:37:52
Too late dude. Sorry, but it's time to disrupt the way things were evolving between mining cartels, pusillanimous users, developers seen Bitcoin project as a mere academic exercise, and libertarians.
Bitcoin is a f.ucking kick at the door, not a nice investing instrument in your ever growing portfolio
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:35:12
Frankensegwit is not going to happen, sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:04:20
The split is almost unavoidable now. So be sure to chose the chain that fits better with your thinking
