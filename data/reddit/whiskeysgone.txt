The thing is, no one knows what will happen next. It could skyrocket, or it could crash. It depends on exactly how much you have, but if it where me I would probably sell 25%-50% to secure some real nice profits in case it crashes, and you can still get some real nice gains with the rest you have invested. I'd rather take a guarantee of being rich now over a possibility of being either super rich or super broke in the future. But that's just me.

Exactly, demand has increased greatly over the past week, and since everyone wants to hold onto their coins, supply has either stayed stagnant or decreased.

I absolutely trust Coinbase, why wouldn't you? As far as I know they are the only place that actually insures your crypto.

Yeah your fine, most legit exchanges require it. The only reason it would haunt you was if you didn't pay your taxes on your earnings or used them to buy something illegal, like the other guy said.

Why do you say it will sink this weekend?

If you click on "Accounts" and then "My Wallet", you should see the transaction there. If you don't see anything there, then it did not go through.

Because this deal makes no sense. Why wouldn't he just sell them on an exchange for what they are worth, why would he willingly take a 33% loss? If it sounds too good to be true, it is.

That's what scares me, it seems like the bubble has to pop at some point. Especially with all of the uncertainty surrounding the future of BTC and new people who know nothing about it just throwing money in, if I could sell 25%-50% and make a life changing amount of money right now while also staying pretty invested in BTC, that would be my move. Just one mans opinion though, I'm far from an expert trader, I'm a software engineer.

It's going to go up or down. Not trying to be an ass, just being real. No one knows what it will do, everything is pure speculation. People try and compare it to stocks or commodities, but the reality is that this is a whole new ball game.

I'm not gonna take advice from someone who can't even spell the damn word.

It's not a bug, it's a feature.

It's not a scam, they are a legit company, they are just scaling very poorly. A whole lot of new people have been getting into crypto the last week, and Coinbase has no idea how to handle it. I'm confident they will get everything sorted out eventually, but in the short term you might want to look into another option. Definitely not a mt. gox situation though.

I've tried to do some trading to gain some quick money, but I got burned a lot more than I gained, so I just stopped doing that and am playing it safe now. For me, a life changing amount would be at least $50k, maybe $100k. Enough to pay off my student loans and put a nice down payment on a house. Hard to say for sure though since I'm very far away from either of those.

Oh I didn't mean it would crash to 0, just that it could crash much lower than it currently is. In which case you would be really glad you sold some, and then you can buy back in if you feel like it will rise again, which it probably will.
