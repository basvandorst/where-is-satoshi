I don't understand where this 'scam' accusation is coming from.  I'm in the Bitcoin business for the longterm and I own 50+ sites, including BitPlastic.com, BitLaunder.com, CoinChimp.com, BitListing.com, BitMeetup.com, BitForum.org, BitArmored.com, BitBing.com, BitSweeps.com.  At least half my sites are completely FREE and intended to benefit the whole Bitcoin community.  I earn no money on BitBing, BitListing, BitForum.org, BitMeetup.com etc. and yet I invest many thousands to build and run the sites.  BitPlastic is a Bitcoin wallet and debit card site, and we have never scammed anyone.  It is simply not in my longterm business interest to rip people off.  I want people to use the other sites, which they obviously won't do if we steal their money.  And we make plenty of profit on fees for the debit card, so resorting to theft would be absolutely idiotic.  Anyways, I am happy to address publicly any specific user's complaint if they post details, such as date, transaction, amount, BitPlastic userid, etc.  I am not going to waste my time respond to people who call me a 'sick, vile disgusting excuse for a human being' who have never even used one of my sites.

I am the owner of BitPlastic, and nobody was 'ripped off'. If you can provide more details of your complaint I can address it for you publicly right here.

This card is total garbage. They will request ID/verification, report your funds to the IRS and FinCEN, block certain countries, and it might not even work.  Where is their card right now?  Not available. You have to sign up to 'pre-order'.  
If you want the only REAL and WORKING Bitcoin Debit Card in existence, use 
ALL COUNTRIES OK, no Identity verifications, and IT WORKS ...

i can guarantee CaVirtex will go out of business within 1 year. Banks and Bitcoin mix like fire and ice.  Also, getting a CaVirtex card is difficult, even for Canadian citizens.  They make you jump through every imaginable hoop.  If you want a REAL anonymous debit card with no ID, no verification, and that works worldwide and is available to anyone in the world, try
