There is no way to know whether or not he would keep the value stored in BTC or exchange back for USD. It doesn't really matter though because he is accepting BTC as a form of payment for the house. 
If he were accepting GBP for payment would you say "he is not selling it for GBP because he will convert it to USD after"? You have no way of knowing what he will do after and it really doesn't matter.
It is also important to realize that by default all houses in the USA will be benchmarked in USD no matter what currency is used for payment. This does not mean you can only use USD to purchase a property. This goes the same way in other countries too. Lets say I wanted to buy a vacation house in Mexico. The price of that house is benchmarked in MXN by default. I can still buy the house in USD if the seller allows it. Would you say that I bought the vacation house in MXN if I used USD simply because the price is benchmarked in MXN?
I understand the point you are trying to make which is that it is a gimmick because the BTC will only be used at the point of sale and will be quickly switched back to USD after the transaction is complete. The problem with this argument is that there are many BTC millionaires who would find it convenient to buy a house for BTC and it is possible that the seller himself wants a large position in BTC. It is not necessarily fact that the store of value in BTC will only exist at the point of sale.
Bottom line is that he is indeed **selling it in BTC.**

this looks like it was written by a high schooler.

So then it is not the exponential growth that is unbelievable, it is the idea of digital money overtaking fiat money that is a nope.

Drugs yes, hitmen and child porn were strictly forbidden. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:23:37
In order for bitcoin to go from 200 dollars to 10,000 dollars it has to grow by 13.69 dollars every day... nope.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:33:38
Not the DEA, Carl Mark Force IV. He is the one who arrested Curtis Green and staged the murders. He can't be trusted as a reliable source of info for the case.

because you have to buy food and pay rent
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:41:23
I agree that the concept of crypto making another 100X in price seems pretty low, but that is because of fundamentals. The way you wrote your post makes it seem like you don't understand exponential scaling and that the climb would be a 10% gain every day for 2 years. It is just wording, clearly you do understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:24:27
If the story is true, but everything those FBI agents said and did must be discredited as they are corrupt and ended up in jail. It is very hard to believe anything they said. Chat logs could have been fabricated too.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:21:55
This guy does not know how exponential growth works lol

Anything related to him I take with a grain of salt.

"If I have one advise for you it would be the following: DON’T!. Just don’t hack BTC wallets. Besides the fact that it’s a dick move its a lot of hassle. You will never sleep well again."
I bet they actually sleep great at night.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:54:23
I dont see what that has to do with anything. The reason everyone is making comments about exponential scaling is that by illustrating 100X growth in steps of 1300 you create the idea of a linear graph in peoples heads. It would make more sense to say BTC has to have a .63% growth every day for 2 years to reach 1 million. I agree that this will probably not happen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:38:37
I have to go though see you later man.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:49
not conspiracy theory. The DEA agent named Carl Mark Force IV was sent to jail for trying to embezzle money from the case. Anything he said or did is discredited and did not hold up in court for that reason. Ross Ulbricht was not charged with murder for hire for this reason.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:17:34
They fabricated a story to entrap him into ordering hits he would not have otherwise done. The DEA agents were then caught for illegally trying to steal the bitcoins. Not credible in my opinion, and why they got dropped from the case.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:05:29
because of a fake story created by crooked DEA agents.

Can somebody explain the circumstances of the arrest?
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:36:02
Theoretically with USD inflation and the eventual loss of bitcoins, 750 million is possible, but unlikely.

Bought it from a guy who accepted BTC for it.

I lost the private key. Prove beyond a reasonable doubt I didn't.
Maybe I am a fucked up immoral person but in a messy divorce (most of them) there is no way in hell I would let a person take the BTC.

I like the message of this post though I would not recommend this movie to a friend.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:30:30
You keep saying "the courts would have figured out"... did you have these coins on an exchange or something? This is a good instance where plausible deniability would keep you from getting in trouble with the courts. Are you on good terms with your ex wife or something? There is no reason to let her get half you BTC. Perhaps you are just catholic or something.
@_date: 2016-05-18 05:12:49
Yes, but bitcoin doesn't take long to set up at all. If a business wanted to setup a functional bitcoin platform they could do it for free in an hour or less. People just don't realize that because they don't understand it.
Edit: Keep in mind that I am in the techiest city in the country and that there actually is somewhat of a user base here.
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:28:24
are you a business owner? let me know if you have any questions... I love to help people adopt BTC!
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:12:21
Yes using bitpay solves this. It generates a QR code that you scan. Once scanned bitpay converts the bitcoins into USD directly into your bank account. takes 30 mins to set up and gives you cash dollar for dollar. Also allows for receipt of payment.

I literally only eat at places that accept bitcoin and foodler.com because they make a bunch of restaurants payable with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:14:39
Using bitpay or coinbase allows people who accpt it to have dollar for dollar proof of every purchase while also allowing the person sending bitcoins to remain anonymous.
Takes 30 minutes to set up.
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:44:44
Yes obviously there is now way to completely avoid banks, but having to convert BTC to fiat only at the point of sale allows us to not store large sums of money in banks.
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:35:25
Ah I see. 
The fees are much lower than the typical 3% on plastic. (.5-1%).
If you ever have any questions let me know!

The new bitpay debit card makes it possible to spend your bitcoins on anything that takes visa as payment. 
The answer is yes.
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:24:38
Yes sir. I live in SF and many businesses currently take bitcoins in this manner and give you reciepts upon purchase. 
Realize that cash registers print receipts...  For instance, when someone gives you cash you get a receipt. The cash itself does not create the receipt just as the bitcoins are not what create a receipt either. Reciepts are seperate from payment systems.

Just bought this game with bitcoin. Amazing how easy it was to do. All online purchases should be done this way.
FUCK. The pre-order was for steam and I am a console gamer. I feel like a huge retard.
Is there a way to send your game to someone else? If so I will send it to the first person that sees this.

They are! bitpay instantaneously wires the BTC value into the store owners bank account in USD in the same way that plastic payments do. It is a fantastic system.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:34:25
agree with George here. Acting like we know the economics of bitcoin in china is ridiculous unless you have some kind of insider information.
@_date: 2016-07-31 20:42:19
He is selling it in BTC with a benchmarked price in USD. He is taking BTC as a payment so how is this selling it in $?
