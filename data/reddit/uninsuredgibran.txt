Pray that your exchanges are not running on VPS...
The impact of MELTDOWN is that I could run a process on a VPS and access the entire physical memory, thus the memory of the other virtualization guests; i.e. private keys, passwords, etc.
To be honest, if they did that would be really stupid, regardless of this particular issue.

Dear butters, I'm coming from your friendly neighborhood with a public service announcement
__Be on the lookout for updates from your system vendors: Microsoft, Linux, Android, Apple, etc. and apply them as soon as they are available.__
People have already built working exploits for those vulnerabilities and there is no doubt exploitation is starting to happen, or will start very soon.

There will be a performance impact on applications making a lot of system calls (since you'll now have to do a TLB flush).
CPU mining should be fine since it's almost entirely computational. Blockchain downloads probably fine too.
Software making a lot of syscalls (web servers, databases) will suffer a performance penalty.

You know, you can have properly regulated and functioning markets without the government.
Markets where exchanges are audited, where they don't trade themselves, where inside traders like Roger Ver are banned, and so on.
This would be a good demonstration of how government is not required, and markets that are entirely private work well.
Instead of that, we have "Internet libertarians" arguing that everything is allowed and a-OK. This is stupid.
If you want to convince your parents to remove the training wheels on your bicycle, maybe show that you won't fall over as soon as they're removed. The Bitcoin community had years to do that. So what do they do? "Ah, it's OK to fall all the time, that's how riding a bicycle is supposed to be!"

In fact in this case governments have shown a lot of good will.
Where repressive countries like China eventually banned Bitcoin, western governments have let crypto-currencies run wild.
Maybe they actually want to prove a point. Wait after years of mismanagement, countless hacks, scams and heists, for people to come back to them, begging for government intervention and regulation.
Libertarians completely, utterly failed to seize that opportunity to build a better system. What a waste.

He's not a libertarian, he's a self-serving asshole.
I'm a libertarian, and our argument is that we can build better institutions than the government, not that we are better without any institution.
So far Bitcoin has built a very strong argument against libertarianism by demonstrating that unregulated markets are a complete disaster (which we already knew). They had one job, which was to come up with their own private, market-based regulatory institutions. That never happened because they were too greedy.

What do you mean libertarian roots? Where is libertarianism mentioned in Satoshi's paper?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:42:32
What you describe is "libertarianism without society". You can do that when you live by yourself in the woods, but in that case you can be anything (a fascist, a communist, a democrat), it doesn't matter when you live by yourself.
I've read quite a few libertarian thinkers (incidentally my favourite one is Bastiat, used by Ver on his twitter banner), and he describes a libertarian _society_, where men interact. In such a society you have institutions, and you need rules, regardless of whether or not they are enforced by a government.

You should have read the white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Store of Value System" by Sadoshi Nakatamo.

I'm pretty sure I am.
Unregulated markets are a complete disaster, whereas in cryptocurrencies or in Liberia.
A libertarian social order is regulated, although not by the government. Read Hayek, he discussed that at length.
On the topic of money, Pascal Salin is great, but most of his work is in French and has not been translated to English.

Today I'm at the BITFINEX world headquarters in Taipei Taiwan. I had a nice chat with BITFINEX CEO, Jean-Louis van der Velde, about their current situation. He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers. I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at BITFINEX are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at BITFINEX. The traditional banking partners that BITFINEX needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy. The dozens of people that make up the BITFINEX team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with BITFINEX easier for all their customers around the world.  For now,  I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.
tl;dr you got GOXED

That's the first thing, yes. But it goes further.
Review carefully who controls your assets (exchanges, wallets, etc.) Are they exposed to tether? And, more generally, are they transparent? Do you know who runs those organizations? Not just their name, but their business history, etc. Do you know where those organizations are registered? Do you trust those locations? Do you have evidence that those organizations are being audited by trustworthy people?
I.e. do your due diligence. Whether or not you believe in government-associated institutions. It's fine to distrust governments if you have good reasons to, but completely fucking stupid to trust some random guys hiding behind shell companies in tax havens operating completely unregulated markets.
The libertarian argument against government regulation is that it's ineffective, unjust and so on. But there is no argument that no regulation whatsoever is best. So if you believe in market-based regulations, make sure they work.
A fundamental market regulation keeping Tether honest is the ability to redeem Tether for USD. It prevents them from printing too much.
Is that regulation working? Obviously not.

This is a fucking retarded answer, and you completely missed my point.
My point was that, even if you're a libertarian who doesn't trust normie greenbacks controlled by evil central bankers and filthy statists, you still have to do your due diligence and not trust your assets to some random clowns with no business history, hiding behind shell companies in tax havens.
There are three categories of people arguing against regulations: libertarians, greedy fools and criminals. The latter two groups seem somewhat larger, and at the moment I have not seen any evidence of libertarians making any effort towards building effective market-based regulations. You still need audits (financial and infosec), you still need the equivalent of courts to address conflicts, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:14:49


That's... not how it works.
Exchanges (I mean, real ones like NYSE and NASDAQ) publish quarterly financial reports that are audited. They don't give customer data, they give aggregated values for their balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statements (as well as a bunch on non-GAAP metrics). And the auditors can look at all the accounts, and they write a letter certifying that the reports published by the company are legit, based on what they have observed.
There is nowhere near that for Bitfinex+Tether, which is acting as a combined central bank and exchange (an interesting combination...) for Bitcoin.
I won't lie, I'm a Bitcoin skeptic, but if you guys are serious about Bitcoin, you should treat Bitfinex+Tether as the Lehman Brothers of the crypto markets.

Incidentally, the two exchanges that advertise the fact they are operating under well-regulated jurisdiction.
