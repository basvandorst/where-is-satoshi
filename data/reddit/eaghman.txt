Someones feeling a tad precious. Its the truth, if you do not understand the consequences of a volatile market do not get involved.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:14:49
dude, thank you :) (doesnt know how to accept)
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:55:54
Buy ~~tomorrow~~ when the market bottoms out. And $10000 is a metric fuck ton of money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:27:59
Yes a bad idea.

Thanks buddy, I don't actually have any BitCoin this was written out of a pure interest in the topic, please feel free to link to this page :)

by charging for the transfer for bitcoin you are regulating it, it becomes symmetrical to other currency

Never Invest something you cannot afford to lose.
A word of advice, when you invest something consider it gone, imagine that you have already lost it and are merely doing this for a thrill.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:22:24
More than welcome, just a shame it got buried :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:07
It has crashed
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:43:45
I might start doing this, difference in GBP and USD is ~5%
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:52:57
Good luck. Do not feel the need to hold because people tell you to for BitCoin's "integrity". Hold if you believe it is fincially viable for **you**.
Bear in mind this wasn't the first BitCoin bubble, and hopefully it wasn't the last. Could be days, or years, who knows.

Excellent, I may buy in on this

charging a fee per trade ruins it as a free market

Just to say, I do not think this crash is over yet
