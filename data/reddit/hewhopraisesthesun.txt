What is all this resistance stuff that I keep seeing posted here? Is it like once it gets past a certain resistance level "something" happens? Support? I'm not sure I understand.

Ah, well that's still pretty cool. You'd still have to basically already be "in the know" if you wanted to use this kind of stuff though, but I mean I'd use it, it's cool as hell!
as said, thanks for the clarification.
