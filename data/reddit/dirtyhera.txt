Wow. That is beyond unacceptable.

I love how they still continue to believe that they are the 'investors' and the entire rest of the human race are just 'people in the street.'

I wrote them months ago trying to renew my subscription after the payment portal timed out, and they still have not responded. If they won't answer to take money.. I'm not sure what they are doing. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:20:50
Thanks for responding, I wanted to post publicly that once I looked into it, what I had actually done was respond to the email that had timed out. Derp.
I never opened a real support ticket, I doubt my message went anywhere, and now I understand why my Coinigy account doesn't work. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:32:01
Awesome, thanks. I hope to move on to using a USB drive.. a cold wallet, I think? Is that even what that means? But for now I still don't know what I'm doing and want to get my feet wet painlessly, if possible.

The consensus here seems to be Coinbase.. I had initially read a bad review, and that's what steered me toward Circle. I will try Coinbase next.
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:23:56
Well, no luck so far. The Circle transaction was charged to my account, and then returned. Status on Circle says transaction canceled.. This is just trying to get the initial $10.00 on there.. we haven't even gotten to the Bitcoin purchasing stage yet. I didn't really expect this to be simple, but I kind of thought this first part would be.

Awesome, great analogy. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:35:20
I will read up on those! I haven't used any services before so it will be trial and error and lots more research. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:18:27
I've been reading your site all day! Fantastic information for beginners. Currently reading Education 9 and Education 2.
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:26:52
Any reasons or just personal preference? 
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:43:55
Thanks for the advice. No luck with Circle so far. I'm calling it a day. Hopefully I can figure it out. Bitcoin day 1 = 0.00000 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:30:27
Right, I have been reading horror stories about keeping the funds on centralized services and then losing everything. Seems like the chances of that are risky enough at this point without losing everything to assholes. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:26:08
This is exactly what I am hoping to do. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:32:21
Excellent advice, thank you. So far Trezor was mentioned twice, I will look into that now. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:52:36
Same goes for Kraken. These scrubs are taking millions from us and screwing us every time. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:33:55
Thanks so much. I just subscribed! Everyone is being so helpful. I am so excited to finally be a part of this community. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:54:01
Thanks.. To be clear, I have no intention of stopping at 10 dollars.. I just wanted to make sure if I screwed up or something went wrong I wouldn't be out anything. Now that I am starting to understand how this works, I have already bought more Bitcoin, some ETH, and MXR. Thanks to everyone for the help. 
Also, if I understand you correctly, such a small transaction ($10) is wasting space on the blockchain.. but how else are you supposed to learn without risking money you can't afford to lose? I was skurred. 
edit: still a noob. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:28:45
Got a reply from Circle first thing this morning. Problem was on their end. Got the $10 loaded.. now just trying to figure out how to actually get the Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:27:41
Awesome. I thought it was potato salad. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:58:22
This may have changed since Circle stopped selling btc last month. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:43:53
Standard trader trap of turning actual gains into perceived losses. You got +11x, not -20%. Call it a win and be happy. You can buy back in whenever you want. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:59:46
Sure, on PC it is under your account name, get address.

A couple of weeks ago I kept reading it as USAF and trying to figure out why the US Air Force is getting involved in BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:11:00
Oh Jesus Christ. I went all the way on opiates and then all the way back off over the course of many years, and bitcoin hadn't even been invented yet. I've been using btc for 3 years and I'm not back in the clinic.
