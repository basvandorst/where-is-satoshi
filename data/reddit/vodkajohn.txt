Wow y'all really are delusional. It won't replace these institutions, it will give these institutions a better way to manage records and record data swaps. Chase has been building and testing this tech since late 2015. 
This will not be their down fall but only make them better.

Why are you ok with the most corrupt, rotten, amd evil people having the most wealth? That's insane.

The fact that there was a cc called memecoins should be everyone's indicator that this shit is a joke.

The problem is that it does matter if it speculation. If there is nothing promised other than the fact that maybe it will go up it has no substance. The only thing transformational about it is block chain. Outside of that it is merely the unanimous decision that this digital nothing is woth something. If there are truly billions in it then they are betting on the idea that nothing is worth something. The only thing infecting finance is the tech of blockchain. Outside of that you might as well invest in rocks beimg worth something because a buch of people say they are. The only difference is that rocks are still there when the power is out.

Hopefully most regulations regarding it are from the late 80's.

Blockchain is a very promising way to track digital information. It is one of the reasons banks and governments are studying it so much. As long as there is a society there will be banks and governments in one way or another.

Ok break it down since we seem to live in two different worlds. What government rules you? You say first world but it sounds like you are in China or Russia. Do you even know what taxes do? Unless you live completely isolated from anything taxes benefit you in some way. Also almost any major, and most small banks will process an international wire for you at cost (just like bit coin processing fees). There is a very small list of countries and banks that are not allowed as well as personal sanctions on certain people. You just make it seem like governments are the pure evil of the world. They do shitty things sure but on the whole they mostly benefit the people they serve.

There is always a victim in drug dealing and that is the person buying drugs, as well as police institutions that have to stop them from stealing, fighting, and being a menace to society. Then you have the medical institutions that have to deal with them as well. It is incorrect to say that is victimless. As for weapons dealers, it is hardly ever someone selling the proletariat weapons to protect from the government. It is most often sent to cartels (you know, the one's that deal drugs and terrorize cities) and terrorist outfits. You must live in a bubble that is bigger than bitcoin.

So outside of being a nothing assest it is because people that want to get away from the government taxing them to improve society, or otherwise because they are participating in illegal activity that they invest. That should be the primary indicator that this currency is illegitimate. Many banks are already set up to send money anywhere to anyone so that argument carries no weight. And come now gold is valuable for wholly different reasons. Demand is cheif among the value of gold true, but the physical properties at least are able to be ascertained.

Not because they are the next currency but because they have seen rampant artficial growth based on speculation. Few, if any, are giving loans on cryptos. Where do you think people are getting the money from? Banks are already applying cyrpto tech on current and real currency.

If they believe hard enough the evil banks will go away!! I'm with you, these people are in their own bubble, and that bubble is crypto currency...

I am not arguing that. You obviously missed the point. Even before fiat these crimes existed. Try actually breaking down the substance of my argument and then reading what I was replying to before you start calling names.

Sure they lend but there is hardly any evidence that they lend off deposits made.
Legitimate as in they aren't illegal. Sure cryptos open that market to block chain but to say that will decentralize a market is not accurate. What is more likely to happen is these markets adapting this tech and then using it to make processes that are already in place more effective. Cryptos are a speculative "commodity" at best. There is nothing real there though.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:36:48
Banks make significant income by loaning money from deposits made, true. Not sure how cryptos offer an alternative (will you please elaborate)... Banks also have massive portfolios in stocks and bonds as well as in physical commodities. Almost every legitimate bussiness you deal with is tied to a bank in one way or another.

You make it sound like they seize your money for their own coffers. Maybe it is different in Ireland but my taxes in America go toward roads, libraries, and fire departments. If you want your own bank stuff your bills and coins in your mattress, not in this farce. Good talk m8, good luck with your cryptos.
