That's what I thought it seems a little dodgy.
If you're from the UK any advice on which site to use to get bitcoins as it my mtgox payment got rejected and you can no longer send them to a UK bank account to deposit with them.

Thanks, I didn't realise you could use the barclays pingit with any bank account. Going to give it a go now.

I didn't screenshot it at the time and would rather not go back on the site to be honest.

Just gunna leave it, not even worth risking it. Going to use the barclays pingit thing seems really easy so far.

I went through the process on bitinstant planning to send my bitcoins straight to a bitcoin address. After entering various details such as name, phone number, email and my passport number to prove I.D. (which I'd read about on other threads so didn't bother me too much). You also get an automated phone ring you with a sort of confirmation code thing then you enter this and go to the next page where it then began to ask for my login details such as letter 3, 5 and 8 from my password and a similar thing with my online pin which is where I got concerned and left. Nothing has happened to my bank account.

Why does this make the transfer instant? Why are we not just given an account number and sort code to send our funds to? Oh and how does this prevent fraud/scammers?

This is exactly what I thought, it all seemed legit enough until they asked for these details.

Have you used bitinstant successfully? I just attempted to use it and they asked for my online banking login details while going through the process after the phone call, seems a little dodgy to me.
