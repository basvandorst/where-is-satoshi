TBH, I think too many people want super quick adoption. Like any other new technology, for many people there's no need for Bitcoin yet. They got their payments channels, it's quick, it's easy. They can only be convinced if their current system suddenly doesn't work as well anymore. The alternative would be Bitcoin, for example, and they will come themselves. By that time, the UX of Bitcoin related tools has improved, and they happily start using it. If you approach these people before that time, they'll propably just get annoyed. Like we're some kind of Johova witnesses. 
I think actually using bitcoin increases liquidity, which is always a good thing. That's one of the best ways to help. And if someone spreads disinformation about BTC, start a conversation.

Well, I'm hodling and buying a small amount every month. If it drops, I keep buying. If it rises, it's celebration time. So fuck yeah, HODL-ing is easy. The only thing which is not easy, is you checking CMC every 30 minutes. Just follow the news and ignore the price.

Well, if people hold their btc in different wallets, in theory there could be more than 729,000 (or 650,000) people with one btc, right? If people have 0.5 btc in their first wallet and 0.5 in their other, they aren't in the metrics we use, yet they are in the 21 Million Club.

We should really stop care so much about these 70 year old symbols. Just like the swastika, that used to be a symbol for happiness, sacredness and whatnot.

I don't know and I'm not a professional, but I expect the price to drop at first, as people need their fiat for surviving financially, but on the long run I expect a crisis will show the problems most countries have with inflation and (central)banks. This could improve the overall 'image' of bitcoin, as people may realize it's not as bad or scary as it seemed before, or even start considering btc a decent alternative.
@_date: 2019-03-01 12:55:33
Well, I hope so, and given the developments in bitcoin and the crypto space in general, I think the price is more likely to be higher than lower in 5-10 years.
But still, it's impossible to value bitcoin properly. I just hope the price follows previous patterns and gives us at least a bit of insight in the value of the protocol in the long term. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 22:17:46
If I were you, I wouldn't care about the price and/or profits at this point. Imo, if BTC is going to be as big as it might be, you may never need to switch it back to your national fiat currency ever again. That's at least what I'm aiming for. 
However, owning Bitcoin is a great reason to read up on the technicals (not too much in-depth, but getting a bit of an idea). I'd suggest reading the whitepaper if you haven't done so yet.

Perhaps we should start to quantify all BTC forks (or perhaps all shitcoins) with the same symbol/name: Dorians, or Dor. The symbol will be exactly this.
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:02:25
This is a very optimistic scenario. We haven't had a major economic crisis or recession since the genesis block of Bitcoin, so I really wonder what'll happen to the price when a crisis like that occurs.
@_date: 2018-10-18 11:05:18
1. No one 'should' buy more Bitcoin, even if they can afford it. I certainly believe it would be a smart thing to buy, but many people aren't ready for this. Be careful with giving advice like this (especially IRL, with friends/family/etc.).
2. Nothing is guaranteed, even in Bitcoin. I do believe in the Bitcoin project, but it's still a believe we share. 
3. But yeah, I do agree, this is exciting news.

When I saw this, I only figured they don't sell as quickly anymore (last year I had to wait 3 months for my Ledger). I guess this is a good sign, the market has cooled off, and hopefully it will boom again not sooner than 1-2 years from now. Let the developers develop, and let us do our due diligence.
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:35:34
Agreed, however, there is still a chance we'll go lower. That isn't necessarily a bad thing (buying BTC more for less) but we don't know yet whether this is the definite bottom. Nevertheless, things are looking good indeed.
Another note: there is a new financial crisis lurking. I don't know what type of crisis it will be and the severity of it, but I heard a few key figures claim that once the crisis really breaks loose, crypto will be hit just as hard as any other market. Chances are however, that it will rise like a phoenix once people realize how dependent they are on the current money systems. This is what makes me excited: we get to take place into a theater and get to observe how all markets crash or thrive. Exciting times indeed.

I have a question. We have of epic whales with anything between 10.000 and 200.000 BTC. If BTC price rises, for example, to somewhere around 200.000 dollar or higher, these whales will own billions and billions worth of dollars. I'm sure these funds can and will be used for funding wars and other obscure things. Money = power, and I'm assuming all of these whales are power hungry. To what extent is this disparity in BTC ownership a systemic risk for the future of Bitcoin?

Here's the shocker: there is a change both inflation and taxes increased, so they both had their share on the increase in price. I don't know the details, but stating that the 400% price increase is due to inflation may be an oversimplification.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:42:27
Individual or groups, that doesn't matter if they all have the same ideology. Same risks.
I'm sure the world will keep on spinning and I'm not claiming WWIII will break out because of a BTC price rise, but these individuals or groups will have IMMENSE political power if the price of BTC keeps rising. That's pretty scary. I'm not claiming every whale will abuse their position of power, but I'm sure there are plenty of whales with questionable ethics and/or motivations.
In response to your last argument: that doesn't make sense, to be honest. Whales may sell a portion of their holdings at any point in time, of course, but I expect they will hold the majority of their BTC and thus get filthy rich nevertheless. It's not like they say: "oh the price is $50k, let's sell all of my 200.000 BTC!"
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:49:00

Woah woah, wait! You dare to call BTC 'VERY user friendly'? Dude, I'm sorry if I come across a bit harsh, but please get real. I'm sure you're a bit of a nerd, just as I am. Although I'm not as tech-savvy as many of my peers, but I know my way around a computer, and was able to get a BTC wallet without to many problems. 
But I have no idea how my mother will ever be comfortable with vague, long addresses, where you can send transactions which are permanent and with the risk of losing all money by making a small mistake. My mother is gonna get scammed so freaking much. And I can prevent that to some degree, but there are so many lost souls who will be eaten alive by scammers. We need a REALLY good UI to make this stuff easier. Just my 2 cents.

But are we in a down trend or an up trend? You seem to suggest we are in a "down trend". Don't get me wrong, I know the market's been pretty bear\-y since january. I was hoping for a revitalized, healty and moderate uptrend since march or so. But apparently it takes longer than I expected (imo we're just moving sideways). 
For this reason I am buying fixed amounts of BTC/altcoins 2 times a month, just because I can't read these markets. It may be FOMO, but I think if I start shorting, I am gonna regret it in 2\-3 years.

I bought it, but it was too 'programming heavy' for me. I love reading about the economic value of bitcoin and its social impact, but I'm not ready yet to learn about how it's programmed. I bought "mastering bitcoin", but haven't touched it since. Bitcoin Standard is pretty good, although it has a few random rants about art, family and several other topics unrelated to bitcoin.

Yeah, nice summary, but in history there were PLENTY of products which just never had a use case or couldn't find the mainstream support that was required to flourish. I do believe in Bitcoin, but let's try to remain unbiased/skeptical here: there is always a possibility that Bitcoin will NOT appear in these kind of lists in the future. If they were to find a critical bug, if Satoshi suddenly dumps is 1 mill BTC, if miners somehow manage to perform a 51% attack, if BTC actually dies a slow and uneventful death... It's always possible.

Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely bullish on bitcoin. I don't know if we bottomed yet, but I'm sure it's here to stay and we can expect a massive price increase anywhere between 1-5 years. But a bull market builds up slowly, and doesn't start with a pump like this.

Would they still have delisted it, because, in their own words, BSV's practices are antithetical to everything Kraken stands for?

It's a cool story, I'll give you that. However, your argument seems to be: Banks are slightly inconvenient, so that's why we will have bitcoin. This only scratches the surface. There are many places  in the world where bitcoin already serves its true purpose, where governments are more corrupt and the political/monetary system fails as a whole. That's the reason bitcoin was created and remains its true use case. 
But I should shut up, because low key I'm a hodler and a speculator. You seem like the person who would actually spend it, and I certainly do respect that.

"Will help everyone"... I'm sure Bitcoin is better than any other store of value / medium of exchange / unit of account, but it won't help everyone. Some people will be screwed over big time by bitcoin, probably because they're not tech savvy enough, prone to scams or part of the monetary system that is in place right now.

Haha, just kidding. Let's keep it at that, agree to disagree. Here's to a lot of great, exciting years in BTC/crypto, cheers!

I stayed in because I love the tech, but this specific poster doesn't promote the tech. It promotes getting in 'because you don't wanna get left behind'. How can you blame people for having the wrong mindset, if the wrong mindset is promoted like this?
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:36:06
Well, I believe you're right: in the long run it definitely will be beneficial for the space and theoretically it'll definitely increase the price.
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:52:38
Upside: a heartbeat has a bottom of 0, while BTC has an (apparent) bottom of about 6K. I can live with that.

Everything about this title annoys me. There is no indicator yet of anything warming up, and it's way too soon to even talk about a new hype. Please, hold your horses and keep this sub clean.

This reeks of circlejerking.

I am looking for some more critical / sceptical BTC news sources, to nuance all hype on reddit and the usual media outlets. They don't have to be anti-BTC, but I would like a rational and down-to-earth approach of the subject. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:49:13
Hold your horses (no pun intended). What I hated about 2017 and 2018 was that everyone was hyping everyone up with calls like this. I expect nothing will happen price-wise and the development of most platforms and a few coins can go on undisturbed.
I hope this is another Chinese new year or wall street bonus money scenario. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:25:39
Poor choice of color.
Also, are we talking about # ATMs globally, or a specific country?
I'm pretty sure there is a sub for horrible charts, and this one will fit right in.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:59:56
I feel like the overall price and movements are more dependent on development of bitcoin (adoption LN, etc.), external developments (BAKKT) and, most importantly, macro economics. I really wonder if we are going to see these cycles once a global recession or financial crisis hits.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:38:25
Well, I don't believe anyone deserves anything, but if we're claiming something in the spirit of '*group x  does/doesn't deserve object y*, in my opinion only the developers deserve increased wealth, since they are actually producing something. We may invest, but don't actively produce anything. We just sit and wait. Of course, there's a risk involved with that, but if our wealth increases, it's not due to our hard work. That's the reason I claim we don't 'deserve' any of it. We just may become wealthier by the hard work of someone else, in combination with a bit of risk and a bit of luck on our part.
But then again, I'm not a fan of the word 'deserve'.

Officially it would be Medium of Exchange and UoA is Unit of Account. I don't know whether these abbreviations are common, because I just made them up :')
But overall I agree with you, gold being all nice and shiny is a kind of luxury, and gold could completely lose in case of a global catastrophe. However, I think we would still need a medium of exchange that's durable, moldable and divisible (to some extent). Gold is more likely to have a significant value on an industrial level. However, it's a fairly soft metal, so I wonder what use-cases it would have in a Mad Max scenario, but I hope we never find out, lol

I'm considering leaving this sub altogether, unsubscribe from various youtube channels and all crypto news sites. The only one I will definitely stick with is Bob Loukas on Youtube. He seems like an honest, experienced and rational guy, with nothing than the best intentions. I think his style really suits you.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:02:01
I once made a small lie. In order to cover up for the lie, I had to lie bigger and better. At some point, I forgot what happened, because I created a complete new reality where I didn't lie.
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:25:06
Keep in mind that there are plenty of new technologies that were ridiculed as well, and actually failed. There are definitely similarities between this article and btc, but people tend to forget that bitcoin still can fail. I don't expect that to happen anytime soon and I do believe in the fundamentals, but there is so incredibly much out of my control in this space, that it's scary. 
But of course, I hope we can look back on these times in 20-25 years, laughing about it all.
@_date: 2019-05-03 07:20:25
I agree. 'Shiny' was a bit of an exaggeration. 
And I haven't dived into diamonds yet, but I certainly will!
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:54:56
This reeks of centralization of abbreviations. HOW DARE YOU!
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:55:36
Well, I got to be honest, I think you're both wrong. Your Economics professor seems like a bit of a dick, but there's still a chance Bitcoin will fail dramatically in the long term and will go into history books as the greatest bubble of our time. I think these chances are very slim, as BTC has proven otherwise so far and consolidates itself in society with every new block... But nothing is certain.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:39:20
Well, it's better than work!
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:38:17
Elaborate please. And ignore the price. Please give fundamental reasons why it is over.

\- Can be used in electronics
\- Has a track history of thousands of years
And then some. This lists are useless if they're not complete.
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:11:12
Well, it most certainly had value before it was used in electronics. Gold was a great SoV, MoE and UoA, for various reasons and unique characteristics. Also, you apparently can make nice and shiny jewelry of it, that lasts for centuries. Of course, goldnever had intrinsic value, but what really has intrinsic value? 'Value' in itself if something extremely subjective and circumstantial. The fact that gold maintained its monetary role for so very long (especially compared to fiat currencies), has to count for something. If bitcoin stays around for 10 more years, that's definitely a selling point for btc, so why shouldn't it be for gold?

Could you elaborate on the metrics you've used? Based on historical price movements, these bandwiths don't seem completely crazy, but I'd love to know a bit more on how you came to these conclusions.
Nevertheless, your post seems a lot less hype-y than most, and I love that.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:15:03
Mildly. But yeah, it is.
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:14:45
Well, these Moving Averages are just picked with random numbers. They CAN indicate a long term trend (and I'm sure there are plenty of traders using these), but to me, they don't mean shit.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:16:37
I don't know a lot about LN (is on my to do list for the holidays). Anyway, it has grown with approx 50 BTC so far in dec. What can we expect for 2019 and how does this affect the network? 
Also, the chart is a bit misleading. I would love to see a chart that starts with 0 BTC on the Y-axis and shows the growth of LN over 2018. Are you able to plot such a chart?

Having a track record isn't necessarily positive or negative, it's just an indicator that it's been around for a longer time, indicating at least a bit of resilience. The inflation due to the New world gold didn't change anything about its track record.
It has generally been deflationary for thousands of years but how useful is that fact to someone caught at the start of 150 years of gold inflation?
I do agree that the price of gold can be inflated again, but that's not the point. For this specific person the track record is not necessarily useful, but for millions who lived in other times before and after the discovery of the new world it actually is. And sure, the asteroid gold can inflate it again, but the fact that it can happen somewhere in the future will not change the value (= use) it has *right now*.

And who are you to 'deserve' gains? You're investing, you're taking a risk to lose it all. Let's face it, there is still a chance that Bitcoin will fail in the end (albeit small). If you get massive gains, did you 'deserve' it? Fuck no. That's not how it works.
In my opinion, the only people who 'deserve' gains, are the people who are programming and building on the Core. Everyone else reaps the benefits of someone elses work. And we also benefit from other people hopping on. Seriously, get some humility.

Definitely one of the best Bitcoin 'tutorials' out there. I watch this one almost once every month.

A year ago I was begging for the price to go higher, now I'm begging for the price to go lower :')
Also, a year ago I was fully convinced that Bitcoin has had its days, but was too slow and about to be overtaken by Ethereum, lol. Can't believe how wrong I was.
Now I wonder how much my convinctions will change in the next 5 years.

I interpret his use of 'deserve' as 'have the right to receive rewards'. I do not agree with that.

I think he's exaggerating a bit to make a point. The thing is, in this community (sometimes filter bubble) we love to see the good things about bitcoin, but never the bad things. We act as if everyone in Venezuela is saved by bitcoin, while the reality is waaaaay more nuanced. Check out the latest What Bitcoin Did podcast, it's a really good one.

If there's one thing I learned last year, it's that I don't fully the crypto market, I can't trade and I can't time the market very well. I'm currently DCA-ing twice a month and am willing to do so for the years to come. However, I do need to make a plan on when and under what circumstances I'm going to sell. Besides that, I'm not going to spend any of my time on crypto. Except for lurking on Reddit and coindesk of course, can't get that out of my system. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:42:13
Exactly. I was super confused when I saw it. Now I know CSW a bit better, it all makes sense.

And those who can handle 5% drops do 'deserve' 500% gains? Why do they 'deserve' this? People are looking for morality in fucking everything. 
OK, I had pretty much the same discussion yesterday, but today is another great day for arguing on the internet.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:05:39
Could Facebook in this case decrypt and store my information, or is it more of a anonymous ID check? As in, yes I am who I claim to be, I am so and so old, etc., but my name and specific credentials aren't shared.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:10:26
Sure, these natural patterns do apply to markets and speculative assets such as Bitcoin (to some degree). However, nature doesn't give a fuck about morality or what an individual 'deserves'. In the hypothetical scenario that Bitcoin goes to zero, are you gonna whine that you actually 'deserved' gains because you didn't sell after a 5% drop? People really need to come to terms with the fact that morality isn't a thing in this space, and it shouldn't be. We are all hitchhikers on somebody elses work. We speculate on price rise for various reasons, such as political, societal and monetary reasons, but you don't deserve anything more than anyone else. In my opinion, that is one of the main points of decentralization.
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:31:35
It would probably create a new bubble, so we get filthy rich quicker, but eventually the bubble will pop and BTC price will go back to the mean. This bubble would probably take place over 10 years or something.
