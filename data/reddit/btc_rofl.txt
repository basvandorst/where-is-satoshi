He hasn't been put on trial for the attempted murder charges yet. He'll have his day in court for that, but the outcome of a trial is just to see if he's guilty or innocent according to the law. 
Only Ross knows whether or not he paid to have people killed. I, along with any other reasonable person looking at this, am just looking at the evidence that's been presented and forming my opinion. In my opinion, he more than likely did attempt to have people killed and I have an accordingly low opinion of him.

You're acting like it's impossible to do an online transaction with a credit card and that they only work by phone. You're talking about replacing an apple with an orange. If they were able to take Bitcoin over the internet, they'd be just as capable of taking credit cards over the internet.

They certainly don't apply equally to other currencies. Also, saying, "when bitcoin becomes ubiquitous" isn't a very good argument to make because it's a very long way from being ubiquitous. There are lots of reasons to believe many problems bitcoin solves could be solved using other means.

I don't think you understand how analysts and investors work. Investors weren't ignorant to the fact that Rockstar was releasing a highly popular game. What happened, was that analysts predicted x-number of sales of GTA5, which would result in x-profits. Investors based their investments on those types of calculations, so when they released their actual results and those results exceeded predictions, the price went up.
This happens with every major stock with every quarterly earnings call. If sales were lower than expected, the stock would have dropped. If sales met expectations, the price would have stayed the same.
Also, you shouldn't spend time figuring out if a public company has "debt nobody knows about", unless you're an investigative journalist or SEC investigator. If they aren't disclosing that information to investors, they're committing fraud.

With an IRA account, the entire balance is taxed as income. Your gains are taxed when you withdraw as income. In certain circumstances, your IRA contributions are tax deductible, which could net your some savings. However, In the case of GBTC, it's unlikely the premium you paid is greater than your tax savings, if you qualified for the deduction.

If sellers could reasonably accept credit cards for drugs and buyers could easily use credit cards for drugs, while staying anonymous, than people wouldn't have spent Bitcoins on Silk Road.
People spent Bitcoins on Silk Road because Bitcoins offered the layers of anonymity required to do illegal things.
So, based on your reply, you need to make a product people want, but also exclude other forms of payment in order to get people to use Bitcoin.
I really hope the people of this sub gain clarity on how Bitcoin fits into the economy. It's a niche currency/transaction system that has it's uses, but does not do a better job in most transactions than other established payment methods.

What's your case where you'd use your retirement account to buy Bitcoins while maintaining the accounts tax shelter status rather than just buying them directly? I don't see the advantage in doing so when you have to pay a 100% premium on the underlying asset. 
With an IRA, you can buy more shares because the money is pretax. But that money is locked in until you're 59.5 (or you pay a 10% penalty) and it's taxable as income when you withdraw.
With a Roth IRA, you can buy as many shares as you would outside of any retirement account because the money is after-tax. You have to wait until you're 59.5 to see any tax benefit from that or else your gains are going to be taxed as income. This is also pretty limited since your Roth IRA contributions have a fairly low annual max.

There is no chicken/egg problem here because "Bitcoin mass adoption" will be a holy, supernatural event, like creation. Satoshi says "let there be store of value and transaction use" and BTC goes to the moon, governments fail concurrently, everyone uses BTC and the Hodlers shall inherit the earth.

Bitcoin can function perfectly fine at $220, $120, or even $20. It will all depend on where it's functionality ends up and what the ultimate demand for that functionality is.
The reason you don't understand the logic is because that logic is faulty. Remember, you're dealing with a fair number of well-meaning, but wildly delusional people hodling with the belief that Bitcoin will one day be worth multiple thousands of dollars and trying to justify their investment.

Nobody in their right mind would take on a risk investment that only pays out a 0.001% or even 0.05% in return. You can get better rates on a simple CD and don't take on any risk at all. 
If you're mining and only expect to get 0.001% back, you're either in it for reasons other than investing or you don't understand opportunity costs.

Huh? I was saying that Bitcoin will result in losses to the Winklevii and VCs who invested in companies like Coinbase, Circle, etc. And that their losses wouldn't lead to any sort of rebalancing. They lose money all the time but they make enough money some of the time to cover those losses.

You and your boss sound like you might be the two dumbest people on Earth. There is zero way illegitimate charges like that would stick. But I see you're still very bitter about it. I'm glad you found your bitcoin comfort blanket, where nothing bad can happen to you!
I'm also not sure you know the difference between identity theft or credit card theft. In the case of identity theft, which can't really be done just by handing someone your credit card to swipe, it's infinitely easier protecting yourself than it is securing your bitcoins. 
And look at all the high profile credit card security breaches over the past few years.... how many consumers, in the end, got stuck with charges from those?

These comparison between Bitcoin and email and Bitcoin and the internet are somewhat ridiculous. Think about what email replaced and what Bitcoin replaces. Also think of barriers to entry and short and long-term benefits. Finally, holding Bitcoin has inherent, and legitimate, financial risk associate with it. Email didn't really have that problem. If you used email, your money wasn't going to be exposed to wild gains and losses.
You could also easily argue that businesses adopting email for internal communications was email's real catalyst. There will be no equivalent way for Bitcoin to enjoy such a fast ramp-up, unless companies decide to start paying their employees in Bitcoin.

Yes, we get that; we're not stupid. The issue is that even though this chart is accurate and is not lying, it is still pointless. Yes, there are many orders of magnitude between $0.01 and $200 or $1000. Nobody is denying that.
The problem is that the chart does nothing to educate anyone on the recent value of Bitcoin, which is the most important thing to educate people on because Bitcoin only became a more popular device in 2013. What Bitcoin did in 2011 is completely irrelevant to today, just as whatever Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak did in their garage in the 70's is irrelevant to how good of an investment Apple is. 
This is nothing more than Bitcoin chart porn. Sorry if you think that assessment is trolling, but step away from the rah-rah Bitcoin club for a second, and think about how Bitcoin's price matters today, and you'll see it.

The generally accepted narrative was "it's bounced back tenfold every time it's retracted", which may have been true, but was in no way indicative of what it would do in the future. It never made sense to me then why people bought into that and it still doesn't make sense now.

If prices are the same for all transactions, you're actually losing money by NOT using a credit card, since you're paying the same amount and not getting anything back.

This is a fair criticism, minus whatever interest you have in my pants.
I think the fact that this silly little chart hits the front page or even though similar charts almost certainly had to have been posted numerous times the past few months, shows the unbridled enthusiasm has in letting each other know what a great investment Bitcoin is. 
To me, that's misleading, given that for many people, Bitcoin is not, and has not been, a good investment, nor is there strong evidence that it will be a good investment moving forward.

All time price chart for Bitcoin is silly for a log chart. A better chart would be Bitcoin since around 2013 when Bitcoin really started getting attention from more popular press.

No, they are an extremely convenient means of payment


Which, 99% of credit card users couldn't care less about. They care that the card works, not the underlying structure of the system behind it.


Really, for the amount of use credit cards get, the number of security incidents aren't alarming. However, when there is a security instance, the credit card companies are extremely good at making sure you're not responsible for the charges. If my CC # gets stolen, the only thing I'm dealing with is time loss sorting it out. I'm not going to lose any money when Home Depot gets breached. I'm just going to have to get a new card and read my statements to make sure the charges are valid.


Yay -- an actually solid Bitcoin use-case! Sorry for the sarcasm, but I don't dispute that Bitcoin has it's purposes. A replacement for everyday banking and credit card use, however, in my opinion, are not ones.


It's quick AND easy for the users. Don't discount how critically important this is. Credit cards have been proven to work extremely well for consumers. The leap in innovation and convenience between credit cards and Bitcoin is nowhere near as clear as between email and postal mail. Quite frankly, for most use-cases, Bitcoin has proven to be neither better nor more convenient than traditional payments.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:51:21
There weren't strong alternatives that did what email did.
There are extremely strong and widely adopted alternatives in payments.
