I don't want to sound like a prick, but why the fuck are you into Bitcoin then?
I really don't understand it. The beauty of BTC is that you don't have to rely on any third party or anyone for that matter, except yourself. If you are scared to trust yourself, stay with the mass and keep using FIAT. Honestly, and again, I don't want to sound like a prick, and I probably do, but people like you that trust these retards that lose BTC over and over again, makes BTC fail.

Ah ok, disregard my words, sorry to attacl you that way. I just get riled up when people buy numerous amounts of Bitcoin and still put it at a third party. I dare to say that these kind of people work these kinds of fiasco in hand.

And people are doing now exactly what?

You can only take over the throne by defeating the current kings. There will be some smears in the Bitcoin campaign, but how the hell did you think current kings became these kings? Exactly. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 09:35:45
No you can't, sadly. You cannot withdraw your whole bank account at once. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:31:04
Uhm, not here in Europe. And I cannot believe you can do it in America. There are probably some cost which you don't want to see. But let's agree to disagree. In about 1 year you will agree with me :)

If you want wide adoption of Bitcoin you want to educate the user, not shooting businesses down who's users are too retarded too understand that Bitcoin is money. Why the hell do you think bank has his security on top? If you want to be your own bank, make sure you're on top of security. 
Sometimes, really just some times, I'm wondering if with the stupidity of the average user Bitcoin can achieve wide adoption. People are just too damn stupid.

Haha, wow, didn't knew.. Than this wasn't exactly necessary maybe, but w/e I thought this guy is legit, lets give him some love. But you already did, I'm a bit late to the party :D

I wanted to buy something on that site, I've bought a few things on the site, and I was surprised with the quality. Now I wanted to get something again, and wanted to pay with bitcoins. I wanted to send them a mail requesting for payments with Bitcoin. But they already had it implemented! 
Great shop! Show them some love, they deserve it!
@_date: 2014-11-23 09:54:42
Did you put money in the account? So yeah, you paid the bank money to store money. Don't be so naive. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:17:10
There is no context so I dont really know what he is talking about, but it's not going to happen.
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:18:06
Yeah, I realise that now. But they deserve it though :)

God, I love the American Justice System. /s
Seriously, you guys need to overhaul everything regarding justice, because what the fuck you guys are doing, its not justice. It's fucking retarded. America isn't closely on the list of civilized country's anymore. It's a cesspool. I hear people whine about SA because they hand out death penalty's for demonstrating or being Christian, but I never hear the same people whine about people going to jail in the USA for having a bag of weed.

They sure are. If I didn't hate Ethereum already, which I didn't because I didn't have any reason, I'm sure I'm now.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:31:41
Yeah im a little bit in the dark here myself too. An answe to this question would be great. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:04:43
Expand.

I want the Bitcoins paid will be instantly converted to Euro's and send to my bank account.
Directly receiving BTC is no problem.

It's the most easy way to get familiar with bitcoin. I don't see a reason why it won't get new users on board. But w/e. Keep whining about the lack of new users, lack of adoption. Meanwhile keep the circlejerk going, tip your friend who can't stop talking about Bitcoin, that help!

So if I understand this correctly, it's a kind of marketplace app where you can search for available products and services, and offer services and products to the users?
I can't see it working like Reddit where posts get upvoted, what you suggested in your OP.
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:14:29
This actually sounds quite interesting. You're sure there isn't such a service around right now?
If I'm done with my current app, I think I can make a commitment to develop this idea.
