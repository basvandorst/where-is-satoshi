yep, you're completely correct
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:13:26
That's pretty much exactly what I said. My point was that they might decide to accumulate MORE currency in order to pump the price further, and make that much more profit in the selloff.

Why? Lol

he didn't say anything about storage, he said bandwidth.

You could use a shift card or other visa card solution. I don't think Shift charges any fees besides the initial $10.

Aren't you sort of supporting his argument there?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:27:51
Even just "futures" would have got you there. Come on man.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:10:56
yes but it's a ridiculously large number
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:31:02
I mean, why lie?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:51:06
Evidence that it's not? Seems many tech companies are actively supporting / investing / making partnerships with those in the crypto sphere.

Watching that 300 btc sell wall @ 15k get eaten on GDAX was pretty amazing.

You can look at the volume from each exchange on coinmarketcap. That's about as close as you can get to what you are asking.

I agree, I think a pump and dump is much more likely than them shorting it to nothing right out of the gate.

I was wondering if that was the case myself.

You misunderstood his point. There are privacy-oriented coins where all transaction information is obfuscated.

14k to 15k: 6.5 hrs
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:17
Some people would, others would still be up several orders of magnitude at that price
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:01:35
not saying it hasn't pumped, but couldn't they make more money pumping it even further before shorting it? after all, crypto is still a "drop in the bucket" compared to these large institution's bankrolls. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:19:01
That's called a doji, it's a sign of uncertainty in the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:52:27
It's a pretty good assumption that Coinbase uses a lot better security for their cold wallet than most users, however, there's also a lot more people trying to gain illicit access.

You should be numb to the volatility by now. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:39:47
They take the value from different exchanges. Each exchange is its own market, and the supply and demand across exchanges can have some variation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:23:45
That's been said so many times on this sub it's getting ridiculous.

It doesn't even say they're pushing it back in that article.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:32
That's a cool website. Thanks for the link
