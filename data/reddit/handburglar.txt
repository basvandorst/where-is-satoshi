I heard Steve Gibson say something like quantum computing will have the same effect on encryption as teleportation will on bank vaults.  Neither one is likely to be feasible for quite some time.

Pretty cool it has made it this far with no security holes yet.

That doesn't tell you anything really.  Who is that address?  If they never ever used it again, what could you gain from that information?  If both parties never used their address again, all you would know is that there was a transaction.

even if they don't ban tor, if they start banning exit nodes you won't really have much luck.  You kinda seem like an idiot.

That's the point though, almost every transaction people do will not be untraceable.  The point is, if you're super careful, it CAN be.  That is extremely valuable.

While you would rely on a trusted third party for day to day stuff the fact still remains that you could completely go around anybody and do direct transfers (plus no central banks mucking around in currency manipulation).  We don't have that with todays money and that to me is very valuable.

Check out this [thread](


Assuming the hash engine took 350 gates (2 orders of magnitude reliable), the chip runs at 550 MHz, and has 9 million gates, and was just 20% efficient, that is 80% of the time the chip is waiting for data or or otherwise not hashing, you could see about 2.8 trillion hashes per second.  TRILLION HASHES PER SECOND.  Even using worst case figures, a 5 million gate device at 250 Mhz, 5000 gates per hash engine, and a 5% utilization factor, you still get 50 Gh/sec, over 200 times the hash calculating power of a Ati Radeon 5850.
Apparently this guy is using a cluster of these now.  Mining is gonna be serious business.  Even a pool will have nothing on this.

There's an entire episode of Security Now dedicated to them and Steve Gibson loves them.  If Steve Gibson likes something, that's as close to bullet proof you can get.

I think that eventually this will be a good idea, but which market would we use as the indicator?  I don't think Mt Gox is mature enough to be the definitive indicator.

This is only because the client hasn't been updated to reflect the explosion in "value".  Transaction fees will be adjusted downward big time soon, and there is nobody saying you have to pay any transaction fee.  Just would make it take forever to be incorporated into a block.

Do you have a link to the wiki?
@_date: 2011-06-05 19:15:05
Good luck with that guys.  Best you can do is DOS the site but a new one will pop up.  Sting operations would work too (to freak people out) but a feedback system will probably help defend against that.  Bitcoin is about to get some negative attention, that's for sure.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:44:14
No idea what this would actually do if run.  My guess?  Virus that steals all your bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:35:33
Id have to guess you signed up at some point, that's the only way you'd be getting these emails.
@_date: 2011-10-12 16:00:18
I don't want the value to go up, I want them to be stable so we can actually use these things, rather than a vehicle for speculation.  
@_date: 2011-05-29 18:30:13
If anyone was trying to figure out if we were in a bubble, this is probably the best sign.  When people even start talking like this it's not a good sign.  
I fully support the idea of bitcoin, and think it will be very useful/valuable, but c'mon, all your savings?
@_date: 2011-10-14 00:54:50
Is there an easy way to import these wallets yet?
@_date: 2011-05-27 16:38:30
I agree, it is the best.  Unfortunately best isn't very good right now.  I am not criticizing Mt Gox at all, but it's just not there yet.
@_date: 2011-10-14 04:46:45
Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2011-08-23 02:46:27
Right, the 8 digit limitation is not set in stone, future clients could divide further (and move the decimal point too).
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:03:30
All this doom and gloom is going to create some great panicking selling.
@_date: 2011-05-21 13:53:51
They are these hash MONSTERS that are being used now.  Apparently one board can hash at over 1thash/sec.  That's like all of deepbit on one machine. 
@_date: 2011-09-06 18:50:53
I know... It's been keeping me up at night.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:28:42
I hope not, but you never know.  People may be panicking today.
