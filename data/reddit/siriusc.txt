My advice is usually "look... I don't know".
But it's not just advice. I've pretty enthusiastic about bitcoin &amp; would get carried away when talking about it. But I guess I don't really care about the empty told-you-so's.

How do you determine a dip is a dip? When it starts going back up consistently?

Where do you normally see FUD? I just learned of the term. I assume it's in the media? I've seen articles pop up in my feed that do this. At least 1 every day or two.

I'm an admitted noob &amp; I don't know how to properly lose my shit, if someone wouldn't mind helping.
A lot of people are posting about how terrible Coinbase is &amp; that they're leaving. They're losing their shit! Are these said noobs?
And if someone is to ignore all this drama as suggested does that include taking any action as far as Coinbase is concerned? They're at the center of this drama.

I intend to. But is it bad to hodl with coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:57:07
Okay, this totally makes sense. Thanks for helping to clarify. I still don't think it's "very bad" but it's certainly a bummer. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:37:24
Wow, so you know how much money a person makes by their comments, huh? That's amazing.

If they're *literally* the same then why do they both exist?
(not a snarky question, I'm really asking) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:15
Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:03:55


This is silly, it's not "a coin" the same way a quarter or a penny is. 


Isn't buying stock for a hopefully higher return a gamble? If I buy 100 shares of any given company aren't I just betting on it? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:45:16
Who's to say what the top is? How can anyone know? This was my mindset for the longest time.
"It's $200, I missed my chance"
"It's $400, I missed my chance"
"It's $1000, I missed my chance"
I bought in at $5000. I'm comfortable with the amount I spent &amp; the amount I gained. But I certainly wouldn't have minded buying in at a lower "top".

And I'll bet most stockbrokers couldn't tell you where the value of an American dollar comes from.

For who? And why?
How many bitcoin investors are gamers?
How many gamers have bitcoin?
How many people with bitcoin actively spend it?
I really don't know, I'm relatively new. I see people making blanket statements like "this is bad" without any kind of info or discussion points. The price went above $13K since Steam announced this. All in all I don't think this would matter too much. But it's just a guess.

Okay okay... But why is he so celebrated?

The account hasn't been used in 6 years but that doesn't mean the individual has been off reddit. A lot of folks have alternate accounts. Myself included.

That's actually an issue I'm having. When I have a basic grasp of things I come across something like this exchange vs wallet thing &amp; I can't quite find what I'm looking for in the sidebar resources. I dig &amp; I either can't find an answer to my question or find something that confuses me a bit more. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:31:08
As opposed to what?
(forgive a beginner, I just started a few weeks ago. I'm between 2 forks!) 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:59:36
Thanks, it's highly appreciated. And thanks for suggesting to just ask within the community. Other subreddits can be uptight about reading a sidebar before posting. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:24:52
Is it sad that bitcoin isn't understood *deeply*? I personally understand it to an extent. But when I try to research it a bit I get so confused.

My roommate is a highly educated, very affluent architecture student. But he doesn't know that you needs to rinse off dishes of excess grime &amp; turn bowls face-down before putting them in the dishwasher. Should he educate himself on dishwashers before using it? Or am I allowed to help him. The OP is just helping people. Simple as that.
And who says "n00bs!" anymore? I felt like a douchebag just typing it out in quotes. I wonder how you must feel day to day! (though I'm willing to bet you're not that self aware)
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:34:07
Wow, what an ass. I've seen the most educated folks make the most baffling mistakes. There's nothing wrong with pointing out something that might be a misconception.
