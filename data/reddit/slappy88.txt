When I open the file using cat command
    cat wallet.dat
My terminal fills up with garbage characters. This leads me to thinking it is in fact encrypted?

Any advice on command options?

I’ve tried tried reading the file with the base64 command and piping it to openssl with the base64 command option and I get the following error
     bad magic number

Yes I’ve tried absolute and relative paths to the file. I’m running as root user in a Kali Linux environment 
Sorry I understand now strings is a command. I'm having a look at using it but no luck so far. Any more advice how to use this command?

That’s what I get minus the 12 words at the top

Yes for sure I know that. Thanks for the response though.

I must be doing something wrong with this command. I created a brand new wallet.dat and encrypted the wallet with the same paraphrase. When I try the same command with new wallet file I get the same error.
    error reading input file
I have tried opening the file with the cat command and piping it into the command but the same error.
Another thought is this even possible with a bitcoin core encrypted wallet created on a Linux server?

 I'm running in to an issue with your command
    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in /path/to/wallet.dat -out ~/wallet-decrypt.dat
    error reading input file
any advice on how I can fix this file?

Update: some people have informed me that possibly I can use a hex editor to restore the headers of the corrupt file so I’ve been trying but this is very much out of my league.
Does anyone have any advice for how to do this? Like on what bytes does the header end? I’ve created a brand new wallet encrypted with the same passcode, and I notice a lot of zeros in the first 8704 bytes. Not all zeros but 99%.
Anyone with any thoughts?
Like is this even possible?

I’m not sure. Each line of that output has a maximum of 5 characters per line, also the lines are littered with * ‘ ^ &gt; characters..
Is it safe to post the output of that command here?
