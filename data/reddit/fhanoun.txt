Almost all bitcoins sellers in lebanon take around 15% commission. Assholes running it just like banque du liban.

I bought bitcoin 2 years ago. The situation of the country was quite "normal".
Still 10% is fucked up and is against all the concept of bitcoin and low transaction fees.

I totally agree with you, and to be honest I adore the country, the food the family values it has, the hospitality of the people, the beach that is now unswimmable or our amazing moutains (even tho politicians destroyed more than half of them) but we're the top country in Asia in cancer rate and second highest in the world. I am still young (24) and pursuing a software engineering career. I'd rather save myself and leave and let my family follow than die of cancer cause of stupid corrupt greedy politicians. I hope you understand my point of view. I am not leaving hoping the grass would be greener, I am mainly trying to escape from cancer and an early death. I have seen cousins and friends and coworkers getting cancer at that age and even younger people and it kills me from the inside. No one is even mentioning it on the news. It's this corrupt.
