You do realize that Circle includes the fee in the bitcoin price...right? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:12:56
Not true. Cash is easy to store in your wallet. A noob can easily lose their bitcoin if stored on their own computer. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:14:57
Which is why people need to stop suggesting people store bitcoin on their personal computers or flash drives. Bitcoin will never scale if that's the case. The average Joe should keep their coins on a secure site like coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:45:03
This is the correct answer. All the places I go to who accept btc have no problems with lines slowing down because of btc questions
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:29:35
Circle is hardly a bitcoin app anymore. They're basically just Venmo these days. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:20:16
They do, but at a much lower rate than when noobs try to keep bitcoin on their computer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:55:25
That's.... Not how it works at all. Fees don't rise until the block becomes full. For 8 years blocks got larger without fees rising. It's only when blocks stopped growing that fees grew out of control.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:23:50
This is by far the easiest way. Download Jaxx or CoPay
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:04
Increasing the block size today does not create centralization. It's a quick fix to save Bitcoin from losing completed functionality until LN can save us.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:09:06
Downvote for literally saying a fact that both sides agree on.

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:20:18
Gdax along with most exchanges will take at least a week or two before you can actually get verified, money transferred etc so I'd advise you to get it started asap. Gdax is the best US exchange. They don't charge trading fees if you use limit orders.
As far as getting hacked, there is small chance that gdax could get hacked or something else where you could lose your funds. So the best way to avoid that is by transferring your coins to your own wallet where and only you control your money such as Jaxx or copay etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:35:13
Not really. It's more similar to asking someone who you know bought Tesla stock when it was $1 how much they bought
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:47:12
Have you read the white paper? Bitcoin was supposed to bank the unbanked and allow instant transactions around the world as a digital cash system. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:22
You must be new here. Have you read the white paper?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:08
Storing 1 years worth of 8mb blocks costs less than one btc transaction. It's literally not an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:33:08
To answer your first question. It's not about how petty the comment is. The moderators in this sub have been banning people for even mentioning anything positive regarding bitcoin cash, but allow posts or comments if it's bashing bitcoin cash including personal attacks on supporters of it. You should really look into this. It's actually kinda nuts how censored this subreddit is which is probably why it seems like everyone fully supports bitcoin core. Fun fact, it's because anyone who doesn't agree with core is literally banned from writing comments. 
Regarding the advantage Cash has over most alt coins like Litecoin, is that it is an upgrade of bitcoin itself as a fork which means anybody who is a bitcoin holder is also a bitcoin cash holder. So basically it has a massive network effect unlike other altcoins. Another advantage it has is that the blocksize can increase as more transactions occur on the bitcoin cash network, so fees will never go up like they will with bitcoin, litecoin or other altcoins. It essentially fixes the clogged network until second layer solutions are built. 
I would tip you some bitcoin cash, but unfortunately the mods banned that too.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:20:37
I think the main issue is that people are thinking too far into the future. If bitcoin becomes one of the top currencies in the world, then yes, large block sizes are a big issue.
The thing is, we absolutely need to increase the blocksize TODAY to alleviate the clogged network. Is it a long term solution? Maybe not. But we need to fix the pressing issue now and come up with a longer term solution as we go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:29
You realize this is because of the slow transactions of the bitcoin network right? This has nothing to do with Coinbase service. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:58:19
2 life sentences
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:04:50
You don't think it's at all suspicious?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:36
It's the 3rd largest coin. They would be fools to not allow bch trading.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:07:05
Doesn't that just make LN coins an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:44:30
With our current clogged network, people literally can't move their bitcoin off of exchanges because of fees etc so they leave them there.  Especially for smallish amounts. That in my opinion is centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:29:06
So here's kind of an overview:
Every 10 minutes, 1mb of data is created and is stored on computers around the world. Some people are concerned that with larger blocks, less and less people will have enough bandwidth and storage on their computer to store all these transactions which would reduce the amount of copies of the bitcoin ledger (supposed centralization)
Personally, I don't think it's an issue. Mainly because bandwidth increases and storage costs decrease with Moore's law. So in 30 years if we have large blocks, we will have had 30 years of technical advancements that will allow us to store those transactions. Another reason why I'm not concerned is that you really don't need that many people storing the ledger. As long as there's enough distribution around the world, nobody will ever be able to destroy the ledger, even if something like WW3 happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:30
It's supposed to be better than Visa or any other form of money. That's kinda the whole point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:09:06
That's literally the opposite of what bitcoin was invented to solve. Most of the world has no access to banking. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:49:53
It really is simple, if we don't scale bitcoin, there is no future. There's a reason ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash are taking marketshare. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:04
Bitcoin cash has scaling
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:57:29
I'll probably get banned for saying this, but genuinely curious why you don't use bitcoin cash? It's bitcoin that is fast, cheap and reliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:59:18
Bitcoin cash already fixes all of this today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:12:31
They aren't using segwit because it requires new code. It's also not a long term solution
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:04:24
Ya it's definitely risky because only anti-bitcoin cash comments are allowed in this sub without being banned. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:48
It literally is the answer. It works already.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:51
It's not a direct copy. It's an upgrade to btc by adding scalability.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:37:16
Other coins do hardforks all the time without creating "airdrop altcoins". I don't know why everyone on bitcoin is so afraid of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:13:14
They halted trading because they opened up trades too quickly and there wasn't enough liquidity and price had become volotile. Do you honestly think Coinbase would risk their entire business to make some friends happy? Give me a freaking break.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:24:36
Not anymore what
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:04:36
Serious question. How will LN ever be a real solution when it costs a huge transaction fee to even deposit your coins into it? Especially for those in 3rd world countries. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:46
Get out of here with your logic!
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:12
No. Because it does not have a 1mb limit. That's why btc is so slow right now. Less than 7 transactions can get through per second meaning most transactions can't make it in very quickly. Bitcoin cash does not that limitation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:46:12
That's fine, but dogecoin isn't Bitcoin. It doesn't share the same userbase, code, amount of coins etc as bitcoin. Bitcoin cash isn't meant to be an altcoin. It's the scaling upgrade to the original bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:14:48


That's absolutely not true. The fees on bitcoin cash are pennies or less.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:19:30
A currency implies that it can be transfered for goods or services. Bitcoin can no longer be transfered for goods or services because core won't increase the blocks. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:11:03
Every 4 years the amount of bitcoin "minted" is cut in half. So less new bitcoin will be added to the bitcoin economy, thus making it gradually more scarce. It's similar to how gold is harder and harder to find in the earth as time goes on. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 00:14:29
Happy 15 million!!
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:18:42
What is your reasoning? Just curious btw, I can respect that.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:18:25
Exactly. The map is spammed with tons of restaurants that do not accept bitcoin in person.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:19:13
They are a business. My gosh heaven forbid they make money.
@_date: 2014-06-07 23:44:48
Because Bitcoin is traceable. No business would want people being able to see exactly how much their business collects. Its not fishy, its just business. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:01:36
US citizen here. I agree the amount of time to transfer between accounts in the banking system is terrible, but to say that they charge me to keep money with them is simply false. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:29:23
I think this is dead on. Something like dogecoin is perceived more as a digital karma than a living breathing currency. I think its only natural that as bitcoin grows up, people treat it more like money and don't throw it around like it's worthless.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:36:23

@_date: 2014-12-08 18:16:48
You are confusing credit card companies with Bitcoin. They are not the sane type of thing. Credit cards are services built on top of cash. Bitcoin is like cash except its digital. There's no reason why there can't be credit cards built on top of Bitcoin that also offer buyer protection.
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:21:12
they are just buying at lower prices than before
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:39:46
Not a great solution but they could just use the coinbase website in their browser. That's what my local deli does
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:49:58
Unfortunately aldi is so tight that they wouldn't invest in some iPads or terminals to accept btc. Also they won't pay the 1% Coinbase fee
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:24:59
I'm sure coinbase is checking to make sure their ap doesn't have any bugs or security issues before putting it back online
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:47:28
I've never had to wait on coinbase. Its always instant for me.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:57:17
This sounds like a terrible idea. The idea is to get people to not think we're crazy. Spamming them with bitcoin articles will just piss them off more
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:24:08
Question. If you never intended to cash out your bitcoin for fiat, then why did you have to wait for a free tier? Why didn't you just accept bitcoin with someone like coinbase where it's completely free.

I'll believe it when I see it. Apple could easily block bitcoin apps because they don't "approve" of them
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:33:13
This is not true. With your logic, paypal, google wallet, square cash, ebay, amazon etc would all have to be removed because you can purchase goods or send digital money. Apple is also removing wallets that don't let you purchase bitcoin. ie there is nothing being purchased yet they still remove them.

It honestly astounds me how people can't wrap their mind around how you can accept bitcoin using something like coinbase and receiving USD. They still tell you that you're stupid for accepting such a wild currency even after you JUST explained to them that you don't take any risk. I realize more and more that people are just stupid.

I have been an investor on btcjam for a few months now. I would say over 50% of the borrowers are scammers. I have a -60% return so far. Even when I invested in A or B rated borrowers they usually default. I've gotten better at investing on there recently and have had better luck. I now only invest in people who are very communicative in the comments section and who only have 1 active loan and have paid back a crap ton of loans. Also if they are from the US that cuts back on defaults drastically. The site is legit though just be careful because you can easily lose everything.
Also stay away from loans that offer 20%+ interest. Almost every one of those I've invested in has defaulted. BTCjam as a company is horrible. They have zero customer service, they NEVER respond to support emails and they don't penalize users for defaulting even though they claim they do.

My advice, (If you are in the US)
Sign up for a Coinbase account 
and buy some coin. 
I would then either keep it in coinbase if it's a small amount or if it's significant I would send the coins to something like Multibit on your computer and encrypt the wallet.

This post is so terrible. You clearly don't understand how humans work. If someone is interested in bitcoin and has little to no technical background, then trying to explain private/public keys, encryption, blockchain etc is a TERRIBLE way to go about it. Remember, these people will give maybe 10-30 seconds of their time to consider bitcoin. Coinbase or circle is an easy in for them. Trying to explain the universe to them in 10-30 seconds just won't cut it. Once they understand how to use coinbase or circle they can start learning about better way to secure their money and start buying larger amounts. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:09:11

You aren't explicitly saying that to her but you are implying that Bitcoin is a safe investment and that price is basically going to rise. Enough that you are willing to give her insurance on it.

I think you're confused what bitcoin is. It is not the end all and does not mean that credit cards will disappear. Bitcoin is similar to cash in that credit cards were built on top of cash. In the same manner, I fully expect credit cards to be build on top of bitcoin. Just because someone uses bitcoin doesn't mean they don't want or need a credit line and the benefits of buyer protection.

I don't think you understand how this works. When you actually get invited THEN they will give you $10 worth at THAT time. It's not like they already bought you $10 worth at a previous exchange rate.

These services instantly send an IOU. The money takes several days to actually move from my bank account into PayPal and then into their PayPal where it takes an additional few days to move from their PayPal into their bank account. 
Not to mention you can only send money to friends who are using the same service such as PayPal or Google wallet. Bitcoin can send person to person without having to know what wallet your friend is using.

It's great that you are teaching young people about bitcoin. Keep it up! I would probably stay away from complicating things though by having them import HTML files. Just keep it simple by having them install apps on their phones and have them scan in the private keys from your paper wallets that you hand out. No need to complicate the process. As for transactions, just show them how they can view transactions on blockchain.info's site

whenever i buy things with bitcoin I simply replenish the amount I spend instantly so I never worry about it. Also, as price goes up, it makes your bitcoin savings worth more. So you spend more bitcoin because you have more buying power. People bought HD TV's when they were $20,000 and today they are like $500. Same thing

1. Changing your bitcoin straight to USD does not defeat the purpose of bitcoin. It's allowing bitcoin holders to spend their coins in your store. And you can then do what you want with your money. Don't feel pressured to keep it in bitcoin. You have bills to pay so do what you need to do. 
2. Double spends are almost impossible to do and the amount of work involved to double spend far outweighs the reward. Also, bitpay takes the risk, not you
3. A Droid X would work fine, lots of people prefer tablet because it's just a little bigger. I suggest a Nexus 7. Also, coinbase has a very professional looking app so if you weren't committed to bitpay you could check them out as well. You get the first million dollars in transactions free. 
4. Theres literally no risk in taking bitcoin if you withdraw USD so it doesn't really matter if there's a huge market for your goods. You aren't losing anything by accepting it. 
Thanks for supporting Bitcoin. We love you for it and you are only helping adoption spread!

People put $500 into Bitcoin not because they think it's less risky than putting it into a bank, they do it because Bitcoin is scarce and it has never lost value if you hold it for over 1 year. Most see it as the money of the future and eventually if it takes off, volatility will get smaller and it will be worth magnitudes more than its worth today

Absolutely. Bitcoin addresses were not designed to be used more than once. Think of an address as a single transaction. Using a service like bitpay or coinbase, you receive a new address per transaction. That way when the address receives the proper amount of bitcoin, that transaction is considered filled.
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:10:56

Are you really that delusional? This is classic PR talk. It's an industry-wide way of saying "No" in a way that makes the customer feel good about themselves. I've worked in this kind of industry.

Honest question. Why on earth would you buy at 1000 and then sell at 400. Bitcoin has never died before and it's not dying now. Man you people are dumb.

What I'm saying is price doesn't mean much because even if Bitcoin is not used for currency or transferring of value, the technology has been invented and its going to be game changing. There's no doubt whatsoever about that

In order to digitally send money to someone it requires a bank or 3rd party.  If I wanted to send you USD on a Friday at 5pm, you wouldnt get the the money till next week. With bitcoin you can send money whenever the crap you want. It doesnt matter if today is a weekend or a holiday.

@_date: 2014-04-29 20:19:57
I know people hate the idea of bitcoin banks but stuff like this is why I'm all in favor. I think most people would trust a trusted/insured bitcoin bank over securing the coins themselves

My guess is that Bitmit and Coingig got shut down because they were running an escrow service. On the site I'm currently working on, we use multisig so hopefully we won't run into legal trouble because we don't hold the funds from the transaction.

I am keeping a small savings in Bitcoin as an investment but I also spend Bitcoin and replenish my account at the same time. Im not touching my savings for at least 10 years if not more. I only put in a few hundred bucks last year so if Bitcoin dies I'm not out much but if it succeeds then it will be way worth it. My plan is not to cash in my Bitcoin savings someday but rather spend it when its more widely adopted.

Well using a 3rd party is fine. But my concern was that the restaurant doesn't accept bitcoin if you were to eat there. You have to order via the website which makes it hard to discern on coinmap where I can actually drive to and eat.

Nice article but you make it sound like 1 person is in charge of hosting the excel spreadsheet on dropbox. You never explained that everyone has a copy of it in their own dropbox. You just said that one guy is hosting it and we just trust that his spreadsheet is accurate. If that were the case, he could just fudge the numbers. This is why we have decentralization where this excel sheet is stored on thousands of computers and we can all recognize that he fudged his numbers.

The problem with this app is that when you zoom out, it does not display the businesses. After a few minutes of tinkering I realized you have to change the dropdown  to show the entire world. Very poor user experience in my opinion. Why have the dropdown at all? Just show where you are located and as you zoom out, simply display the businesses on the map. You're making it too complicated. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:16:46

This makes bitcoin look extremely complicated. You have to get the merchant to buy one of these dated looking machines and then you have to use a specific card with it? Just let the merchant use something way simpler like the coinbase app and scan the qr code.

@_date: 2014-03-20 20:48:36
Shouldn't we remove all these from coinmap then? It specifically states that they have to be brick and mortar places. If I can't walk into the restaurant and pay with bitcoin then it shouldn't be on coinmap.

Bitcoin addresses are not meant to be used more than once for privacy reasons. Just have him use Coinbase on his phone to accept payments. There's no reason to have a qr code printed for his business.

Hasn't happened to me yet but when I go out to eat with friends and we get one check its a pain to split the check when I don't carry cash. Credit card only. I'd love to be able to just pay my friend instantly without doing a bank transfer that takes a week.

Fees are optional. If you don't choose to include a fee it might take longer to send. Also, I think the default fee is fractions of a penny.
Alternatively you can use something like Coinbase where they automatically pay transaction fees for you.

Dude, please research before you state assumptions that are wrong. Bitcoin is open source so people have verified the code. The coins literally cannot be counterfeited because of the way the network verifies them.
@_date: 2014-05-22 04:16:17
The point is because some of us truly believe in the future so we hold a little just in case. In the meantime, we go out of our way to refill our wallet and spend our coins to help create movement in the space. If everyone holds and doesnt ever spend then this digital cash won't take off.

You must be new to Bitcoin. Its not dying this is just a market correction. It happens after each bubble.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:34:10
You definitely have not missed the boat yet. Bitcoin will be the clear winner over dogecoin in my opinion. Bitcoin is extremely cheap in the long term. prices have risen exponentially for 5 years straight. What makes you think it has reached its peak? 99% of the population still has yet to hear about bitcoin. 
Obviously don't take financial advice from strangers though.

The price is dropping because some people decided to sell some coins. Then the next person got scared thinking the price might drop so he sold his coins. Then the next guy got scared.

Supply and demand is absolutely the reason for price. And today it's much much harder to get your hands on a full Bitcoin than it was a couple years ago. Not even because of price, but because it's much harder to mine one than it was.

You're using a linear scale. Everything looks like a bubble when you look at it in a linear scale. Try looking at the stock market. Stocks grow exponentially, much like Bitcoin. Looking at them in a linear chart is misleading. Log charts show the actual growth via percentage, not just dollar amounts.

@_date: 2017-08-13 06:30:03
First of all, it's never too late. Bitcoin is absolutely in it's infancy and because it gets exponentially rarer over time, the price should theoretically continue growing like it has for the past 9 years since it was invented.
If you want to start investing I would recommend coinbase.com It's the most trusted site out there. There are a lot of places to research but you'll probably pick up the most info at @_date: 2017-08-15 19:57:14
So Apple stock is a pyramid scheme by your logic? If I had invested in Apple early on and believed in their company I would have been greatly rewarded for doing so by having a crap ton of stock that is worth more later.

Honestly...turn off your price ticker and just wait it out a few years. Bitcoin has always gone up and down wildly but has always trended upwards over time. The more you look at your price ticker the more tempted you will be to trade. Just treat it as if you don't even own it by putting it in cold storage and not touching it for years. It's worked great for me and many others in this sub.

Pretty neat. One suggestion: the background numbers are extremely distracting to the point where i almost can't read the foreground info. Maybe if they moved slower or were more transparent in color?
Edit: Another suggestion: you could probably remove the cents part of the dollar amounts. It moves so quickly by thousands of dollars per second that the cents are kinda meaningless 
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:26:05

You realize those posts are jokes right?
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:43:19
Let me be clear, Bitcoin will almost certainly drop in price soon. Historically after large run ups in price, there's a crash. I expect this runnup to be no different. That being said, the price has always crashed higher than the previous all time high. And Bitcoin has risen in price exponentially since it was invented 9 years ago. There's no reason why it would slow down any time soon. Just remember though that you can't time the market, so don't try to pick the best time, just buy and don't sell it during the inevitable crashes to come over the years.
And yes Bitcoin is divisible so you can buy any amount you want. If you only want to buy $1 worth, you can. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:13:11
More miners probably
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:04:58
While I agree with you, there's absolutely no way to know the price will be that high. If we knew it would be $2k in 2020, then the price would go to $2k now
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:38:24
That would certainly take out a lot of the internet's websites, but the internet and technology itself can never be shut down.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:07:05
Instant transfers are not the same as confirmations

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:04:33
It was never originally believed that you needed to wait for any confirmation for relatively smaller transactions as it was nearly impossible/economically unfeasible to double spend.

That's kinda my point. You suggested off-chain transactions not on the blockchain, which is essentially what PayPal or any 3rd party service does with Federal reserve dollars
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:12:52
Free karma brah
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:50:51
A cheap fee would be under a penny. You all are so dilusional it's not even funny. It's like everyone in this sub forgot how bitcoin used to work.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:16:29
Man, that sucks that the fee was so high. Fees used to be fractions of a penny.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:55:28
Having a scalable bitcoin makes me unskilled? And here I am trying to make bitcoin usable like it used to be. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:50:02
That was hardly a dip. Wake me up when we're down 50%
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:32:10
Even still. Bitcoin needs to scale. This is why bitcoin cash exists. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:04:18
See 2011 and 2013
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:57:05
I doubt Coinbase would sell to PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:48:16
You should put the Bitcoin wizard image and nyan cat pooping rainbows across the front
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:12:41
Bitcoin is a global currency that is distributed across computers across the globe. Similar to how the internet is distributed and cannot be shut down, bitcoin has the same attributes. 
The Bitcoin exchange rate tends to go up over time because unlike most currencies, Bitcoin gets rarer and rarer over time. Every 4 years, the amount minted gets cut in half.  By 2040, 99.9% of all Bitcoin will be "minted" so people have been buying because it gets more scarce every 4 years. 
Bitcoin just hit $4000 today which is an all time high
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:05:13
That doesn't mean bitcoin cash is centralized. If that miners was taken out by a government, Bitcoin cash wouldn't shut down. Also, that hash power is only because Bitcoin cash is brand new and it takes time to get even distribution. By your logic bitcoin core is centralized because only Satoshi and others were mining it at the beginning.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:09:43
Satoshi left the scene and gave his control over to Gavin
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:11:10
Miners will work for transaction fees
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:40:02
That wasn't me. I get what you're saying
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:45:24
Really surprised you've never seen [this](
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:51:48
What if you had to pay 37 cents to hand someone some cash?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:58:20
Same here. I no longer use my Bitcoin because of the fees. Fix scaling and then I'll start using it again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:27:08
My point was that after every bubble, we ended up with more valuable Bitcoin after the crash than we did before that bubble
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:56:49
It's not about being cheaper than wiring money ffs. It's about being a currency. That will never happen with full blocks and high fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:25:08
Personally I wouldn't invest during an all time high like we're currently in. Give it a few weeks or months and the price will most likely go back down a few thousand before doing it's next bubble. I fully expect 10k Bitcoin price in the next 2 years.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:07:14
How do billionaires not already own some? Like just invest $100k. That's nothing to them. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:46:43
Even if they cashed out and caused a flash crash, the price would come right back up. This has happened several times in the past.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:53:17
Instead of this off chain fixes, we could just increase the block size like Satoshi envisioned. Sheesh
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:42:26
Holy crap, he speaks!
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:33:54
Yes, but there's no other coin that is even on the radar
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:31:36
Think of it like gold. There is a limited amount of gold on the Earth. Over time it gets harder and harder to mine. You could compare one pound of gold with say one bitcoin in that you can divide that gold up into ounces or grams or even less. It just means the smaller amount has less value than the larger unit.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:10:40
Yup. It absolutely will crash hard soon. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:21:18

@_date: 2017-08-18 03:01:40
Can you give me one reason why not?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:02:27
No. Why limit it at all? Off chain transactions defeat the purpose of bitcoin being decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:18:15
Supply and demand works like this. If you let bitcoin scale how it was designed to do by Satoshi, and more transactions occur (making it actually be useful as a currency) then the amount of small fees add up. And if it's not enough money for a miners, that's fine! They can stop mining and then the other remaining miners will earn a bit more. It will equal itself out naturally. No need to artificially limit supply
@_date: 2016-12-27 05:55:18
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:00:33
Their website is much better today
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:01:48
Oh thatd be cool
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:00:12
Every 4 years, the amount that can be mined gets cut in half. Yes more bitcoin are being added all the time, but it's harder and harder to get a hold of it. In a decade,most of all Bitcoin will have been mined and very little will be introduced into the market. That's what makes Bitcoin rare. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:15:44
Basically the gif was shown on the site when bitcoin hit $4000 USD out of excitement. Whenever Bitcoin hits a new all time high, they put a different gif up.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:48:19
That's not relevant to the point I'm saying
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:59:44
As most people have said on this subreddit. Never invest more than you're willing to lose. So for the past 2 years I've basically just assumed I lost it all which was fine with me. I've never thought about selling though. There's so much more potential upside than there is taking a small loss. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:51:44
Strap in boys...
@_date: 2016-11-01 02:09:12
I can't because I get the cards from work for commuter benefits. Aka: I don't have a credit card to charge back

Man have I missed bitcoin being fun and goofy
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:14:04
Ouch that's really expensive and slow. Bitcoin is supposed to be almost free with 10m confirmation. Can't wait till we get a scaling solution.

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:16
Seriously. Core is the one stopping bitcoin from scaling the block sizes. So much irony here
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:39:18
Most people say that, but when the crash actually happens, they get scared and don't invest
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:37:44
Synchronization happens during crashes. People panic thinking their gonna lose it all so they sell cause it to drop faster. It happens all the time
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:47:03
Man...those were the days
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:20:00
No it's not. It's just a misspelling of hold that became a meme

People are realizing insane gains. Pretty common during bubbles like this.

Coinbase charges a brokerage fee by inflating the price slightly. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:14:44
Let me make this easier for you. Coinbase.com is all you need right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:38:02
I see no issue with that
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:52:04
Do it now. You'll get double the amount of (different coins) when it forks

He asked where to start. I gave him quite possibly the easiest way to start. Calm down dude.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:06:46
I was there
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:47:51
Because there's been insane growth in price in the past few months. People get greedy, then they get scared and panic sell once the price starts dropping. Rinse and repeat. Bitcoin is notorious for huge gains and huge drops
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:06:22
That's what everyone said the last 3 times
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:20:12
OP has apparently never worked at any company. This email is a classic "Ya sure, we're working on X. Now please go away so I can close this support ticket"
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:22:55
There doesn't have to be any reason whatsoever. It's just mob mentality. People get nervous and sell once the price drops a bit and then it snowballs into a full on crash. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:31:38
Sound advice. I'm going all in
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:41:34
That's not what it means. It was a misspelling of "hold" and now it's a meme
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:46:11
Bitcoin has always scaled by increasing block size. 1mb simply isn't big enough for the transactions

@_date: 2017-10-16 19:51:21
They are spending all that time to stop bitcoin from scaling. Sounds pretty bad to me
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:59:49
Exactly. I would use my btc if Core wouldn't limit transactions. They are single handedly destroying what bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:52:22
This...this is actually accurate
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:54:29
Bitcoin used to be instant. Confirmation wasn't needed because double spending was practically impossible

Do we have to start calling him Solo now that the movie is coming out?
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:54:06
It's so young that it's very volotile right now. Bitcoin is relatively new so as people learn about it, they buy and sell which causes such high volitility. In the future it won't be like that. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:02:18
He would have cashed out at $1
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:39:35
Not OP, but for me my initial investment is so incredibly low compared to my btc valuation that at this point it really wouldn't even matter.

Ok that's weird
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:40:07
Why is everyone cheering about this? I honestly don't understand why people don't want bitcoin to be upgraded. The current bitcoin is so broken that I can't even use it as a currency

It's not called bcash. The name is Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:22:29
Take 5 minutes to get set up on Coinbase.com. You haven't missed any boat. The fact that most people have no clue what bitcoin is means it's in it's infancy

Stop trading for goodness sake. Just buy and don't sell

@_date: 2017-10-21 01:22:09
You joke but...
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:51:14
People will panic for a bit, then they will all realize it doesn't matter if Satoshi dumped or not and our lives will move on

It's nothing for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:51:35

@_date: 2017-10-22 04:57:35
People on this sub hate him because he wanted Bitcoin to be able to scale and be used as a currency like it used to be. So when bitcoin cash was forked off of bitcoin he moved over to that camp because bitcoin cash follows the original design that bitcoin used to have where it was scalable. Not sure why people on this sub don't want bitcoin to be able to scale and be useful once again.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:27:52

Use gdax. No fees

I'm a long time bitcoiner but I can at least admit it's currently broken as a currency.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:35:10
1c of bitcoin would have been great a few years ago, but today you'd lose it all to fees
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:55:22
Seriously. Bitcoin was attractive because it was better than cash and it would allow anyone with internet to have a "bank". Unfortunately Core has destroyed all that by making bitcoin no longer usable as a currency. Now everyone just sits around counting their coins.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:36:37
The fact that it can't be used as a currency anymore because of the 1mb limit. Not sure what world you're living in where that's "working"
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:25:06
If you still have the drive you can most likely recover the data. Take it to someone who knows what they're doing.

Everyone overcomplicates things on this sub. It's really quite easy to safely store btc. Download an app like CoPay and write down the 12 word passphrase. Throw that passphrase in a safe or write it down and you're good for life. Even if that wallet gets shut down you're still good

@_date: 2017-10-13 17:00:37
I'm sure it doesn't. Maybe one could think that by "not cashing out" you haven't gained anything or something
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:10:43
Not really greed. They want to improve where Bitcoin is broken
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:38:39
We've already tried several times. Bits almost became a thing but eventually died off
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:09:06
In the early days, people lost thousands and thousands of bitcoin because they were worthless so people didn't bother taking precautions when storing or just threw away old hard drives with tons of coins on it. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:50:52
Yup, this is better advice than most. HD wallets are more user friendly and the only thing people have to do is write down their passphrase somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:25:16
RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:49:35
No prob :) I would encourage you to read up more on HD wallets. [One example](
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:56:37
The fact that someone can mess up an order because we have to somehow decide on an ambiguous fee is just crappy user experience for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:39:28
So if they report it as a sell doesn't that mean I'm screwed if I've ever transferred btc off of Coinbase in the past?
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:00:16


Hardware wallets might not be confusing to you but to a new user this is utterly sci-fi. Getting them started on a trusted online wallet like Coinbase has magnitudes less friction and once the user has played with and understands Bitcoin more, then they can dive into more advanced and complicated solutions like hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:43:04
Is there any way to get off the report? Like what if stuff I transferred long ago is reported on the future as a sell? Won't I get backtaxes?
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:58:36
The user of a currency should NEVER be responsible for messing up an order because they didn't happen to choose the perfect fee for the network. What a horrible experience.
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:44:22
Why? Don't you want bitcoin to scale?
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:09:16
Except OP is locking in a house rather than hoping btc continues to go up. Peace of mind is certainly valuable. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:38:14
How do I support it? Serious question
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:29:30
As an average user, I don't know who my provider is, what that means, and how to contact them. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:51:45
You said Bitcoin isn't for you unless you want to be your own banker. I'm saying you can be a Bitcoin user and not be your own bank. Putting money under your pillow = being your own bank. Putting Bitcoin in Coinbase = Not wanting to be your own bank. The user can be pro Bitcoin and pro banks. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:02:53
Bubble confirmed
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:10:25
Its impossible to know how many coins have been lost but some estimate around 30% which would make sense. In the early days, people wouldn't think twice about losing thousands of Bitcoin by accident.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:07:22
If I could accurately predict the future I would take out lots of loans to buy btc
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:25:55
He said explain it like he was 5. A 5 year old wouldn't read that.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:29:57
Don't listen to these other people saying to buy hardware wallets. Since you're obviously new to Bitcoin, just go to Coinbase and buy some there. No need to get all nerdy when you're just starting out. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:45:45
Completely false. Some people keep their cash under their pillow, some people keep their cash in a bank. The two aren't exclusive to physical cash and the same is true for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:28:16
First of all, I'm not suggesting they never learn the basics. I'm suggesting they get their feet wet with something that a regular human can understand and then learn from there. I'm a 4 year bitcoiner yet when you said "SPV wallet like Mycellium or Jaxx" I could have been reading German for all I know. Now imagine someone reading that who is actually new to Bitcoin. They would be so turned off so quickly.

I think he means solo mining which is more like a lottery if he discovers a block
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:14:23
CoPay is a great wallet available on chrome that uses a seed passphrase. So you can write down your phrase somewhere safe and you're good for life.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:04:52
WTF why would you downvote this? Are you waiting for Bitcoin to basically die before doing something about it?
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:04:42
And they would have failed as a result.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:20:11
You called it...
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:37:08
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:23:33
That's the beauty of it. You can throw away your computer. As long as you have the passphrase you're good. I would suggest trying it out for yourself first. maybe with a couple cents or whatever. Save your passphrase and delete the app altogether. Import the phrase into another app like on Android or something or reinstall your original app and you'll see everything including your transaction history intact

Holy crap that commercial was bad. I thought the ending was gonna be like "TD Bank is open 24/7" Instead they're open...10 minutes later...

You don't convert your money to USD. You simply spend your btc using a debit card. Coinbase converts money at the point of swipe. There's nothing else you need to do.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:51:00
Well I mean you could call it a paper wallet if you wanted. You could write the passphrase on a piece of paper and throw it in a safe. Main difference is that you're not writing down a private key to an address.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:02:39
Serious question. How would the IRS know anything? Couldn't I just tumble my coins and then sell?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:18:54
Yes first download a wallet to your phone. CoPay is one that works fine. Just make sure you write down your passphrase it generates. If you save your passphrase you can even throw away your phone and your coins will always be safe. 
Now you can go to the ATM and buy some Bitcoin. Basically it will give you a QR code that you can scan to send the coins to your phones wallet. 
As far as Bitcoin balance, that's all in your phones wallet. Unlike a bank, you don't go to an ATM to check your balance. The ATM is essentially just a vending machine and nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:46
Personally I use copay on my phone and on my desktop. Your passphrase can be entered into both and your transactions are always synced. It's a good and safe wallet. They also have it as a chrome extension.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:57:19
You're blaming the user? lol ok. Bitcoin is clearly at fault here for not scaling properly causing fees to be an issue
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:22:54
Thanks for the insightful reply. Serious question, where would one buy Bitcoin if they didn't want to be linked to the police database? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:57:04
Or you know... We could fix bitcoin so it's usable again
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:43:44
They want bitcoin to scale. What on earth is your rationale to not scaling bitcoin. You want it to die?
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:01:12
To actually answer your question: Every 4 years, the amount of Bitcoin that is mined (minted) gets cut in half. So instead of 12.5 Bitcoin being created every 10 minutes, 6.25 Bitcoin will be created every 10 minutes. This goes on until all 21 million coins have been created and then there will never be any more Bitcoin created. 
So basically, Bitcoin gets scarcer every 4 years which means price should theoretically go up over time.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:35:08
Worked for me
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:14:41
In my mind it's an issue. I and many others used to use Bitcoin to buy things but now we can't because of fees. The original concept of Bitcoin was digital cash and right now it's not digital cash at all.

The problem with something like Electrum is that the UI is extremely unfriendly to a regular person. Even for me it's confusing and I'm a 4 year bitcoiner who likes tech. IMO a new user is far more likely to lose coins by trying to fiddle around with their own wallet until they get more familiar with Bitcoin.

Seriously. Why does everyone think banks are going to die with Bitcoin. Banks will store Bitcoin just like any other currency. I'm like you I'd rather them keep my coins safe rather than me writing down my passphrase on a piece of paper in my house where I'll lose it or get robbed.

I get what you're saying, but with your analogy you're basically saying an average person needs to know the ins and outs of the US mint and understand ever little detail about how the money is created, circulated and the study behind it. When in fact, most people just want to buy a cheeseburger.

@_date: 2017-05-09 04:49:13
I'm not against it if you're a pro bitcoiner. But try telling a random person that and they would think you're speaking a different language. My whole point is to ease newcomers in slowly and empathize with them rather than bombard then with geek talk that they don't understand.

You don't have to wait for confirmations. It's nearly impossible to double spend.

Actually there are banks in Bitcoin. Coinbase is technically a bank as they will store your Bitcoin for you.

When you send money from an address (in this case a paper wallet) the remaining balance will be sent to a completely new address leaving nothing left on your paper wallet. Unless you have the private key to this new address you're toast.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:59:27
Except on the rate event that you found a wallet file, it's probably encrypted.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:38:04
I don't understand where people get this idea that you have to wait for it to be confirmed. It's nearly impossible to double spend coins especially for smaller transactions such as meals.

Yes, early adopters would be unbelievably wealthy if Bitcoin takes off. It's estimated that Satoshi has at least 1 million Bitcoin. So that's roughly 4.5% of all Bitcoin that will ever be created
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:52:18
And this is why we need scaling. Users shouldn't have to know or care about fees because they are tiny. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:29:18

Paper wallets are kinda ok, but it's extremely easy to lose all your coins if you send part of your coins to another address. All your remaining balance will be gone forever. Just use a wallet app. Such as copay or jaxx
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:54:37
I can think of a reason. It takes 1 line of code and it would improve their margins. Why wouldn't they add it?
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:34:34
I highly recommend not using Bitcoin core. It's a horrible experience for little gain. I recommend using an HD wallet like CoPay or Jaxx. These wallets give you a passphrase that you simply write down and you're good forever. If you use Bitcoin core you will be syncing transactions for weeks and it's harder to backup. Trust me on this. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:24:14
I remember it hitting $10. I didn't care enough about it to learn what it was at the time. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:38:37
I agree that warning them is good advice, but honestly, telling a newbie to install, sync and learn Bitcoin core is going to make them think Bitcoin is too confusing and worse than traditional money. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:35:16
Why would anyone even think that?
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:14:22
And then turn on logarithmic chart and realize we aren't even in a bubble yet. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:28:59
Send your Bitcoin to a wallet like CoPay or Jaxx where they give you a passphrase. As long as you have the passphrase your bitcoin is safe forever even if the wallet you have goes away or you lose your phone etc.

I think he meant to say credit card fees. And yes that is an insane amount of extra margin for them.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:24:27
It used what's called an HD wallet. Look it up, it's safe. I believe the passphrase is generated locally and you're encouraged to delete the passphrase out of the app once you jot it down. You can even delete the CoPay app and your Bitcoin is still safe. You can even enter that passphrase on a completely different HD wallet app at the same time and have essentially a "synced" wallet in that your transactions and balance are always up to date with each wallet. It's all stored in the passphrase. IMO this is the easiest most user friendly way to secure Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-27 05:06:29
I used to get excited for this kind of news but now that Bitcoin has been stuck in the scaling debate, I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to use bitcoin anymore for stuff like this. I used to use Bitcoin all the time, but now I just hold out because it's a terrible currency anymore for transactions.

OP used to buy drugs on the Silk Road and was using a TOR wallet
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:21:19
Well to be fair, he was right about how Bitcoin is stuck in a stalemate at the moment. Scalability still hasn't been solved yet and thus cannot be used for regular daily transactions. That being said i don't know why anyone would sell all their coins. Bitcoin will get fixed eventually so people can start using it again. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:32:46

@_date: 2013-11-15 04:08:29
Because if you look at prices on a logarithmic scale, you will see that this bubble is not very significant. It's nothing compared to the bubble in 2011 yet it appears much worse because were dealing with big numbers. The price has consistently growing exponentially since inception. So theres really no reason why you would have to wait for a crash, as price has gone up at an incredibly consistent percentage.

I kept responding, I'm very serious about this and that bitcoin would make the transaction process so much smoother and we wouldn't have to exchange identification. Needless to say, he gave up lol.

I don't think you understand rich people. They do not spend all their money. They use their money to invest. They can invest using bitcoin just like dollars.

Log form shows the growth in strictly a percentage base. Any exponential growth chart makes it appear the chart is in a bubble at all times. Log charts display it by actual percentage growth which in bitcoin's case, is an extremely constant exponential growth since inception.

I don't think you understand how mining works. If it gets so difficult to mine that it's not worth it, then people will stop mining from their specific machine. When people stop mining, the difficulty gets easier. Basically if everyone on earth stopped mining, then 1 person could be the only miner and it would be very easy to mine. The system works itself out naturally. There is no need to fear about miners stopping.

Yes, I'm the designer at tinybyte apps. The purpose behind this site was so that you could send bitcoins to someone with a simple and well designed UI. The person receiving the coins may not be that familiar with bitcoin so we thought it was important that they have an easy to use system to claim their coins. When they receive the email, they get a giant input field where they can enter their bitcoin address. This service isn't unique as you said but we thought we could simplify it. Hope this helps.

1. My advice. Understand that your value will rise and drop drastically. Do not sell in these circumstances. Everyone loses when they day trade.
2. As far as price, I would say it's at the high end, wait for a depressed day. Those days happen quite often so you could just wait. Don't rush.
3. Only invest what you are willing to lose. In the end, nobody knows what price will do. We do know however that btc will be worth either zero or a crap ton.

In layman's terms:
Bitcoin is a digital currency. You can exchange it for goods, services, other currency etc. 
Bitcoin is similar to the internet in that there is no central hub. Bitcoin is a network where you can transfer Bitcoin at little to no cost.

"I would imagine not all of bitcoin sales are accounted for"
Actually every bitcoin in existence is accounted for. We know exactly how many have been mined. What we don't know is how many of those coins have been lost forever.

Have them set up an account on Coinbase. Coinbase is one of the most professional looking sites and probably one of the more secure web wallets out there. 
Next have them purchase something small on bitmit.net
Edit: They could also do those "free bitcoin" sites that pay you to look at ads. That's how I originally got my first dust.

The problem with paper wallets is that I could simply write your public key on a new piece of paper and it will verify as having your coin on it. I can now slap a sticker over nothing and tell you the private key is inside.

Yes. the y-axis is price, but exponential growth is hard to view in linear format. Using log displays price in the y-axis in terms of percentage of growth rather than static dollar amounts. 
"percentage of what?"
- The percentage of growth. So if you go from $1 to $2 that is exactly the same as going from $500 to $1000. The percentage is exactly the same in both cases.

Expect it to drop a lot over time. Do not panic sell. New users usually panic sell and lose coins. Just remember that bitcoin will either fail or succeed.

unfortunately most of these are online businesses without brick and mortar locations. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:36:01
The reason the price goes up is because it gets scarcer and scarcer to get your hands on bitcoin. So naturally with supply and demand you get higher prices. Since bitcoin is in it's infancy, the price should only grow by massive amounts. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:03:52

Honestly? Wait it out for a couple weeks first and see where the price levels off. Then buy in. In the long run, the price "should" go up very high or go to zero. I would wait for price to settle back down to a sane price first though. IMO $200-300.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:18:05
So does this mean you don't have an online account with a reputable bank because it might get hacked?

If those coins were being used, then price would drop because of the more supply. They are really just ones and zeros that were lost.

I emailed them about bitcoin donations and they say they are monitoring it but will not be accepting it yet. Not sure why since there's no risk whatsoever on their end.

has been awesome by helping me understand bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:43:03
go on...

You might as well buy 1btc or whatever you can afford to lose. Throw the private key in a safe and come back in 10 years. Could be worth a ton or could be worth 0. Nobody knows.

30% is a safe number to shoot for. But yes, the rest of your cash will end up in the government's hands with sales tax, property tax etc etc.

I like how it's incredibly outdated already.

I support this because my mom was interested in getting some bitcoin and asked what the price was. When I said $130 she backed out. Even though I've told her you don't have to buy a full bitcoin, the psychological barrier is a big problem.

Please read the link. Tesla is not accepting bitcoin. It's just some dude accepting bitcoin to use his home charger.

I would suggest getting yourself set up with a coinbase account. It's user friendly and will be a good way to get your feet wet. You can buy some coins there.

I believe bitcoin will be successful because of all the benefits and ease of transactions in the digital realm. Waiting 4 days to send money simply doesn't cut it when bitcoin sends immediately.

False it shows the price by percentage rather than by price. You can see from the log chart that price has grown by huge percentages and that this latest crash means nothing. Heck look at the previous crashes and tell me they are aren't meaningless
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:53:57
What's the point of redistributing them? 
1. We don't know if they are in cold storage or lost forever. 
2. Redistributing them would create more supply, thus cheaper bitcoin value. 
3. Bitcoins are divisible so theres really no loss since bitcoins will simply be worth more then.

What I do: Trade with people who have good reputation.

If you are unsure if your kid is going to buy crack with it, then i think you have much larger issues you need to deal with. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:31:56
Congrats! However, you probably couldn't have picked a worse time to buy because a crash is imminent. However, when it does crash soon DO NOT SELL. I fell into this exact same scenario during the last crash. I told myself I was going to hold for the long haul, but got nervous because it was my first bubble with bitcoin. Never again

You sir have never used bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:52:08
Kevin actually bought back in after the dip. He tweeted someone about it the other day, but I can't find it anymore. He must have deleted the tweet. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:42:07
Crap. Can someone suggest an alternative?

This is more likely to solidify people's negative view on bitcoin. Things you messed up.
-Point them to coinbase or an online wallet rather than QT. Who wants a beginner to download the blockchain for the next 2 days?
- Don't advertise bitcoin as a get rich scheme

Blame the government not mtgox
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:58:30
The government has already made their own coin. It's called US Dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:24:29
So what you're telling me is that bitcoin normally fluctuates almost 80% in 8 minutes? Very unlikely. Remember, as price goes up, small amounts like $5 USD does not fluctuate much.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have here
