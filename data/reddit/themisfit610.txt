Trading has nothing to do with lightning network. 
When you trade using an exchange you’re using their system. Not the bitcoin network. You only do a bitcoin transaction when you transfer in or out of the Exchange.

Shillary, huh? Good stuff. 
Classic trumpkins talking points. Just endless bagging and misdirection about how “bad” Obama was or Hillary would have been. 
Comments like that aren’t designed to actually make a statement or persuade anyone of anything. They’re meant to make others feel stupid by challenging a point nobody is making. That’s a straw man argument, which is a bully move that lowers the bar and delights idiots because it’s “alpha”. 
You’re right to say the markets are strong. That’s undeniable. Nobody said the markets would have been better under Hillary, but you took it there because it makes you feel powerful, and it shuts up people who won’t stand up for themselves.
You should be ashamed of yourself. This is a perfect microcosm for the race to the bottom that embodies so much of modern politics. You are literally contributing to that. Great job ����

Sounds like too many people and not enough income. I doubt you chose any of this so I’m sorry bro. That’s tough. 
I’m fiendishly unwilling to have any kids or be responsible for anyone for this exact reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:39:01
And that is why we need monero ��
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:06:02
This had nothing to do with ethereum as a currency afaik. Wasn't an exchange hacked?
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:00:02
Them taxes tho. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:04:32
Still a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:20:08
That is not my understanding. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:28:40
Well... there's always monero ;)

Look into bitcoin.tax. They can calculate it all for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:00:42
Exactly. There’s things you can do to reduce your tax burden that are perfectly legal.

Super secure, distributed, free market network for the exchange and storage of value, unaffiliated with any government or corporation, and with guaranteed inflation control. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:31:24
Your example of how money can be taken from people sounds exactly like fiat in a bank. 
The government can seize your assets at any time. You have no recourse. 
With bitcoin and many other cryptos, if your opsec is reasonable, nobody can ever take your coins. Ever. Not sure why you’d think otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:30:59

Maybe he wants to buy property or move some into lower risk investments? Not everyone has to put every cent into crypto. As much as we love it, having a balanced portfolio is always a good idea.

Good. More power to Gemini
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:19:14


Incorrect. I don't use paper wallets so I can't speak to that, but a hardware wallet will generate a set of 25 seed words you're supposed to write down on paper when you set it up. If your wallet is stolen / damaged / otherwise dies, you can just buy another one and restore it using the seed words. Obviously you need to be careful with those seed words. Send multiple copies to people you trust, broken into pieces maybe. A copy in a bank vault, etc.
Even software wallets often also have seed words (e.g. Monero / Aeon reference wallet apps).


Maybe not right now in the USA, sure. I agree it's not a major risk to the vast majority of people, but isn't there something to be said for technology that prevents this? Look at Venezuela. I read all kinds of fascinating stories about Venezuelan people needing dollars to pay for stuff they can't get inside their country, but the government seized the dollars and controls the supply. On top of that, PayPal closes their accounts containing USD and seizes their funds. They have zero recourse.
NOBODY can take their bitcoin. And it doesn't inflate into the ether like Bolivars. Are people using it day in and day out on a large scale? No. But the Internet didn't start that way either.

Bitch please! A single strand of single mode fiber can carry many wavelengths of 100 Gbps Ethernet. 
That’s real scaling. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:01:09
Dude what? Blocks are created every 10 minutes on average by design. That’s absolutely fundamental to the design. When more hashing power is added and the block times go under 10 minutes this is corrected via a difficulty adjustment every two weeks. 
Yes it does take about 10 minutes to get a confirmation of your transaction included in the block. That much is true. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:28:17
That's not how it works in the US. If you sell, you owe tax. Period. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:40:13
Maybe in the short term, sure. Even in the remotely possible version of the future where this happens, I’m bullish. The “illegal tradings” as you say are significantly valuable.

So... dude is recording satellite tv. 
What does that have to do with satellite internet?
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:38:22
Except they don’t anymore. How many people do business in cash under the table every time? Especially in developing countries? Bitcoin is perfect there, especially when inflation of the local fiat is a thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:17:23
Yeah but people have to care / use them. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:53:07
If the queue of pending blocks grows then why doesn’t the mempool keep expanding? It oscillates, sure, but burns down regularly. This will only improve as Segwit adoption grows. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:10:57
Yep true statement 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:47:06
Except it can literally be used to pay for goods and services directly. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:23:44
Good luck banning bitcoin. Sure, bans would make it harder to exchange but not impossible. If anything it would only drive local premiums. 
How would you propose making bitcoin not decentralized? An attacker would need the majority of hashing power. Sure the NSA could pull this off but Venezuela? Argentina? Brazil? Consider me skeptical. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:14:21
You took that first quote completely out of context. That’s disingenuous. 
If you’re not into bitcoin that’s cool. No big deal. I just think it’s a fascinating innovation that’s disruptive and has a huge potential upside. I put what I could lose into it and a couple other cryptos (Monero and Aeon) and I’ve seen about 6x return in a year.  It could all blow up tomorrow but it’s a fun thing to get into and it’s legit made me enough for a down payment on a house in LA. I have zero regrets and will probably hodl crypto forever. 
I’d really suggest anyone who’s even kinda interested to put $100 or whatever you can just shrug off into it. You never know. 10 years from now?
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:39:36
I literally said
 


Your response is asinine. I'm done here.

Dank AF. Totally legit 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:56:08
Except it’s not a stock. It’s technically a currency but doesn’t really behave like either. It’s digital gold IMO. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:10:30
What does that even mean? People trade currencies all the time. People “invest” in dollars when their local currency is shit. Your position doesn’t make sense. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:55:34
Yep. Monero / aeon etc solve this. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:28:36
Even that technically counts. You're gaining value. Every trade has a loss or a taxable profit. Period. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:04:02
Everybody always wants to become a quick millionaire. That never changes. 
Bitcoin CAN be used to buy things,  but you’re right. Most people are putting money in and hodling because they think the value will go up over time. I’m one of those people. 
I also believe that bitcoin has an intrinsic value as a decentralized, secure, deflationary store of value, free from government control. Look in countries experiencing heavy inflation and ask yourself if they want bitcoin. Of course they do. Hence, demand. Hence value. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:02:55
The market cap is small enough that whales can indeed manipulate the price. 
However a really important thing to realize with bitcoin is the finite supply. This is a key differentiator between it and fiat. You can never just “make more” bitcoin. You can always just make more dollars. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:13:03
amen. 
That’s why I have a decent chunk in crypto but a lot more in index funds and a bunch more just in cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:05:05
We shall see. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:28:38
There is no way Venezuela has nuclear weapons. I don’t think anyone seriously thinks they do. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:04:04
Good orbital mechanics there. Don’t thrust towards the thing you want to hit, thrust towards where it will be when you get there!!
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:02:09
Sure but I don’t see why that’s a problem. It’s gaining value because people buy it. It’s different from tulips or a pyramid scheme because it actually can be used as currency, and the fundamentals of it being secure, decentralized, deflationary, and outside government control make it valuable. 
It could all blow up, sure. But it’s difficult to classify and can be used for many things.
The fact that I could hypothetically cross the border of any country with internet access and carry with me the keys to my entire net worth simply by memorizing a private key or set of seed words utterly free of any government controls goes a long way with me, even if that’s not what people are using it for. I think in a decade there will be uses for bitcoin
and other cryptos that we haven’t even dreamed up today, much like the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:19:37
Yeah. Thank you. Jesus.

@_date: 2017-07-04 18:49:11
My understanding is that the chain with the minority of hashing power will obviously have horrendously long block times for awhile until the difficulty scales down. 
I'm not sure how long is too long, and I'm not sure what happens eventually 
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:12:01
But only if miners actually support it too... right?
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:35:32
Yeah but that's not how you'd talk about the buying and selling. You'd still use the price of a full coin as a reference. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:52:37

Great read!
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:29:59
Well, I'd argue that peering agreements are a bit different from auto scaling cloud compute, wouldn't you agree?
In any case, you're suggesting that Coinbase runs their own hardware in a colo? Certainly possible and I'd agree for lots of workloads likely cheaper (provided you have the expertise and capital), but cloud is just everywhere now. Are you sure about this?
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:01:56
I didn't know that! :)
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:22:22
I guess I prefer how they have multiple trading options, e.g. Market vs limit vs auction etc 
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:39:37
Sure I know how live migrations of VMs work, but in a truly cloud centric app you have tons of instances behind load balancers. You add more when you need more capacity and then you scale down when you're done. The state and disk of a given instance shouldn't matter.
Kunernetes and GAE etc take this to the next level. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:19:58
Interesting. Yeah I just used a constant percentage to have a simple example.
I can't imagine it being smooth sailing, that's for sure. I definitely hope the majority signals right away or soon thereafter but like you said, the miners really just want the fees. We will see. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:08:12
Are they signaling for segwit or for BIP148?
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:15:56
Personal preference mostly. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:24:51


@_date: 2017-06-09 05:17:33
Or Gemini. I prefer Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:14:48
Why sell for Tether? You still have to pay taxes 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:38:56
Of course. You use auto scaling groups. Or something like Kubernetes. It's really really cool. 
Writing good code that scales with the infrastructure then becomes quite a challenge :)
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:28:48
Preach the truth, brother. I also like Monero's little bro Aeon. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:31:10
Right. Monero is good for that :D
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:04:02
They use auto scaling cloud servers. I can basically guarantee that. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:08:50
I'm really just trying to get a sense for what different people say. I've been doing my own research of course.
Why do you think it's likely most miners will signal Segwit? I haven't seen anything that leads me to believe this but I really really hope you're right?
In terms of incentives I was thinking more along the lines of "slow block times mean we can only mine the highest fees, so maybe it's worth mining the Segwit chain" in my specific example. I was looking for validation on that.
