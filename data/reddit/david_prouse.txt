In all seriousness, a summit wouldn't do that much. Both sides have already made their arguments fairly well and by now the miners should be able to decide if they want to increase the limit or not.

I agree with you, but you should change all the "probably irrelevant" and such statements with "completely irrelevant". That's a whole lot of words for a person that only knows that Bitcoin is somewhat like bittorrent. (I kid, you obviously know a little bit more than that. But just a bit)

Jesus! dude, all the blockchain does in this case is store some hashes in a secure public ledger, that's it. You can do the same with a regular database for way cheaper, with the same SHA256 security, and in a private way (because businesses like to keep their information private).
And yes, even with the blockchain system you'll also need to pay cost to maintain or pay for server development, deployment, testing, mirroring, high-availability, data backup, bandwidth, security, cross-border regulations, etc., etc... because all you're doing is storing some hash, while the actual info has to be somewhere outside the blockchain (so guess what? you have to download a database anyways and handle both systems, joy!), or are you proposing to store all that there too?
Which brings me to my main point: How would it ever be possible for the blockchain to handle that traffic?  Like, you want to forward every freaking small business transaction to a global ledger? do you have any idea of the magnitude of that task? 
The avengers movies sell upwards of 100 million tickets. The current blockchain would take months to handle a single movie. (please don't answer with "future theoretical developments make this a non-issue" because that is extremely disingenuous)
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:24:16
That's 5 bits per day at ANY coin price. 500 satoshi. also known as "pretty close to the dust limit"
But if you mean US dollars, well lets be extremely generous and say that tomorrow bitcoin suddenly is worth a hundred times more, which would cause this subreddit to go crazy with joy... That's still 10 cents a day. Peanuts.
A thousand times? one dollar a day. 
Ten thousand times? Hey suddenly you could probably pay your heating bill. No wait, because there would be a ridiculous arms race and people would suddenly buy heaters in Ecuador and Egypt.
So yeah, for any *reasonable* price expectation this doesn't look that good.

@_date: 2015-05-01 14:10:35
Man, that was quite the weasely response.
1) First, such an attack would most likely be done to force a double spend but to paralyze -by mining empty blocks- the network. An enormous double-spend can be theoretically be dealt with by rolling back the blockchain but the paralysis would destroy trust.
2) There is nothing you can do about it. Andreas pretends that the other users can just ban a pseudonymous attacker from bitcoin after 10 minutes of the attack. Bullshit, you need a patch to do so, for people to download it, and then the attacker can just change credentials and try again.
That was really disingenuous.

It is not a narrative. It happens. Often. You can do a search in this same sub for "stolen credit cards, purse.io" to get a ton of examples.
You guys are still small and hopefully have not been hit by this yet but you will, so I sure hope you're prepared. Having an irreversible, semi-anonymous way to extract money with fraudulent transactions is extremely tempting to carders.
You have a point about Raise.com and similar, but there are some big differences between them and you guys. First, because all their transactions can be followed and reversed, they have much lower risk. And second, their discounts are nowhere as good. (Starbucks is at 7% right now in Raise.com).
So you're running a smaller business, with more risk involved, and giving a better discount that the big guys so I think it is not that weird for me to be skeptic about the whole thing. 
But it would be nice to be wrong about this, so I hope your company does well. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:18:22
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:53:14
Yes, all those unwanted starbucks giftcards. (You realize that unwanted gift cards for successful businesses do not exist, right? because they are worth zero until activated. And activated cards with some spare dollars left that people get rid of would not be able to support any real volume anyhow)
Again, people buy the gift cards using stolen CCs and then re-sell the gift cards for cheap using fold or whatever. That's where the discount comes from.

Yeah, it's not like the huge mining farms that provide the backbone of bitcoin are easily findable, and centralized in two very known countries, one of which also builds most of the mining rigs.
Like, let's be serious, if -say- the Chinese government wanted to squash bitcoin (because too many people are evading currency controls with its help) they could do it at any time they wanted by first crushing the mining farms (which you can bet will be intimidating as all fuck) and then launching a 51% attack with the farms they just acquired for the total cost of pretty much zero (edit: or just do nothing and leave the frisbee on the roof to be extra-annoying). 
If that's not enough for 51% then they can tell the ASIC manufacturers to build a few extra ones for the cause, for cheap.
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:26:02
Those digital currencies are already here. They are called Euro, Dollar, Peso, etc. Their digital versions and infrastructure are developed both for a profit motive and national interests. The main difference is that the banks or whomever develops them doesn't want to profit mainly from the currency itself but from the services and products they provide for it. That's his point. 
Anyways, if you think about it, right now bitcoin is *not* a currency, just a (mostly dollar-based) payment system coupled with a digital commodity. Pretty much 99% of everything you can buy with bitcoin is actually denominated in dollars or other fiat, the actual currencies used in the transaction, bitcoin is just a way to move those dollars around.
As you yourself said, you're more interested in it as a store of value and speculative investment, not as a currency to actually -you know- do currency stuff with, like buying eggs and milk.

Let's say that 1/10 of human beings live in a place where you need to use a heater during the winter. If everybody got a bit-miner (which is the optimal, most desirable case for decentralization) that's like 700 million people that would be sharing the soon to be 25-coin per block reward.
My math may be wrong but that's would be like 5 bits per day for each person *if* there are no other miners competing.
So you would be running a technologically advanced, incredibly complex and delicate set of chips doing specialized math instead of, you know, a sturdy, relatively simple hunk of iron that burns kerosene or gas (or an equivalently simple electric heater) just to get (in the best case scenario) that sweet, sweet tenth of a US cent daily.
I like bitcoin but does this sound reasonable to you? truly?
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:38:41
But I do know something about you? Specifically what you have written (which is as very superficial analysis with lots of tinfoil speculation). 
On the other hand, I am not the one saying that "people" don't understand that bitcoin is a currency, or that governments don't understand it. That's what I wanted to point out, you don't know either, but base your theory on that.
Then, you write "While we watch the price of bitcoin decline, we're all asking why". Again, you're putting words in the mouth of a group while -at the same time- recognizing that you don't understand something that is really, really simple to comprehend.
So, taking all that into consideration, I can come to the more-or-less informed conclusion that your perspective is dumb.
Edit: As for your question, the people who benefit the most from the price dropping are the guys who manage to get out as soon as possible. Why? because the price is going down!
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:27:11
If we don't value fiat, then they'll pay them in bitcoin, gold or whatever.
Good for you to try to whatever you can to stop what you think is wrong but such simplistic views are not going to help you convince anybody (and you alone won't be able to do jack shit).

When George Soros came to my mom's basement and told me:
"David, we're afraid, we're powerless, you're our only hope. We need your shill powers to deal a mortal blow to the menace (this is how they call bitcoin). I'm begging you, help me one last time" 
I asked for a day to meditate about it and told myself, and I remember this as well as the day of my first-and-only kiss:
"If the price actually did crash down to sub-$100, wouldn't I be strongly tempted to buy some bitcoin? And what would the resulting cognitive dissonance do to me? Would I not become a bitcoin fan at that stage?"
And said.... naaaaahhhhh. Georgie boy, bring on those millions! I am expecting a big performance bonus.

The blockchain is not a magical source of security that is impposible to emulate. All that liftmaster has to do is use SHA256 and that's it.

Yup, that's precisely what he did. He responded to "bitcoin is wasteful" with "but VISA is too!" without taking into account that VISA does waaaaaay more than anything bitcoin does (at this moment) and didn't even realize that the article is about sustainability (waste).
Because the main thing is that CC's fees are precisely that, fees. You buy something with your CC, pay some fees, and somebody pockets that money. On the other hand, the vice article was talking about the waste of the current bitcoin ecosystem. You pay for something with bitcoin, a shitload of coal is burnt for no real reason (the network is over-secure right now), some of the money ends at the miner, some at the coal company, but a big portion goes *poof*.

The basic ideas is as follows (someone correct me if I'm wrong):
You send the hash of the thing you want to have a record of to factom (plus some extra metadata). Then they take all the hashes they receive every 10 minutes, concantenate them, and hast *that*, producing a hash of all the hashes. This final hash is then stored in the blockchain.
They are not actually storing your data in the blockchain, just hashes. These hashes can be then used to prove that you have not tampered with a document, but you must store that document elsewhere.

You don't seem to understand that, in order to recover from such a deficit, Greece (both the state and the citizens) has to make deep structural changes. I am not in favor of their austerity measures, in fact I think they will be counter-productive, but the kind of changes that will actually make a difference are not something in the level of anything that merchants can do, they could all switch to bitcoin and have a thriving bitcoin environment tomorrow and it wouldn't mean shit, the country would still be screwed.
Also, the merchants have no problem right now selling their wares -in Euros- to anybody interested. The capital controls prevent them from moving Euros outside Greece, not merchandize. So, feel free to put your wallet where your mouth is and buy as much greek shit as possible right the fuck now, don't wait until they switch to bitcoin, help them. If you are not willing to do so that means that you're not actually interested in helping the greeks, but are instead interested in helping bitcoin. (nothing wrong with that, just don't pretend it is the first when it is actually the second).

If bitcoin dropped to 1 then the miners (who have invested a considerable amount of resources in specialized single-use hardware) would crash and burn. Rational actors will not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in mining when the rewards are a mere $3600 daily, and the network is still too small to survive on transaction fees alone.
Thus, the security of the protocol would be heavily compromised and bitcoin would lose trust, which would drive the price even lower into a death spiral.

My point is that bitcoin was developed to allow people to transact in a trustless way.
If you put somebody in the middle then there is no point in using bitcoin, it is much cheaper to use any of a million alternatives to handle a ledger that are faster, more efficient, and equally as secure (since they use the same cryptography). I am not pretending it is bitcoin, just that it takes bitcoin and does nothing with it.
Are the micro-transactions done in the blockchain? nope (they would clog it almost instantly if this was the case)
Does the included miner pay for itself or produce any non-trivial amount of bitcoin? nope.
Are you in control of your money? nope.
So yeah, you spend $400 to get access to what?
Oh, and the stated point of the device is as an all-in-one package that will let you set up shop and offer services which will be paid with bitcoin micro-transactions (but they are not actually bitcoin transactions).

Technology can't be good or bad, but it can be useful or useless. A hammer made with ballons is not very useful. Sure, you can use it to entertain children but it won't be a very good hammer.
The 21 bitcoin computer doesn't seem very useful right now. It is just a rPi connected to a small miner so where is the extra value that justifies the price tag? In the software? We have close to no info about it. And, if the software is the key, then what is the point of the $400 toy computer? For that amount of money you can buy an actual one.

Yeah. the idea is that the node owner decides what to publish and people will flock to the nodes that they like.
So, for a practical example of the archetypical use case for this kind of technology, a node owner could decide to filter the child porn so that only boys are present, while another one could include only toddlers. Then users would be able find and pay for their favorite cp and everybody would get a cut, including the DATT company. But since the system is decentralized everything would be perfectly fine and I am 100% sure that they won't run into any trouble (mainly because it is vaporware)

So, basically you have no idea of what you're talking about. And you don't have the decency to spend the 30 seconds required to educate yourself about simple topics.
This is why people downvote you.
And yes, you have no fucking idea about any of this because, otherwise, you would immediately realize, without checking any numbers, that the inflation in the years leading to the great *depression* was ... very damn low or even negative. That's what happens during a depression.
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:54:09
Yeah, turn it on if you want (BTW, you'll probably lose money by doing so, but it's fine if you do it to increase the security) but, as a whole, if mining is producing $3600 dollars worth of bitcoin a day then the amount of mining resources will trend downwards, to whatever it is that requires $3600 in electricity and hardware depreciation.
Now, since bitcoin is by nature weak against a 51% attack then anybody who wanted to mess with the system would just have to invest a small (relatively) amount of money to do so.
Bitcoin was able to grow from pretty much zero because a bunch of nerds were mining for the heck of it and it was something interesting and new but now, as a somewhat mature technology, you cannot go back to those pricepoints and have it survive.
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:27:28
No, the money you're supposed to receive from all the micro-transactions when you sell a service. You know, what is supposed to be the whole point of the device?
Since it is off-chain how do you know that you're actually getting what you're supposed to be getting? They could tell you whatever the fuck they want, say that people offered less, skim on some payments, etc. Isn't bitcoin supposed to be trustless? you're placing an awful lot of trust into a central company.

Proof-of-reserve only proves that you can access the coins, not that you're the only one who can, which is one of the main features of bitcoin. So yeah, you can show your proof-of-reserve all you want and still be robbed blind the next day (or maybe you yourself stole them, who knows?)

Took me 20 seconds. Now, do you think that one day the depression just happened? The inflation was low or negative pretty much during the whole 20s (which I think even you would agree are the years that lead to the 30s).
Seriously dude, I am being an ass because you're being a moron.
BTW, in those tables you can also see what *real* high inflation looks like.

So a thousand people send 1 cent every minute to this single trader. That's what? 16 transactions per second? Bitcoin cannot handle that and won't be able to do for a long while. And this is for a single trader.

Computers can't hold BTC either. The coins themselves do not actually exist as anything but an entry on a distributed ledger that is not stored in your machine.
So, when you say that you "hold" BTC in your computer it's actually just the credentials to access an account. This can also be done with fiat.
(You can also stash bills inside your computer case)

Then go ahead! There is a market for all kinds of weird stuff. You can buy egg whites in a bottle. It costs like 10 times the price of just getting some eggs and tastes like shit but some people seem to like the product.
Like, lets divide the end users in 2 rough groups, developers and regular users, and see if the 21 computer is a good idea for them.
Regular users: Even this subreddit agrees that this is not a product for them. But I'm sure my mom will say she enjoys her 21 computer (while being not-so-secretly disappointed at me)
Bitcoin Developers: My guess is that they have the know-how to a) buy bitcoin and b) install the library on their computer. So, if they do so, they'll end up with a better development kit and more coins to play around.
So what is this product for? Is it bitcoin developers who don't want to or don't know how to buy bitcoin? Maybe for people that can't crack an egg open?

No. Computers cannot actually hold either (electronic) fiat or btc since they are actually stored in a database you don't control. The distributed part is important because, even if you have a copy of it in your computer, you don't actually "have" the database.

There is no reason. Credit cards are a mature technology and have lots of advantages over bitcoin at this time. Things could change in the future but, right now, they are superior.
A lot of people ITT argue that the fees that the processor charge get transferred to you as higher price, which is a simple argument for boneheaded simpletons. Studies (and not only the ones paid by the CC companies) have shown time and again that people spend a lot more when using CC than cash or other payment types. This increase means that, even after the fees, the store will make more money than by not using credit cards. That, in turn, means that they can lower their prices.
But of course, they will only lower their prices if it makes sense to do so. And the same would be true if they took bitcoin.

Yeah, the parents want to control where the dollars are spent because they are afraid that the young fellas will use them to buy drugs (among other things, but drugs are the big one).

They don't have to break the internet to monitor a freaking *public ledger* and act accordingly. You can transfer all the bitcoins you want but -in the end- unless your objective is to see some numbers grow (go play cookie clicker) you (as in the physcal you, who is located in a country) can be traced when you actually exchange them. You are under the delusion that we do not have physical bodies (or something similarly crazy)  and that countries are dumb enough to not be able to deal with a public ledger, of all things.
Yes, it can be the defacto payment solution for all programmers and be taxed by each country as such. Some will tax it more heavily, some won't, thus it is not country agnostic.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:46:22
No, if you check my brief post history you'll notice that, while I mostly post snarky comments I do not have anything against bitcoin itself, just some of the people who post in this sub.
Now, there is a big difference between people sincerely asking to pay with PayPal or whatever because it is convenient for them and people asking the same to proselytize. One is fine, the other is annoying. The guys who ask to pay with paypal, Mexican pesos, or whatever are not trying to increase the adoption rate of their chosen form of payment, they just want to pay with what they have. Now, plenty of people in this thread want to do just that but a metric shitload don't plan to actually buy anything and just want bitcoin to spread and, unfortunately, since the users in here are mostly nerds with little social skills (but not me! I am suave as hell. Or so my mom says) they go at it in the worst (read annoying-as-fuck) ways.
Of course, not everybody is like that, InsanelySexy's approach is a fine one:
"I think it's very powerful to simply ask nicely, "Do you guys take Bitcoin?". And leave it at that. "
But then, immediately after, you get thouliha completely misunderstanding the point, even if it seems at first like he gets it:
"This is the best answer. Its polite, simple, to the point, and it lets merchants discover it for themselves.
If they answer 'no, what's that?', the best reply would be, 'it's a form of payment where you have no fees, unlike the 3% that credit cards take. I can help you get set up accepting it if you like.'
(how do you properly quote in reddit anyways?)
Lets ignore the lies about the fees, since there *are* fees, and instead focus on this random stranger who is going on and on about payment processors and offering some service to me. What's up with this freak? Is that a Fedora?
And that's just a written comment. You know that in real life the guy is going to talk on and on about mathematical hashes, proof-of-work, Satoshi!, taxes, charge-backs, and Mace Windu.
And don't get me started on the guys who go "Do you guys offer a discount for paying with Bitcoin?". Nope, are you going to buy anything *at all* you strangely smelling person?

You know, while I do like bitcoin I also do troll this place from time to time because, well, you guys have some really big misconceptions about how the world works.
For instance, you mention that bitcoin allows developers to create country-agnostic apps, which is true... right now. But do you honestly believe that countries, freaking *countries* will just go "welp, I guess we cannot tax those transactions. Oh well, nothing to do here!". Fuck no. No matter how incredible your technology is (it could be magical) at the end of the chain of transactions there is some flesh-and-bones person, who is located somewhere under the direct jurisdiction of a country.
If bitcoin (hopefully) becomes big one day, it will certainly not be country agnostic. Want to buy some American shit from Argentina? Well, better cough up 50% extra. Thank you very much.

Yes. And at the same time your computer doesn't hold the bitcoins. Otherwise they couldn't be transferred by anybody who knows your credentials from anywhere in the world without any access to your computer.
Just ask BitPay. Somebody stole a lot of bitcoin from them but, since the coins were not actually stored in their datacenter (because conceptually you cannot store a distributed virtual good in a single place, otherwise it wouldn't be distributed). Their insurance agency refused to pay because, since the coins weren't actually *in* the datacenter they were not technically stolen as defined by their contract (the insurance dudes are huge weasels but they are right, as bitpay discovered).

BTW... Price has very little to do with the viability of most currencies, that's right. But bitcoin behaves more like a commodity and, for a commodity, price has everything to do with vitality.
Just like low oil prices can spell doom for oil-producing companies, low BTC prices can destroy the miners, which are the backbone of the system. Yes, eventually the difficulty will adjust but the harm is already done.
