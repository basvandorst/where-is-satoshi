* Coinbase has always had access to forked coins since they hold the private keys
* Coinbase has never "supported" the fork
* BCH spikes and BTC starts trending downward yesterday night
* Coinbase "coincidentally" announces support today and trading goes live 20 FUCKING MINUTES AFTER THEY ANNOUNCE IT
* I know some people are getting their Coinbase forked coins but rest assured Coinbase also holds quite a bit of them.
* FOMO goes into overdrive
* BTC dump for BCH

It should be noted that this is the amount to mine 1 bitcoin worth of reward in 1 day. Not the amount of hashing power required to process a 1 BTC transaction. That said I was getting around 1mBTC per day a month ago. Pay rate has gone up since and I'm doing a bit over 1.5mBTC with just 4x1070s. I have about 1600 in that rig. So without bothering into trying to get more efficient. 
* 1000mBTC/1.5mBTC = 667 rigs needed 
* 667*1600=1,066,666
 
I'm only running 4 cards but can easily add a few more to the rig. I Also have some asic miners that are more efficient but they are harder to source. If youre doing this though it would definitly be worth it. There is a few things more to note like trying to source 2500+ video cards without inflating the market value. Also adding that much hashing power is sure to lower the reward. This is mining alt coins and exchanging rewards to btc. Also with that much hashing power you might want to look into trying to make your own pool and trying to find blocks of less popular alt coins on your own. Youd also need 16000 kWh per day. So a a few grand in electricity every day. Then you'd probably need a small staff to make sure all the rigs are running at full potential. Like I said there are more ways to make this more efficient which anyone dropping this sort of money would definitely do.

Alternate coins. Unfortunately (or fortunately for you since you didn't lose any money in it) the largest noob mining service was hacked earlier this month and lost 70 million+ and is still down so it's a bit more involved but not too bad. Coins are mined by algorithms. Now 1 algorithm can be used by multiple different coins keep that in mind.
Basically you have GPU mining which is cheaper to get into since you can start with as little as 1 GPU it's also more robust since you can mine many different algorithms and if everything crashes you still have a GPU that's worth something to gamers. Then you have asic mining which are more efficient, usually bring in more money but have a more limited life cycle. These are hardware specific to a single algorithm so once that coin stops being profitable you are left hoping a new coin takes it's place but that's likely to get the attention from all the other asic miners leaving you with diminish returns much faster. Basically you have robust vs efficient. If you want more into on alternates pick a good GPU and look into mining subs (the service that was hacked) has plenty of good info on alternate mining services now that nicehash is down. You can also look at mining for specific coins like ZEC,ETH, VERT or pool services like If you go to whattomine.com you can get a pretty good idea of what hardware will pull. Keep in mind as more people jump in the profits will go down so the profits you see are higher than what you'll be pulling. The plus side is coins are going up so you can make more if you just hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:37:36
Honestly I'd never make it past a million. Whenever I hit that I would pull most if not all of it. Maybe let it ride enough to cover taxes but after I'd be out. I couldn't deal with the constant stress.

It would be hard without dropping the price. I wouldn't do more than a couple at a time. Maybe hit up a big exchange in person and try to cut some deal in person for the keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:14
I know technically you did own them but they held the keys so they could have easily moved them before withdrawals. I thought this would be the case (letting people have their coins regardless of BTC withdrawals) but the way they rolled this out seemed a bit fishy. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:44:14
Geez I wonder what people are going to do.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:38:29
Could they be fudging the numbers to prevent bots from causing 4-5k dips in 30 seconds like they did with the BCASH clusterfuck? Are the numbers high or lower the actual? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:05:49
What if you only pull what you initially invested but keep the gains stored. I.e. if you bought 1 BTC  waited till it hit 20k then withdrew .5btc (for 10k)? Do you calcute how much percentage you needed initially to get you to .5btc and pay on those gains or does it not count into you widthdrawl more than you initially bought?

If he's sipping the koolaid hard enough to make his boss pay him in btc there really isn't a reason for DCA. Either way he could do this with cash if needed. Unless he doesn't have a phone, utilities, car or other services there is no way even half of his bills can be paid in btc. Best case scenario it's only slightly more inconvenient with no upside. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:55:11
Let's say he has order financial investments that are currently tied up. Best case scenario he has spare money and can afford to stash the BTC. This is stupid because putting that money into BTC now will likely yield bigger gains than the biweekly payouts. Lets say he doesn't have money and will just be converting back what he needs. This is also dumb because fees for converting BTC to cash quickly are a lot higher than the fees to convert cash into BTC instantly. Coinbase even lets you access it instantly if you buy often enough and if not you still lock in the price. The 1.5% is substantially less than you're losing by getting paid biweekly anyway. Unless he's looking to just duck taxes but in that case just take cash. There is no upside to getting paid in a less flexible and acceptable method of currency. Also I'll eat John McAfees dick if this story is true.

You can try selling high and buying dips but you'll lose more often than not. Even if you break even on price you fall behind on fees.  You either pull out for good or ride it out. It might take a bit to get back to the ATH though.

Seriously how much does he get paid? You can buy 20K+ a week. You can easily buy every couple of weeks and still have the flexibility of having currency literally every business in the area takes. If you buy enough coinbase lets you have your bitcoin instantly. Not that hard to set up autobuys and the fees are pretty much a wash with the volatility of the market anyway. Then he has to pay to transfer money back for the places that don't take BTC and if he set money aside for this it's money he could have put in BTC ahead of time and made more. Basically he negotiated to get paid in a more inconvenient way. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:56:04
This adds an extra step to paying all his bills. How convenient.

Yeah. I lost some money on the nicehash hack but honestly they couldn't have made it easier to get into mining. All you needed was a bitcoin wallet, download a program, put in your wallet address and hit go. Well there was benchmarking the first run but the program took care of that for you. It was super easy. Not sure if I'd still be doing it if it wasn't that easy to start. That being said it's profitable and definitely worth the research if you're interested.

Oh shit looks like it's back tomorrow. Just know you're walking in after 70 million dollar clusterfuck that half the user base still thinks was an inside job. I'd look at the subteddit. There is still a lot of unknowns in terms or profitability. They lost a ton of people a boat load of money and have been vague about repayment. Honestly stopped paying attention a few days ago.

Well shit. Looks like social engineering hacks. Just tried the coinbase "lost my authenticator" shortcut and it just gives the option to sms so I guess the authenticator isn't any more secure. I suppose it's a good thing I move everything offline as soon as it clears then but that sucks.

The D3 over saturated the market with miners and a lot of people are getting out of it since it's not as profitable. Not sure how that will affect it down the line. I'd imagine if enough people leave profitably should go back up but I'm not as optimistic for dash.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:51:59
Alt coins dropping from people buying BTC. After the fork people will balance it out and the alt coins will go back up. People will dump BTC prefork and scoop up the lower alts before they shoot up. The play there is that the forked coins wont be worth as much as the alt coins surge after people come back. Not sure if this is popular enough to make a dent but I've seen the suggestion quite a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:46:07
Depends on your metric. If you're talking 0-60 or redlight racing then yes. There are a few other things Tesla takes like cost, practicality and giant center display. If you put the Tesla on a track with curves it's going to get spanked by a Focus RS (TBF it's a nice car). If you're talking curb appeal, interior quality, sound, overall performance, looks then the Lambo is better and it's not even close. I thank Tesla for all they are doing even though I don't own one but in 20 years the world will be flooded with self driving electric cars. The Lambo will stand the test of time.

@_date: 2017-11-07 18:13:42
Right but prices are already down for B2X and it's looking like ~1k at fork. So even if we stay fairly steady and it forks at ~7400 then drops to about ~7k you're looking at a gain a bit over 8% if you sell off right away. Very achievable with the 2 largest alt coins. Obviously just speculation it could very well hit closer to 8k and forked coins could stay closer to 1.5k then you're looking at 18% bump. That's being generous and even then if you notice the increase from the fork best case scenarios isn't nearly as big as the jump we've seen from people buying in leading up to the fork. It looks like the real gains have already been had at least for this fork. This is what would lead people to jump to alts then move back to BTC after it drops post fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:26:06
