Besides, even if it’s all gambling, there’s no guarantee it will end soon.

Happy to explain my friend. 
A company like Coinbase makes its money selling coins. It doesn’t care which ones you buy. It now has to invest time and ergo money into implementing segwit, so Bitcoin as a brand can prosper. Coinbase won’t make any more money by doing so. 
Bigger blocks (up to a point) can easily be run on an average home computer. We don’t need 1gb blocks, but anyone claiming we can’t go to 2 or 4 with current tech, PLUS THE FACT THAT LIGHTNING WILL NEED IT TO INCREASE ANYWAY, isn’t paying attention.

Exactly. But Bitcoin is meant to be decentralised, no dependent on some centralised institutions acting against their own self interest. So instead of a decentralised solution like bigger blocks, we’re now at the mercy of Coinbase playing nice.

Research in this space does not give anyone the ability to predict the future. Pricing in this market is often very irrational and isn’t based on what the best tech is or anything of that nature. 
Pretending you know what will be priced higher in 12 months is claiming you can predict the behaviour of 7 billion people; there’s nothing more irrational than claiming to be able to do that. 
I have marked your words and will return to them in 12 months.

Here’s what I don’t get: how can it be considered insider trading by knowing that Coinbase was going to list a new coin?
Half of r/bitcoin was cheering at the thought of Coinbase listing it because they believed listing it was going to tank the price as everyone could finally dump their free coins. 
No one honestly knew whether listing the coins was going to spike the price or collapse it, so IMO purchasing BCH a day before the listing was very risky. It’s not like people had material information about Facebook accepting it as a payment platform inside messenger. 
The insider trading had nothing to do with the craziness that went on on Coinbase in the moments BCH came online. That appeared to me to be the confluence of two factors: not enough liquidity, and whales trying to pump up the price. 
Frank’s neighbour’s cousin’s mate who heard from a friend that Coinbase was listing BCH soon was not the reason for the opening day debacle on Coinbase. 
If you want to claim “insider trading” should be stopped, then the next step is for everyone to have full public disclosure over what coins they own, just like all share holdings are a matter of public record. 
Don’t support this insider trading narrative if you don’t want legislation demanding all ownership of crypto-assets be a matter of public record. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:23:38

Spend a few months learning about Bitcoin first. Read the whitepaper, then everything you can get your hand on re Bitcoin. Make sure you read Mastering Bitcoin and The Bitcoin Standard. 
Download Bitcoin Core and buy a few $ worth of BTC on Coinbase. Send it to yourself. Create a paper wallet. Play with that. Try a hardware wallet out like the Ledger Nano S. 
After you’re well informed, and very familiar with how Bitcoin actually works  look at your investment needs, like how long you can tie the money up for, and weigh up the likelihood of what you think the value of Bitcoin will be in the future. 
Don’t rely on the advice of randoms on Reddit. Although this random redditor is telling you not to rely on random redditor’s advice so my logic is circular but hopefully you’ll understand what I’m saying. 
It’s nice that we’re not in the middle of a crazy bull run, so now is a great time to learn about Bitcoin without feeling like you’re going to miss a 100% price increase if you wait 12 hours. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:54:31
Happy to try and explain. It’s the most interesting and important factor about Bitcoin and the one thing that in my mind makes it a good long term opportunity. 
Computers perform a computational task (mining) in order to compete for the right to add a block of transactions to the existing chain. [This video is fantastic]( at explaining the process.
When a miner creates a block they grant themselves some brand new Bitcoins, along with the transaction fees for any transactions they include in the block. When bitcoin started, it was 50 new coins. This is known as the block subsidy. The block subsidy combined with the transaction fees is known as the block reward. 
The block subsidy, halves every 210,000 blocks. 
The bitcoin protocol is designed for blocks to be created every 10 minutes, so in theory the halving happens every 4 years. 
It’s not exactly that as you will learn in time for reasons I won’t go into.
There have so far been 2 halvings. We went from 50 to 25, then to 12.5
In less than 2 years the next halving will drop the block subsidy to 6.25. 
My figures earlier of 1800 new coins per day is the block subsidy expressed as a daily figure. i.e. 12.5 x 6 (blocks per hour) x 24 (hours per day) = 1800. 
One day, in 120 years or so, there will be no more new coins issued to miners, and instead they will only receive the transaction fees in the block reward. 
So as we can see, every day currently 1800 new coins come into existence. At $6,000 USD per coin that means over $10M USD worth. 
Miners must pay electricity costs and rent etc, and they usually want a profit, so they often sell a lot of their coins. The net result whether they sell them or keep them is that every day the market has to absorb 1800 new coins. So it’s taking about $10,000,000 being added to the Bitcoin ecosystem every day to keep the price at $6,000 USD. 
When the block subsidy halves, the economic theory is that if demand stays the same but the supply drops, then you would expect to see the price increase. 
In reality it doesn’t play out smoothly, because we don’t know when people start to factor in their expectations regarding the halving event or the supply reduction.

Remember the market is currently absorbing (either through miners holding or people purchasing) 1800 new coins every day. This drops to 900 around March-May 2020.
While sideways price action in most asset classes is not a very bullish sign, remember Bitcoin’s market cap is actually growing around $10M USD + per day. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:33:01

My point is that while the original poster is lamenting the absence of people buying at this price, the truth is every transaction that has gone through has included someone buying at this price. 
It’s circular logic. Complaining there aren’t people buying at this price because if there were more buyers the price would be higher therefore we wouldn’t be at this low price.... 
Volume is healthy. And each transaction involves a buyer. So there’s plenty of people buying at this price. 
Re your predictions re price, that’s another story. 
But I share your bearish sentiment. I don’t think 2k is possible, but sideways or down to 4500 until the next halving is my guess.

“Today’s price” is simply the price that a buyer and seller last agreed upon. 
There are many reasons the price goes up and down. If you really know it is simply a factor of how many buyers and sellers are placing orders then you’d be able to easily predict price movements and within a year you’ll be the wealthiest person on the planet, simply by shorting or longing the trend via leveraged tools on Bitmex. 
But you cannot predict which way the price will go in the next 10 minutes, 10 hours, or 10 days, despite having bid and offer data.

The “price” of Bitcoin is the price of BTC the last time a trade took place. Nothing more. Nothing less. If a trade took place at 4K that means one party chose to sell at that price and one party chose to buy at that price. 
Markets can decrease in price even with more people wanting to buy than sell, because they might both believe the price should be lower. Conversely the price can increase despite there being more wanting to sell than buy for the opposite reason.
And whatever happens, there will be the exact same number of buyers and sellers.

You need to understand the difficulty adjustment. 
There is no set “cost to mine”.
The more people mine, the more it costs to mine. 
Each miner is trying to find a hash of all the data they want in a block that comes out lower than the “target”. 
They have a variable they change over and over while trying to find this special low hash. That’s the nonce. 
Once they find the very low rare hash they create a block, get the block subsidy and tx fees of any transactions in the block they just created, other nodes verify their work, and then the race is on to make the next block. 
After 2048 blocks, the software calculates how frequently the blocks were found. If it was less than every 10 minutes, the target for a valid hash gets even lower, meaning it’s even LESS probable of finding a valid hash, meaning you have to spend more electricity to find one, meaning the cost to mine goes up. 
If the block subsidy went away, and heaps of miners shut off their equipment, (as sometimes happens) then blocks will take LONGER than 10 minutes to be created. 
Then, after 2048 blocks, the difficulty will change to make it easier to find a valid hash. If this keeps happening over time, the cost to mine keeps going down in line with the reward miners receive. 
The reason transaction fees are low now is nothing to do with what the block subsidy is. It’s just supply and demand. There’s only so many transactions that can fit into a block. If blocks are full all the time, you have to outbid other users to bribe miners into including your transaction in a block instead of someone else’s. 
With or without a block subsidy, miners will mine the highest fee transactions first almost every time. 
One day there will only be transaction fees in the block reward, no block subsidy. 
But miners will still exist, blocks will still happen every 10 minutes, and it doesn’t matter if there’s a gajillion hashes per second or just one laptop in my loungeroom mining, bitcoin will work the same. 
Now the only doom and gloom prophecy that exists is this: some people posit that if there’s not many people mining then it becomes easy to re-org the blocks. That’s when someone mines a longer chain in secret, then broadcasts their chain to the network essentially invalidating however many blocks are different in their chain to yours. 
This is why many exchanges wait 6 blocks (or confirmations) before considering a transaction safe. 
If someone sends bitcoin to an exchange, swaps it for Monero, withdraws the Monero, then does a re-org attack (also called a double spend) revealing their chain to the network which, conveniently, doesn’t include them sending any bitcoin to the exchange in the first place, they now have their bitcoin AND the Monero. 
Exchanges and massive transactions on chain are the most at risk of double spend attacks. 
But this is very easily solved, simply by waiting for more confirmations before considering a transaction final. 
Because most transactions in the future will be done on lightning anyway, as long as the channel was opened a lot of blocks back, it’s really not an issue. 
So in a nutshell: mining costs are irrelevant. The network adjusts so there’s always close to 10 minute blocks no matter how many miners there are. When the block subsidy goes away nothing will change, except maybe exchanges who don’t use lightning will have to wait more blocks before allowing withdrawals.

Either way, it should generate a new address for each “receive” you do. One wallet controls billions of addresses. And if you use a new address each time that’s good practice. But you should try restoring your wallet on another device with your seed to make sure you know how to recover your wallet if you lose everything.

You sound like you read 1 chapter of Keynes and decided it was the Bible. 
the greatest art and scientific breakthroughs happened in a world where people saved and invested, rather than went into debt. 
Creating money through debt rewards the rich and penalises the poor, who don’t get access to the new money, can’t save faster than their money deflates in value and prices rise, and your moronic system is exactly the reason for rising inequality. 
I don’t care and Bitcoin doesn’t care what you think.  You go hold the money that guarantees to lose value every year, and I’ll hold the one that gets scarcer every year, and we’ll see who can afford more stuff in a decade. Goodbye.

You clearly don’t know how exchanges work or wallets for that matter. 
Each wallet can produce potentially millions (or more idk) of individual addresses. Each UTXO is sent to a different address. 
As an outsider you can’t see what addresses belong in the same wallet. They all just look like unique addresses. Sometimes when an exchange sends an transaction made up of multiple utxos in different addresses you can make an educated guess that probably they owned both of those addresses. But you don’t actually know what addresses are all of theirs. They don’t put every utxo they have into one address, and most don’t combine all their utxo deposits into one giant utxo. 
So Coinbase doesn’t have 1 cold wallet address that you can point to and say “that’s their cold wallet”. All their UTXOs in cold storage are spread through many many different addresses. 
Nor do they have only several hot wallet addresses. They have thousands of utxos all kept in different addresses that are controlled by their hot wallet. 
Every time you make a withdrawal from an exchange they pay themselves the change from the UTXO you’re taking from too. So they create yet another new address for that change UTXO to go to. 
From time to time you will see them doing some housekeeping and combining their small utxos from many wallet addresses into larger utxos that will make spending from them economical if the fees get higher. But they never merge all their millions of tiny UTXOs into one giant UTXO on one address. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:50:16
Except that’s how all exchanges work. 
You don’t move coins in and out of cold storage with each transaction. 
You keep most in cold and only touch them when you have to. And whenever someone deposits coins into the exchange they’re just used for other withdrawals. 
It would be insecure if you were accessing the cold storage 2000 times a day.

First you have to understand there are still 1800 new coins being created every day. 
In a bit over a year it will halve to 900 per day. And roughly every four years it will keep halving. 
So currently the market has to absorb 1800 new coins per day, which, at $3600 per coin, is over $6M USD per day. 
In the following four years, when it’s 900 coins per day, if the price was $200k per coin, the market would essentially need to come up with $180,000,000 million each and every day to buy all those new coins. 
Whoever is telling you it’s going to 200k in the next 5 years either has no idea about the mechanics of bitcoin, or they’re INCREDIBLY bullish. 
That said, I’m very bullish over the next 30 years plus, but there’s no guarantee you’ll see a positive return on your investment in the next 10 years. 
And while I’m sure people will say this is fear mongering, I was here when BTC was $20,000 and anyone suggesting it might fall to $10,000 was called an ignorant moron. 
I hope I’m wrong and bitcoin hits $200,000 sooner rather than later, but I’ve learned the hard way not to take advice from people who already own a particular coin. Read about how the coin works yourself and make an informed decision if you think it will be in higher demand in the future compared to today.

You have no idea what you’re talking about. You’ve been reading info from people who don’t know how wallets work. 
Every person using bitcoin uses a new address for each transaction. Over time some of the addresses accumulate a lot more than others, but there controlled by the same wallet seed or keys. From an outsider it looks like there’s a rich bitcoiner and lots of small poorer bitcoiners, but that’s not what’s happening. 
And yes, the scarcity is EXACTLY why it’s valuable. The next block subsidy halving is just over a year away. The supply is finite and demand is steady.

No this has nothing to do with fees. Moving coins between cold and hot storage doesn’t have any impact on the fees payable. It’s the fact that an exchange would have to access its offline keys that many times a day. 
This is why any responsible exchange keeps a % of their coins in a hot wallet, made up of recent deposits etc and available for instant withdrawal, while the majority of the coins are in cold storage, only ever touched or added to when the hot wallet becomes too empty or full.

The volumes certainly are bigger, but I’m of the opinion that most of the money is people playing musical chairs with crypto. The numbers seem to say we need $14M a day, which is not insignificant. 
And yes I’ve considered (and tweeted about) those who approach $BTC trading as a commodity, which bitcoin is unlike as it doesn’t matter how much the price goes up, there’s no new mine to open. 
It’s perhaps more like New York real estate in 1800. We can see it’s going to run out soon, but there’s more than enough for now. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 05:05:07
Yeah but gold doesn’t work that way because if it becomes more scarce, that pushes up the price, which makes mines that otherwise would not be profitable to come on line, thus increasing supply, and putting downward pressure on price. 
That’s why Bitcoin is so special.

I believe $14M of NEW money every day is a lot. That’s over a billion every 3 months. Not just in trade volume obviously. In people deciding to spend NEW money into the system. 
And getting paid in Bitcoin is still the same as contributing value to the ecosystem. You might provide $300 worth of labour a day to a client and receive that in bitcoin. So that helps. 
Clearly the market CAN sustain $14M per day atm because the price is holding steady. But if the price hits $100,000 within 2 years as some predict, and then the mining difficulty spikes again because it’s so lucrative, then we could be looking at needing $180,000,000 per day of new money to maintain a BTC price of 100k. That seems somewhat unreasonable to me at the current block subsidy size, but perhaps feasible in 14 to 22 years. 
I’m asserting that I don’t think many forecasters take this into account.

@_date: 2019-01-26 05:03:49
True. The only thing we can hope for is daily demand from new money entering the market stays consistent while supply halves which pushes price up over time, thereby keeping miners compensated adequately. But as we’ve seen with other chains that have been re-orged, the worst case scenario is we have to wait for more confirmations for transactions to be considered safe. And now that lightning is up and running well this really isn’t a concern.

And they don’t need to collude. Any exchange can sell bitcoin that doesn’t exist. Just because they show you a fancy screen with some numbers doesn’t mean you have real bitcoin.

If you measure inflation as new bitcoin to actual bitcoin available to the market, it will still be well above 2%. Many bitcoin should be considered lost and destroyed forever. If you measure it against all ₿ mined then it’s around 2% after the next halving. 
Still inflationary by definition though. But will require less money to buy up the new coins each day of course.

I don’t believe someone who has such little understanding of bitcoin could ever be in a position to be responsible for a hedge fund’s technology. 
My guess is you actually want to arbitrage between exchanges and have a misunderstanding of how mining, blocks, and confirmations work. 
Do some more research on the basics of bitcoin. 
Even if the largest mining pool in the world prioritised your particular transactions, at best they’d only get 20% of the blocks, so you’d be waiting on average 50 minutes. There is a lot more to say here but I believe it would be too technically confusing.

Some of the Bitcoin I acquire these days is through mining. At the moment it appears I’m buying it at a discount. The jury is out whether that’s a good long term strategy. 
The bulk of the trading I do is arbitrage. I live in Australia and I am presented with plenty of occasions where BTC price varies wildly between exchanges. 
My retirement expectations are 30 years away, not 7. 
I would not be surprised (or bothered) if bitcoin was at $2,000 in 7 years. I agree with you that one cannot plan for the future in that time span (or any time span with certainty). 
The way I see it is this... imagine you knew bitcoin would one day be worth $8,000 back in 2010. There’s no way you’d be worrying about whether you were paying $8 or $12 or $20. And I doubt you’d bother trading it to make a few bucks along the way either. You’d just be buying all you could. I’m sure in a few decades people will wish they had the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at $8k or $17k or $25k. 
Regarding trading, you are correct. Someone who can pick the tops and dips will acquire more coin than I. But I’m not competing, and I wish that person all the luck in the world. The reason I’ve not chosen that strategy is because I’ve come to the conclusion that the price could spike north at any moment without me being in the market. I fully expect a lot of people to sell when the price hits 17,000 again, then watch it go to 25,000, then realise they messed up by selling. 
I saw that exact thing happen over the last few months too. I don’t wish those people ill, but I have a 30 year time horizon, and believe that with an ultimate volume limit at 21,000,000 Bitcoin could well become the reserve currency of the planet. I have capped downside (what I’ve spent) and virtually unlimited upside. 
If I’m smart and invest in other assets as well (and practice stoicism and contentment with poverty), I can sleep easy whatever happens.
The Black Swan of crypto is something that I have thought about. If I could purchase extremely out of the money options as a hedge against Bitcoin I would look into that.

If the $ value of the block subsidy remains higher than the cost to mine then large corporations will be attracted to it. If the cost to mine is higher than the subsidy then only hobbyists who choose to essentially pay to mine will continue mining, as it will be unprofitable.
There will always be people willing to mine at a small loss as obtaining bitcoin via mining gives you clean, untainted and untraced coins, which is in itself of value to many people. 
If you don’t want to be tracked by your government, buying $1,000,000 worth of coin on any market is a lot more dangerous than mining $1,000,000 of coin even if it costs you $1M + to mine.

No I said reduced profitability from mining means a higher percentage of the coins needs to be sold, putting downward pressure on price. That has nothing to do with any halving, that has to do with mining difficulty increasing at current block subsidy rate.
And the final sentence is a BUT, meaning good news that the subsidy will be extremely low in 30 years (the implication being WAY less downward pressure as there are hardly any new coins from mining to sell).
@_date: 2019-09-13 09:19:19
Great work buddy. Ignore all the haters and mockers. If you have an idea like this just go for it. I look forward to reading it one day.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:18:35
Everything I’ve said is simple facts about the mechanics of Bitcoin.
Hashrate FOLLOWS profitability as a lagging indicator. If price goes up, it inevitability encourages more mining.
As a miner myself, allow me to explain the basics to you. 
It costs money to mine. You have to pay rent, electricity, hardware, and staff costs. 
So in order to make a profit, miners sell some of the coins they mine to cover the costs. 
As more and more miners come into the market and compete, Bitcoin’s difficulty rate increases. This makes any given mining operation less profitable. 
So say for example in December 2017 I mined 20 Bitcoins and my costs were $50,000. So I sell 6 Bitcoins at $10,000 each, pay my bills, keep $10,000, and hodl the rest of my coins. 
But by July 2018 the mining difficulty has skyrocketed, and the price has tanked. It’s still profitable to mine, but barely. Of course my costs don’t change. I only mine 8 coins. I sell 7.1 of them at $7,000 each to pay my bills and hodl the rest. 
If you follow this simple example you’ll see how in December 2017 a far smaller % of the mined coins needed to be sold to cover mining costs. 
It is plainly obvious, as well as my own personal experience, that miners must now sell a far higher % of their coins to cover costs than 7 months ago. 
This is naturally causing more downward pressure on price. 
I’m not asserting it’s insurmountable, or that it is impossible for enough money to enter Bitcoin to keep pushing the price up. 
What I said so very clearly, and what is patently obvious, is that you must take these simple facts into account when making your price predictions. 
For you to assert that people don’t need to take these facts into account is absurd. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:27:03
Gold is mined at about 1-2% /annum vs current supply and has been for many years. Bitcoin supply is currently inflating at close to 4%.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:48:40
Probably neither TBH. It goes off block number not days anyway. The point was that we have a while to go with high BTC inflation still. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:03:46
As I understand the terminology, the block reward is the combination of the block subsidy and the tx fees. Correct me if I’m mistaken. 
The subsidy is known moving forward. Yet the fees move up and down depending on the state of the mempool. The recent decrease in fees is not ascodiated with any change in block subsidy. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:11:07
That would only be the case if there was only 1 miner. They compete with each other. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:30:04
If you put in $12M but someone else removed $12m then we haven’t got an aggregate increase of $12m have we. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:42:58
The block subsidy halves. 
Currently 12.5 Bitcoins are awarded to the miner who mined a block. They also get the transaction fees, and the tx fees and subsidy combine to make the block reward. 
The cost to mine a block (electricity and equipment) is close to the value of 12.5 Bitcoins. The net effect is that miners need to sell a decent percentage of their bitcoins to cover their costs. 
Blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. So that means currently 1800 new coins are created each day. That’s a fair amount of new Bitcoins the market needs to absorb. 
Every 210,000 blocks the block subsidy halves, roughly every 4 years.
Estimates currently have the next halving in about 2 years.
The halvings will keep occurring for the next 120 years until there’s no more new Bitcoin created. 
If underlying demand from new money for Bitcoins remains constant, then it’s expected that when the halving occurs the price may increase as there’s simply less new Bitcoin being sold onto the market each day. 
In reality it won’t play out cleanly. Once enough people realise a halving is about to occur, they will anticipate a future price increase, and rush out to buy bitcoin before the halving happens. 
This will have a self fulfilling prophecy-effect and cause the price to go up anyway. If that causes a bubble it may overshoot what would be a stable price post-halving, and we may see more volatility. 
Potentially, the upward move in price caused by the halving of supply of new coins may attract even more money to the asset, causing an even greater move upwards in price. 
But whatever price point Bitcoin hits it’s good to keep in mind it will have to sustain that price for another four years as 900 new coins per day (on average) get dumped onto the market.
Long term it’s helpful to understand that availability of new Bitcoin diminishes heavily in time. 
I like to think about it this way: 
Currently the market is able to sustain a price of $6000 per coin even while 1800 new coins are created each day. 
In the year 2052 (roughly when most people here on this sub will retire) there will only be 3.5 new coins per day.
It might be worth holding on to some Bitcoin until then in case it remains reasonably popular. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:54:16
Each time you send Bitcoin on chain you include a small fee. Miners will still compete to earn those fees.

Sure. I guess that’s true. I mean, I hope as much money as possible flows into Bitcoin. I tend to do my estimates on worst case scenario though.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:26:37
I’m genuinely open to hear your explanation as to how $12million aggregate can be injected into Bitcoin each day while it has only 1800 new coins per day and each coin can remain at $6500. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:01:26
For 1 mill to be sustainable after the next halving we’d need 900 x $1m = $900Million PER DAY injected into Bitcoin for 4 years. That’s $1.3 Trillion. 
I don’t think so Tim.

@_date: 2018-07-19 14:26:11
No I never said that. Please pay attention.
What I said is that a big INGREDIENT in your future price predictions should take into account the fact that there are 1800 new coins every day no matter what, and that the mining difficulty has increased to the extent that mining margins are very thin, meaning many of those 1800 coins need to be sold. 
Anyone who thinks this is not important information is ignorant of the mechanics of Bitcoin. 
I’m personally very bullish long term on Bitcoin. I usually accumulate more of it every single day. 
But my predictions, such that they are, always account for the current block subsidy, and upcoming difficulty adjustments, among other factors.
Anyone telling you that Bitcoin will hit $X who is not aware of the current inflation rate in Bitcoin is not doing anyone any favours.
I also am not interested in debating you on details that are widely known and publicly available. Please go and read some Bitcoin basics material so you understand exactly how mining works and how the block subsidy functions.

@_date: 2018-07-19 14:34:40
Your entire premise is flawed. 
Firstly, price and hash rates are not correlated. 
For example, the last 6 months has seen a constant increase in the harsh rate and a constant decrease in price.
You have to seriously manipulate the axis to make out like those graphs are the same. 
Secondly, I am asserting that the block subsidy (currently 12.5 coins every 10 minutes) often referred to as the inflation rate of Bitcoin, plays a significant role in influencing the price. Econ 101 tells us that as a good decreases in supply, the price goes up. 
And we have almost two years before the next supply decrease of new Bitcoins. 
How you interpret that blatantly obvious reality to be fear, uncertainty, and doubt, is beyond me.

According to Bitcoin.org the “block reward” is the combination of the subsidy and the tx fees. Eventually the subsidy will be gone and the reward will only consist of transaction fees:
“The amount that miners may claim as a reward for creating a block. Equal to the sum of the block subsidy (newly available satoshis) plus the transactions fees paid by transactions included in the block.”

We should have a Bitcoin fundraiser where everyone sends to a single wallet that mods control them we donate that to a charity and put out as many press releases as possible. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:52:15
Not exactly. Investors generally don’t have a clue how much mining costs. The correlation between mining cost and price of bitcoin is this: as more people mine bitcoin the “difficulty” automatically adjusts, making mining less profitable. Once the difficulty reaches a certain point and mining is not profitable at current price, people stop mining.
Thus, market determines price of coins and mining costs adjust naturally in response to the price.  
It’s the supply of new coins onto the market vs the demand from new coins entering the market that is the main driver of price.
At the moment of halving, mining profitably does indeed halve. As I understand it, in the past that hasn’t caused large hash rate drops because profitability was above 2x. But it likely will cause such a hashrate decline if price doesn’t double due to expected supply drop and investor speculation.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:06:11
Because if there was we wouldn’t have dropped below $7k.

How profitable mining is.

Most of that is people playing musical chairs. 
It is highly unlikely there is $12m of new money being injected into the ecosystem most days.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:47:37
Hashrate has been rising  for 8 months despite price decline. Mining margins are thin but still profitable.   
I’m not concerned about the hashrate in 600 days. 
What’s worth knowing is mining profitability. If it’s low, a higher % of coins will need to be sold to cover costs. 
There won’t be an ASIC with a 10x increase in efficiency for SHA256 anytime soon. 
I suspect mining will eventually only be able to exist where there is extremely cheap or free electricity.

@_date: 2018-07-18 20:13:20
I originally wrote “through purchasing or miners hodling”. I’m well aware not all coins will be sold. I also covered the fact that as mining margins decrease a higher percentage of coins need to be sold.
If you honestly believe $1.3T is not far fetched I’m happy for you. As long as you’re making your forecast with a knowledge of what the block subsidy actually is. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:45:25
You either purchase bitcoin with electricity (mining) or with money on an exchange or trade something for it. Either way, 1800 Bitcoins get purchased each day.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:50:51
I think you may be right. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:17:42
It’s one of many factors to consider. But all things being equal, a reduced supply will increase the price of a given good. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:37:27
Because if you bought $12m (put in $12m) someone else sold $12m (took out $12m). That’s how trades work. There’s always a buyer and a seller. 
In your example you buy 6 million coins, but there’s only 1800 new per day. So most of what you bought was people leaving bitcoin, not buying miners’ coins. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:57:41

When I finally understood the block subsidy, mining difficulty adjustments and profitability, and the hard cap on the supply of bitcoins, I gained a real appreciation for how great bitcoin can be in the long term, and how each price drop was just an opportunity to buy more. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:45:09
Yes. Some people who will all of a sudden be mining at a loss may stop mining. But Bitcoin will automatically adjust the difficulty algorithm such that it then becomes easier to create a valid block, thus making it more profitable to mine. 
If half the miners stop, the profitability will double for those who miners who remain.
It’s a self correcting system.

Billionaires don’t tell people on Reddit their plans. We just ride the waves they make.

Many sold when the price was “high” at $2000. 
It never went below that. 
Plus you have to take capital gains into account. 
Say you buy one bitcoin for $5,000 and sell for $10,000 making a $5000 profit. Then (for example) you owe $2500 tax. You’re left with $7500. 
You need the price to dip well below $7500 for you to get your position back and end up with MORE bitcoins than you started. 
You may be sure the price will dip, but are you sure the price will dip enough for you to pay your tax and end up with more coins?
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:58:24

@_date: 2018-12-29 16:47:57
You’re not being conservative. You’re being absurd. 
There’s no timeline where in 5 more years most people in the world are using Bitcoin. 
I’m as bullish on Bitcoin long term as they come. But nonsensical assertions like this just get people’s hopes up and make them frustrated when it doesn’t happen in that time frame. 
The internet sat on top of phone lines, so it used an existing network. The phones sat on top of the telegraph system. So there was another existing network that allowed phones to roll out. 
Most people in stable countries have no need or desire for Bitcoin. It’s not more convenient than fiat. You can’t ring visa and ask for a refund when your account gets hacked. And to top it off, there’s still 1800 coins being printed every day. It will be at 900 when your 15 years are up. So BTC will still be very inflationary and volatile. 
There’s no scenario where the average person wants to switch to such a volatile currency. 
And the only way main stream adoption will occur is with L2. Because without that we’re all paying $50 per transaction. 
I’m running a lighting node using LND. To suggest this will be even close to ready for mainstream adoption in 5 years is naive. Have you run a lightning node and opened channels and seen the headaches of trying to use it?
It’s promising. But we need a lot of iteration before it’s good to go. 
I’m sure it will be close to ready in a few years. But, only then can we start expecting people and merchants to start looking at it. 
Maybe 15 years from the time Lightning is ready to go would be a possibility. Maybe. 
But in all honesty we all  need to stop comparing Bitcoin to other technologies. It’s not a new gadget or tool like the telegraph, vacuum cleaner, or internal combustion engine. 
It’s money. 
And none of us have ever been alive to see a good go from novelty to actual money. 
People speculate on the process of a good becoming money. Szabo’s Shelling Out is a good start. A great start actually. 
But a good doesn’t go from collectible to widely used medium of exchange and unit of account in 15 years. 
Bitcoin certainly is a bargain right now in my opinion. But there’s absolutely no way I would promise that in 5 more years the price will be higher than it is today. There’s no way to know that, and not enough subsidy halvings between now and then to significantly impact the daily issuance. 
I certainly hope the price is a lot higher. 
And I’m investing as if it will be. 
But no one can honestly predict what will happen in such a short time frame.

It’s like comparing the US dollar with Visa. 
One is the underlying currency. One is a payment mechanism.
Your chart compares them as if they’re two different currencies or two different versions of the same thing. 
On chain BTC tx is still happening underneath a lightning channel being opened or closed. 
Your funds aren’t _locked_ on lightning. You can close the channel and spend on chain whenever you want. 
There’s no theoretical limit to the volume lightning can handle. 
It would make more sense to Compare lightning to Liquid or to proprietary L2 solutions.

There will only ever be 21million coins. About 4 million are lost. Population of earth is expected to hit around 10Billion in 30-40 years. 
So back of the envelope there’s only enough BTC for each human to have 0.0017 each.
