The first and only company I was able to purchase goods with both BTC and LTC. We're also investors through 500 Startups and excited about what Elyse is working on which includes a holistic supply chain adopting Bitcoin.

I was just in a similiar situation with a waitress who was interested in Bitcoin. However I gave her a $10 cash tip AND a $5 BTC gift card. That's how you do it. They live on the tips and they can dream on the BTC.

For those surrealist fanboys and girls out there here's a mashup that was bouncing around in my head for a few weeks. Bitcoin is not money, it's a representation of money.
