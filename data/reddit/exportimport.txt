Check the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve from 2000-2012 so you can see how the USD monetary supply has grown. Then compare that to bitcoin supply figures you provide.

Circle has fees included in the price. Coinbase outside the price. Local bitcoins is the way to go. You're trading liquidity for convenience. As promised, there's no free lunch.

Fungibility is desired but requires trust. The two are one and the same idea.
Agree with you but even cash doesn't have perfect fungibility, e.g. Marked bills. 
Bitcoin is similar because by design its transactions are traceable. The only thing that I can think of with 100% fungibility are precious metals because you can melt them down, but there you have liquidity issues, ie buying/selling/transporting.

Govt monopolies don't work. Give me one good example of a functioning gov't monopoly.
They have proven themselves to be incompetent in even supposedly "necessary" govt functions, like national security or tax collection.

wake me up when you have a proper rebuttal to what he is saying
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:14:43










I'm not refuting that there are gov't monopolies; I just haven't seen any that are functioning free of waste, corruption or inefficiency. All of those examples reinforce the argument that any responsibility given to the govt has been a failure. 
Saudi Arabia's management of oil simply collects profits for the princes at the top and gives (relative) scraps to the public. Any Saudi Aramco employee will attest to widespread idleness by most employees there that just collect a paycheck.
How has the Chinese social credit system treated the Uyighurs recently?
USPS does not have fair and reasonable prices in my opinion because competitors could it for far less. E.g. Amazon receives a "fairer" price than you and me to ship the same mail. It has also resorted to sending us unwanted spam for money now.
Happy to rebut more examples or hear your rebuttal to this. Thanks

Localbitcoins.com is pretty anonymous if done in small amounts

I don't get to say this often, but I'm so glad I live in Jersey.

Good analogy. Technology always subverts the old way of doing things and usually for better.
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:28:38
another good point, Ben!

Thanks a lot!
