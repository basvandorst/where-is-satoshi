I’m learning very quickly that most of r/bitcoin thinks $20,000 is a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-11-28 23:30:07
Exactly bro. $20k is not a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-11-28 06:04:07
Haha hardly
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:33:43
Lol. Me and 6.15 btc guy could hang out
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:02:16
It’s not though. That’s not even a 20% down payment on what most “homes” cost in America.
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:48:04
Risk of losing it on private wallet I guess.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:59:55
Just curious, why 10,000x?
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:50:14
Keep waiting bro. But look into the Danaher tender offer. Make like $1k on $14k. Your welcome
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:11:28
It doesn’t matter what I have to say. I don’t care if some guy on Reddit agrees with me.
I’ve got a bunch of bitcoin and I’ll be holding my ground when the same people are telling me I should sell at any dollar amount
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:48:58
After looking through your comments I gotta ask. Who hurt you bro? I mean we all know the answer is your uncle or stepdad but still ��

BlackBerry was a legit ass brand that is currently up to some good stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:01:04

@_date: 2019-12-04 22:50:39
Not alone. I sold all mine during the bch fork scare around $8500 when I had 8 bitcoin and I’ve been acquiring since. Back up to like 5.6 btc. Hoping prices stay low for a bit
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:49:33
Lol how do you know gape. Be honest
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:18:06
There is no telling, but my estimate is ‘higher’
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:38:28
I’m still buying stocks. Are you?
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:42:50

@_date: 2019-12-05 01:22:17
It doesn’t matter what they do. Because this is a worldwide asset.
No matter how many tards are day trading the holders will win.
Day trading anything = losing behavior

This is my post in case you’re forgetting where you’re currently talking shit
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:13:47
Has anybody done an analysis on the unique upvotes in this thread? I’d like to know how many of the accounts are multi/alts.
We have 1.2 million subs. How many are fake?
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:29:37
Day traders are losers (financially)  based on my experience. And I work in finance.
Worldwide asset means that there’s a whole bunch of shit going on you don’t hear about.

Lol dude relax. I’d buy ya a pint if I was in Ireland but I ain’t.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:57:18
All investments come down to “do I believe in this”. I own 2 properties, stock, and crypto. They’re all the same. Do you believe in its future.
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:56:29
Your soul?
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:05:56
You can be bearish and that’s fine. But I don’t plan to sell my properties, nor my bitcoin. I don’t want to sell anything. Only add to what I have.
If I invest in something from here on on out it’s because I want to own it. With the exception of short term m&amp;a offers. 
I’m 28 about to be 29 for context
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:54:16
please confirm
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:48:20
Bitcoin isn’t a stock. It’s a blockchain and the og blockchain. The only one that matters.
Charles Schwab is a stock and bitcoin is worth more than 3 times what they did in 50 years.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:33:14
The drunk Irishman all mad. Chill brother.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:35:06
