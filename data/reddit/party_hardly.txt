So I downloaded blue wallet and tried to send over from lightning.  Didn’t work so I sent from my edge wallet and now I’m trying to send from my blue wallet segwit address to lightning address and then I’ll try again to send from lightning app to blue wallet lightning

I sold 10% when it went from $4800 to $3800 and then back to $4200 because of this graph.  Fuck this graph 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:06:51
Just sell it and buy back in when your more comfortable.  It could go down to $2k.  Or just hold it for 2 years and it’ll be at $50k or something most likely.  But if you can’t handle the $2k sell it.  Don’t invest more than your comfortable losing

Well yeah well said but I’d give all my bitcoin for a michaelangelo.  There’s historic merit.  Bitcoin is still just very new.  It doesn’t stack up.  But it’s in the same ballpark.  :) 
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:10:52
Buy on hoss �� �� �� 
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:09:17
It is very much.  I compared it to a michaelangelo painting to my buddy and it clicked.  It’s just perceived value 
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:47:39
Don’t forget to pay estimated taxes like now.  That’s important too.  Pay the full amount don’t split it up over the next two quarters.  How much you pay will depend on the state you live in and how long you’ve held your bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:29:39
A bunch of folks apparently.  There’s probably a lot of unrealized millionaires left that just can’t take it anymore.  Once they’re all gone.  It’ll bounce.  Could take a couple years though 
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:21:08
That’s interesting I thought of that too.  But there are new circles.  The altcoins.  They’re just not as delicious as the original circle or something.   Not sure of course whether that’s true but so far yeah bitcoin is the yummiest circle and the one that is used to get slices of all the other circles so yeah. And yeah the slice is yours forever and can’t be counterfitted.  It’s a really really awesome circle which is why people buy the slices 
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:54:04
Shaaaaaade. that’s okay I do it too 
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:43:18
Interesting.  I guess people just always bet with the retracing of the price and yet the retracing doesn't happen but once.  Timing the market never works so the wall gets eaten up.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:29:29
I watched a video once where a day trader was saying that most people think that the large wall means the price will move against the wall but that in actuality the price moves towards the wall.  And I must say especially recently, that is true.  Odd.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:10:08

I like selling when it's crashing.  I've had some success with that.  And, of course, buying when it's going up, like now.  
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:38:36

@_date: 2017-01-03 07:48:03
True.  But I'm not saying to sell now.  Saying to sell when it starts tanking.  Which it will.  Let's not be stupid.  Sell and then buy back.  10k to 1k is what I'm thinking.
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:37:47
That is smart but smarter may be to sell the next 10x crash if it happens (it will)
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:14:09
Gemini is better than Coinbase.  Instant buy with 0.25% fee.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:32:17
I would possibly short on bitfinex during the crash.  With like 10btc.  That might be fun.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:20:25
Good luck it's going to hit 10k then go down to 1k. I don't have the balls for that drop.  Going to probably sell half on the way down :(
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:02:18
And thank you to all the full node runners.  I will
Be one in the near future :). 
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:50:03
Haha nope.  I'm circle jerking with the rest of em.  Blow it up!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:28:30
This is something that so many have said.  I'd be pretty surprised if it didn't happen 
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:41:30
I don't want it to tank but I don't like when new folks get in and think it won't and lose their shirt when or if it does.  I will Hodl 75% so don't worry I'm still HODLing 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:30:27
Yeah I'm not keen on putting 10s of thousands on a bitcoin exchange.  I'm just gonna sit here and vomit while the price fluctuates haha 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:28:40
Oh boy here come all the pms of folks asking you for moneys.  Good job.  I'm nearly there 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:26:40
Good strategy.  It's going to hit 40k. I'm sure of it.  But yeah buy when it goes back down to 1k which it will.

Dude I’m not selling haha.  Fools game.  I’m just trying to help people from gettin there ass burnt.  But yeah hold forevah.  Sometimes you gotta sell though.  It could easily plunge to $2k do you not agree? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:57:15
You may be right.  But I can see $2k in the future and let’s not pretend that can’t happen.  I’m not giving advice just hope that folks can ride this and try to have the best time they can have.  Btw I’m holding all the way for sure but some folks may be better off getting cute and tricky and that’s fine more power to em 
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:29:24

Oh is three digits a total collapse now?  Cool.  A couple years back it was two digits people were calling for.  
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:30:28
I was down about 60k and couldn't stand the thought of watching the price go up if I sold.  So I didn't sell.  Once it started going up I bought a bunch more.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:17:12

Dude I can’t tell the future but I’m thinkin it’s going to go down till the next halvening.  I don’t have the balls or money to sell *income tax* but yeah probably going a bit more down from here.  As much as that pains me

Don’t worry about it going up again.  That will definitely not happen 
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:07:22
Not really.  Doesn’t bother me.  You keep thinkin your things though.  I’m sure you are right.  And I am wrong 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:18:06
I don’t understand the mindset of these people.  So let’s say bitcoin is a complete joke.  Like flat earth.  I think flat earth is a joke.  Do I seek out the flat earth subreddit and brigade it?  Nope.  Why do they care so much?  
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:22:28
Dude.  Yeah.  It’s totally empty that’s right.  It’s a scam.   Short the shit out of it. Free money right?  
@_date: 2018-11-29 06:04:24
I’m amused.  I’ve trolled buttcoin a bit just for lullz but then realized that it’s not even real.  Doesn’t even seem like real people over there.  Not sure what’s going on.  Sure will be interesting to see what that place is like in a few years.  It never ends.  People shoot rocks at shiny stuff and always will.  
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:45:39
They denied me first time.  I went through the process again and got approved within the hour 
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:57:13
Zero.  Totally.  And absolutely without a doubt zero. I know, I know.  I’ve been calling for zero for a while.  Back when it was $20.  And then $1000.  And then most recently $20,000.  Trust me though.  Zero next.  For sure 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:05:29
I have a question for the haters.  When you guys constantly point out that bitcoin is not like a company in that it doesn’t produce any profits.  How is that exactly?  People pay for bitcoin, just like people pay for products.  The service is in the protection of the asset.  The profit comes from people paying for that service 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:15:48
It’s going down to sub $100 soon.  Definitely.  I’d bet my life in it 
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:45:56
I’m buying hard at $1800.  Although I would hate it to go there.  It’s odd 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:54:45
I'm dieing right now.  Not sure about y'all but I have large holdings and this is making me f$&amp; sick.  Hold on I guess.  I honestly think we will be looking at $750 for a couple years.  Hold tight my friends like I've said I've been  here before.  Buy big when it goes sub 1k trust me.   Be rich 
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:16:06
I guarantee if you put a prop bet on whether bitcoin will go to $500 in one year you will have massive odds.  Betmoose.com. Go ahead and make the bet and make tons of money 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:01:20
So many haters right now.  Pretty hilarious.  Can’t believe it.  Let’s pray for sub $100.  We can all have another chance.  That’s when I’m going to start buying.  When it’s not reality anymore 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:51:14
I’m guilty a that.  But I’ve seen this monster destroy me before.. and then it lifted me a up bit just thought I’d share 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:02:04
Haha!  It might go under 2k prepare thinseleves for $500 bitcoins it's not impossible.  Not trying to spread fud just being realistic.  I don't think we will see double digits ever again however

Feed the ponzi, that got me laughin 
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:19:56
I remember a post like this coming up when bitcoin was at $280 or so.  OP said they were going to short and buy back at $125.  And there was a comment saying it was a buy signal that such posts were coming up.  Then a few months later the price went bananas.  Then again.  A short position could be very smart right now.  I’d wait for a terrible obvious crash though.  
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:33:16
Nice!!  I was wrong go figure.  I’ve never been right.  I thought it would top at 10k and drop to 1k yeah.  That didn’t happen.   I give up on predictions.
