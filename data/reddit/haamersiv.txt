That's right. If future iterations of the top-dawg in crypto don't integrate the present btc holdings (which is very likely IMO) then BTC will become irrelevant, or at best have a minor market cap. 
The endstate for cryptographic exchange systems, even moreso than paper fiat, is to monopolize. This is the way credit is done, there are no real competitors to the big boys. If you don't produce a meaningful featureset in the right timeframe, eventually the adaptation latency due to sunk cost will not be enough to sustain your constituency and you WILL lose market share. 
If the next product is better enough fast enough, you will completely fail. BTC - and crypto in general - is moving awfully slow.

Just go for smaller timescales on your downtrend picks. If the variance is less than a few tenths of a percent, I wouldn't bother, but this is usually high volatility asset.
EDIT: I would think of it as this: you're going to be buying all over the price curve. If you save and buy dips, you're at least buying at lower points on the curve at all times and have increased profits. It might continue to go lower, but if you'd bought peaks it would be even MORE of a loss. I don't think you can go wrong as long as you continue in it. Perhaps just have a maximum waiting limit of a few days to a week?

Whatever makes sense for you and gets results.

No, this is just the AK recoil pattern from CSGO on its side. We're about to run out of ammo, by the looks of it.
Buy the reload, tweet flashes and full rush B!

I mean, you could save those daily amounts and only buy when it's on a 1D uptrend after a previous downturn.

Hodling is just having an infinite timeframe on your buylow/sellhigh regimen. Everybody should adjust the timescale they're comfortable operating in, and always 'buy the dips'. That's the only sensible way to operate. That's what hodlers are doing, they just believe everything until the apex is a huge, multiple year dip.

Schelling points - if they do not have solid analytical frameworks for the issue, the most relevant authority will displace it. Your insights are doing the jobs of the big voices whom you obviated by digging in and becoming aware of the technicalities, but you still have an authority to stake your sense of value on.

I'd be surprised if TA will be useful whatsoever in 5 years - on any publicly traded asset. If a human being can make educated guesses with some colored lines once per day, then a properly calibrated machine learning algorithm can take in 1,000x more data and do 1,000x more guessing ten times a second.

It isn't right to say Bitcoin Is Money. Money is whatever technology is premiere enough at the moment to provide some controlled scarcity of resources. What Bitcoin will lead to, Is Money.

I know about HFT. Machine trading is still in its infancy. You'll know it's maturing when nobody but the machines can make any money doing anything but long-term holding. Already, 90%+ day traders lose money.

That's not based on technical analysis, per se. Just your determination that, on an indefinite timescale, bitcoin is undervalued.

90% of TA day traders are losing money. It's a fact. Survivor's bias in online communities makes us think it's attainable for most people, and it is simply not.

Almost entirely true. The easy money is gone.
