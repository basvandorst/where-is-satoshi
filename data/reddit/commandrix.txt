Awesome sauce.

Do we have an English version of this article posted somewhere!
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:20:09
I think that's what may have happened to ShapeShift.

Have you tried Localbitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:41:44
You say that like it's a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:15:48
Do you have a Twitter or blog?
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:42:37
That's either, "Don't worry, hooman, I'll watch the prices for you," or, "Hmmm, I wonder what it is about this that my hooman finds so fascinating?"

Dude, do you even Reddit? Putting the URL in the title bar isn't how you get a link in Reddit.

It's Wordpress with a customized premium theme. I think most Wordpress themes are done in PHP...

You'll thank me later.

The question here isn't whether you should wait until you're 18. The question is how good you are at camouflaging a hardware wallet as a normal USB hard drive. And don't do anything that's going to raise your parents' suspicions.

LPT: Most centralized entities will look out for their own best interests when push comes to shove and will often fold before it gets to that point. Trust only entities that make it technically impossible to jerk around with them and you.

What is it they say every time the stock market takes a nosedive? You don't lose if you don't sell?
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:04:54
It's something they probably understand better than holding on-chain Bitcoin. It's like what used to be the gold-backed dollar, you could take a dollar bill in and redeem it for X amount of gold but it was only promises until somebody did.

You may want to look into mining something other than Bitcoin if your intention is just to buy a single mining rig. Try [whattomine.com]( to see what might actually be profitable for small operators.
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:14:08
Still looks only a half-step up from an ugly 1990s website.
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:21:25
Probably not. I think the ones who criticize crypto for its energy usage are missing the point and ignoring the miners who look for cheap renewable energy.
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:41:46
I wouldn't recommend mining Bitcoin with a laptop. Check out [whattomine.com]( to find out what you could reasonably mine with that (which will probably be some minor alt). Also, I've been using this new thing called [Honeyminer]( which will mine whatever cryptocurrency will work with your setup and give you payout in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:35:26
Thanks for showing off the good that cryptocurrencies can do. I think sometimes even those in the Cryptosphere need to be reminded of that on occasion.
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:27:15
Luckily being autistic is not a barrier to learning how to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrency. A lot of cryptocurrency insiders are probably on the spectrum. [Here's a decent video to get you started with trading cryptocurrencies.](
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:20:36
Dude, begging is considered rude in the cryptocurrency world. Just FYI.
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:05:14
Agreed, and also find ways to earn cryptocurrency because it can beat paying the exchange fees. I have occasionally earned cryptocurrency and occasionally spent it on gift cards.
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:26:30
Neat looking! Any plans to expand outside of Chile?
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:22:16
I get your points. A lot of the early Bitcoin adopters got involved for variations of the reasons you mentioned: Cryptocurrency as a concept is capable of taking on the Wall Street types and the powers they back financially. Some of them are still around even if they aren't liked very much (like Roger Ver) and/or have been forced to be more quiet about their contributions (like Gavin Andresen). I'm for developing the cryptocurrency ecosystem and promoting the more useful cryptocurrencies wherever possible, and those who find what we build useful will use it.
@_date: 2018-10-24 00:45:43
Where's the cryptocurrency newsfeed? (Google it because I don't wanna be accused of spamming.) Not gonna take you seriously if you don't have some kind of news ticker up...
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:58:00
Are you sure that isn't a Tangle of some sort...? /s

Does anybody really know what time it is? And does anybody really care?
It's Miller Time.

Is there an upper limit on the amount of bitcoin that can be sent in a single transaction?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:56:21
Any given Bitcoin can be bought, sold, or transferred as a payment multiple times in a single day
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:23:21
That's a good idea. The final implementation probably won't use BTC, but I could see this happening. But you should probably add an exception for people on your contacts list.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:31:46
You'll have trouble convincing the many-coiners. They'll just ask you what's so great about Bitcoin as it exists now that it deserved to be the only cryptocurrency and you'll need to give a better argument than most bitcoin maximalists seem to be capable of making (sorry).
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:42:40
That is true. However, if one goes by recent history, you may have some difficulty convincing the ones who jumped into Bitcoin recently because they thought it would make them rich.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:46:12
Now dat is cool.

eGifter does and you can get a Domino's e-gift card to order online.

I should tell you that only one of those seven actually walked on the Moon.

Good on you for jumping in with both feet. Stay strong, brother, this wild ride ain't over yet.
@_date: 2019-01-31 21:52:39
More details would be good. Is this a new partnership, an event, or just a photo op? The Korean language website you linked to was rather scanty on details when I ran it through translate.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:35:35
Of course they do. Same type of people who blame the gun whenever there is a mass shooting. This type of attitude is a cop-out that makes lazy asses feel like they're actually doing something when they go after it. It will always be easier to blame the tool than to go after the root cause when it comes to criminal activity.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:08:16
So you noticed that I like to tease, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:25:58
True. On the one hand, I think crypto users throw the word "scam" around so easily that sometimes I hear it as, "I don't like it or don't understand it, so I'm gonna try to scare everyone off from investing in this thing". On the other, I've gotten burned when the Mint exchange went out.

Bitcoin has first mover advantage. But then, so did MySpace. DON'T GET COMPLACENT.

That's just, like, your opinion, man. :P
