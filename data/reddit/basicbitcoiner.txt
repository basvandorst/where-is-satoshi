How is ANYTHING losing to Apple Shares?  It takes longer to get cash out of Apple Shares than it does Bitcoin, and it's far more likely to devalue in the meantime.  
My prediction:  Bitcoins and Gold outperform Apple Shares and Cash (USD) during 2014.

I don't have much of an opinion on them one way or the other (many people do, so maybe some folks could opine here), but my understanding is the largest promoter of Bitcoin is the Bitcoin Foundation.  They accept donations, and they may be a worthy cause.

So the real reason the OP is complaining is that he feels the "random" numbers generated by Electrum fall "within bounds" - as in, they are not random enough.  Based on his interpretation and behavior (generating a more "random" number with far fewer digits than the "bounded" random numbers generated by electrum), I'm assuming the reason he feels this way is because of the number of digits coming from the randomly generated numbers between 1 and 2^256 - 1.
If electrum is generating a random integer between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 (2^256 - 1, a 78 digit number), the OP is upset because he finds that the RNG is generating 76,77, and 78-digit numbers FAR too often.  This is why he's creating something like a 40-digit number to generate his private key from (which, try as he might, he can't seem to get Electrum to generate one this low).  
What the OP is failing to realize (and thus also why he's referencing Benford's law) is that 77.7% of ALL random numbers between 1 and (2^256) - 1 are 77-digit numbers (and roughly 13.6% are 78 digits, and 7.77% are 76 digits - that's over 99% of all of them).  
The OP sees the numbers written out over and over and over and sees a pattern, all these 76-78 digit numbers, and so few significantly shorter numbers, and assumes there is a problem when really, none exists.

A few points:
* Does the lease that your friend uses say that it allows the storage of said money in bitcoin?  I'm guessing no.  In this case, storing the deposit in bitcoin would possibly cause issues if the actual lease was ever brought up for anything (if the renter stopped paying or the landlord wanted to enforce other terms of the lease in court).  
* If your friend purchases 16 BTC @ $150 today, and BTC drops to $0, your friend is still required to return $2,400 at the end of the lease.
* The reason you are required to put in an account number where the deposit is being held is that you are required to hold that $2400 in the event that the lease is terminated early, to ensure that you are able to pay back the full amount of the deposit.  
Ultimately, it's a bad idea, and it's possibly illegal.  However, the odds of it actually causing a problem are slim, assuming your friend is always capable of paying out the $2400 at the end of the lease, even if BTC goes to $0.  I would suggest that your friend use his rental income as investment money rather than his security deposit.  The security deposit is the renter's money, not your friend's - your friend is only holding it to help enforce the terms of the lease.  Your friend doesn't actually have the right to do whatever he wants with it.  IANAL, but I am also a landlord.

I keep a small hand-money amount in my paper wallet.  I just made a vanity paper wallet for my father, too (recently retired, just started getting into bitcoin).  
My primary wallet is electrum on an old offline netbook, however.

Part of the reason CBX's volume appears low is that most of the intelligent larger volume traders use their "Dark Pool" feature.  The number of bots who undercut you by $0.01 (or just people who have too much time on their hands) makes the dark pool a really attractive feature.  You can't undercut someone if you can't see their sell order.
I'm not claiming CBX is a large exchange (it most certainly isn't), but their displayed trading volume is also deceivingly low.

This math is also under the assumption that you randomly told them five words from the entire hash, without telling him the order those words were in or where they fit into your hash.  If you randomly told him the FIRST five words (but in a random order), the (12!/7!) section changes to (5!) and reduces the time taken to crack by the supercomputer to roughly 45 days. 
Additionally, the supercomputer in question doesn't exist - it's purely a hypothetical supercomputer which is a bit faster than the world's fastest supercomputers right now (1 Exahash/s is stupidly fast.  Current supercomputers only run at a few dozen Petaflops).  Realistically, even a fast computer by today's standards would be a few million times slower than the supercomputer I'm talking about.  If you're worried about your Joe Schmoe friend brute forcing your wallet, don't be.  I merely wanted to show you the math to get to the numbers I got to.

Though, I bet the guy who created that site has a script that when it generates a page it's never generated before, it checks for active balances in any of the accounts and sweeps them, thereby guaranteeing that he'll get the funds before you do.  I've noticed that there's a short delay when accessing a page that no one has ever entered before, yet there is not one when accessing common pages (the first 100 were almost instant for me).  It's possible this delay is entirely because he's generating all those hashes, but it's also possible he's checking the balances too.  
The only way to know for sure is to find one with a balance!!!

You're going to need tens of thousands of dollars of server power, a secure distributed hosting provider, and a couple very skilled programmers (I imagine a web front-end guy, a database guy, and a security guy at the very minimum - maybe one of the two code guys can handle the web front-end).  Plus, you'll need the coin to start the exchange going.  With no fees, you'd probably want to start with at LEAST $400-600k in VC, plus about 8-12 months of dev/startup time to get this off the ground.  
And, how are you planning on supporting it or getting that VC with no revenue?

The big variable is the number of words in the electrum seed dictionary.  Let's just assume (for simplicity's sake) that there's 10,000 (10^4) words. 
If there's 12 random words, there's (10^4)^12 = 1.0 * 10^48 possible combinations.  
If there's 5 known words (but order unknown) plus seven random words, there's (12!/7!)(10^4)^7 ~= 9.5 * 10^32 possible combinations. 
Based on this, your seed is roughly 10^15 times easier to crack.  This is a significant difference.  Is it really enough of a difference that it will be possible to crack?  Potentially not.  A supercomputer capable of checking one quintillion possible hashes per second will still take 9.5*10^14 seconds ~= 30 million years.  However, the uncompromised seed would take many many times longer than the universe has existed.

I'm sure they understand bitcoin mining, but the process at a large previously-existing company to develop and roll out a brand new product is much longer and more complicated than rolling out a brand new product from a brand new company like most of the ASIC mfrs.  I'm sure it was a FANTASTIC idea when they first had it, but because it took too long to gain traction and to actually design/implement it, it's too little, too late.

So, most of them don't work.  Here's an explanation of all of them (and whether they work or not):
* Buy/Sell (Standard) - These are the same as above.
* Buy/Short (On Margin) **DOES NOT WORK** - Margin trading lets you buy or sell more BTC than you actually have or can afford.  CampBX will lend you the rest.  This means that if you buy twice as many shares as you can afford, your profits (and losses) are doubled from changes in price.  Short Selling is basically like selling BTC that you don't have, and buying them later (ideally when the price has dropped).  I like to think of shorting as "buying negative BTC".  
* Margin/Leverage **DOES NOT WORK** :  This is the percentage of the shares you're actually paying for.  I  believe CampBX's minimum is 52%.
* Price:  This is the limit price of the order you are entering
* Stop Loss:  A stop loss is an interesting feature.  Essentially it allows you to automatically sell BTC that you buy if the price drops by a certain amount (percentage or $ amount).  I do not know if this is enabled yet (the interface says "not enabled", but I've never tried).  I much prefer the feature of a "trailing stop", which adjusts itself upward as the price goes up.  CampBX does not appear to support the trailing stop.
* Fill or Kill (FOK):  This is an order submitted that is either filled immediately in its entirety, or cancelled entirely without purchasing/selling anything.  I don't see much reason to use this at all, unless you are trying to check if someone has submitted a Dark Pool (see below) order. 
* All Or Nothing (AON):  This is an order that will not be filled in small segments, only all at once.  Again, I don't see much reason to use this.  
* Dark Pool:  This feature makes your order not show up on the Depth Chart.  It is useful if you are a major player in the BTC world and want to manipulate the market without anyone being able to tell what is happening.  You can also use this to avoid having someone beat your price by $0.01.
Most of this isn't much use.  Stop Losses are useful, Margin trading is useful for day traders (but also raises the risk as much as it does the reward).  Unfortunately, I don't think any of the useful features are actually enabled!
PS Happy Cake Day!

CampBX has margin options (long/short) and BTC withdrawals.  You can also withdraw to and (starting next week) fund from your US bank account via ACH.  I use them and they're good aside from low volume.  I can give you a referral link if you're interested (you get a better rate if you sign up via a referral link, or at least you used to).

Lack of context/knowledge of the context can cause that pretty easily.  Not knowing who the Boston Bruins are or what their logo looks like, but knowing the bitcoin logo makes this an easy mistake to make.
I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA.  When I was a small child, a friend of my parents asked me "what do you think about Mario" while they were watching Hockey.  I responded "I LOVE MARIO, ITS THE BEST VIDEO GAME EVER" because I didn't know they were talking about Lemieux.  Same scenario.

Lets say you're holding 500 BTC on CampBX.  Let's say you sell all of it at market value right now.  You're going to drop the maximum bid by 25% at least.  Then, you plop down a 500 BTC buy order a decent chunk above the maximum bid (High enough to avoid the influx of new bids, but Low enough that you can buy everything back for less than you sold it for), but you place it in the Dark Pool.  The chumps who jump in to fight for bids will be fighting below your price, and the people who are panicking and issuing new SELL NOW SELL NOW orders will be selling you their bitcoins.  Do a little ???????, and PROFIT!

TIL that "Decibel" is simply a measure of ratio.  I wanted to post to correct you for misusing it, but you didn't!  I thought its use in audio meant that it in some way referred to the power (wattage) of the audio source.
However, you're wrong about your math, so I still am going to correct you.  $1.20 -&gt; $0.90 is a decrease of only 1.2 decibel.  3.2 decibel would be closer to $1.20 -&gt; $0.55.  
(Source:  10 * log (1.20/0.90) = 1.249)

From CampBX's FAQ:  Dark Pools or Dark Liquidity are orders that deliberately do not advertise their liquidity. In other words, the order exists but you cannot see it in the Depth Table till your order "trips" on a Dark Pool.  
Based on this explanation, I feel like regular orders can "trip" on Dark Pool, but maybe it's just poorly worded.

Gotta say, I don't know that I think this really counts as "spread the wealth".  Those who see reasonable gains from mining (to whom transaction fees matter) are ALREADY wealthy.  In some cases, pools don't even pay out the transaction fees to their miners, simply keeping the transaction fees for the pool.  If you wanted to really "spread the wealth", you'd be better off finding good folk on reddit and tipping them, or donating to a charity like Sean's Outpost.

From Electrum's website, they encode their 128-bit random seed as a string of 12 words.  Thus, each word holds 10.666666... bits of entropy, meaning their dictionary could hold as few as 1,626 words.  
If we're considering the MINIMUM security, the supercomputer would only have (12!/7!)(1626)^7 ~= 2.855 * 10^27 possible combinations.  The same supercomputer would only take 2.855 * 10^9 seconds ~= 90.5 years.

I wish American newspapers carried Cryptics.  As far as I'm aware, the only regular one is the NYT's "Variety" Cryptics, which they only publish once a month, and they often aren't very challenging (I assume because Americans aren't as familiar with cryptics, so they have to make them easier for us).  All the good cryptics I find are UK-styled, and I feel my lack of UK-topical knowledge really hurts me when I try to solve UK Cryptics.

Right, if you scan 100 million hex addresses (sequential or not makes no difference), you will have 100 million separate chances to hit one of the (however many million bitcoin addresses have ever been used) out of 2^256 - 1.  You're easily dropping a dozen zeroes off the end of your odds.  
It's still 1/10^65 or so, which is all but impossible.  
Also, hey OP, have you seen  ?  It's a sequential list of every single private key/public key combination.  Hop onto a "random" page and start checking links, maybe you'll find an address with some money!  I won't be holding my breath.
