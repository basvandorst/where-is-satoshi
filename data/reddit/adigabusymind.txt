I feel responsible for this drop.... since the day I bought, about 2 weeks ago, bitcoin didn’t go $1 higher than the buy price. 
Who wants to buy my bitcoins to get everything back to normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:07:21
Saved, will do when i get wifi. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:09:02
Lol, thats very religious. Your answer is like a radical muslim would answer something about god.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:36:40
Thank you. There is no reason to be mad. And if you think im an ass, please dont help me.
Getting back to your link, you are missing my point,
My point is that the number is arbitrary, and actually means nothing, be it 5 or 50. If we can now do something other than bitcoin and mine a new 21million of it, that makes my investment in bitcoin immediately worth half. Then a new one comes out, now the value of my invest is third and so on until its worth nothing. There is infinite digital currency.
Do you own any bitcoins? And are you willing to sell it? If yes why?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:38:24
Thank you. I am reading but its a very large space.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:57:39
Ok, your analogy made me realize that you and i are on completely different pages,

God! I am not lecturing, from what i read, i reached this conclusion, if my logic is not correct, tell me i am wrong, and tell me where did it go wrong. So that i can fucking understand, if you dont have enough understanding of my basic questions, dont answer.
If you do, then dont say that they are basic, and give some perspective of your own, opinions that you came to after reading and learning, dont send me links of other peoples opinions.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:23:03
I am not. 
I thank everyone who answered my questions, and i am asking followup questions. if my questions are that basic then i would like appreciate the conversation.
Many have answered with go read somewhere else, which is not what i am looking for.
And others gave me answers that are not scientific which i am also not looking for.
After all.... maybe i am a cunt in real life, its always good to be evaluated in order to become a better person.
If i offended you, i apologize.

Our central bank said the same, but not for those reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:55:42
Remember that someone bought pizza with a lot of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:01:04
You speak as if you will never get sick. Just be content with whatever you have right now. And say thank you.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:25:21
Honestly, thats why i am afraid of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:25:24
I hate the fact that we write their worth in US dollars! Thats somewhat meaningless!
From now on,  lets use bitcoins as a way to declare wealth. Hehe
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:11:09
Fair enough. Will do. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 20:33:04
And i still dont understand how to buy bitcoin, and if i did, and wanted to sell it, how will i receive my money. I live in a third world country. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:12:48
I bought some on the dip.... seems like I did not buy enough!
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:49:28
Good for you, thats amazing. People who understand the probability that you can get filthy rich or get back to zero roughly have the same probability are the ones who really benefit at the end.
The only better scenario here is that you are already doing financially great and the these investments are a small fraction of many, then you can gamble a little more. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:15:04
Thank you, i would like a conversation, i want to sit with someone who understands this and talk to him, not just learn, i have no friends who understand bitcoin, thats why i asked here, but thanks i will look for the channel.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:55:38
No i mean who said there is only 21m? Why didnt they start at 5 million only or 50million or any other number.?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:31:03
With all due respect but the ELI5 in the link you sent me missed a very important aspect, where did the apple come from?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:59:46
This means that there is actually infinite amount of bitcoins right? They can get consensus anytime and destroy the system. How does something with infinite amount be of value? 
@_date: 2019-12-28 02:53:04
They won’t see it coming bro. I am pretty sure it will be so exponential. Just like how startups overthrow giants before they get the chance to react.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:20:17
Large majority consensus from whom? and will that be the equivalent of printing money without gold as a reserve? Or is it more like breaking down the currency into smaller bills?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:32:28
Why is there only 21million in the first place? I mean who decided this number? And why should i trust him?
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:05:00
I think people are cheering for the wrong target. Reaching $100k or $1m is worthless, because it puts you at a position that the only way to benefit is the sell out, which will just make the price go down again. And sense everyone thinks the same, we will all act the same.
That’s why Bitcoin will never go up using these mechanics, and as fast it goes up the faster it will go right back down. Brining only momentary triumphs for a very selected few, and losses to many, who will never buy bitcoin again. Again losing the long term game. 
It’s like a business setting a target to make $1b in 5 years and not executing on it by offer new products or expanding to new markets and brining real value to the market. 
The only goal that people should be focusing on is adoption and transaction-ability and any additional “value adding elements” that are on top of the nature of bitcoin and block chain value adding properties. Then People who have bitcoin become really rich.
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:36:45
Is the cost worth living in that world. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:08:42
This might be a stupid question, but what is the function of minors after bitcoin mining ends, and what would be the incentive to keep such a rig?
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:32:32
You have no idea the number of times i thought of creating a wallet for my family back home just to send them money, then remembering that the bitcoin community did not develop there yet, for me to this.
I am sure many think like me, when people realize that they can bypass all government taxation on international transactions, even businesses will prefer this.
This by it self is the reason why i am holding and invested in bitcoin.... 
On the other hand, i wonder the amount of anarchy we will create when we start doing this more and more. Governments will crumble.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:02:13
No one is going to regret anything, just like gold, people might start using it, then everyone will be using it after they paid for its fair price. 
No real advantage of being first in a currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:03:00
You said dollars hehehe
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:33:06
well i also posted about this here before and people here acted like religious extremists. as if i was offending a religion, when in fact i was trying to reflect my views and predictions with the hope of someone really showing me the right path but no one did. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:20:22
What is the value of compressed air?
The best analogy i came up with to explain the issue is that, bitcoin is basically Compressed Air, it has value because its compressed, but my compressed air is nothing more special than the one you compressed, and there is an infinite amount of air and a very large amount and types of compressors. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:18:28
Whats bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:20:38
I will buy in when i reach a point where i can buy a complete bitcoin, just for the fun of it, because i missed that the first run. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:12:54
No, because going back to regular cash and be filthy rich is like admitting that crypto is useless, and to stay rich they have to HODL and believe in crypto and only spend on a very limited selection of things. Fucked up situation where the only answer is to stay on Reddit and make cryptomemes
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:08:51
Because of this post I went in and bought some lol
