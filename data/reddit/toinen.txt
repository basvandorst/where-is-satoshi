Winning Mahatma Gandhi sounds nice, but hasn't he been dead for decades now?

That's a very much useless statement. There is no way to verify what source of energy the miners use (unless solar and nuclear were the only possibilities for every person in the whole world).

All you need is one exchange that operates mainly on some altcoin. Once that makes a good profit the rest will follow. Setting up an exchange is not too hard. Bitcoin's main advantage is the userbase, which comes form the first mover advantage.

Investing in anything you know nothing about is as good as setting your money on fire.

What are the naysayers saying exactly? That bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine? That bitcoin has long transaction times and large fees? That bitcoin is a deflatory currency? That most people here only care about the price and hype without understanding shit of the technology? That there are significant political risks still involved?
Yeah! Let's make them look stupid! Come on!

According to [this]( one transaction takes the same energy as powering your whole house for a week. If you don't care about the environmental footprint, you should at least understand that the miners who use this energy will want their money back - in the form of high transaction fees. Now that's a problem.

It still does not resolve the problem that using a lot of energy (regardless of means of producing the energy) is expensive. The ones to pay for the energy are the users in transactions, in particular once the last bitcoins are mined.

This is a genuine problem with bitcoin. All we need is one shock where bitcoin is in trouble and an altcoin without the same problem will replace it. After that bitcoin will never recover.

The only problem with your analysis is that **there are alternatives to bitcoin that consume much less energy**. Is there an alternative to your 747 jet (realistically)?

"I will hodl till 1 BTC = 100kUSD, then cash out in USD!" The good old sell-it-to-the-greater-fool investment strategy.

My doubts:
* Bitcoin is a deflatory currency. If it becomes the only currency it would probably crash the economy pretty hard.
* Time to confirm transactions is too long, which in a way is effectively preventing the first point from happening.
* Bitcoin is very good for illegal things (drug trade, tax evasion), which may lead to governments attempting to control it.
* Other blockchain technologies with more possibilities are just around the corner.
* Finally, posts like [this]( where an artist is selling a poster that predicts the end of fiat and rise of Bitcoin. He does not accept Bitcoin as a payment, only fiat.
