How long have you waited? I'd be worried that their contact page says that they will get back to you within 48 hours. That is a long time for a company that is dealing in financial transactions if you ask me...

They literally recorded a recording of a video (evident by the double watermarks on the bottom right near the beginning).
They didn't mute their mic either, so you hearing really weird sounds throughout.
I get that people will always be coming up with pyramid schemes to try and make money from morons, but I really would have thought they would take the time to at least try and make their stupid scheme appealing. Who would ever fall for this...?

No offence if you have anything to do with that project, but I just don't see it working.

I use a site called BitBargain. I recommend it to anybody buying in the UK.

You'd be surprised how many people do leave unencrypted TXT files containing passwords on their PCs. Like btsfav said, given the Stack Overflow thing, it's not inconceivable.

I don't see $1000 USD/BTC happening until some way into 2017. Would need a sharp investment to have it happen in the immediate future.

This is possibly the worst video I have **ever** seen on the internet.
Clear pyramid scheme...

Why would anyone sell 2000 Bitcoins to someone without having any ID or verification... especially if the buyer is using a credit card...?
It sounds **very** shady..
