I would direct people to Wikipedia - Changelly.  Specifically this paragraph:
Fraud allegations
Changelly has recently faced accusations of stealing money from their customers, commonly claiming "errors" in their transactions and refusing to answer technical support inquiries. [7]

Still no contact from Changelly.

I have finally had a response from Changelly.  They have refunded me .47 BTC.  Here is my response to them:
Thank you for sending 0.47044275 BTC.
There is still a problem! 
The original transaction was to exchange BCH to ETH. 
When that did not work and produced an error message I asked you to refund my BCH. 
Instead of that you have exchanged my BCH to BTC and skimmed US $1200 off me in the process. 
Please refund me US $1200 urgently. 
Here is how the math works out:
Todays prices on coinmarketcap.com.
Bitcoin: $13,857 .
Bitcoin Cash: $2573. 
I Sent you 3 x BCH = $7,719. 
You have refunded .47 BTC = $6512. 
$7719 - $6512 = $1207. 
Please immediately refund me $1207 which is still owing to me.  Note I did not ask for the exchange to BTC I asked for a refund of my BCH.  But even the exchange to BTC should not incur an exchange rate that costs $1200.  
You are working in the crypto currency  space to make things better than the banks.  Even the worst bank on earth would not charge $1200 to exchange funds.

In my opinion Changelly is very slippery indeed.  I believe they are committing fraud.  We will see if I am right.
I have registered a complaint about this company with the Prague Police.  My complaint meets their criteria and they have opened a file which is being handled by the Interpol branch of Prague Police.  I am very grateful for the professionalism of the Prague Police. 
If you have had a similar experience with Changelly you can contact the Prague Police at this address interpol
