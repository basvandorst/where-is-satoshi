You are talking about arbitrage, many have tried and failed as far as I know.   
The biggest problem with it is the speed and cost of moving bitcoin from one exchange to another, by the time the move is complete the market could have moved against you.   
To make a profit you have to move the actual coins you bought, there is no point in converting them to FIAT then moving them, it defeats the purpose.   
You could look at alternative coins that don't cost too much to move and move faster, however you would also have to take into account the liquidity of such coins.   
Usually you would not be able to liquidate a large amount enough to make it your worth while as the difference would not be significant enough.   
I've found that the larger the difference in price between exchanges the greater difference in liquidity.   
But perhaps there is a coin and a set of exchanges out there that hit the sweet spot, who knows.

Of course they have not changed their tunes, because they are the ones playing the music.   
They sold at the highs, now they are just waiting for all the "hold crowd" to finish panicking.   
So they will then start buying at very cheap prices.

Correction, the marketcap is determined by the price and amount of coins in circulation.  
i.e. the price of bitcoin determines the marketcap not the other way around.   
There are a lot of people who believe rarity does affect the price, however at the end of the day that does not play a major part on the valuation of the price.    
The main reason the price moves is because of hype, the hype could be positive or negative that is what will determined the movement.   
Since hype is what drive the price then it will move erratically, it will either rise up fast or drop down fast.   
The reason why it drops down faster is because the majority of people playing cryptocurrencies are new to trading so they have weak hands holding, the smallest sign of negative movement they panic sell, which causes are chain reaction...

It really could be many different reasons, or maybe no reason at all.   
The point is bitcoin has risen up high all based on hype.   
Hype alone can not sustain such an over valued price.   
So, it could be South Korea negative but false reports that the government was about to shutdown exchanges over there.   
Could have been that Bitcoin Cash HASH power is increasing.   
Could be that China is cracking down on illegal crypto farming companies.   
Could be someone sneezed and put a wrong order.   
The point is that people are in it based on hype, so when people see it go down, then they panic and start to sell, which causes a chain reaction, and since the price is up high based on hype alone, then there is no economic foundation to keep it up there, thus it will just drop.

OP is not pretending that at all, and he already said that most only care about making a quick buck.    
That may seem normal to you, however that is not how bitcoin or cryptocurrencies  are meant to work.    
If people don't realise that we will again be in the same situation either with bitcoin or any other cryptocoin.   
Generally if a cryptocoin is accepted **and used** globally, it will benefit the majority of the worlds population.   
Right now the financial system is designed to benefit only the elite and the rest are left to a dog eat dog type of life.   
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:31:41
If Bitcoin does not have a practical use, what is the point?   
why keep on repeating the "hodl" mantra?   
This is exactly why it drops so suddenly, and why it is so volatile.   
No one is using it, everyone just wants to hodl...    
which means it has no purpose other than hype i.e. speculation.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:04:35
No it is an unregulated space in that sense, they are not connected.   
This is due to many factors but the main reason is because of location. Different countries have different laws on how these exchanges can work and who can use these exchanges.   
The price is really determined organically by the users(traders), the exchange entity itself does not decide what rate it should sell at.   
People put bid and ask orders, the exchange simply matches these and executes the matching orders, that is what determines the price.   
Since each exchange is working with majority of local users, then each exchange has varying amount of users which means volume/liquidity varies from exchange to exchange.   
If one exchange has very little liquidity then usually means that their price will lag to the rest of the other major exchanges.   
Some times it will catch up or suddenly just drop which again depends on what the orders are at.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:27:04
You say that now, however when it is a bull market, none repeats that.   
I keep on saying it all the time and get down voted "for spreading FUD"
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:08:42
Decentralized is not about who has access, It is about who controls the access.   
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:40:56
While I wholly agree with your post the only reason you got upvoted is because of the current crash in price.   
Had you made the same post back when it was around 20K mark you would have been downvoted for spreading FUD.   
As you mentioned greed is what pushed the price up and if people continue to yell HODL! then the original purpose of cryptocoins in general is out the door.   
I've been saying this here and other crypto related subs, but get downvoted for it.   
I too hope this wakes people up and shakes the greed out of the crypto space.    
We need functional alternative crypto currency, not a speculative commodity that is driven purely on hype.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:16
more like echo chamber
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:31:39
The old crypto adage was and **always should have been** "only hodl what you can afford to lose"   
Unfortunately this has not been said enough, so now you have people who have jumped in not only without knowing what they are getting into but also with the incorrect mindset that "bitcoin is going to make them rich".     
Furthermore the bigger problem is that "FUD talk" is feared so much and despised.   
I would say that if Bitcoin is something so legit and has a purpose and true value, then all the panic and negative talk in the world should not affect its value so much.   
People seem to treat it with cotton gloves "lest someone say something negative about it" just breeds more hype and blind belief which in turn attracts more people with blind belief and hype.   
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:56:23
Ironically it is made worthless because people treat it like it is worth something. i.e. that it holds value... most people treat it like a speculative commodity.  That is exactly why it can be manipulated into going up and down.   
The true value of blockchain and thus bitcoin is when used as an actual currency, when it is adopted to created economic trade, i.e. to buy goods and services.   
However that will never be realised until people stop buying/selling bitcoin as an "investment". 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:37
lol... you think you have deep enough pockets and big enough balls to take on wallstreet?  
Sure their actions are nefarious, however you need to learn to understand your foe.   
They not only have pretty much endless stream of money but they also have a huge experience advantage.  
The real reason bitcoin and other cryptos are so volatile is because it is top heavy with inexperienced hodlers.   
Inexperienced people use their emotions to buy and sell... i.e. panic.   
This is why it is so volatile, this is why they love it. They know exactly how to manipulate it. Because with deep pockets it is easy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:03:46
you really think that someone who got to the level of managing $500M trades with emotion?   
Your level of naivety is exactly why whales like that can manipulate the market    
If you had any idea how commodities markets work, the writing has been on the wall for a while now.    
a 30% or more correction was bound to happen, and guess who made money out of it?   
Those who have experience, not those who blindly hodl.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:19
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:03:44
That is the problem, none seems to be treating bitcoin like a currency.   
Everyone just wants to acquire it and hold it so they can make money.   
You don't treat a functional currency like that.   
When doing that you are not "investing" in the coin at all, you are investing in your potential gain, that is it.   
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:09:11
that "announcement" was a clear red flag.

10btc but I mined these in the early days, and just left them in the exchange for a rainy day. I was one of the "lucky" ones that did not buy them. I feel really bad about those folk that did though.

@_date: 2014-03-02 08:10:05
hmm, interesting take on this.   
But one thing does not add up.  
Your theory would work if people blindly put their their coins into mt-gox and then they could not ever check their balance.   
But every single person had the means of checking their balance.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:33:08
Firstly, mate I feel for you,    
but the document should tell you just how incompetent the people running Mt.Gox are.  
They were also making changes to their code on their live production systems, not even on a test UAT environment. These guys were not experienced enough to run a firm that big.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:55:54
I think more people in the crypto world need to understand the difference between currency and commodity.  
They are not going to treat Bitcoin as a currency but all the regular laws for commodities will apply.   
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:01:35
If it was a ponzi scheme they would have been caught out much much earlier since they are so incompetent.  
They clearly got it into a line of business they had no idea how to run nor manage.   
Basic financial, technical and logistical practices were not adhered to as you have quoted from that joint statement.    
Karpeles was running it with less care than a hobbyist would have, I mean their standard practice of making changes to the code was done on the live production environment. They operated with combined wallets that contained customers and the companies coins all mixed up.   
This guys just did not know how to run a proper business let alone a business that handles financial transactions in very large volumes and such very high frequency.   
I'm sure we will hear more about the ins and outs of how it was run by ex-staff soon enough.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:25:44
is there an app to map the tracking or does one just get a known address and simply plug in to the blockchain one transaction as a time.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:21:23
That would make sense if the thief had planned all along to wait until mtgox was insolvent and for the public to be informed and thsu watching every move that mtgox is making.  
Why would a thief do that, he would have moved those coins out of those known wallets straight away after gaining control and then would have kept on moving them until he cashed out.    
Why would they wait until now to start moving them.

Most likely it is a local issue for your area. Kraken.com is reachable.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:01:18
its not that simple.   
Even if this fork does succeed, which I think it will but with a relative small decrease in short term value for both coins.   
For this to happen miners, exchanges and users will be divided... lets say 50/50 this time (I know that is not the case).   
If anyone tries to push for another fork. the division will be less even an the hash rate i.e. miners can not keep on diving to one coin or another.   
It will be self defeating for any entity to try an push for another fork anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:26:41
The analogy is not correct.   
The claim is that **if such images exist in the blockchain** then anyone holding a copy of the the entire blockchain is also holding those images.   
The internet allows the flow of such images however "you" don't have the entire internet's data flow going through your computer and you don't store a copy of the entire internet, so it is not the same thing.   
Having said that, as far as I know while the blockchain would allow transfer of such images in fragments they would not be retained in the blockchain permanently because that type of data is eventually discarded. Anyone who can confirm or deny I'm willing to be proven incorrect.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:39:53
Best advice I can give is to keep access to your coins with **you**, do not leave it with any Exchange or online wallets.   
Only keep coins online that you are prepared to lose.   
The biggest losses in an albeit short Crypto-history have been because people are leaving their coins in exchanges **Exchanges are not banks** or in **on-line wallets**, in the cryptocoin world **you are the bank**.

in your wallet do the following.   
Help -&gt; Debug window -&gt; console
enter:  dumpprivkey **address you want the key for**   
also if you are using windows, the actual file that stores the keys is : 
of course this is assuming you did a regular run of the mill vanilla install, so check the date and time of the wallet.dat file. Once you are certain this is the file, back that up.   
for now if you can see your coins in your wallet, then you should be ok to wait until the dust settles.   
However, I would frequent forums like this one regularly to get the latest info regarding this change to the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:32:37
Well, it depends on which side will have the most pools i.e. miners.   
Without miners which ever side will lose no matter how many people are backing them.   
It really is sad that bitcoin came to this. the entire idea was that it was decentralised and thus not controlled by anyone. Seems like that is not the case at all.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:07:58
In short yes.   
However to be clear, you really did not "move your coins".  
Coins are kept in the blockchain think of the as kept in your own personal virtual safety box, that safety box is in the blockchain.   
The wallet application is really the key to open that safety box.   
So as along as it is you who is controlling the key then you are the one who controls access to the coins.   
If you leave exchanges to manage your key, then you are trusting them to control access to your coins.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:04:59
Although I do understand the point of the message.   
However to the noob on the street ... 
**"move your coins OUT of their wallet to a wallet that YOU can control"** means absolutely nothing without explanation.   
Even going to to bitcoin.com, bitcoin.org or any other "official" site, they say "it is your responsibility to chose the right wallet".   
Why not have or actually share the information people need?   
Why not have a single "official wallet" that the every day non-tech Joe can download and use.   
The bitcoin and the crypto communities seem elitist when it comes to sharing info which turns people away.   
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:10:10
I'm not suggesting that bitcoin will disappear, however the split will definitely affect the "bitcoin" brand and the idea that "no single entity controls it"
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:50:38
From what I've read, BTC-e was allegedly involved in FIAT money laundering as well as running their online exchange. So I don't think both parts of BTC-e are necessarily assumed to be one in the same.   
However, since the owner was arrested due to his alleged direct involvement in the illegal money transactions then they are holding all his assets during their investigation.   
Regarding the physical location and services used, I remember a case not long ago that all and any entity using .com domains fall under US laws. That and the fact the services used were located in the US, of course they are going to use that as a reason to apply US laws in order to shut them down.   
I'm not implying it is righteous or justified, I'm just pointing out how they play the game.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:36:21
HODL? yes, online? **no**.   
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:22:10
The point is that exchanges are **not** banks.  They are exchanges.   
You don't keep your money in exchanges.   
trade what you need then get it out to the wallet that you control.  
The biggest losses in crypto currencies have been because an exchange went bust, got hacked or the owner stole the coins.   
So, just like you would not leave any of your money at the local Travelex booth, same thing applies.   
OP is just reminding Bitcoin users about this because there is a major change happening to the coin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:23:22
