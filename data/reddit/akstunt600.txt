Bitcoins initial utopian goal of regular consumers running the network does not align with the current direction we have already diverged upon. Pooling and asics really lead to centralization as asic prices were kept aloft by misleading business practices, and a company chasing losses. We need to encourage users to run their own nodes despite the associated "difficulty" in doing so. Just like Gavin's tweet about SMTP, it comes down who you delegate authority of the txs to. If people ran their own email servers, would email be more secure? Email server aps for consumers could be easy to make but there isnt much of a profit incentive,  at least for the time being people don't see a better way to communicate. Bitcoin is a bit different in some ways than SMTP as it is closer to its p2p roots?

Ehh, the banks can't starve themsleves. I figure at some point it would have spurred innovation. Well as a matter of fact, I just left a job a few years a go that was taking advantage of this EXACT thing. We were offering compounded interest rate loans to small businesses because the banks were not lending. The banks found out and drafted new underwriting guidlines and made a new automated system to scoop up those that got dropped in the collapse. A few banks have partenered with the big names in the space and it all came full circle....

Trolls be shut down, heres why. The price just shot from $350 to $395 the day before it was at $300s. The thing to pay attention too is that are 6 million plus accounts ready to purchase btc. where as in the bubble there were only 1.5 million wallets. So a much smaller group of people were able to drive the market cap to over 7 billion. its 5 billion now. imagine if all 6 million wallet owners decide to invest like last time. well that is essentially what these new adopters are waiting for a low price point and a perfect market or a future pathway for the technology to form. Well it appears we have the recipe for a perfect storm... get in or get out... the next bubble is forming, and like any healthy, new economy it will continue this boom bust, but each time value and trust will be added.

@_date: 2014-07-15 19:40:56
Hmm, I have never had an issue. If you pay out to a bit pay merchant from Coinbase it is a normal on blockchain transaction. I have never had delays when sending from one btc address to another from coinbase either. So, I am not sure what your referring to. My guess is if coinbase was having any issues commiting txs to the network that they would be work to resolve it quickly, as it would likely piss off a lot of people.

Ehhh, I think merchants should be holding at least 30 some % and auto exchanging the rest via bitpay/coinbase etc.
Otherwise, Merchants will be crying or just generally upset when this next "surge" hits.(i will refrain from calling it a buble because who knows how long we will stay a loft)
It would be wise to encourage a hold policy, aka best practice for merchants. Otherwise shit they are NOT going to be happy when they exchanged over 10btc for a paultry +/-$500, after price hits +$3000 per BTC.
Also think about the economic growth that actions like this would spur for all of these new merchants. It would be a tremendous WIN/WIN for BTC merchants and consumers. They would tell all their customers and friends with huge smiles or content smuggness!!!! Maybe even remodel or reinvest in BTC.

OK, lets think critically here. Why haven't the big players done major TV adds and why haven't the merchants begun pushing adoption with discounts? The bottom line is that it is not show time yet. There are more features and a couple of apps that need to get dropped and beta'd across FOSS and private bitcoin endeavors. Once all this beta testing is done and a few more building blocks are secured it will be time to pin the throttle and ignite the afterburners( or wait SSRBs?)  The fun has only just started.

"Mt.Gox has been mired in problems ever since Feb. 7, when it halted withdrawals from its trading accounts.

When Mt.Gox discovered it was under attack, it stopped any investors from pulling their money out of their trading platform -- but it has yet to allow them access to their money"

I was also fairly careful both times it happened. Thanks to my NIDS i got from work i knew fairly quickly i had been comprimised and we easily able to finger the VM as the culprit. I investigated further and found that it was citadel both times. I went as far as to locate the irc server via tracing my steps and reviewing the sites i had visted previosly. A few stood out as odd, and I dont believe i ever added them to notscripts/noscript. The dns names resolved to NOIP.

"This fiasco is just simply embarrassing. First lets get it straight. There was never a direct issue with the Bitcoin protocol. It was an issue that effected just a handful of exchanges who ignored issues that had been pointed out before with transaction ID malleability. The key thing here is that Mt. Gox wasn't even using the the official Bitcoin wallet daemon to handle all the transactions. They instead would queue transactions with a transaction ID and then in turn try to process each tx through bitcoind. The problem here is that there was lack luster security exchange side protecting these txids.
THE ONLY FAULT OF BTC, is the lack of evolution in the both the daemon and the QT wallet AKA: We are developing too slowly to keep pace with the rapid adoption of Btc as both a commodity and a currency. These issues that Mt. Gox is experiencing are easily fixed by updating the code on which the exchange runs, This is comparable to if the NASDAQ collapsed due to a few bad algos and trading was suspended. On the flipside the issue could also have been resolved by releasing a more robust version of the daemon and QT wallets.
The manner and volume in which the disinformation was spread indicates other influences at play. The news media seems dead set at fingering the blame on BTC, this would seem silly if it weren't Karpeles that sat at the throne! Since he is in a position of power, and also one of the first people the news media would contact in the event of a failure of the BTC protocol he had an overwhelming effect on the marketplace as a whole."

What if you only had to pay for continuous "streams" of semi-unique content. Basically the detection algo would change or be updated all the time, like Google to prevent cheating. Users only pay for movie/video voice content after some time of use. All content is verified "semi-unique" by browser info and content requested. Basically the browser demo and device stats will be a primary factor in what you pay and it has to meet "consensus" I'm sure some basis can be formed from what I mentioned here. Basically is browser user sane? What is sane should be he/she be awake? If most users in that area sleep then less pay if content is more or less unique and/or specific more pay etc.
The "rules" would have to be easily tweak able to aide in rapid update to defend against game. But this can be done, but would always be cat and Mouse game. Lol
All data is encrypted after initial node to ensure privacy of user. Each stream is "tagged" or measured for pay. Pay would be distributed like he said pos/pow. I don't see any issues with this layout.....

The "Government", Bitcoin, Mt. Gox, and the Alt-coin markets.
 
 
We are at interesting point in time in human history where we are on the verge of a new way of life via currency. Currency hasn't changed since the first clay tokens of Mesopotamia. Now with Bitcoin we have a new way to go about things. Tokens that are accounted for absolutely and usable absolutely without a centralized authority.
 
It's seems once again that a great empire is falling, the empire of the United States Dollar. Lets not fool ourselves it is in it's essence a Ponzi scheme, a house of cards with USD as the single supporting pillar.
 
Lets face it the trust in USD is gone and is now being floated by lies and manipulation on a global scale. The NSA has been careful to make sure they have been obtaining as much data from the population as to know when to promote or demote a specific agenda. Matters of National Security are most easily quelled by controlling the flow of information.
 
No worries, Bitcoin to the rescue! It became clear at the debate in November that our government was taking a neutral stance with crypto-currencies, some would even say a positive stance. This interesting because it came after the news that China and Russia had been moving away from trading in USD, and that volume trades in USD were n a steady decline. Bitcoin almost immediately became a last ditch failsafe alternative in case of economic collapse. Shortly after the government had its "talk" about BTC, the rumors about JP Morgan, Sachs, and others entering the market started pouring in.
 
Silkroad.... How do governments fund blackops? How would one "test" out a new system to launder money? It is best worded as a craigslist style site that skims profit off the top. What a perfect environment for funding of back channel operations. A secret agent could receive both a message and a payment in complete anonymity if one knew how to do so.
 
 
Finally, Mt. Gox, This fiasco is just simply embarrassing. First lets get it straight, There was never a direct issue with the Bitcoin protocol. It was an issue that effected just a handful of exchanges who ignored issues that had been pointed out before with transaction ID malleability. The key thing here is that Mt. Gox wasn't even using the Bitcoin wallet to handle all the transactions, it instead would queue transactions with a transaction ID and then in turn try to process the through bitcoind. The problem here is that there was lack luster security exchange side protecting these txids. THE ONLY FAULT OF BTC, is the lack of evolution in the both the dameon and the QT wallet AKA: We are developing too slowly to keep pace with the rapid adoption of Btc as both a commodity and a currency. These issues are easily fixed by updated the code on which the exchange runs, This equivalent to if the NASDAQ collapsed due to a few bad algos and trading was suspended.
 
The manner in which the disinformation indicates other influences at play. The news media seems dead set at fingering the blame on BTC, this would seem silly if it weren't Knapels that sat at the throne! Since he is in a position of power, and also one of the first people the news media would contact in the event of a failure of the BTC protocol he had an overwhelming effect on the marketplace as a whole.
 
Co-incidence, I think not!
 
 
Why U No stabilize markets?
 
Boom Bust
 
Getting into crypto is popular, cool, and relatively easy when compared to traditional markets. The risk lower, yet the reward higher. Throw in a market that bounces up and down like a stripper on a pole, and your going to have people lining up around the block to get in on the gravy train.
 
The problem is that the boom must stay active and interesting to foster growth. There needs to be constant media attention and graphs that leave laymen drooling. All of these key elements seem to to remain present in the crypto.
 
When you compare USD to BTC and Altcoins to Yuan, lira, pesos, etc, things really start to look interesting.

Yeah, I would love to see a Coinbase feature on the merchant side that allows them to enable refunds in the case of a mispay, wrong ammount sent, or any other potential problems that could occur. A button would pop up in the merchant account allowing a refund for say 10-15 days after purchase.
What I mean by this is do not believe Coinbase should handle this themselves, they should make it availble for the merchant and the merchant can choose to enable it, if the merchant has it enabled the user can then request a refund on their end via a similar button. The merchant would also get a cool logo on there payment page stating that their transactions are "protected" or something.
Hmm, now i am thinking about all kinds of other cool ways to do this.
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:22:44
This can already be done using some open source stuff. Check out dd-wrt and the WAP services. It allows full setups like Starbucks to add injected stuff, and etc...
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:50:22
I would the markets have matured quite a bit 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:40:25
My sentiments, exactly.
Bitcoin got exactly this far because of principals, and core beliefs. 
NOT GREED
NOT PROTECTING A "BRAND" NAME
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:04:37
Really, you are getting down voted on this?  Anyone down voting, Just look closely at block propagation as it pertains to mining pools, it should be an eye opener as to what all this discussion around Block size is really about.
i think there is only one option here and its algo for dynamic block size. I understand that no one really agrees on how to do that, but this is the only direction i am comfortable moving in.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:11:57
YAY! This is great!!! Finally a headshop near philly that accepts cryptos!

That would be awesome, but I can think of numerous ways to game this system.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:54:15
Uhhh, this is not how Authy/Coinbase works at all. Authy is an additional layer of security for Coinbase. An attacker would have to have complete control over your email account and know your existing phone number. Furthermore, upon a change of number a notice is sent to your phone(the one to be changed) and your email notifying you of the change.This would be pretty hard to miss. On top of all that it takes 48 to 72 hours to complete the change request. So you have plenty of time to report an event if anything malicious were to happen.
Hope that provides some clarity.

Well said but its no cake walk yet. I'm out here on the therside just barely getting by.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:10:47
Well idk I find this even more signifigant. The thing to pay attention too is that are 6 million plus accounts ready to purchase btc. where as in the bubble there were only 1.5 million wallets. So a much smaller group of people were able to drive the market cap to over 7 billion. its 5 billion now. imagine if all 6 million wallet owners decide to invest like last time. well that is essentially what these new adopters are waiting for a low price point and a perfect market or a future pathway for the technology to form. Well it appears we have the recipe for a perfect storm... get in or get out... the next bubble is forming, and like any healthy, new economy it will continue this boom bust, but each time value and trust will be added.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:04:35
Heh, I dropped this as a theory a few months back, that many whales would dump to spur adoption.
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:41:59
Ok, well I had the same initial gut that increasing block size will impact the fee dynamic. I ended up agreeing with Gavin that there will be little or no short to mid term effect on the fee dynamic while we are still subsidy. What we really need to be careful of is not shooting our selves in the feet.
What happens when the subsidy is gone? Will miners be have full block? Will they have enough lummm zee duhm see compensationnnn.

SW or Segregated Witness is a block size increase too! It lessens the amount of data being sent across the bitcoin network while decreasing the amount of storage space required to run a full node!
More data = more contention, So scaling a less optimized codebase doesn't get us nearly as far...
by eliminating unnecessary stuff we can improve performance and scale. 
This is like a SUPER WINNING if you think about it.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:07:09
Thats with things as a constant. Bitcoin is dynamic. There is no telling...
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:07:34
Same as operation costs for a mine. Prospecting isnt cheap!
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:22:54
You are conflating 2 points. I'm simply stating one of the core fundamentals of a blockchain, Blocks must be as small as possible as to where there Is an equal chance for the majority of particpants to submit a block and have it received by the majority of particpants in an equal and fair manner. If the blocksize is increased, propagation latency grows very quickly relative to the ammount of new space gained. As propagation latency increases the likelihood of block collisions or race conditions increases drastically. This creates an issue where there can be more than one valid block given a set window of time. Bitcoin being an international borderless settlement/value system cannot be encumbered by an issue as serious as this. An issue like this could potentially cause dispute/war if adoption/dependency on bitcoin increases. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:17:49

@_date: 2016-12-31 18:16:52
As those limits are reached we fill blockchain "buckets" with "value"
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:53:03
cognitive dissonance strong with this one, or is it? This is really very confusing...
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:05:11
Hmm, looks like there is a 'conspiracy' to undermine the bitcoin network by misleading the userbase into thinking blocks are full when in fact the issue is simply that fees are not being scaled depending on current demand. This feature that allows fee estimation is commonly reffered to as "dynamic fees" and must be used to insure prompt transactions on the bitcoin network NO EXCUSES.
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:45:44
LOL, It's just the way system works bud. There is limited space because of the need to ship blocks globally with expedience. This needs to be an auction style thing to allow competition for space as the blocks need to be as small as possible. This creates a market around adding data to a blockchain. This is a requirement to keep traffic moving efficiently. Now comes the conspiracy bit. A few large wallet providers and exchanges have participated in wilfully ignoring the recommended guidelines for tx fees. These wallet providers and other services were sending all their customers txs with a tx fee that was too low for the given state of the network. This effectively creates a ddos and mislead many people to believe that blocks were full when in fact it was a handful of companies neglecting their user base to serve an agenda.

Yes, This we need great decentralization of pools. p2pool is great but  history shows that consumer miners are hasty when it comes to payouts.

Can bitcoin be spammed to a crawl if the BS increases 10x? Maybe what about 2x or 3x? I know we dont want to have to fork again.... but i mean lets not shoot ourselves in the foot here. Can we quantify the actions of miners at this time with near 100% accuracy? Is it this simple?
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:29:19
Ok, this problem is very simple.
Can you spam the blackchain at 1MB?
Can you spam it at 10MB?
Can you spam it 20MB?
Ok, now that you have thought out.... What about a DDOS using transactions that are free?
What will the miners do?
Well heres a sample config of one of my bitcoind:
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:51:06
The blockchain wasnt getting spammed to heavily and with only about 70 nodes on testnet at the time i doubt it could be too accurate. I propose a test using ltc!!! :p

Sure, data was transfered from one location to another, we just cant quite quantify it yet. :-)
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:17:54
Yes, exactlty. The point here is that data isnt really being moved its being "teleported"(in a sense) to another location instanaeously. the problem is understanding how and why this happens, but hey it works and its getting better. So, we are not talking about light based communication really(fiber optics). You send the photon using light initially, but you dont need to "send" the photon back to send receive....
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:10:07
WUTTT???? Mining in orbit totally works can even be done in different galaxies. Just have to send the entangled photons first...
Quantumn entanglment... If your not privy, it already works and its getting better, FAST!
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:09:27
None of this matters if the blockchain can get spammed to a crawl...
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:30:25
So I ask you again does it matter? really think about it....
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:11:15
It could easily be in fact big banks counting on an increase Block size to ruin bitcoin....... Just saying we need to crunch the numbers and see how a spammed blockchain holds up. We can finally use LTC for a test subject :p
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:24:25
Heh, Doubt it. This is the start of a better understanding of these technologies. Once someone figures out how to modify spin to represent data, without decoherence then hey, thats another step forward. We just got the first unconfirmed quantumn teleportation exepriment a few years back... Give it some time bruh? A few years at least.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:29:31
