Apparently Russia hacked RNC but didn’t give docs , but also Wikileaks turned down Russian docs

Assange didn't appear to be following that standard when dumping all emails compared to their earlier efforts to review cable material.
It's possible to support Assange's earlier work while being suspect of his more recent turns. This happened to people such as Bell, who worked at Wikileaks. It seems the organization took a turn to center around Assange's personal motivations rather than the general movement toward government transparency. We can't know all the details personally, but have to make judgements based on what information we can gather. In any case, I'm sure more will come forward in court.

I wasn't saying they refused to publish RNC emails. This is supplemental information. The info supports the idea that they didn't get the RNC info (according to reporting, but these are secretive orgs) However, reporting shows that Wikileaks turned down publishing documents regarding the Russian government, which is suspicious of Julian's claim for transparency. For me, the organization seems to have shifted from its original values.
I'd also recommend hearing what former member James Ball has to say, particularly about Israel Shamir

This is also Britain, where the laws are different. However, 1A in the US is against the government restricting speech, not businesses. It’s one of the reasons that cake shop didn’t have to make a gay wedding cake. 
However, I can see a non-legal cultural standard wanting to be upheld, which PayPal and a lot of other people don’t see applying. Businesses also have a freedom to associate. You don’t have to buy or provide services to someone due to political affiliation.
Bitcoin is filling in as it can. There are also other payment providers, but those can also reject. If not the courts, then in public opinion is where it can be redressed as it is now.

Well, best would be a course and accompanying textbook at your local college. However, here’s a more fun intro explaining how secondlife created a currency people use to power the secondlife economy 
Linden dollars work as a medium of exchange because of the monetary policy they enacted. Had they not expanded the money supply it could have resulted in hoarding. Interestingly their exchange rate still seems stable despite having a contracting economy.

Y’all need to read a monetary economics book

You should read up on Japan's economy. Deflation caused people to hold off on large purchases until they absolutely needed to. This slowed the Japanese economy. The answer is somewhere in between at a stable rate.

I'd agree, but economies are emergent, caused by the individual choices of millions. The central bank can influence by acting through the banking system but individuals can decide to spend a lot of money on tech stocks and real estate if they like. Unpredictability is inherent due to our uncertainty about the future and beliefs of consumers. If tomorrow people thought inflation would be 10% it would devalue the currency when nothing has really changed. You can see the impact through things like the false Chinese ban news today causing bitcoin to drop.

I don't see what that has to do with talking about the dangers of deflation, but I'd also say that economies are complex. Predicting the direction of an economy is taking into account more than one factor. For instance, your economy can be deflating, but productivity increasing, leading to growth. However, the very existence of this meme demonstrates the hoarding behavior experienced with deflation. Just as people rush out to buy things while they can in the case of inflation, people hoard money to get an even better deal in the future. If my money is increasing in value by 10% every year, I might as well wait to buy a car until I absolutely need to because every year I wait, it will be 10% cheaper. This sounds great, but when everyone acts this way, the economy slows down. Japan's situation isn't just about deflation, it's also about population growth driven by a strict immigration policy. But hey, that's their choice to grow their economy at half our rate. Money isn't everything.
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:54:38
The devil is in the details. If you like to hold a lot of cash or bitcoin, deflation is great because you horde money and your purchasing power increases over time. However, if this causes people on the margin to spend a little less, the demand for goods and services drops, cutting the economy's growth rate.
Also, trade deficits and inflation/deflation don't go hand in hand. Look at Germany.

So how are people assessing the fundamental value of bitcoin?
All the rationale seems to be based on the greater fool theory
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:49:22
I may have spoken too soon, but my concern is that crappy ICOs bought by people who don't know what they're getting into will drive up BTC by creating demand to buy BTC to cash out bad ICOs. When the companies show they are shams, demand will drop for BTC used to buy in and cause skepticism on the entire market. This would seem analogous to all the internet companies that launched in the late 90s to capitalize on the stock market fever. I'm just someone on the internet though, interested in more educated opinions.

 it's also commonly used as an example in any class on monetary policy. The great thing is you don't have to believe me. I encourage you to investigate.
also  Deflation can actually be much worse than inflation because the central bank has fewer levers to control deflation than inflation. Japan's central bank rate went negative for a bit because of this. 
In a broad sense, if we expect bitcoin to increase by 10% every year, I'd be less likely to use it as a currency and more inclined to hold onto it than spend it. This would result in hoarding. The point here isn't that no one spends the coins, it's that the people who would rather have 10% more money from holding than spending would stop spending.
