From the website:


Not sure I would trust the pentesting skills of a guy that just got social engineered out of 25 BTC.

This message brought to you by Coinbase ....
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:43:03
All right Luke Jr. The gig is up we know it's you.

That and they hand out more bans than changetips here. I used to actually like I started visiting other subs because they don't get butthurt over trivial things. Little wonder there is not wider interest when mods act like tumblrinas instead of fostering discussion.
I'll await my next 7-day ban that will surely follow these comments.

Welp I'm convinced. He donated ~~1~~  **2**BTC to himself, sounds legit! :D

They just added paycoin and reddcoin. No way I am touching this service with scam coins on the roster.

Very nice site, and just in time for me .... I am searching for a few new domain names :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:24:51
Impressive work! Keep it up. I don't have a whole lot of bits on here yet (Just learning/new to changetip) but here ya go. Enjoy!
10 bits private

I wish those reddcoin spammers followed that advice. The 5 cent tips everywhere is more ridiculous than doge.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:20:21
Nice as always! Thanks for the updates.
10 bits @_date: 2015-05-25 00:55:40
Yup, ready fr the big time.

If it wasn't for reddit, what would I do with all that popcorn I get for Christmas?
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:05:18
Just making my casual appearance since the topic is shit.

Band-Aid for teh butthurt ( ::: [ ] ::: )

Now you can watch your Bitcoin dissappear *IN HD!*

lots of worthless "tip" coins like reddcoin
@_date: 2015-09-12 14:44:51


No, it seems Satoshi vanished not long after Gavin made his intentions known.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:26:03
I'd much rather use bitcointalk than this garbage site brought to you by Mr. Meltdown who will lose his shit and dox any user that disagrees with him. Or owes him $50. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:59:00
The "girls" of like to pull this one lately, that sub being so well moderated and all.
@_date: 2015-11-26 00:21:36
Maybe I should start selling cases for $200. If these morons pay $400 for a pi with an obsolete mining chip on top, they'll eat this up.

You're not missing a goddamnd thing. iirc it is a malware paradise, and judging from op's handle I am not surprised this occured.
