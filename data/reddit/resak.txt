There are 3k unconfirmed transactions. If you didn't pay a priority fee of .0002 btc it will probably take a little while maybe as long as 60 minutes. Depending on how many confirmations you require at the destination.
Edit: yea just give it some time.

You don't have any.

27k Unconfirmed Transactions at this time, you may be waiting a while, seems its at 37MB right now.... did you pay a transaction fee?
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:46:35
Look at the mem pool right now, 37MB of transactions, 27K transactions, no one is getting confirmations, I'm not sure if this is a "test" of the network or not.

Depends if you are pool mining or not. Right now it's roughly 2k a month at 95th after the halving. Which is most likely when he will have everything setup. That number will decay quite quickly if the difficulty continues to rise, which I'm sure it will if the price continues to rise. You'd be looking at an 8 month turn around for ROI.  If you get lucky and hit a block solo mining within the first three months, and then switch to pool, you'd hit ROI in like 5 months. This is of course IF the power cost 0$. 
If anyone has free electricity it is a no brainer to mine. I'm up like 800 canadian shrute bucks already.

With 95 th you could solo mine a block with some luck. Calc says estimated 102 days to generate a block. Now of course you have to assume the difficulty will go up. Meaning the estimate will go up as well.

Just do the math real quick, 0.00000001 is one satoshi, you have 0.03000000 so you have 3000000 satoshi. 3 Million satoshi. There are going to be a total of 21 million bitcoin in existence. The market cap for bitcoin right now is around 12 billion, and there is only around 16 million bitcoins released at this point at around 750usd. The price would have to increase to around 100 million dollars per bitcoin for yours to be worth around 3 million (enough to retire). The market cap would be around 2 quadrillion. The 2016 global market gdp is only around 100 trillion. Sooooo good luck.

there would be aprox. 16675562 btc available next year this time. so 80,000,000,000 / 16675562 = 4797 per btc. Good Luck!

This is so spot on it hurts. I love the idea of bitcoin so much, but I feel like everyone is getting more out of it than me, even if I make a couple good trades. I used an atm in my home town to sell some btc so I cousd prove to myself I could make actual dirty fiat. When I approached the atm I noticed a huge difference in price between selling and buying btc. Nearly 70$ cad. I sold .25 btc for 90 dollars canadian so I could reassure myself I could get an ROI. Trading sites take more than I think they should for the trade as well, considering we know how much the actual trade costs them.  I think I paid .01 btc for a trade the other day. If it was between me and a friend it would cost us .0001btc to do the trade.
