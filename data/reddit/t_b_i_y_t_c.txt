Nor do I
It's the cartoon fantasy "to the moon" that was stolen from pink sheets.  Certain people are comparing this whole thing to penny stocks.  It doesn't seem right.

Right.  So 14 dollars is ~$1,400.
The moon?  You're going to retire on additional $1,400?  The one guys math just doesn't add up.
I'll crawl back in my hole.  I just don't understand false boasting.  I'm sorry I brought it up.

Not until it's sold.

Does anyone here posting all the "to the moon" stuff own more than 5 bitcoins?  Are people truly this excited about a $100 or so gain?  I see posts all the time about "finally splitting the cost of one coin".
I'm just trying to figure out the daily hoopla about tiny percentage point spikes.  The growth is wonderful but I find all the slum hour nonsense here annoying.

So that's a no?  Thank you for answering my question.

It's the roller coaster cartoons.  I don't have a job.

Thank you.  I can understand the sigh of relief but that is a different cartoon image.  Not the roller coaster to the moon.

Also I didn't notice the entire week gain
I'm late to the party but that still isn't a moon rocket.  I use to piss 15K

Thanks, dick.

Why would they do that?  I've never heard of that.  I called the bank and he told me he couldn't see anything on his end coming to them.  Only the money they sent to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-09 14:04:15
I'm going to stop using them for sure.  I had a support ticket going back and forth with someone and then he just turned it off.  I couldn't reply any more.
