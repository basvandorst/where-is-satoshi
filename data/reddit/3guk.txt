At least store your coins on your laptop - get a desktop wallet where you control the private keys.

It still kinda shocks me the number of people who think that keeping money / crypto on exchanges is a good idea...
Mtgox anyone ?

I believe you can still order from the US site, I used to order from the US site all the time, and never had a problem with customs duties.

Not tried spending bitcoin with them, but these make an awesome present, I have loads of them - and the seller is one of the nicest guys you'll ever chat to !

The only thing I'm vary of being promoted is that off "free, instant transactions", I know the UK is probably an outlier with this one, but I've never paid GBP &gt; GBP.
I have to pay a small fee £9 for GBP &gt; EUR (3 day transfer) and £25 GBP &gt; EUR (next day). But my understanding of this is due to the European banking system being behind that of the UK.
The vast majority of GBP &gt; GBP payments are made instantly, with a few taking around 2hours, and a tiny percentage being next day.
I love bitcoin, and have already started to invest, but to guys from the UK, instant and free aren't really a selling point !

Use a webwallet from someone like blockchain - however, once you start to accumulate more, avoid keeping large amounts in "hot wallets".

I think you can sell through bitinstant, although I haven't really looked into it, I guess you have to go through more verification.
Kinda excited to spend mine and buy things rather than converting back to GBP.

When you sign up to bitinstant you get given another  address (someone correct me if I'm wrong here) that your BTC gets transferred into - once this happens you are then prompted to transfer them from the bitinstant address into another one, in this case I used my blockchain one !
I've saved my address in my 1password app on my iphone so I can always find it. I'm still reading up on addresses and wallets so forgive me if I'm not using terminology.
I've also got the blockchain app on my iphone which shows my address when opened, and a qr code that you can easily scan with other apps.

I've always been tempted by localbitcoin, the niggling feeling that I'd find someone who would mug me and take all my money is preventing me from doing it.

Based in the UK, I guess thats always an option.

UK is difficult I think, Bitstamp is probably gonna be your best best.
I use bitbargain.co.uk - but I'm only buying between 8 and 10BTC at at time.
