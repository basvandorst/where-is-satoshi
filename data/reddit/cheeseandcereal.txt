Great questions.
So first of all, I'll try to clear up your understanding of a wallet which should hopefully clear up some confusion.
A wallet is simply a piece of software which manages a collection of keys which themselves can manage and generate addresses.
A 'wallet' isn't really the proper term for it, and I wish we could go back in time and change the word because a crypto 'wallet' actually never stores the coins themselves, it only stores the keys needed to access the coins which are always stored on the blockchain. It's much more of a keychain than a wallet.
Now crypto wallet software have to follow certain standards which basically make them to be interoperable. I don't know if you've heard of the concept of a 'seed', but a seed is basically a list of 12-24 english words, which is used by every wallet in order to systematically generate crypto addresses and their associated keys.
Because of this, you can actually do something such as: create a new wallet using some software like BreadWallet, write down the seed it generates for you at the beginning, completely destroy your breadwallet, then import that original seed into ANY bitcoin wallet software/app of your choosing (which supports importing a seed, which is most of them) and you can still access all of the money.
The only way that wallets really differ are in the software, which matters for how transactions are created, and keys are stored, but they all work fundamentally in the same way in regards to accessing coins themselves on the blockchain. A hardware wallet is nice because it means those keys which can access all of your funds are simply stored on an offline device where the keys themselves are never transmitted to any computer. This makes them better from a security perspective since you can't really 'hack' the keys off of them, which theoretically can happen with other bitcoin software like using app, but they can use the same seed as any other bitcoin wallet.
Because of this, the blockchain doesn't even recognize different wallets. It only sees addresses and transactions. This should hopefully answer your first 2 questions.


It's as easy as using the software from each respective wallet to generate a new address to receive the bitcoin (done automatically by wallets, you just have to copy the address), then using the other wallet to send the actual coins with a transaction. Basically you're just using the two wallets to make regular bitcoin transactions which is easy.


As I was talking about before, the blockchain doesn't even have the concept of a wallet, it only sees addresses and transactions. Therefor it doesn't matter. You can transfer funds directly to any wallet you like.
To answer your last question:


So as I mentioned before, wallets don't actually store the coins themselves, they simply store a seed which can generate addresses with their relevant keys. A 'trick' that is often used is that a wallet can use the same initial seed to generate a whole different set of addresses/keys for any altcoin (assuming the altcoin can use the same type of standard seeds, which is most of them). The only trick is that to generate/use the addresses, the wallet developers must implement the software for each relevant altcoin since the technologies between them are fundamentally different (each altcoin uses a different blockchain, and with it its own protocals/set of rules which a wallet must follow).
Because of this you could have a single 12-24 word seed which can generate/control funds on various altcoins, but maybe only certain different wallet software support certain altcoins.
So basically any wallet can always add support to store any crypto, it's just a question of if the developers choose to implement altcoins into their software, as well as choosing how to store different keys, or if they'll use the same keys for all cryptos (a common approach for hardware wallets).


As a 'wallet' is just a collection of keys: no. In order to transmit a transaction, your wallet needs to talk with a full bitcoin client with a full copy of the blockchain, but this is usually done over the internet to some other server. That way your devices never have to download a full copy of the blockchain themselves. For example BreadWallet would have some full Bitcoin node/client running somewhere, and simply have everyone using breadwallet transfer their signed transactions to their Bitcoin client which they run, which can send that transaction out to the network.

Honestly I don't have any suggestions for BTG wallets. I don't really actively use BTG.
Just to make sure we're clear, by 'claim', do you mean you want to move your BTG? If you want to keep holding it, there's no reason to 'claim' it since it will sit in an address owned by your keys forever without you having to do anything.

The biggest fundamental difference between BTC and BCH is block size. BCH has an emergent consensus model of block size which allows them to produce blocks 16x the size of BTC (but could get even bigger in the future). The benefit of this is being able put more transactions into a single block, making less competition for blockchain space, lowering fees. This, in combination with its FAR less utilization vs BTC makes fees for BCH transactions very low (practically free).
This is a great solution for the short term because you can transact BCH with no fees for the near future. This solution of larger blocks to handle transaction fees is linear, which means that for fees to stay down with exponential adoption, blocks will have to grow exponentially, leading to an unmanageablely large blockchain over time.
Higher layer solutions like the lightning network coming to BTC provides a different perspective on scaling. Rather than scaling the underlying layer 1 protocol (bitcoin consensus itself), you can build layers on top of bitcoin as settlement. This way you don't have to grow the blockchain to unreasonable sizes and you don't have to record every transaction to the immutable ledger that is the blockchain. (do you really need your transaction buying a cup of coffee to be recorded publicly, in an immutable way so that it can never be censored? Probably not) Higher layer solutions also have the benefit of being opt-in. You aren't forced to use higher layer solutions if you don't want. But scaling with something like a block size increase isn't optional; everyone must agree. 
For example, with lightning network transactions, you can effectively do infinite bitcoin transactions, but you only have to report 2 transactions to the main blockchain. This way the fee for a regular bitcoin transaction becomes almost irrelevant if you choose to utilize the lightning network.
BCH is superior right now, and for the near future in the short term for transactions because of smaller fees. In the long term, higher layer solutions like the lightning network provide much better scalability in the long run, even with exponential adoption.
P.S. BCH transactions are not faster than BTC. They both use 10 minute blocks. Plus higher layer solutions like the lightning network can make transaction confirmations irrelevant/effectively instantaneous.

I don't really use bitcoin on my phone. Electrum is a great cross platform wallet which I would recommend. It also apparently has an android app (although I have not tried the android app).
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:30:31
Mining a block is also the mechanism that releases new bitcoin into the economy. By adjusting it so that they come out at a consistent rate, you can know the exact inflation rate which is one of the benefits of bitcoin.
Also there is the argument that increasing block speed or block size will make the blockchain grow too quickly and become less manageable in the future. It was a design decision when bitcoin was created.
These rules can be changed in theory, but a problem comes because any time you want to change the rules which bitcoin is built on, every miner, wallet, node, etc all have to update their software and agree with the new rules.
That agreeing part is called consensus and is particularly tricky. If part of the network updates to new rules, but the rest doesn't, you get a fork, and now have 2 seperate blockchains, thus 2 currencies. This is exactly what happened with bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold. It's also why ethereum classic exists. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:34:36
Yeah so you'd have to use the ledger wallet to generate a new BTG address which you will receive funds to. Then put your breadwallet seed into a different BTG compatible wallet and send your BTG to your ledger BTG address you generated from the ledger wallet.

if it's only 1 address, dumping the private key and importing it into a BCH wallet would be pretty quick and easy.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:31:37
How many addresses do you have your bitcoin cash in? If it's only a few, you can use the console in the debug window with the 'dumprivkey' command and the relevant addresses to get the private keys for individual bitcoin addresses.
From there you can import them into a wallet that supports BCH and manually move the BCH out. Of course this is only viable if your bitcoin cash is in a few addresses max since you have to dump and import the private key for each bitcoin address manually.

If you use a wallet which lets you set a custom fee, it isn't really that bad. I can regularly get transactions into blocks with fees around 20 satoshis/byte or even less. If it's a segwit transaction, that ends up being about 30-40 cents (USD) per transaction.
If you're not using a wallet where you can set custom fees, use a better wallet, and definitely don't treat your exchange directly as a wallet.
Obviously even 40 cents/transaction isn't viable for small everyday purchases, but with the introduction and utilization of technologies like the lightning network, you'll likely be able to push those fees back down to more reasonable levels.

The difficulty of mining a block is determined by an algorithm which adjusts the difficulty so that each block is mined by the network on average every 10 minutes. Mining is the process of computers solving cryptographic equations, essentially guessing until they get the right answer, which will create a block. Block size has nothing to do with the difficulty of mining blocks. This is done intentionally by the network.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:21:09
It's hard to say. When the price fluctuates greatly, you get people moving their money around to buy/sell. If the price stabilizes for a few days, I could envision the fee going down a bit more.
Alternatively, you could take your seed from your breadwallet and load it into a different wallet like electrum, and from there send your btc with a custom fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:49:19
Where are your funds currently stored? If you load your current funds into a proper wallet, you can set a custom fee pushing a transaction down to as low as 20 or 30 cents which still gets included in a block at some point (~20 satoshis/byte fee). If your BTC is currently in an exchange, then you're at the mercy of the exchange's chosen transaction fees, which are usually insanely and unreasonably high, regardless of the current mempool/average fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:20:26
Bigger blocks are a linear scaling solution to an exponential problem. To keep fees down with exponential adoption, you need exponentially growing blocks which is not a feasible long term solution.
In addition to this, larger blocks create a much faster growing blockchain (in terms of size). The argument here is that if the blockchain gets too large, it won't be as practical for regular users to run their own nodes because they will need better hardware, and so only bigger players with a bigger incentive to run nodes will run them, leading to a centralizing effect of bitcoin nodes.
It's generally agreed upon that expanding the block size to something like 2 or 4MB would be perfectly safe/reasonable, but for this to be implemented, a sound hard fork would need to be written and accepted by everyone.
A lot of people even reject the notion of a 2MB block increase (even when shown to be technically sound), because it sets a precedence, then consensus gets all political.
Either way, solutions that are able to handle exponential growth need to be created and implemented because linear block scaling is not a good long term solution for the problem of exponential adoption, even though it's a fair solution in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:51:27


This is not even close to true. A normal full block right now contains a bit under 1.5 BTC in transaction fees on average. The current block reward is 12.5 BTC. The new bitcoin being mined is almost an entire order of magnitude more valuable than transaction fees. (almost 90% of the mining rewards are currently due to the new bitcoin reward for the block, NOT transaction fees) 
This is the whole reason why SPV mining is even viable (and why pools occasionally mine empty blocks shortly after a previous block). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:04:45
Most of those sites are legitimate scams. Most of them don't even show you proof that they are mining in your name. Because of that, there are a lot of pretty sites just trying to scam people out of money.
It's easy to just make a site, take someone's money, and then give part of that back to them slowly, pretending that you're mining without any real hardware. 
Even if they were legit, you're still going to be paying a premium vs the actual enterprise running the hardware, so you'll still be disadvantaged.
In the end, mining just gives you BTC anyways, so in 999 out of 1000 cases you're better off just buying BTC with the capital you would have invested in mining.

It depends on your bank and how long the transactions take to clear. Since coinbase is using ACH to clear transactions from bank accounts, you'll never be able to get it under several business days because that's the minimum time ACH takes to clear transactions like that.

This is very far from the truth. First of all: Japan is a very heavily cash based society. A significant portion of Japanese shops, restaurants (even a fair few hotels) don't even take credit cards, let alone bitcoin. There are a fair number of large chains that do take every payment method imaginable, including bitcoin (like Bic Camera, Don Quijote, etc), and there are a few online services which take bitcoin, but they are far and few between.
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say you're more likely to find a shop that accepts foreign cash vs bitcoin. Also I want to know what bars (or izakayas) this article talks about, because I've never even heard of (let alone seen) one that takes bitcoin, and I have specifically gone out of my way to look for them.
With that said, bitcoin does hold a fair amount of public interest in Japan. Advertisements for bitcoin exchanges like bitflyer.jp aren't hard to find on TV, or even a few physical ads (like billboard-esque), but saying it's accepted everywhere is a joke. You'll be hard pressed to find any place that accepts bitcoin for payment in Japan anywhere except the largest retail chains.

Did you write down and save your seed for your wallet when you created it? If so, you can simply input that seed into any BTG compatible wallet. A wallet doesn't actually store the coins themselves, it simply stores the keys in order to access the coins which are stored on the blockchain. The keys are derived from your seed, so you can use your seed with any bitcoin (or bitcoin derivative) wallet to access your funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:40:05




That depends on the implementation of the hardware wallet. You certainly could have a device which generates a public bitcoin address and displays in on the device, but that's not the way most hardware wallets work. A bitcoin address is not sensitive information, in fact its public once a single transaction has been sent to it (making it appear on the blockchain). As such, it's not important to hide this information. Because of this, most hardware wallets choose to use software which allows them to be viewed when plugged into a PC, communicating with its wallet software.


See answer above


Yes, it will look just like any other bitcoin address.


Sort of. In order to save space, a hardware wallet will likely only store a few small bits of information needed to generate the same set of addresses/keys, likely just the seed. This way once it's plugged into a computer, it can simply regenerate these addresses/keys every time that it's plugged in without having to store anything. A private key certainly could be viewed as a string of characters, but this is sensitive information that will never leave the hardware wallet for security reasons, so you don't really have to worry about what a private key looks like. Every address has its own associated private key. The private keys by themselves are not actually addresses. They're simply associated with an address, and are used to sign transactions for its associated public address.


Since all it really stores is a seed, you just need a backup of the 12-24 word seed to get access to all of your money (the seed is used to deterministically generate public addresses and their associated private keys).


Yes and no respectively. In order to send crypto, your wallet has to sign the transaction with the private key that it generates from its stored private seed. This information never leaves the wallet, so it has to be plugged in to sign a transaction which can then be broadcast to the bitcoin network. It doesn't have to be plugged in to receive anything. Bitcoin sent to an address will simply sit there until a transaction is signed with its associated private key which would allow it to move somewhere else.


Correct, basically the wallet only stores the seed. A passphrase is basically a string of characters that goes onto the end of a seed when generating addresses/keys. So if they got your wallet and knew your seed without your passphrase, they would be generating completely different (and empty) addresses from the ones you would be using if you have a passphrase. If you don't have a passphrase, a hardware wallet will use something like a pin which simply prevents the hardware device from cooperating and sharing any information unless the pin is put in.


No, you can just put your seed (which you backed up) in addition to your secret phrase into another wallet by yourself. If someone stole your wallet and you don't have a backup of your seed, in addition to your secret phrase, you're SOL.


That's good skepticism to have. Fortunately with hardware wallets, they will NEVER normally communicate the private parts of your data (your seed) over the USB. They keep it and store it locally, and if they need to use it to sign a transaction, it will sign the transaction using the processor on the device itself, and only send the public transaction over the USB.


If you're planning on keeping bitcoin stored cold for that long, you can just use a paper wallet. Generate a wallet using wallet software like electrum. When you generate the wallet, write down the seed it gives you. Move the bitcoin you want to store to the address it generates for you, then delete that wallet from electrum. At that point you have a piece of paper with a seed which can be used to access the funds by plugging it back into a wallet in the future, and isn't stored anywhere digitally.
The draw of a hardware wallet is if you want to store bitcoin securely while also actively using it and moving it around. If you only want to store bitcoin for holding, a paper wallet works great because there doesn't have to be a digital copy of the private part anywhere.
If you want to try to read more about wallets, here's a great post that's a bit more technical:

Short answer: no
Long answer: There isn't really the concept of a 'server' in a decentralized system like the blockchain. Everyone is a node (or client). The beauty about this model is that new nodes can come and go without affecting the network as a whole. As long as a few nodes can stay alive, the entire network/blockchain can continue to move forward, and other nodes will sync back up when they come online. 
Not that I think it would even be possible to realistically crash nodes by publishing too many transactions anyways. Individual nodes could simply choose to drop transactions from their mempool if it got too full. The software which runs bitcoin wouldn't likely ever crash from a naturally overfilled mempool.

Yeah so you'd have to use the ledger wallet to generate a new BTG address which you will receive funds to. Then put your breadwallet seed into a different BTG compatible wallet and send your BTG to your ledger BTG address you generated from the ledger wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:57:00




That's a good attitude to have. If you don't plan on moving your coins around often, then uninstalling/reinstalling a wallet when you want to move your coins around is a good idea. That way you don't have to store a copy of the keys to your money on your wallet.

Unless you live in a place with extraordinarily cheap electricity and have a lot of capital to put up front for equipment, you will make more money investing in bitcoin itself.
If you want to mine, you're basically competing with every other enterprise mining farm which have access to the best equipment, as well as cheap electricity purchased in bulk.
To put it in perspective, I spent $30 on a little USB miner a bit over a year ago (which was top of the line for that price back then) and have run it 24/7 ever since (just for fun) and I just made my $30 back. If I had put that into bitcoin itself, it would now be worth close to $800
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:20
Ah, I see. Well then yes, you'll have to import the seed for your breadwallet into a BTG compatible wallet, and from there you could send your BTG to any other BTG address you'd like. You'd have to use the ledger wallet to generate a bitcoin gold address using your ledger. According to ledger, the ledger nano does not support BTG, whereas the nano s does. If you have a nano (not s), you can't send BTG to it.

The Antminer R4 is based on the same chipset, and thus has the same efficiency, and will run on a 110 volt PSU. It's sold out right now, but here are the relevant links:
R4 Itself (note doesn't come with psu):

Note that it takes standard PCI-e power connectors, so you could go out and buy your own PC PSU and hook it up, given that it has enough total power delivery.

I didn't say it was profitable. But if you want to vote with your wallet, it's a simple way to go.
In most cases, paying for hardware is even less profitable than cloud mining unless you live an in area with extremely cheap electricity, or you are willing to mine on a much larger scale, buying electricity and bandwidth in bulk, rather than an individual consumer level.
If you're looking for profitability in bitcoin mining as an individual, there may be ways for slow ROIs over the course of years (or even longer), but if you're really just looking to turn a profit, investing in BTC itself will do you much better.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:58:25
You absolutely can!
The easiest way without even requiring any hardware would probably be cloud mining, where you're essentially paying for someone else to mine for you. These services will still generally let you join a pool of your choice.
For example you could buy some mining power from a cloud provider, point it towards a slushpool account, then within your slushpool account you can choose what type of work is sent from slushpool to your cloud miner (BU or Core). This WOULD be voting with actual hash power.
Here's some more on cloud mining:
Of course you can always buy mining hardware and run it yourself. Every little bit counts (in proportion, obviously).

I agree with everything you're saying, my only issue is that I think you're using the word decentralization, even within the context of bitcoin itself too narrowly.
Referring to my previous comment, I mentioned that utility can be gained through decentralization. In this case, the software that runs bitcoin is the implementation. Talking about bitcoin, there is tons of software that keeps it running.
One form is the miners which run software to do "work" (generally assigned from a pool). This is what you're talking about, and you're correct that the work done by miners is one form of bitcoin's decentralization and is the most vital part that keeps bitcoin safe, since the idea of doing something such as a bruteforce attack is simply infeasible, even by some of the biggest nation states at this point. With that said, this is only ONE aspect of bitcoin's decentralization.
Decentralization, even if we're talking exclusively within bitcoin isn't just one thing. For example, the software running the nodes is another part of the decentralization of bitcoin. Note that the purpose of decentralizing the nodes isn't really meant to primarily be protection from attacks, but rather is much more utility oriented. Full nodes are the backbone of the entire bitcoin ecosystem. As bitcoin is built upon a peer-to-peer network, every new node essentially shares some of the burden of relaying blocks, verifying transactions, etc.
Because of this, saying that a node is "less" or "more" decentralized than a miner doesn't make a lot of sense. They are both different forms of decentralization, performing entirely different tasks. If you're talking exclusively about protection via decentralization, then you would be correct in saying putting another node online isn't going to be doing much, but it's providing a completely different service via decentralization, beyond just security (which you seem to be fixated on).
To say that the purpose of decentralization in bitcoin is for security isn't wrong, however, **it's far from the full picture**. Another important purpose of the decentralization in bitcoin is the freedom (or maybe "impossibility" may be a better word here) from regulation, among countless other various purposes and side effects.
So in conclusion, running a node is definitely decentralization, even by the definition of the word. With that said, it's not necessarily going to provide the same services that other forms of decentralization (such as mining) does, but that's not the point. Decentralization in regards to bitcoin refers to much more than simply mining for the sake of protection from attacks and general security.

Running a full node further decentralizes the network which is a large part of the philosophy of bitcoin as a whole. While I don't necessarily disagree that running a full node doesn't necessarily inherently give you of voting power or "a voice", to say that "Running a node is just burning fuel for the purpose of governance" is VASTLY understating it.
The whole point of bitcoin is that it's a decentralized network that you can trust as a whole, but not on an individual level. If everyone just had the idea "oh, just let the other guy run a node", then you end up consolidating the network rather than de-centralizing it.

Right, my bad. You're correct in that the S9 doesn't come with any PSU.
The antminers all use standard PCIe power plugs, so you can use any standard power supply with the number of PCIe cords required for their miners. With that said, even though the amazon page you posted says it supports the S9, I've seen the S9 pull over 1400 watts from the wall, and those in the amazon post are two separate supplies, which are suggested to be used in parallel. This isn't a very good configuration and can lead to damaging the S9 itself.
Those power supplies in that Amazon post are switching, so they operate by frequently toggling between full-on and full-off. The output voltage is regulated by spending more or less time in the on-state. If load increases, the voltage drops and the feedback controller reacts accordingly.
When two PSUs are installed in parallel, two controllers are hard at work to maintain a stable voltage, but they are unaware of one another. As a result, they may enter a hysteresis loop by consistently overshooting their target. Alternatively, one unit might try to lower the output voltage but fail, because his partner is pushing the output in the other direction.
This can all lead to a damaged, or significantly reduced lifespan of the S9 (or really any electronics you try to run like this), and is definitely not recommended.
Your best bet for 110 volts would probably be to get a 1600 watt PC PSU and use that instead so you have the proper overhead. You can also get higher efficiency power supplies this way as well, which can save money in the much longer run.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:18:13
Running two switching mode power supplies in parallel is never a good idea. You can run an S9 at 110 volts, but you should really be using a single power supply to provide all of the power. 
Using 2 switching mode power supplies in parallel can lead to damage or a significantly reduced lifespan: something you definitely don't want with a $2k plus unit.

I think you're confusing the **concept** of decentralization itself with the **utility** of decentralization via an implementation. I've already inferred it, but I will emphasize that the concept of decentralization does not have any inherent utility without some sort of implementation.
It's true that a means of protection/utility can be brought up and empowered by decentralization, (all depending on the implementation), however, the concept of decentralization in and of itself is not necessarily equal to protection, or even utility in general.
In its most simple form, the concept of decentralization of a network is running a network across multiple different computers. Then, BY DEFINITION, running your own node means that part of the bitcoin network now runs on your computer, further decentralizing the network.
It's important to note I'm talking about decentralization here as a concept. Not as utility, or a tool, or political/economic power, or anything else.
If you want to start talking about the utility gained from running a node, that's an entirely different subject. The main utility of running your own node simply means that you can validate your own transactions without having to trust any 3rd party, however there are other various uses, such as wanting to mess around with code itself, etc.
Not everything everyone does has to have an ulterior motive. It's not like every person running a node is doing so with the specific intent of gaining political power within bitcoin. I think running a node for fun, or simply to say you support the concept of decentralization are valid enough reasons without having to go any deeper.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:10:31
Did I say that running a node is helpful? No I did not. I even agreed that running a full node isn't even voting power/voice.
With that said, running a node can be helpful, giving you the power to verify your own transactions without relying on third parties. In addition, as I noted before, more nodes = more decentralization.
I said nothing about the helpfulness of a single node to the entire network. Quite frankly, a node ran by an individual won't do anything in relative terms of the entire network. But with that said, running your own node means that you are further decentralizing the network, which is basically the ethos behind bitcoin when you put away all the politics and economics, is it not?
An analogy could be a vegan not eating meat because of an ethical dilemma of animal cruelty. I'm sure most vegans know that on an individual level, they are making absolutely no impact on the global market, however they still remain vegan out of principle. You can apply a similar concept here. Running a node could simply be a gesture saying that you support decentralization and nothing more.

This would be true if every miner was a full node, but that's far from the case.
An overwhelming majority of miners are part of a pool, which gets work assigned to them. They do not have the full blockchain stored, but rather let their pool delegate work.
It's true that a full node is technically a sub-part of a full miner, but the reality is that a large majority of the hash power in the bitcoin network is not provided from full miners, but rather from pools which run nodes that delegate work. It's because of this fact that I say running a full node provides a different service from mining, because when I talk about mining, I assume a miner that is participating in a pool. Nowadays it's simply impractical to solo-mine as a full node unless you are mining on a massive (data center) scale.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:25:36
Right, by the technical definition, you are correct.
With that said, I think that the practical definition of mining within the community has evolved to mean "contributing hash power to the network". I mean people who contribute hashing power to a pool don't call themselves a worker, they call themselves a miner.
WIth that said, when you were referring to the benefits of mining, you were generally talking about the security gained through the total hash power of the network. This can be provided by a worker just as effectively as a full node miner, however by your definition, only the full node is providing decentralization, even though the product of their work provides the same protection.
Once again, I will say that nodes are ONE FORM of decentralization. It says NOTHING about "the actual issue Bitcoin has". Not once have I claimed that running a node, or even decentralization in general is fixing any particular issue. When you are referring to decentralization, you are simply referring to one particular benefit that comes from decentralization, but I'm talking about the act of decentralization itself. By definition, running a node IS further decentralizing the network. When I say decentralization though, I imply NOTHING about security or protection.

No you cannot. The APW3 PSU that comes with the S9 is for 240 volt outlets only. Even in countries that use 120 volt mains, you can still get 240 volt outlets installed. Just know that you can't plug it into a "standard" 120 volt outlet.

It doesn't matter, the title is a  bit misleading. I mean, full nodes are the backbone of the bitcoin infrastructure by verifying transactions, relaying blocks, etc, but node counts don't really mean anything except for some graphs that people like to point at and pretend they matter.
Note: I'm not saying running a node isn't beneficial to the network, but I definitely wouldn't call it  "vote" in any sense.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:02:45
I can agree with that comment :)
Nodes are definitely a much more insignificant part of the network vs the hashing power of the miners. And I agree running a node isn't going to do much at all for the network, but by doing so, I would say you can still make a personal statement.
If someone starts up a node thinking that they're doing some huge favor to the bitcoin network, then obviously they would be incorrect. With that said I think a contribution, regardless of how small, is important from a personal perspective by simply making a statement.
It could be like someone who complains about a policy which they could vote on, but then doesn't vote themselves or contribute either way. Even if a vote wouldn't have technically mattered, by doing so, you're making a statement. I think of running a node (for me personally) in a similar light. I'm well aware that the contribution of my node to the network is negligible at best, but by running a node, I can say I had a part, regardless of how small :)

There are nearly 500,000 blocks on the blockchain now. These statistically unlikely events are bound to occur sooner or later. Since you're only looking at 5 blocks with a 0.37% chance, on average every 1,351 blocks, there will be another 5 blocks mined in succession that are this fast, or even faster. This is only a bit over 1 weeks time. This is all normal behavior.

Unless Bitmain is conspiring with over 50% of the entire network's hashing power to stop signaling for Segwit AND stop enforcing BIP 91 at the same time, they literally can't stop signaling for BIP 141 without getting their blocks orphaned from the main chain because consensus on the main chain is enforcing BIP 91.
This would be incredibly unlikely since it means that you are literally risking tens of thousands of dollars for every block you mine unless you are positive that over 50% of the current hashing power has stopped enforcing BIP 91.
If there was some sort of talk about more than 50% of the hashing power of the network going rogue simultaneously, we would have heard something. To do that in secret without informing the public in any way is simply infeasible, even putting aside the difficulty of actually convincing pool owners totalling 50% of the hashing power to go along with a plan that would put hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) at risk for every pool owner. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:35:00
BIP 91 already is enforced with consensus and also enforces Segwit signaling.... So UASF isn't really relevant unless more than 50% of the hashing power decided to stop enforcing BIP 91 all the sudden. 
Also UASF HASN'T activated yet because the MTP (time used by the nodes) is behind real time by about an hour, so UASF won't activate for another 20 minutes or so.

Not sure why 120sat/B would be suggested when the median confirmed right now is sitting around 220-ish sat/B
You can never be sure if your transaction will drop until it happens, since pools can sometimes pick weird transactions to include or the mempool could empty (or fill even more). 
If it really was suggesting 120sat/B then you should look somewhere else for your transaction fee calculation like

Paper wallets can be both good and bad. 
* Cannot be hacked
* Free
* Easy to use
* Physical security is safer than digital
* Not practical if you're actively using your bitcoin
* Have to type in your seed every time you use your wallet, meaning you have to be sure the computer you use isn't compromised
* Must physically copy and distribute copies to safe locations that you can trust and access
* If stored remotely, can't be accessed quickly in an emergency
With all of this said, I strongly believe that a paper wallet which is properly distributed to trusted safe locations is easily one of the safest way to cold store bitcoin. Even with digital cold wallets like a trezor, you will still end up writing down your seed somewhere and storing it like a paper wallet since you HAVE to have redandancy, and probably don't want to buy multiple hardware wallets. Especially because hardware can fail at some point, it's easier to preserve a paper wallet vs preserving an electronic device. 
If you're not actively using your bitcoin, a paper wallet is a great solution. You could also use a simple passphrase with your seed which you don't need to write down or store anywhere which would even make a compromised paper wallet useless to an attacker without your passphrase, so you don't have to worry about "messing up" nearly as much.

They're not validating the previous block. If they did, they wouldn't have mined an empty block because they would have wanted to include transactions to get the fees. 
It's called SPV mining. Basically you have the previous block header which is broadcasted by the pool which mined the previous block. You start mining as an empty block in the interrum while you wait for the full block to make its way to your node so that you can validate the previous block and work on mining a new block full of transactions. If you get extremely lucky, you can actually successfully mine the empty block before you finished getting/validating the previous block. Because of this, you will immediately start broadcasting the empty mined block because you would rather take the 12.5 bitcoins than wait and potentially get beaten out by someone else. 
So basically whenever these empty blocks or mined, they will happen very quickly after the previous block, and will not have validated the previous block. Basically they're betting that previous block is valid, because if it wasn't, they would get their empty block orphaned as well, but a lot of pools take this risk/reward chance and SPV mine anyways.

A tx never "officially" drops, but nodes eventually drop tx that don't get confirmed within a certain amount of time (configured by the node operator), so it will get 'dropped' from the mempool eventually. I've seen people say you should wait at least 3 days before trying to spend the money again, but you can wait even longer to be safe. (it also depends on transaction fees and the probability that your transaction could still be confirmed) 
The process to spend the unconfirmed coins again (if you feel sufficient that the transaction will not be confirmed) will be different depending on your wallet. Some wallets will automatically put the coins back so they can be spent after it sees the unconfirmed transaction being dropped by a lot of nodes. Other wallets will never let you spend those coins again, meaning that you will have to import your private key into a different wallet in order to spend those coins.

It's called SPV mining. Some people claim it's bad, some people claim it's good.
I recommend looking up some info on it to educate yourself and make your own decision.
Also to your point, a lot of people ARE actually SPV mining. Maybe not everyone, but the way it works, an empty block will only be mined very quickly after the previous block, so while most people may be SVP mining, that does not translate to mostly empty blocks being mined. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:49:18
The problem isn't that they don't think they can validate a block quickly relative to other pools, the problem is with the the distribution of the completed block, and the competition with other pools who are doing the same exact SPV mining. 
Right now the fees from bitcoin transactions provide less than 10% of the bitcoin reward per block. If someone else is SPV mining and beats you to the punch while you're validating a block, you lose out on the entire reward, while you were just sitting there validating the previous block. Even for a large pool like antpool, they only mine on average roughly 1 block per hour. The chance of missing out on your empty mined block and taking an hour to even get any reward again simply isn't a good proposition for most pools.
In addition, in the time it takes to verify these blocks, you are either mining an old block, or have nothing to mine. So without SPV mining, pools basically have to throw away potential hashing power.
Simply due to the nature of these empty blocks, they will only be mined very quickly after a previous block, which doesn't really hurt the network, since they'll either also be SPV mining, or verifying the previous block anyways. 
And if a pool decides to mine an empty block without verification of the previous block, and the previous block was invalid, their block will get orphaned as well, so they still have a motivation to validate the older blocks as soon as possible.

I would recommend that you add the --incognito parameter. This way chrome will never ask if you want to restore pages because it didn't shutdown correctly (i.e. unplugging the pi). Then if you have a display without a touchscreen, you don't have to plug in a mouse to get rid of the message.

Yup, it's a pretty low fee compared to what's being confirmed right now. Median confirmed transaction fee right now is sitting well over 200 satoshi/Byte 
You may just have to wait until nodes start dropping it from the mempool so you can spend the coins again, or if you get lucky the mempool may empty enough for it to get confirmed in the next few days here.
You can submit your transaction ID here to have a hope that viabtc may confirm it for you: 
Other than that, notmuch you can do right now except wait, unfortunately :(

No it hasn't dropped any noticeable amount yet. Segwit signaling doesn't even matter until the difficulty readjustment period on the 27th of July starts anyways. The big date to look out for is August 1st because that's when the bitcoin cash hard fork is occurring, and that's when hashing power could actually be lost. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:06:49
I mean, with BIP 91 activated, you HAVE to signal for Segwit or any blocks you mine will get orphaned. As long as BIP 91 stays active, it's basically impossible for it not to stay at 100%... 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:02:41
Link in a block explorer to the actual transaction? Without that info, my guess is the fee is simply too low. Currently any transaction with a fee under 150-ish satoshi/Byte has a chance to never get confirmed.

This is the exact reason that bitcoins in India are higher. Given a completely free market, arbitrage would almost immediately cause this difference to settle. However due to the restrictiveness of INR itself, and the inability to effectively move INR, BTC/INR is much more expensive relative to some other international markets for BTC. The free market of bitcoin is essentially putting a markup on BTC purchased with INR because the market itself is saying INR has less value than the official exchange rates, likely because of portability of INR itself and the restrictive regulations the Indian government uses to control INR.
