I suspect Google, Facebook etc. are far more useful to state actors than threats. Whereas bitcoin could undermine the utility of fiat, which is a fundamental pillor of state power.
I think they are just watching and seeing for now. But probably have plans to take it down if necessary.

the gov grants the fiat monopoly, the fed is merely their for legitimacy. if the gov directly issued currency it would be less credible.

Surely, a transition to BTC would not extinguish existing state debts. Further, is it not typical for states to be the primary actor and beneficiary from the 'printing of their own money to excess'.

Thanks for such a detailed answer. It's great the system could evolve to protect itself.
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:58:53
Thanks for your reply, this is exactly what I was thinking. But as others have now answered, smart people will find a workaround.

There's a lot of evidence that who we are is based on the information in our brains, so if we can preserve them, a future technology may well be able to revive us, like awaking from a sleep.

I agree, I think they would prefer to co opt, or assume covert control than destroy it.
My second fear is that we may be inadvertently developing and delivering the perfect world currency into state hands. Impossible to counterfeit, perfect tracking etc. etc.
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:46:49
So the system could evolve a little to protect itself. Thanks for taking time to answer.
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:45:23
Thank you for such a clear reply, that does make sense.
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:26:40
Thanks for reply. I agree with you, and we need to be aware of such vulnerabilities for the future.

Thanks for reply,
But could they not simply own several minors and process for free...
but even if not, they still have almost unlimited funds to attack?

Nearly everything is, at base, political. Money especially, second only, maybe,  to violence.

Maybe a few transactions can remain private at first, but over any extended use, surely postal addresses (for goods sent), ip addresses, numerous personal identity markers from ip use etc. etc. will gradually expose the user through existing state surveillance mechanisms.

Concentrations of political power are the cause and targets of mass murder weapons.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:17:39
That is a very good point, i honestly hadn't realised how antagonistic political ideas on non violence were to some groups. I think it may be hard though to keep them away from such discussions.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:03:38
I'd say it's the exact opposite. The only difference between anarchist and lib. Is zero organised violence or the least amount possible. Whereas for socialism, where do I start...
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:56:23
You are a very clear writer, but I think this argument is a bit of a straw man. Voluntary (atomistic) action does not preclude cooperating for social goals.

A government could maintain a blockchain with no fees, while simultaneously underwriting the whole system.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:33:08
Perhaps the word government is too big a concept to narrow. Rather consider violence - organised or not, hidden (law) or not. I prefer people to cooperate voluntarily as their first and primary instinct. I see violence generally as a failure of wisdom, morality or knowledge.

It would have to compete with foreign currency use like dollars or credit cards.
Some people might prefer mining to be a government monopoly.
People might be nervous about the state block chain tracking of people.
Depending on how implemented, taxes would either be very easy or very difficult to collect.
If the state system had any perceived negatives, private alternatives would emerge.
Wealth would become more concentrated toward value (wealth) creators. So the gap between rich and poor might increase.
New forms of capital formation, investment, credit etc. would need to be developed. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:55:25
Thanks for answer. I don't think the state would necessarily admit to any attack, and so no justification is necessary.
But I think the best answer to these types of questions is that these new currencies are supported by the smartest people on earth and so they will find a way to protect them, which is great news.
