You seem to be correct according to their support page you linked. Their online storage of digital assets (which is 2% of their overall holdings) is fully insured.
The 98% is offline in super duper secure locations in safe deposit boxes all over the globe.
With all the exchanges being hacked these days, keeping the majority of holding offline sounds like a good approach to me.

Only thing I would suggest is searching around on bitcointalk.org. There seem to be a few threads on how to find the public addresses. Or pm me. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:48:32
That's why I use coinbase to purchase my btc, but not to store. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:50:00
You seem to be arguing my point exactly. I was just correcting your previous statement: "End of mining." and making sure the correct information is available to anyone reading this. It will not be the end of mining. Miners will continue to mine when all new bitcoins are in circulation. At that point they will be rewarded with only transactions fees for finding new blocks.
PS. Sure I still have plenty to learn, there are few that know it all, but I'm not new to bitcoin.

I don't happen to know how to look up the public address of the Lealana coins. However please tell me the tamper proof seal in still intact. If it's not, the seller has the private key associated with the wallet on that coin. If it is intact, I would recommend keeping it that way to preserve the integrity of the coin and the btc loaded on it.
As far as the public address, I suggest checking out some bitcointalk.org forums on the Lealana coins. I'm sure it's available there somewhere.
Edit: check if it's on this list.

Yes see your point. I have been running my node for about 2 years now and will continue to support the bitcoin technology as long as I can. 
I was more questioning if any decentralized blockchain could be considered "based" out of a country.  My assumption is no, since nodes could be anywhere. Maybe a new startup blockchain could be "based" out of a country. But that would be easy enough to get around even with net neutrality.

Haha I hear ya.  Spent the majority of my BTC @ $700-900 a year ago to buy appliances for my house. It was a need to keep the family happy. Don't regret it one bit. It has been a bit harder trying to buy it back tho.

Coinbase charges 1.5% to buy/sell BTC (convert to and from USD). The only other fee would be during any transfers out of coinbase, but that's implemented by Bitcoin itself, not coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:45:14
Yeah, transaction fees for bitcoin are very high right now due to the mempool being overloaded. Until the lightning network is implemented, using litecoin maybe an alternative.. for smaller transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:23:46
It is safer to hold your own keys. 
Here are my personal thoughts on the matter. If you plan on hodling long, a hardware wallet or paper wallet is a good way to go. If you plan on using your btc for transactions, use a mobile wallet like electrum so you don't have to pay coinbase's higher BTC transaction fees. If you plan on trading, you have no option buy keeping your btc in an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:58:00
I have always used coinbase to buy and sell BTC. I have not had any issues and I always recommend them to new users.
That being said, I only store a small amount of my BTC on coinbase. As anyone would suggest here, keep your coins off an exchange. And depending on your use case, paper wallet, hardware wallet, even computer/mobile wallet is acceptable. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:49:50
Good to know.  Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:01:03
Thank you for the advice, I will keep an eye out. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:33:15
3-5 days if I recall correctly. It's been a while since I've purchased USD with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:50:49
I would love one. Yes please. Yes please. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:02
If I spend 0.05BTC on something, I purchase 0.05BTC through coinbase. So my total holdings of BTC doesn't change. And I'm willing to pay the 1.5% buying fee imposed by coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:01:14
Every time you send BTC, you will be required to pay a transaction fee. That transaction fee will be the same no matter the quantity of BTC. You don't pay to receive.
Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:29:21
Can I sell my bullion to them for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:59:25
Thanks for all the great information. I'm definitely behind the 8 ball when it comes to the details of net neutrality and its current status. You definitely put some time and effort into this response so I don't want it to go unanswered. I agree with everything you stated and therefore (unfortunately) I don't have any info to add. Again, thanks for a great response and I think it's time I start educating myself on the facts of net neutrality and what is actually going on with the current situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:32:24
Not a problem. Hold on to it and cherish it. Not many have physical coin wallets. I have a nastyfans coin wallet. Love it.

He is desperately trying to find his private key to the wallet everyone sent BTC to. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:04:46
I don't fully know the answer to your question, I assume if they start blocking the ports bitcoin runs on, it could drastically limit the amount of nodes within the US. And now I have a question. Can a decentralized blockchain be based out of a country? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:03:39
Not end of mining.  End of mining new coins. Miners will still be rewarded transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:29:38
When selling btc on coinbase, you have the option to sell to your USD wallet or your bank account. Selling to USD wallet is instant. 
When buying from your USD wallet, purchases are instant. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:38
The visible number on the coin should associate with an address on the list I added to my original response. You should have verified the public address held the BTC before purchase. There is no reason the seller should have held that from you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:20:38
Does your coin have a partial address like: "La1eRp" on the front or back. If so, look at the list I included earlier and see if any of those addresses start with the number on your coin. That will be your public key. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:33:41
1 transaction. 
I'm sure you paid your fees when buying BTC using the exchange, which is totally separate from the blockchain fees in question.  Now transferring your total btc out of the exchange to your wallet is considered 1 transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:30:43
Very easy to transfer from coinbase to a wallet. I don't have a hardware wallet so I can't give you the details about using one, but as far as I am aware you create the btc, ltc, eth wallets on the hardware wallet and send crypto to it as you would to any other wallet address.
I would suggest sending after setting up the wallets, send a small amount to the hardware wallet and then back to coinbase. Yes, this will cost a little bit due to current fees, but proves you have full control over sending from that wallet. I get paranoid about that whenever I create a new wallet, last thing I want is to send crypto to it and now be able to access it in the future. Read up on hardware wallets and learn how to recover your wallets in case of hardware failure or any other issues.

I don't have an answer for you but please respond back when you find out why your account was closed in the first place. I'm very interested why they would close your account.
I have never had to deal with their support system, but from what I hear it is terrible. They don't seem to be able to handle in the exponential inflow of customers and support requests. 
Wish you the best in tracking down your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:27:50
I use BTC on a weekly basis to buy things with. More so now due to the holidays. I also buy my BTC back at the same time. Yes it's one more process to buy something, but it also keeps the idea of Bitcoin alive. I suggest everyone do the same. It incurrages companies to accept. And saves me from the thought of paying $200 for an apple later on down the road. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:59:57
Well I can't tell her about my gf either. It's too late for that now too. Should have told her from the start so it wasn't a secret.
LOL jk. I love my wife and wouldn't never cheat on her. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:09:30
GDAX is great if you want to pay the lowest fees. However, due to the high volitility of bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin, I'm willing to pay coinbase's 1.5% fee.
Personally, I would much rather pay the minimal fee than buy at an unknown price 3-5 days from now (wait time to deposit USD into GDAX). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:34:44
Agree, it's usually about a whole week. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:50:49
Hey guys, I'm not new to bitcoin but just a general question:  If used as cold storage and only withdrawal btc from it maybe once or twice a year, why would a hardware wallet be better than a paper wallet?  Are there any advantages in this use case?
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:40:30
When the government somehow taxes you on the amount you own and the tax becomes more than what btc is worth.    I don't see that happening, but that would be a scenario. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:31:42
When was the last time a USB miner solved a block? I know their chances are almost 0%, but anyone know when it last happened? I'm sure someone posted about it somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:37:55
So what your saying is the graph should say crypto, not Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:18:56
Is there proof of this? Documentation? This doesn't seem to be widely spread information. Or maybe I'm just one of those out of the loop on this move. People are going to be in for a rude awakening if they sell their BTG and loose their BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:14:24
Anyway to get an updated one? I'd love to see the last 5 years included in this graph. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:56:33
Perfect, thanks.
