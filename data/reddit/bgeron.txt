Certainly an audit firm should audit them, but I think mainly for fiat currency. 
I seriously doubt that a Deloitte auditor could audit the possession of Bitcoins. I expect them to either be satisfied seeing a balance in bitcoin-qt, or to ask for a wallet.dat to be sent their way. Alternatively, Kraken could pay for a Deloitte consultant with secure programming knowledge to study Bitcoin, but how could the consultant know that their knowledge of Bitcoin is complete and accurate enough? I'd guess Kraken doesn't have the money to hire an auditor full-time for two months.

The bitcoin transaction system works this way so that we can be sure that no money can be spent twice, and no money gets lost. You often encounter these counter-intuitive things when you want robust software.
The flip side is indeed that there must be software to collect the change, and buggy software can lose your money. After a while, the bugs should be ironed out and you _can_ safely use brainwallets.

IANAL so I don't know, but compare it with this. Suppose you would have some money and post advertisements in the same newspaper every day, and you make sure they are linkable. You could make a CP story that would be illegal in Canada and Norway (see `haakon`'s post), then put each word of the story in a consecutive advertisement. The newspaper editors won't spot it, and once you disclose the 'algorithm' this will get huge media attention. Any subscriber of the newspaper will be able to reconstruct the story when he knows the algorithm.
But would this make the newspaper archive illegal, just like Hitler's Mein Kampf? I think not.
On a tangential note, the story is of course already in the digits of pi ;)

I think it would be better to just use micropayments. People with GPUs could generate BTC on-the-fly to access the web site, and people without could buy access cards for 10000 website views.

What about converting it into Bitcoin and selling it on bitmarket.eu? There's enough buyers for 6.2€, which is equivalent to 8.8$ according to Wolfram Alpha. That's above current Mt. Gox market prices, so you would actually get a profit by going from Mt. Gox to bitmarket.eu.
