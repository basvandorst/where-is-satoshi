How in earth for this duration no reply from support ticket?. I should wait forever and ever?  More clients more support service should be provided. That's weird.i use 2factor authenticator. Check this

Thanks for the contribution, But that's not the problem. I ve been sending btc to them and many others when ever I sell locally. So why is this one delaying?  Not even a reply from support for many days now. I made 2facor withdrawal which I've been doing all time bcos I use only poloniex. Why is this delay?  No reply from support. Nothing nothing..its bad

Is there any risk free business?  WARNING: use ur spare money to get 10% in 30days. Be careful which platform you chose. I'm just a guider and tutor. Asides,  I'm here to finish knowhow with poloniex and delay and how to sort the problem. Thanks

What da?  All this waiting?  Common,  be reasonable here. If you encounter expansion in your business, source for more workers and keep your customers satisfied. For how long will I keep waiting for my ticket to be replied?  What will the reply be?  For God dam sake withdrawal awaiting approval for all this while, what's the delay?  One person can't be working for poloniex. All this days I've been waiting,  I'm busy doing nothing. Bcos all my investment is on cryptocurrency.  Deposit, pay ur due fee, trade, make some profit or loss, withdraw, pay ur due fee, Get money and feed yourself. That's the business circle. What's your suggestion here? It's discouraging
