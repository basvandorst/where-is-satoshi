We still use this account to respond on reddit because it was the first account we used when we started our project, it’s meaningful to us.
Please provide the destination tag of your account to make sure that everybody sees that you had made a mistake in your deposit.
You asked the seller to release saying that the support has confirmed the transfer while it’s false.
We are a well known company, featured in multiple famous magazines, you can make some research even though I’m sure you already did.
We will take legal pursuit for defamation according to the UK law on Monday.
Thank you.

First of all we didn't get compromised nor hacked. All the conversations are crypted and cannot be changed.
There has never been a Moroccan number that was "changed", the +44 is the number that has always appeared to the users.
Our team was responsive and replied within minutes when you contacted us. You first have contacted us for a problem in your deposit, actually you forgot to put the last number in your destination tag and ended up sending xrp to another user ( A user to whom we have frozen the account as he tried to send them out ). As you provided the hash we fixed your problem and gave you back your deposit, check your hash and destination tag and please share the information here so that everybody can see it. Concerning your withdraw, either everything was plannified from your side, or "your" device has been compromised. There are thousand of transactions everyday and not a single problem has been reported before. It's poor of you to accuse a whole team and without any proof of their implication while the problem comes from your side. Please upload the rest of the chat where you tried to induce the other trader into releasing by saying that the support has asked for that, while we clearly said that the problem doesn't come from his side but from yours.
