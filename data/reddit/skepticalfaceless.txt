I hold zero BTC or BCH for this reason.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:35:45
No because I like making money. I sold BTC at 15.8 and BCH at 3.4 and feel super good about it. The political war between BTC and BCH is juvenile and dismissing alt coins because they aren't BTC is missing some of the biggest gains we've seen, including ether.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:36:13
If this is a repeat of 2013, we are going to see 4k BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:20:45
If the argument is BCH forked because they changed their software , the Bitcoin argument is to not change the original Bitcoin at all, and then build stupid hard to use shit like LN on top. 
So the argument is that Bitcoin can never change their code lest they not become Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:59:16
If you understood the content of the video you'd have the answer you're looking for. The coffiecient isn't yet right - more of the network meeds.to switch to segwit first.
Also, he goes through the math that shows why segwit adoption has stalled, because the incentives don't line up.
Keep downvoting me. I haven't forgotten which sub I'm in. Have fun in your bull trap but I sold all my coins for now. See you sub $10k.

Actually a good read. Ribbonfarm has been around for the better part of a decade. Read his gearvis principle. It's great.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:56:37
Where are these multisig transaction updates stored? On another chain? What's the TPS of that chain?
How does LN keep track of all the hops? 
Honestly as a developer it seems like a kludge. It seems like an entirely new payment mechanism is built around the block chain to avoid the block chain constraints. It's essentially not Bitcoin at that point.
I'm a technical person, is there a link to a more in-depth explaination ? This video makes me want to sell my BTC
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:17:18
Those people are just stupid and taking large risks. I know a guy who put $10k in an index fund for coins right as it blew past $10k. Didn't even think about it. Asked him what coins were in it and he said "top 20". There is probably 2 coins I'd hold right now even though I sold it all: Monero, and Ether.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:34:05
That's the Blockchain version of "this guy fucks"
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:46:39
LN definitely brings usable currency FURTHER from consumers because of all the additional complexity. This complexity needs to be properly interfaced so wallet users don't care about channels/transactions/multi-sig addresses. It's too complex for the average user who can't even keep track of his bank account. So LN **ADDS** work to the pile before its consumer-ready.
AFAIK - transaction fees are required to close the channel. Who is going to pay for that?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:51:13
I agree with the long term vision, just my notes on this specific implementation worries me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:33
So if i put 1 BTC in a channel, use it to buy coffee, and then spend the 1 BTC on the chain, the channel transaction may not go through, but I've already drank my coffee. How is this not double spending? What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:20:37
Sure I just gotta bind my BTC in a channel, leave it in there forever, and then spend more bTC to get it out. Fucking brilliant.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:20
Yup, and so now its a political battle. If he can get institutional money on his side before a massive pump they'll take down BTC anyway they can. They are even squatting on the subreddit with the same trading symbol.
For me, its all BS. I made 20x so I'm out of the market for now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:17:24
If each route requires a new block, couldn't transfer times skyrocket as money has to hop nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:26:46
Right but unless the LN channel encumbers the coins out of my address, I can spend on LN but the block chain has no knowledge of it. Can I spend the original coins directly on the block chain?
I think for it to work it would have to encumber my coins , which would suck because then it's locked into the channel until I pay another fee to move it out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:16:08
No - the price roses with supply is eclipsed by demand. Even if company is more profitable than yesterday I still need people to buy my shares. If my business was shady or potentially illegal, the number of people wanting to buy my shares may be zero - even if the P/E ratio quote unquote is better.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:40:02
Yeah by paying huge transaction fees to the miners. Uh, I just want to buy something?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:54:02
I don't really care what you think. If anything, I'm skeptical of LN.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:14:26
Sorry I meant 1000 worth of eth.
When you move BTC into ETH, you Have realized the appreciation at that point t and it is a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:48:29
I'm not going to appeal to authority, but I have some good reasons why lightning network isn't going to work out the way people expect.

When my mom got a Coinbase account and bought bitcoin I sold. I even told her "literally grandma is buying now, so I have to sell."
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:37:40
These threads simply tell me that Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash is a political battle and a power struggle. Lies, Conspiracy theories, shills, etc. Sounds like the 2016 election all over again.
I think LN has its problems. It is not THEE solution to kill off forked coins or other alt coins. I think both r/bitcoin and r/btc are creating their own verifiable versions of "truth" and I expect these sorts of conversations to get nastier just as they have in our political spheres.
Frankly i'm dissapointed in both communities. Why is success a zero sum game?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:44:49
Think about this scenario:
You buy $10 worth of BTC. 6 months later, it's worth $1000. You trade on BTC/ETH to get $100 worth of eth by directly trading BTC.
You just realized a $990 gain by buying ETH with appreciated Bitcoin.
Short term, you'll owe $200 immediately to the IRS even though you never realized the gain in USD.
This means alt coin trades need to cover the tax spread too.
This will slow down trading opportunities significantly.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:26:46
More likely is a use a channel provider and use an intermediary, so it isn't peer to peer! Douy!

Lol I never pay any fees on any credit card transaction, ever.
It should not cost $5 to spend $5...
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:54:15
Anyone seen this video yet?
What's interesting, is around the 20 minute mark, he says "no one is going to dogmatically enforce the adoption of segwit" and then explains how a scenario like that would lead to a network attack.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:53
What misinformation? I'm doing my research now, and am getting increasingly worried that LN is a pipe dream.
I do not want to encumber $100 into a channel to buy a coffee. It essentially moves my money off the blockchain and into a network i would have to pay to get my money out of. It essentially creates two networks and uses Bitcoin as a settlement layer.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:30:17
CommentChain, now that's a coin I can pun on!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:54:03
This, especially if I've already consumed the service I purchased on the LN. I can't undrink the coffee, and Starbucks can't take coin from me I don't have anymore.
It allows double spending?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:49
Agreed. NFC and Visa do a great job in just a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:30:34
What do you guys think of this? 
He even says the only danger of Segwit is if people dogmatically started demanding it - which won't happen.
Very technical and interesting insight. He is clearly passionate and takes the time to fully explain his thesis.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:47:15
Read through some stuff on Rootstock, RSK, and sidechain/drive-chains.
My experience is based on working for a very large technology company running digital currency projects, and I will say the entangling of these chains will be difficult to scale, and when problems occur recovering these contracts may not be possible. I expect some lost coins, blockchain corruption, etc.
Rootstock's explanation is far from exhaustive, and they don't address disaster recovery, or exactly how they plan to onboard legitimate miners by taking on more chain-risk for "RSK" tokens. 
The adoption curve suggests that it will be centralized for a while, or unstable as the bitcoin network is larger than anyone running entangled miners.
I expect BCH to take on more of these innovations as they learn to compete with BTC, and right now the centralization of exchanges for ether smart contracts. While theoritically I expect tech like this to continue to evolve, more op codes will be needed to increase security and reduce the need to trust special miners, which will require forks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:13
So now you're about to sell low and buy high again?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:34:12
I feel this is a bastardization of the block chain. All of these transactions are queued up between channels that are store locally (on my phone? On a central node?) And not in the block chain. Data corruption, loss, etc make these offline channels super insecure compared to block chain.
It also obfuscates how money is moved, which defeats the point of a public ledger.

No, and this is why a ton of day traders are racking up more taxable events than all of their profits combined.
Only those who want to to remain ignore t or hoping they dont get caught are thinking it's different.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:21:54
Yup, and 99% of the people holding steady are doing so under the auspicies that it will be worth more in the future.
Those who ascribe to the neo theme that when the world is ready there will be no need to cash out is bullshit. People only care about buying and holding for price increases. Just look at ethereum, ethtrader, Bitcoin, BTC, buttcoin, litecoin, litecoin markets, Bitcoin markets, etc, all subs are 100% consumed by price conversations in some form or another. Just a bunch of corporate sell outs thinking they are punk rock crypto anarchists. Most are teenagers.

I bought at $1000 in 2013. Took a bath but held until a week ago. Sold at $15.8 right after it broke 16k. Knew we would see a 13k coin very soon and sold. Made 20x my investment since I sold the forked BCH.
But I had to hold a loss for four years. See you at 100k in 2020
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:01:48
I understand it, but I dont understand how this is secure. I can spend in a channel, which the block chain never sees, and I spend it for real.
Will the block chain prevent me from spending coins encumbered in a channel? If not, there's a problem.
I found the white paper to be poorly written
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:12:43
There is no uncertainty or doubt that you are asking people to take money out of their pocket and give it to miners to support the network.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:52:34
Seems more like an empty promise instead of a technical solution to low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:50:17
Are there block limits to channels? What if I move 2BTC into a channel and begin to making .0000001 transfers?
What if the phone that is holding the multi-sig address and key in it is dropped into a toilet? I'd have to store the multi-sig address and key off-wallet, which means I'm giving the keys to someone else, which means its no different than a bank WRT to trust.
The only thing the lightning network does, that i can see, is move transactions off the blockchain to avoid fees and the scalability issue. everything will still need to clear into the blockchain.
Who pays for the fees to close the channel? A transaction on the blockchain is needed to close the channel and reconcile the transactions that were queued up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:41
Just look at his face. My guess is he did.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:11:33
Terrible argument. Multiple layers and Bank transfers is not peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:22
No it means shorts would be settled in USD so big money can buy in low by forcing the hand of those who holds actual coins.

Why does it have to be about picking sides? "Coding" skills doesn't address the cryptographic or security implications of lacking witness data to verify a block.
One guy in the video seemed very intent on saying "if exchanges start using segregated witness i can attack and steal all of their coins and infect the real chain with an alternative reality of events."
Super intriguing. If you want to write off the technical insight on how the chain is built differently using segwit as "bcash" promotion party - you're simply a cult hodler.
