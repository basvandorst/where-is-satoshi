I never made any statement about my own finances. I wasn't even talking about inflation except as it pertains to BTC value over time. This is a thread about the price of BTC. You have made no point, because making it requires the receiving of it. Communication is hard, good luck in the future.

If we assume the actual value of a Bitcoin to hold steady (which we don't because it's a deflationary currency), realize we're talking about its value relative to the USD. The USD is inflationary, so of course we should expect the USD price of Bitcoin to rise over time, just like candy bars.

There is an arbitrariness to the judgement that makes me empathize with the point that potential definitive harm is not harm.
Your gun example would be more interesting to me if we add to the ineptitude of the shooter. What if, instead of using a gun, he threw a rock? Is there a point where it's impossible for him to cause actual physical harm yet still be guilty? Say, he attempts to throw it from several hundred yards?

This is hilarious. People overly concerned with fashion cause plenty eye-rolling, but you're on another level where you sneer down at all of us. 
The fact that you consider any modern watch as sanctified as a 1900s pocket watch is particularly ridiculous. Clocks weren't ubiquitous and our culture wasn't generally as concerned about the exact time at any given moment, so someone who was busy enough to need a pocket watch was likely also well-off and afforded a quality example of new technology. Boom, a luxury market was born. Our growing obsession with time supported the market, but all a personal watch is anymore is a status symbol. Your elitist attitude is a clear indication of this. A watch should be a thing on your wrist that tells you the current time. No more, no less.

I don't think that supports your point. Of course media attention increases the numbers, but they'd have to have dropped to zero to validate your assertion. 
Let's try your argument out in another situation. A new bar opens and there is a news story about it. The bar becomes popular. Can I now say "The only reason they opened up the bar was the same as the people who went there. See, the numbers dropped the next week."? That would seem quite silly, no?

This is certainly the best we've been able to manage, but it's still less than perfect. It's entirely possible that two crimes factually identical to one another reach different verdict outcomes, for various reasons. First, given your jury choice, parents are possibly biased against another parent accused of neglect, so right off I would rather choose a jury that is representative of the society living under the law in question. On the flip side, a jury of bankers may be biased *for* an allegedly corrupt peer.
The confounding factors continue. The quality of the counsels may influence the outcome. The irrelevant personal qualities of the accused and of the victim may influence the outcome. Recent events not related to the trial may affect it. The judge's flaring hemorrhoid may affect it. Gloomy weather may affect it. And so on and so forth.
The arbitrary judgement of such crimes can be mitigated, but I'm not convinced that it can be eliminated. Fairness can't be assured unless the crime being prosecuted is absolutely explicit, and even then the best system that we've been able to devise is not assured to produce the ideal outcome.

I'll illustrate with a hypothetical. Yes, anyone who does this would be stupid, but it's just to clearly illustrate that your assertion isn't universally true.
I have a $20k tax bill on my inherited $1mil house due in 2 months. This house represents 95-99% of my assets and also is my place of business. I would be absolutely ruined if I lose my house (This is key). I have the exact amount saved, no other savings, and my other expenses equal my income. I need that $20k in savings to keep my house. I learn about this totally awesome investment that is "sure" to double by next month, so I hand over my $20k. A month goes by and I've lost 20% of the investment. The investee offers to return the remaining $16k or to let it ride. I've also learned some things that make me less sure of the investment. 
Now let's pause. Yes, I've been an utter moron, but that's not relevant to the question: What is the rational course of action?
If the analysis now tells me that there is only a tiny chance that I'll recover my $20k investment by next month and an immense chance that I will lose more, your assertion would suggest that I should pull out. However, if I do, I won't be able to pay my tax bill next month. I would lose my house and my livelihood. I'd be in the poorhouse for sure. The rational choice is to cross my fingers and hope that I can escape with at least as much as I invested. I can't afford to take a loss.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:36:28
He said transactions that take place in the app store, meaning app sales. Prepositional phrases matter.
But that point doesn't matter, because Apple takes 30% of App Store sales, IAPs, and ad revenues. All of it. It's all on that page or one link past.
It's an entirely different business model and market than Amazon or Ebay. They're not comparable. Even if they were, pointing at one competitor not doing something as justification why another can't do it is pretty ridiculous. If that were the case, capitalism wouldn't have ever become popular.

That seems to mean they have to be charging you with some crime before entering, though. They couldn't just enter after a report that you're doing some illegal shit, unless they were prepared to arrest you for some prior reason. Otherwise, a warrant serves no purpose.

I'm going to try to remain constructive, but frankly, I kinda want to punch you in the mouth a little bit.
First, the costume. I get it, successful youtubers often have flashy personas, but displaying that rarely entails comical getups (that goes triple for serious topic channels). I was going to let that slide and get on with the video, but things just kept piling up from there.
You sound like a bad Robin Leach impersonator, or someone doing an intentionally bad impersonation of a yacht owner, if you don't get the first reference. Tone it down and be more relatable. 
If your delivery was improved, perhaps that voice could work with a natural delivery. But as it stands, it makes it all the worse that you're obviously reading a script. You even say as much, which isn't professional and makes you appear more amateurish. Practice, do multiple takes, or whatever. I don't know about anyone else, but if you want my donations, poorly delivering a prepared monologue in an annoying fashion while wearing a ridiculous costume isn't going to do it.
The content. I wanted to get to it, but I was distracted by the aforementioned complaints, as well as you spending the first half of the video talking about your new camera. First, I don't see why you wouldn't lead with the stories and close with irrelevant stuff like that. Second, I don't understand why you would be asking for handouts from viewers for a camera you broke on international vacation. Apparently because people will buy it for you, to answer my own question, but it strikes me as shady and makes me not want to watch you even more.
I actually closed the video before you got to anything substantive, and only reopened it to watch the rest so that this critique was more complete. Meaning, if I wasn't here busting your balls, I wouldn't have heard anything important you had to say and would have wandered off quietly into the rest of the tubes. I have no qualms with the actual content once all the bullshit had been waded through. But damn, that bullshit is deep.
You've done 500+ videos apparently, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that what I just saw is the culmination of a long evolution of your image. I've seen many YouTube personalities become caricatures of themselves over time. It helps gain viewers at the beginning, but the more ridiculous it gets, the more those returns diminish. I can only assume (hope?) it gets to a point where new viewers are turned off by such shenanigans and the numbers begin to drop. So take a step back and look at yourself over that evolution. Have other people look at it. Make sure this is what you want to do. Personally, I could see myself doing this and facepalming after I realized what I'd become.
If you think the shtick is what keeps you afloat, reconsider. If it is, it can't keep you afloat indefinitely without quality in other areas to back it up. If you are confident in the quality in other areas, stop leaning on the shtick crutch so heavily and let your other qualities carry the show. If you have those other qualities and keep the shtick as is, I think that even of the viewers who do watch, they're going to watch in spite of the shtick and not because of it.
That's just my two cents.

Socialists focus too much on the restrictions on the freedom of the poor, while conservatives put too much stock in the efficacy of the rich. To both sides: A lot of poor people are to blame for their status and make excuses for their own problems, and a lot of rich people are quite lucky and fail to acknowledge that they enjoy a sense of freedom unknown to most of the world by sole virtue of their position.

I'm banking on delusional, or more politely, mistaken. You've got your own mind cornered in such a way that there's no chance your argument can be pierced. You ask for facts, knowing on some level that you'll keep redefining what that means until your interlocutors grow weary and throw in the towel. 
There is no "fact" indicating qualification, it's inherently a subjective measure and so we are left with subjective arguments as tools. You behave as if you understand this, but I wonder if it's consciously. At any rate, we all see that's your fallback.

You can't expose the inner layers to any heatsink, solid or liquid. There's not enough space. The whole point of 3D is to keep the circuit traces between transistors short. Otherwise, we would just make larger processors. But we don't, because the information propagation time from a transistor at one corner to the opposite corner would slow down the design.

This speculation is beneficial to the currency. It's increasing interest and bringing more people into the system.

Usually, I would agree. My perception though, as I assume it was his, is that anarchic ideals are often expressed by naive teenagers who don't understand either of the systems that they're rejecting or advocating. Such teenagers often have a mental wall that's rather impossible to reach through using rational arguments, and they often only reform their opinions after that wall has been violently bashed and ridiculed. So, I apologize for being presumptious and pursuing that avenue.
Ultimately, I think we could agree that your ideas should be allowed to stand on their merits. Unfortunately, you stated your ideas without presenting their merits, even after it was requested of you. It's as if I walked into an argument about soccer teams and interjected "If you all just played rugby, this discussion wouldn't need to happen" without giving any reason why, and then complaining when they told me to prove it or get out of the argument. What you did was shut down and fall back to fallacies, which just compounded the problem and invited my attack, since I assumed you were unwilling to engage in any substantive discussion.
So, now, how about returning to that previous post and engaging further in the discussion beyond your original assertion? Answering his questions in a way that supports your argument and then asking some of your own that will potentially reveal holes in his position when answered is really a fantastic way to debate, provided both parties don't take disagreement personally and maintain a sense of rationality.

The very fact that they're speculators makes me disagree. They have no interest in holding bitcoin at a stable price. They want to sell it at a maximum and purchase it at a minimum. They don't want to trade it when it's stable, which means their holdings aren't providing liquidity at an equilibrium state, either. If we were to take it to an extreme and imagine that every holder of bitcoin was a speculator, I can only imagine that it would be wildly volatile, even moreso than it is now.

No, I'm attempting to shame him into realizing his faults and correcting them. See, I used to have a similar idealistic outlook on issues. I, as with many hippies turned yes-men (exaggerated to make the point clear), changed my opinion as time went on.
Why is it that so many switch from liberal attitudes early in life to more conservative ones later? The former group would likely accuse the latter, as I did, that they sold out. They became jaded and gave up, and now are drones in the system. That's a naive oversimplification and misassumption of the process, though. What happened was that we realize after a time that it's simply not possible to move the mountain with a single motion. The best way to affect the system is to take a realistic stock of the impact a single movement can make, climb on, and start digging. Be humble and realize that when you die, you won't have moved the mountain, but will have had as much of an effect as possible. You will certainly have made more of an effect than the idealists who sit spinning their wheels and shouting at brick walls demanding change that no one in power will ever consider.

In my past experience with him, he passed instant judgements on me after I disagreed with him and simply didn't respond when I asserted he had no basis to draw judgment on me. He avoids giving an inch after taking a stance, and resorts to ignoring, ad hominem attacks, or using pedantry to twist himself into a favorable position. He's not an honest debater.

Don't get me wrong, I lean slightly towards the non-US method is overall better. I'm just agreeing with the other poster that our method is as logically sound as any other.
Having spent 10+ years in the restaurant industry, I am confident you're wrong in making a blanket statement that the only effect would be to create a better working condition for the worker. You would also damage their ability to earn a better than normal wage. While it's debatable if extra tipping would be eliminated from the status quo, it would certainly have a chilling effect.
You'd change the relationship dynamic between customer-server-employer greatly. There's something to be said for making a server instantly accountable for their performance. Outside of sales, it's one of the few places where workers are still relatively efficiently rewarded for the merit of work done. I haven't been fortunate enough to travel overseas, but having heard multiple accounts from others of cold servers who would better be described as order takers, I do appreciate the emphasis our system puts on making guests feel welcome.
Sometimes the servers complaining loudest about our system are the ones getting stiffed with good reason. If they can't earn a decent wage while those around them thrive, there's probably a reason why, and it's not the very small number of people who stiff regardless of service quality. 
There was a time that my girlfriend and I went to work at a brewery three months before it went out of business. There were a lot of factors that led to its end, but one of them was the shitty service provided by most of the staff. The servers continually complained about the customers and their lack of tips and were constantly worming their way out of work. No one even wanted to work the day shift anymore because the amount of customers had dropped off so much, but we couldn't have been happier to cover the place ourselves. My tip average was decidedly average itself, but the volume more than made up for it. My girlfriend, on the other hand, *averaged* 25% on her tips daily. We single-handedly stopped the daytime customer atrophy, and started bringing in regulars. Granted, the slide was too far along and they ended up closing anyway, but we were rewarded for our efforts. If we had instead been paid a constant wage, we would have had no incentive to attempt to break the status quo and at least I would have just derped along like the others.
You're probably thinking those other servers should have been fired, and I'd agree but like I said, there were a lot of other problems. But assuming they had been the only issue, you still have a problem of abstraction between the customer and server. 90% of customers never complain, but like you, just don't come back. It can take a lot of dissatisfied customers in the non-US system to make a manager realize they have a shitty server. Our tipping system is pretty good at self-policing. If a server gets stiffed, the whole staff often finds out about it. This makes it easier for a manager to identify a shit server, because they bitch the most.

I never said it was really super hard. I said the knowledge barrier to entry to transact in Bitcoin is higher than Paypal. Then you provided a counterargument which depends on a Paypal-like third-party to execute, which I let slide because my example of buying Reddit Gold depended on it.
But in continuing to claim that it took you three clicks and done, you're plain lying. If you can't explain how the BTC got from your wallet to Reddit's Coinbase account as a part of those 3 clicks, I'll be left to assume that what you really don't give a fuck about is backing up your arguments or admitting you may have been wrong.

That's just to get the car out of the driveway, continuing the previous analogy. would insist that you need to use 2FA, secure your brain wallet by memorizing a key with 90-bit+ entropy, perform due diligence when choosing service providers, etc. and there are still daily posts from early adopter enthusiasts getting burned in various ways.
I'm educated and intelligent enough to learn all the ins and outs, but I haven't done much except to dip my toe in the water, because of my concerns about the long-term prospects. I'm not really much of an early adopter; more of a "watch everyone else fall down before trying" sort. It's not good enough that a computer literate college grad can learn it, as far as I'm concerned. It needs to be easy enough that I can teach my grandma how to use it in an hour or two, because that's the only way everyone will hop on board.
Your assertion is too similar to the argument that everyone should be willing to put forth the effort to read quality literature on a daily basis, or that everyone should exercise regularly. Yes, it would benefit them and they could do it if they'd only dedicate themselves to it. But that's not how people really work. People usually take the path of least resistance, and to fail to recognize that reality can be a pitfall.
Edit: I attended a presentation given by a successful multi-company entrepreneur who now works as a consultant for start-ups. He related an experience relevant to this discussion. He once invented a technology that was superior to the one being used by the several clients he was intending to develop it for in order to sell it to them. After four years of developing and tweaking his product based on their feedback, he finally realized that he'd made a mistake from the outset that ultimately caused his business to fail. 
It wasn't that the product didn't meet their requirements, or that it wasn't significantly superior to what they'd been using. It was the simple fact that in order to utilize his technology, they'd have to significantly alter the way they did things. They were comfortable doing things the way they were used to. From then on, he never developed an idea simply because it was amazing or clearly superior. The question he always asked himself: "Do they *want* it?"

They need to understand how to use it. Have you ever tried walking a layman through how to use/protect a wallet? If everyone started using wallets tomorrow, so many people would get burned by insecure brain wallets that btc's image would never recover.
Edit: To elaborate using your analogy, people do need to understand cars to the degree that they can pass a licensing process on how to use them safely. They need to understand how the controls work and be able to follow the safety rules of the road. If we removed laws managing this status quo, crashes would increase greatly afterwards. Probably not tomorrow, unless kids started driving, but over time since the vast majority is qualified to drive currently.

I worry that it's a slippery slope that will erode the non-philosophical advantages of the currency (and I'm not confident philosophy alone will drive mass adoption).

The minimum debit transaction fee is $0.45 the last I saw. I worked in restaurants that probably saw 50-75% of revenue being paid with plastic. A typical 8-hour shift would end up with my personal credit sales at around $400 for 20 bills. Assuming there were a total of 10 servers like that, that means 200 transaction fees. If they're $0.50 each, that means $100 a day in fees. That's over $35,000 a year in transaction fees over a year.

Case in point: Buying reddit gold. How do I do this with bitcoins? Paypal is clearly an option in the checkout process, similar to any other merchant online. I just enter my Paypal login information, which is assumedly verified by Paypal, and then my transaction is processed. Paypal draws the funds from my balance or bank card on file, and then transfers those funds to Reddit's Paypal account.
Not only do I not see the option to pay with Bitcoin in the checkout process, which is onerous in and of itself, but I can't think of how that process would work if it were. The best I can imagine is that the checkout process provides you with an address to send BTC to, waits for you to perform the transaction with your wallet client, verifies it through the blockchain, and then finalizes your purchase of a gold subscription. This is hardly as easy to use as Paypal, for either the customer or merchant.

I think we're all assuming volatility arises from a single source and only referring to that source in our arguments. It's true that the bid/ask spread can cause volatility, which is mitigated by additional liquidity. However, it's also true that a large percentage of traders being speculators causes volatility by trading using speculative predictions instead of assessing fair value. The latter is what caused the bubble to pop at 900, because all of those speculators thought that was the threshold the market could bear and as soon as the momentum broke everyone headed for the hills. The speculation game is a big game of chicken (during the boom/bust period), testing everyone's resolve in how high the price can be pushed before people chicken out. If speculators were a good thing in that particular circumstance, I would have expected the liquidity they supposedly offer to have mitigated the drop off the cliff the price experiences every time these bubbles pop. Instead, those same speculators are the one driving the dive in the first place.

Without knowing the seed, though, its entropy would be between 92 bits and far less. I'm just not sure that going with the absolute most secure route will make you less likely to lose BTC than a memorable but less secure method, not to mention the PITA factor. I can have the most secure random string for my passphrase, but if I forget it, it's no better than "123456789". 
It's akin to protecting your cash. Sure, the most secure method may be to never carry cash or cards and only pay for things using cashier's checks, but most people would agree that the benefits of sacrificing a degree of protection for the usefulness of whipping out money when it's needed and avoiding a trip to the bank for every purchase is preferable.
