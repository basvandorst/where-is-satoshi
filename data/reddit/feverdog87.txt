[Heres a article just this year where he came under fire for donating to Republicans and conservative groups]( The guy was quick to jump on trump's council and only left when the climate accord was under fire. Something that directly reflects on his company. 
  It wasn't trump's view on women or minorities or his treatment of our allies, it was only when it directly affected his bottom line.
 [Heres another article this year where Musk joined in with trump to bag on Obama]( I think at the very least his priorities and choices should warrant more scrutiny than just blind support from fans.  He walks and talks like a conservative, he just happens to make money on cool tech and renewable energies. And let's face it: those industries were ripe for profit as fossil fuels had strangled government development in those fields.  Even then Tesla still isn't turning a profit. His CFO left after a month and his HR head isn't returning after their leave of absence.

He should stop calling rescuers pedophiles just because he's miffed.

I think that's fair. But he's also sculpted an image of progress. In reality many of his leanings are conservative.  Calling people you don't like "pedophiles" is a common dog whistle of the right and alt right. Stress does make us impulsive but it doesn't change who we are.
