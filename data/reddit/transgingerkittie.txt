I feel the same way... Tho I just got in today at 11.5. I feel like a limit of 12 makes sense for me, tho I feel like it really depends where you bought it at.

Yah I just put in 500 at 12750... I'm skeptical it's as smooth as people say it is until 17, like that's only theoretical who knows how well the theory will actually hold up...

Saaaaaame, I just created an account a few days ago, so I'm wondering if that's why. It also saved me tho lol. Looks like Gemini is 500/day and cash app is 2500 for the first month after you create an account, but apparently it goes up somewhat the more time you have it. So like 3k + 500/day max investment through non sketchy places instantly as far as I can tell.

Looking at the trends, it looks like the troughs are \~.14x - \~.17x ATP so it will almost certainly go below the current price at some point in the near future.

I was reading that if half of the money invested in gold (3.5T I think??) was moved to BTC, it would be 100k-200k. I assume it would be significantly more if that much fiat was converted.

Yah literally me yesterday... I can't even buy with coinbase right now for some unknown reason and I've emailed them and have yet to hear a response. You should get cash app, they do 2500 per day and verify pretty quick.
