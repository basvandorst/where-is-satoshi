Source of people buying food with Bitcoin?

I've done this many times, but I realize now my brokerage allows me to withdraw against a margin, so they can deposit funds the same day and sell to cover that.
An advantage of real brokerage, but it's true that a straight sale usually takes three days to clear.

Do you even have an anecdote to go along with this hyperbole?

This shows your *only* concern is that it affects people's perception of the currency.

Simple bank transfers? It takes three hours for me to sell stocks and see that money arrive in my checking account...
If you think seven business days are normal, I assume you're back in the days of the telegraph.

+1 for source, thank you.

Um, that's not certain at all, relatively or not. It's just what you *want* to be true, which is different.

That statement says literally nothing more than "the price is higher now than it was when it was first created, so it will keep going up."


You can say that about literally any stock that is higher now than it was when it first IPO'd. It's not good investing to say that that means it will keep going up.

That isn't revenue.
Apple products revenue because it actually creates something. It adds something new that wasn't there before. The revenue is in exchange for this thing. It's not just valuing itself higher on paper.
Compare this to PoS payments. Let's say everyone in America were using NEO/GAS, which apparently pays 8%. If everyone got paid 8%, would there be any more value in the world? No, the currency would simply be experiencing inflation, that's all.
It's no different than printing more money and giving it to people.

Yeah... Thinking that is a bit like saying "I mostly own Facebook stock, but I have a lot of Twitter and Snap as well, so I'm pretty diversified."
If one goes down the other *has* to go up, right??

I love the way you still think that people here have a crystal ball.
You know it's going to recover because that's what people here want to believe.
