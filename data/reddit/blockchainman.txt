@_date: 2015-12-03 14:15:01

Angola economy... ouch:
Growth and equitable development are constrained by the adverse business environment, 
inadequate governance and transparency in the management of public resources, weak quality 
and maintenance of physical infrastructure, limited quality of human resources, weak agriculture 
growth, inefficient public service delivery to the poor, and difficulties in managing income from 
non-renewables to create savings for future generations. Social pressures are increasing due to 
the high unemployment rate (26%), particularly among youth; significant poverty, affecting 36.6% 
of the population; and high income inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 55.3. In this context, 
structural reforms are imperative to accelerate economic diversification, reduce dependency 
on natural resources, increase productivity, improve the allocation of resources and create the 
conditions for a faster rate of economic growth and equitable development.

I think its a mistake that bitcoin was not made to be ASIC resistant. It only exists since 09 and it is already almost impossible to mine bitcoin privately.

@_date: 2015-12-25 18:00:42
There can be alt chains running their own needs. Look at "Clams" for example. It is an alt coin that is used strictly for gambling on specific gambling sites. It is doing fine and does not need to be pegged or related to bitcoin.

Independent nodes. If big data or individuals are running multiple nodes ( like in the top thread on r/bitcoin) this is not decentralization.

Blocksize increase directly or indirectly like with SegWit. SegWit is cool but realistically it needs to be rolled out and then used by everyone to make much of a difference. It doesn't change anything in most cases only in multisig transactions? 
And I repeat: I do not care for nor support Classic. I do think their approach of FIRST raising the blocksize is a good idea. I don't care for their nodes and it's useless for you to keep bringing it up. 
And yes, I am aware Core will be increasing the blocks eventually according to their "roadmap" but what happens if by that time another crypto really hammers down bitcoin or if alot of businesses come up with some other novel "blockchain tech" and we will miss out? 
You can kick the can down the road just a bit to give you some breathing room.

It seems it has become a constrained settlement layer for elitist  cryptocurrency users in the first world. 
If you don't want/can't afford to pay the ever increasing fees you are a pleb and don't deserve to use this "peer to peer" currency.

Think of LN as a "hot wallet". The bulk of your BTC should still be locked in cold storage.
Second reason:
The Lightning Network has problems with exchanging significant amounts of value.  For the Lightning Network to function, it requires that users and businesses lock up as much bitcoin as they would ever expect to transact over a given period of time.  For the micro-transaction use case, this isn’t a big deal.  Locking up $5 or $10 worth of value is obviously not a problem.  However, if you wanted to ‘only open one channel every six months’, as the Lightning Network slide deck suggests is a ‘reasonable use case’, things begin to fall apart.  For someone to only open one Lightning Network channel every six months, would mean that channel would have to lock up the maximum amount of value the user would ever hold over that period of time.  First of all, this would require a level of trust in the network which I have already noted will take a long time to achieve.  Second, it doesn’t seem practical that in a world where people get their paychecks roughly, on average, every two weeks, that they would be ready, willing, or able to lock up all of the funds they might want to use for a six month period.  You essentially have to think of the Lightning Network as a pre-paid debit card.  You have to fund it up front, you have to guess how much you are going to need, and whenever you run out, you are going to have to top it off again.  There is no scenario where it seems practical that people will only want to open a single channel once every six months.

@_date: 2016-01-20 18:02:20
100% agreed. This is the number 1 thing people have a problem with when i talk about the bitcoin or its price...
"600 Canadian for 1 coin???..... thats too expensive"
That's when I roll my eyes and say its divisible and you can buy X amount of dollars worth of bitcoin. People usually don't understand that even after I explain. 
Many are also very skeptical because they think they "missed the boat" with the price.
If bitcoin is divided by 100 by default, meaning each "coin" is $6 this will be enormously beneficial psychologically to introduce new people to it. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:17:07
I'd rather they keep it low while i scoop up some more.

@_date: 2016-03-03 22:16:22
You are naive if you think it will be cheaper for the people. If anything price will stay the same but the "faster" blockchain settlements might even carry a premium!
Also bitcoin's 6.5 billion market cap is a drop in the bucket for any top 50 currency out there so I doubt they are "devaluing" because of it. 
Edit: also it is likely they will use their own "blockchain" and bitcoin will have nothing to do with it.

You people might not realise that the Big 5 Canadian banks are almost  nationalized and have very strict controls on them. The Canadian banks in the Great Recession were far less affected because they are not allowed to recklessly gamble. 
If they do something that causes systemic big losses it would be directly the fault of the government, and hence they will be protected.

In 2015 we all understood that bitcoin is a politicized and fragile form of gambling and everyone except for a few sobered up. 
We are here to make money on the new suckers buying into bitcoin. I want to get rich from my coins because i think there are still suckers to milk!

Buy btc with your Chinese fiat --&gt;Teansfer btc to another place  --&gt;  cash out into your favourite fiat
In this scenario money doesn't stay in btc so why would it increase? 
Furthermore if you already bought btc recently (maybe during the recent pump) now you cashed it out overseas?

Personally i consider this kind of transperancy a serious flaw of bitcoin. These were not your coins and you didn't win the auction!. Yet, strangers are sitting online and tracking your shit and discussing it!
This is far from cash that is sitting in my safe!

Bitcoin is not ready for commerce yet. Slow confirmations, a steep learning curve for generally low-paid unskilled labour force and price volatility do not allow it.

Enwave's Deep Lake Water Cooling system uses cold water from Lake Ontario to cool buildings in downtown Toronto. Some customers include the Toronto-Dominion Centre, Royal Bank Plaza, RBC Centre, Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Air Canada Centre. The system has enough power to air condition 100 office buildings or 32 million square feet (3 million m²) of building space. It is the largest renewable lake source cooling system of its kind in North America.

Agreed. Its false logic to expect the price to go up so much that current size block fees will replace the coinbase reward. They might... but then the fees will also grow accordingly

A token that allows you to use the bitcoin network for whatever purpose.  If you and others think it has value and others want it, then it gets that value (in fiat) and becomes a store of value. I think this is bitcoin's strongest value right now since it is not ready for facilitating transactions with the 3 tx/s limit and not being widely accepted.

You are wrong. If the hash power falls then it will take longer to mine blocks than 10 minutes. Could/will cause a chain reaction where blocks just cant be mined.

Straight from wikipedia:
Commodity money is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made. Commodity money consists of objects that have value in themselves as well as value in their use as money.[1]
Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, salt, peppercorns, tea, large stones (such as Rai stones), decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, cocoa beans, cowries and barley. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.

What i am saying is that if alot of miners drop out because it is not economical for them to keep the rigs on, the block discovery time will increase from 10 minutes to an unknown. The difficulty adjustment is in blocks not in time so the adjustment will also take longer.
What can prevent this is miners running at a loss to prevent this.

I meant try to explain noobs what the mempool is or how there are different versions with different mempools and variable / adjustable tx fees etc.
Average person is far too simple/willingly ignorant for that. Nobody cares or wants to know what it takes their CC to make a purchase or how the backend at Paypal works or how much the merchant pays in fees. They just want the tx to happen reliably.

I agree with you 100%. Bitcoin at the moment resembles a risky pennystock or overhyped tech company stock. The other investment vehicles yiu mentioned are highly regulated and people never have to worry. Most likely they even pay someone to manage those too.

Freedom has a price. You will pay whatever the fee is if you want to get your transaction on bitcoin. You can cry foul all day long but that's reality. 
I am not for small blocks and hate the centralization that is happening but what can I do but pay up. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:44:19
They are correct. Bitcoin is a transparent pyramid scheme. The more money flows into bitcoin the more the early investors and everyone down the line profits. I could have convinced people long ago to buy bitcoin and they would have made tremendous gains. Others would see that and buy too, and they would gain. This cycle continues the more people buy.
This is clearly a pyramid scheme but without a corporation or owner.
Many things work the same way including commodities, currencies and stocks
