Giving each student easy access to a university-run "bank" with safe backed-up storage and good access would be a big step in the right direction. Having everywhere in MIT that accepts dollars also accept BitCoin would do far more.
The reason that the dollar works - that all currency works, really - is that people need it to interact with the government. Make BitCoin the easiest way to interact with MIT (for daily use stuff even) and people will use it, which will force them to acquire it, which will entice more people to take it, etc.

My point was that source *availability* doesn't equal any sort of *review*, I see that it wasn't well made in my other comment.  


We agree? Paying somebody to do the job is the best way to be sure.  


What's the practical difference? Either way it's trusting the dev and whichever way you have of verifying "goodness" (mine's google! :)). Already compiled or compiling it yourself doesn't change that.  
If you only use stuff that your linux distro has then maybe they eye through things before it gets added/updated? Not sure exactly how that works.

Satoshi answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am Bitcoin Jesus,' and will deceive many. And many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is Bitcoin Jesus!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Bitcoin Jesuses and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of time. "So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Inventor.

I think you're being very optimistic, how many people would actually go though and understand every single part of something unless they had a good reason? And if they're good enough to actually find hidden things*, they'd reasonably have a job doing it. Remember that the people that hide backdoors (or whatever) have financial incentive to be good while the random guy checking random projects on github wouldn't.  
*edit: better hidden than upload(passwords.dat,nice-server-honestly.ru.cn)  


Fully agree. :)  


Same as open source. Not arguing that one is better, but the reasoning that open source is better because "the source is right there, somebody *must* have checked it from top to bottom" is (imo) garbage.

Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of the interference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursue their own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.

@_date: 2015-03-20 14:32:37
That's how Bitcoin was made. Satoshi told his computer that he wanted a currency, parameters "p2p" "crypto", and it shat out bitcoin.exe.

Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a person's sexual choice is the result and sum of their fundamental convictions. Tell me what a person finds sexually attractive and I will tell you their entire philosophy of life. Show me the person they sleep with and I will tell you their valuation of themselves. No matter what corruption they're taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which they cannot perform for any motive but their own enjoyment - just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity! - an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exultation, only on the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces them to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and accept their real ego as their standard of value. They will always be attracted to the person who reflects their deepest vision of themselves, the person whose surrender permits them to experience - or to fake - a sense of self-esteem .. Love is our response to our highest values - and can be nothing else.
