I used to like roger ver a lot. that guy has fallen so far. that sub exists for nothing but shilling out his own projects. half the links on the sidebar go to bitcoin.com or some project he invested in.
he'll literally post a tweet and then link to it on himself. if he jacked himself off any harder i'd be worried he might pull his own cock off.

I can't speak to the ones you listed specifically, but i've had a trezor for quite a while now. it has been infinitely portable, and suprisingly resillient. its taken a serious beating and still works great. as for the ui and the software experiance. i've used it in the web browser. i've also used it with an otg cable connected to my phone with mycelium, and from what i understand it also works quite well with electrum aswell, though I haven't used that personally. I like that it allows for an optional 13th word for security/password's sake and plausible deniability. i also like that it has hardware buttons that make it so that software cant hijack the device and sign transactions without your express permission using the hardware button itself.
I don't know how many of these features exist across all devices, but they certainly exist with trezor and it's been a great experience.
you can also use it as an authentication device of sorts. authorizing ssh sessions and stuff if that's something you're into.

@_date: 2018-01-01 03:23:55
as far as i can tell from reading about it, when you are running a node to validate all of the transactions yourself it scales the same way bitcoin does. as the number of transactions go up the more bandwidth is required. most people on the network seem to be offloading their validation to other people. how is that any different than spv on bitcoin?

When you run blocksonly how much bandwidth does it use per month?

I don't have much bandwidth to spare with all of the other things I do. Could this get me down to 50gb per month or less once it is fully synced?

I mean it could be a situation like poloniex where they had to sell it and keep it going, but clean it up to avoid getting in legal trouble. You have no idea what the circumstances are behind the decision he made. I'm not saying he's a saint, but neither of us have no idea what went into it. It's possible that shutting it down was a larger liability than keeping it going and "cleaning it up". You also have no idea what he is and is not allowed to talk about. He may not be able to tell us what's going on. That's how a lot of these legal things work. You get yourself into trouble when you start talking about it.

the majority of people are holding their bitcoin on an exchange or in the custody of a third party. the number of addresses isn't representative of the number of people that own bitcoin. also many people have bitcoin they control in multiple different addresses.

i mean that may be true, but they still found the bug, and they still did disclose it to wladimir. i don't know why that doesn't deserve a huge amount of credit when they very easily could have just not done that. the bug has been around for a long time, and could have been around for a lot longer. as a zero day if they had just sold the exploit to someone they could have made a lot of money, but they didn't. instead they told them about it.
if you think that core would have seen the patch and investigated it, it's possible that they could have obfuscated the patch and made it non-obvious that it was fixing a vulnerability and then core may have just continued to have been vulnerable.
i don't see why we can't be grateful that they disclosed the bug. it's great for us. we have in the past and should continue to reciprocate. it's better for everyone.

he says he has a twitter account dedicated to ta and he's talked about ta on some of his interviews.
i think that TA cannot work becuase if there was a method of TA that did work then everyone would start using it which would immediately drop the profits of that method to 0. it's basically a free lunch, and free lunches can't exist.
as for tone vays, i think he's always wrong because of his obvious TA nonsense, but even beyond that he is technically incompetent. I've watched a lot of his content and he's made a lot of claims about the technology that show that he isn't very familiar with the the inner workings of the technology. he talks outside of his area of expertise very often.

It would be very inadvisable for him to lie at this point. He would wind up spending a long time in jail. It is overwhelmingly in his best interest to be as honest as he can be so that he can get this over with and move on with his life.
As for the left over money, they were originally going to reimburse people based on the price that bitcoin was at when it was stolen. That means that even after every single person had been reimbursed he would have literally been a mega multi-millionaire. He said he didn't want that, and that he would try to make it so that all the money was given to the people who lost money. It wasn't crumbs. It was a fuck ton of money.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:17:14

I don't really have a problem with them taking some time to implement segwit, so long as they are actually working toward doing it. The thing you need to realize about these big exchanges is that you should want them to be incredibly conservative. It can also be a non-trivial task to rework their entire backend to implement stuff like this. Even once it is done you should also want them to spend time making sure that the changes work as intended. It's possible that when they first designed their systems that they did it in such a way that it wasn't very easy to modify things, and while that was a mistake, hopefully when they are modifying things to implement segwit, they will also be changing things to make things easier to add in the future. As long as they are actually working toward that goal and not lying I don't really have an issue with them taking their time.
People love to talk about how some random website selling stickers on the internet implemented segwit x number of weeks ago, but that is a really stupid argument. These exchanges are holding millions upon millions of dollars and they are moving billions of dollars around. If your sticker store fucks up and loses money it is a nothing story, if a major exchange fucks up and loses money it is a catastrophe.
I understand that some exchanges have implemented segwit faster than others but you don't really have any context for that. There could be any number of reasons for that. It's possible that their backend was designed in a much better way, thus making it easier to make changes like this. It's also possible that they rushed out segwit before it was properly tested and has problems that could be a liability in the future.

more people have lost bitcoin to setting up convoluted solutions and forgetting how to recover them or losing the seed than have had their bitcoins actually stolen. something that is really memorized today won't necessarily be really memorized in 2 years. on top of that you have no way of knowing whether these email services will be around in 5 years depending on what services you use. if you are using a service like protonmail, you should realize that lavabit was around and working right up until the day it wasnt.
i would strongly suggest using a more tried and true method of storing your bitcoin. while /maybe/ your solution offers less risk of your bitcoin being stolen, it also has a /much/ higher risk of you just outright losing it.

buddy you need to chill. i don't care what you do. You literally asked for feedback so I gave it. Jesus christ. If you don't want people's input then don't make a thread asking for it. 
The point is you are much more likely to lose money from coming up with a cute solution than you are from using traditional methods. You are also much more likely to lose money than you are have it stolen from you. Unless you absolutely have to you should NOT be relying on having something as complex as a seed memoized. Human memory is incredibly faulty.
For whatever it's worth storing your private key and your encrypted seed online doesn't seem like a very good idea. At that point you might aswell just use a safety deposit box as it has all of the same benefits, but is much safer.

segwit is a softfork that moves the witness data from the main block to an extension block that has a limit of 4mb. the general consensus is that segwit will allow for an effective block size increase to ~1.7mb. that said if people find interesting and creative ways to structure transactions we could get a much larger effective block size increase. there is no hardfork involved in activating segwit.
the block size change will go from a 1mb block to a 1mb base block + a 4mb witness extension block.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:59:14
hash power seems to be the best way to signal activating a fork. It's not perfect though. When you base it on hash power that's ignoring a large portion of the userbase. you are ignoring all non-miners. That means everyone using an SPV wallet (electrum, mycelium bread wallet etc) a full node (core, unlimited etc) all businesses (bitpay, coinbase, bc.i etc). None of those nodes are putting forward a vote. So if someone forces through a controversial hard fork and none of these infrastructural nodes have switched over you will have 2 incompatible chains that are not capable of interacting with eachother. In order for a hard fork to work you need ALL nodes to switch or atleast an overwhelming majority of ALL(not just mining) nodes to switch over. Now what you will notice if you are paying attention is that a lot of infrastructural nodes (businesses, wallets, etc) are moving to support segwit whereas a lot of the mining nodes are moving to support BU.  If BU triggers and starts mining large blocks then they will be off mining big blocks by themselves since all of the infrastructure isn't running their consensus code.
I'm not suggesting we use a different way to trigger or signal activating forks, because this is probably the best we can do (atleast right now), but it is far from perfect.
edit: to be clear once the threshold is reached they will absolutely activate the fork, but if the infrastructure doesn't move with them there will be 2 incompatible forks running side by side. that could be a disaster scenario.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:44:46
if 75 percent of the hashing power upgraded to BU or whatever the required threshold is and the rest of the ecosystem didn't then all of the businesses that are still running non-bu nodes for their infrastructure and businesses will ignore their blocks since BU will have created incompatible blocks and forked away from them. BU will be mining blocks that are incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem.
if you are going to have a successful hardfork miners alone can not force it through. You need all of the infrastructure to move with them or else they are burning energy for nothing.

BU is has already mined consensus invalid blocks. They are either ideologues or people that are trying to coopt the network. If they actually cared about making the most money they would support the status quo and mine only current core blocks. Not segwit or unlimited.

satoshi is not a deity as much as everyone loves to pretend he is. He's also not infallible. The level of understanding of where this ecosystem would be now in 2010 was very low. it was extremely experimental back then. people didn't even know whether it would work. satoshi didn't even know if it would work, so him predicting things about the future is basically worthless. people need to stop using his quotes as fucking scripture.
would you use 1970's-1980's level understanding of networking to understand how the internet functions today? no you fucking don't because as times progresses and you gather more information, and you incorporate that new information your perspective potentially changes.
also anyone can take a satoshi quote and twist it to make it mean whatever agenda they are trying to push. big blocks, small blocks, segwit, no segwit, spv, no spv. whatever position you are trying to force through I promise there's a quote for you. how about you just fucking stop speaking for satoshi.

you are asking a question that is difficult to impossible to answer. There are people who absolutely refuse to run bitcoin unlimited. So if bitcoin unlimited does activate there is no way around the fact that the network will split in 2. that's the problem with hard forks. Everyone needs to upgrade. We've never activated a hard fork in bitcoin before. They've all been soft forks. Soft forks are much less risky because they are backwards compatible. You don't need to have the whole network upgrade to activate a soft fork.
They don't monolithically decide when to switch. Each node is a unique and individual actor in the ecosystem. Each one can independently choose to upgrade or not. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:32:36
put it in quotations all you want. when you intentionally overwrite blocks that miners commit to the blockchain that DO conform to the rules you are literally attacking the network. not only that you are creating an easy vector for people to commit double spends. if i conform to the rules and put in transaction a, and you overwrite my block and don't put that transaction in that block, then transaction a has been effectively double spent. all i would need to do is relay transactions to those miners intentionally and i can easily double spend transactions

there is a little bit of a difference there. segwit is a softfork, and thus backwards compatible.
we may or may not be able to ever actually activate a hardfork. it would be nice if we did/could at some point. i'm not making a case against a hard fork. i don't think that trying to force through a controversial hard fork is a good idea at all, and I'm skeptical that even a non-controversial hardfork would work out unless it being activated was necessary to bitcoins survival (ie a devistating bug is found in bitcoin that requires a hardfork to solve)

every single transaction in the blockchain is a financial transaction. value is being transmitted from x address/es to y other address/es and while some may not have cost a fee initially all of them do now except under very strange circumstances.

it's an implementation of sidechains. you can create a "drivechain" which is pegged to bitcoin. these drivechains can have rules different to those that bitcoin has. For example, larger blocks, better fungibility, "smart contracts", or whatever else you may want to try. you can move to and from these drivechains while staying inside of bitcoin the whole time.

 this a stupid comparison because when you run a bitcoin full node you do so while recognizing that you will be bearing the burden of every single transaction on the network. the overwhelming majority of them are not mine and i do not want them bloating my node and therefore using your "email" analogy everything that doesn't directly effect me is spam
i don't want any of your transactions. stop spamming my blockchain
by the way his definition is retarded "if everyone burdnened by it doesn't consent" clearly the person who sent the transaction consented to it or they wouldn't have transmitted it. second of all clearly the miner who mined the block consented becuase they mined the fucking block. third i consent to all transactions that miners choose to incorporate into a block. therefore not everyone doesn't consent.
second of all how bitcoin was designed to be used doesn't mean shit. people will use it however they want within the confines of the rules. it doesn't matter how you want them to use it. they will use it in whatever way they like.
third of all all transactions are financial transactions since you are moving bitocin from one place to another which has financial value. also based on the fact that it at this point requires a fee that is also value being transfered.

Altruism is all good and fine but it isn't a sustainable model for success. Humans are naturally selfish and act in their own self interest. The system needs to have incentives in place that will make it such that selfish actors will act in a way that is good and sustainable. Luckily Bitcoin does have such incentives. Validating your own transactions is enough incentive for selfish actors to run nodes which have the by product of keeping the network healthy.
My point isnt that people shouldn't run nodes period... It's that doing it for altruistic reasons isn't productive or sustainable​. It's a waste of time.

Buddy I can disagree with whatever I want. That was both an opinion and something someone can agree or disagree with. On top of that you totally just straw manned me. I never made any claims about what Bitcoin needed as far as full nodes to work. All I did was point out that over time the number of full nodes as an absolute percent of users has done nothing but drop since inception and then posit that it will both continue to drop and nothing can be done to stop it. I'm pointing out what has happened in the past and suggested what I think will happen in the future. I said nothing about what should happen or what Bitcoin needs with regards to full nodes.

that's what happens when you try to trade or time the market. if you want to expose yourself to bitcoin invest only what you are willing to lose and dollar cost average it over a long period of time so you don't have to deal with the volatility as much. don't buy and sell. that's how you will wind up selling low and buying high.

yes. that's not to say that's good for bitcoin, but bitcoin is designed such that whatever the miners put in their blocks, so long as it follows the rules, are real/valid transactions. bitcoin doesn't place a value judgement on who did it or why they did it or what it represents.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:36:56
Running a node for altruistic reasons is stupid. Bitcoin does not and can not be sustained on altruism. If you want to validate your own transactions then run a full node. If not then don't. Bitcoin nodes are easily sybilled. Your "vote" doesn't matter. What matters is what people who need to run nodes run. Places like bitpay, purse.io, spv wallets, miners, darknet markets etc

if you try to time the market you will do nothing but buy at the top and sell at the bottom. there are professional traders out there that will just eat you for breakfast.
let me explain how bitcoin works. you probably won't listen since no one listens until they lose atleast once:
do not spend any more money than you can afford to lose.
do not spend any more money than you can afford to lose.
bitcoin might go to zero tomorrow. there are any number of things that can happen that could cause this. it's possible that an altcoin will overtake it and bitcoin will go to zero. it's possible that there is an undiscovered bug in the protocol, or the implementation of bitcoin that causes it to become weak.
do not buy and sell. that it how you lose money unnecessarily. if you are interested in investing in bitcoin buy and hold. bitcoin in the long run will either be worth a shit ton or it will be worth little to nothing. probably even better than impulse buying randomly would be to set up a consistent autobuy over a long period of time. this is called dollar cost averaging. it will lessen the volatility by a lot and will likely cause you to buy bitcoin for cheaper than you would had you tried to time it. coinbase allows you to do this automatically. you could for example set up an automatic buy once a month for 10 dollars. you can adjust this as you see fit. 5 dollars a day, 10 dollars a week, 20 dollars a month. whatever you feel is safe for you.
unless you want to get involved in the bitcoin economy and spend it, buy more etc, just throw it on a shelf and forget about it. forget about it for like 3-5 years. it will either appreciate or it won't. that's how investments work.
do not spend any more money than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:37:10
This is such a chicken little post. As long as you know what neutrino is and the implications of using it there is nothing wrong with using it. I disagree with the claim that using an spv wallet is worse than using a custodial solution(assuming you have the competency to hold your own keys). I also disagree strongly that eventually everyone will run a full node. Over time the absolute percentage of people owning bitcoin running full nodes has decreased and it's going to continue to decrease and I would posit that there's nothing you can do to stop it. In a world where things are trending that way and will not revert you need to offer the best solutions that you can to those people. Custodial, explorer and spv are all reasonable solutions with different trade-offs and they all have their demographics and use cases. If someone has the competency to be able to hold custody of their own keys I would much prefer them to do so and keep it in an spv wallet than keep it in a custodial wallet, up to a certain amount of money. Keeping a non-trivial amount of money in a non-custodial hot wallet would probably be more dangerous than keeping it in a custodial wallet for example. Obviously keeping it in your own cold wallet/hardware wallet would be preferable in this case.
This fud surrounding neutrino is so stupid. There is nothing evil or insidious about neutrino. It isn't some magical panacea either. It just is what it is.

i don't see any reason to take on the risk.  day trading is a great way to turn a large sum of money into a small sum of money. if you are long bitcoin, day trading is exposing you to a large amount of risk that you are not being compensated for.  sure you won't sell at the top and make sick gains buying the dip, but you also won't sell in the middle, and fomo buy at the top taking a 50 percent loss either.
if you want to speculate on bitcoin, it's almost always better to just hodl and enjoy the ride.

if you try to time the market you're going to have a bad time. timing the market is a combination of astrology and gambling. You might as well ask your magic 8 ball if now is the best time to buy.
if you want to invest in something, doesn't have to be, but does include bitcoin, the best way to do it would be dollar cost averaging over a long period of time.  you will buy at the highest pricepoint, but you will also buy at the lowest price point, which means you will average out somewhere in the middle which is much better than fomo buying at the top and panic selling at the bottom.

don't tell other people to buy into bitcoin. this isn't a cult. if you understand and believe in bitcoin then feel free to invest the amount of money you are comfortable losing if it were to explode next week. you have no way of knowing if bitcoin will be a success, and the people you are talking to have even less of an idea than you. when you go around telling people to throw all of their money into bitcoin you are basically acting like a blind ponzi salesman. 
even if we assume that bitcoin isn't in a bubble and will continue to go up, and we assume that there isn't a latent bug that will destroy it, and we assume that it won't be replaced by an altcoin, and we assume that it has long term viability, (none of which are guaranteed or owed to you. any one of those could be false) there are still plenty of ways for people who don't know what they are doing to lose everything. you could leave it on an exchange and the exchange could get hacked. you could store it yourself and lose the key. you could throw it into any number of scams and lose it that way. you could have someone compromise your computer and steal them.
bitcoin isn't just a delayed vending machine where you throw in 10 dollars today and in 5 years you are a millionaire. 
my default stance for everyone i know is: don't buy bitcoin. if you find bitcoin interesting feel free to read about it and learn about it. if you enjoy it, find it interesting and think it is compelling, then you can decide for yourself if you want to buy some. if you do decide to buy bitcoin do not try to time the markets. you will lose. you are not smarter than the market, and you will do nothing but lose money. buy whatever amount it would be that gives you the level of exposure you are comfortable with and then just hold on to it. throw the bulk of it into cold storage and forget about it if you are looking at it as an investment. if you are looking to play with it or do commerce with it put some of it on your phone so you have easy access to it. fees are making it difficult to do stuff like that right now, but hopefully in the future stuff like lightning and drivechains should help alleviate those problems.

if you have the private keys you still control the bitcoin. depending on what the formating is of the private key you should be able to import it into either electrum or bitcoin core. electrum would be much easier if it's supported since you wouldn't have to download the full blockchain.

People going around promising gains, and telling people who don't know what they are getting themselves into to invest potentially more money than they could afford to lose into a difficult to follow, difficult to understnad, high risk, high reward asset is incredibly irresponsible. Even if bitcoin's price  continues to rise there are a number of ways to lose your money, like I listed in the previous post.

None of those are related the the claim that you made, so I don't see what you are getting at.
as for the services he builds. He is literally only interested in being rich. He builds businesses in legal grey areas that have high levels of risk because they also have high levels of profit. These escapades have landed him in jail for fraud and under investigation for fraud multiple times. He has literally fled multiple jurisdictions out of fear of being incarcerated for the fraud he has commited. He doesn't give a shit about free speech or the end of copyright. The reason he is able to make all of his money is because it's a legal grey area or even illegal what he is doing. If it wasn't that way the margins would be much thinner and he wouldn't be in this business. Luckily for him bitcoiners and pirates are incredibly gullible and they think he is fighting the good fight for their benefit when in reality that couldn't be any further from the truth.

reddit can run their website however they like, just like can run their subreddit however they like (as long as they follow the rules). i don't have a problem with the rate limit existing. it makes it difficult to interact there with it in place so I wouldn't interact there as often. i also don't have a problem with censoring or creating a disincentive for certain people that they don't like. that is also fine with me. that said if they do that then they are lying when they call it the subreddit for free and open discussion that will not be censored.

You probably shouldn't have bought in the first place in that case. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

his new project is only attaching itself to bitcoin/blockchain because he's buzzword surfing. He also uses words like decentralization and censorship resistance because people in this space start drooling when they hear stuff like that even when it isn't true. There is no way in hell he will release a project that is truly decentralized, because  he is a meglomaniac, and you can't control a decentralized system. Maybe it'll be decentralized the way steemit or one coin is decentralized(not decentralized). He also has a fundamental misunderstanding of what blockchains do. A blockchain's sole purpose is for creating digital bearer assets. That's literally the only useful thing that they do. Now I don't know what kind of efficiency digital bearer assets will add to file lockers, but I don't imagine there's anything there. Maybe he's only planning on accepting bitcoin as a payment method? Micropayments via ln or tumblebit or something? If that's the case I dunno why he's making a big deal of out blockchain/bitcoin since plenty of places accept bitcoin already. If he wanted a way to verifiably and cryptographically link hashes digital signatures and shit like that has existed for years even in databases. If he's looking for a decentralized way to store hashes of data dht has been in use by bittorrent for years. So what is it that blockchains add to megaupload? Nothing at all.

if we are going to have an exponential increase, i don't know why you are suggesting a linear solution.
raising the block size is not a sustainable way to meet the demand. that is a linear scaling method.  even if there was no block limit at all it would not be possible to store all the worlds needs and uses inside the blockchain. there will be uses and apllications that we can't even imagine at this point in the future. just like how back in the 80's we didn't expect that every single light bulb would need an ip address in the future, there will be no way to meet the demand using linear scaling methods. You need exponential scaling, or ways to make transactions more effecient.


the aggregate fees may or may not be the same whether you increase the block size or not. maybe if people are paying a fee of 100sat/byte at 1mb blocks, people will be paying 50sat/byte at 2mb assuming demand is constant across both examples. it won't necessarily increase the overall fees going to the miners.

It would seem to me that anyone that is willing to pay the fee, and miners are willing to add to blocks would by definition not be spam. That said I am fully sympathetic to altering incentives to make it either expensive or impractical for inefficient or wasteful uses of the blockchain. There are no free lunches here, as much as people like to pretend that there is. There is a real cost to managing and sustaining the blockchain such that regular users are able to run their own validating node,(while still being able to write to the blockchain) and with infinite block space and free transactions whats to stop me from using the blockchain as my own personal dropbox that the entire network must bear the burden of.

i used to talk about bitcoin a lot, but bitcoin is much less of a religion for me now. if bitcoin winds up being useful people will find it without me going around spreading the good word. 
I've also seen enough of bitcoin to know that investing in it is risky, especially if you aren't technically minded and you don't know what you are getting yourself into. Most people only wind up interested in when i think they should buy so they can get rich. that is a stupid conversation to have so i dont do it.
I've never had someone else mention bitcoin without me introducing it to them at an earlier date or bringing it up myself, so now that I don't bring it up it doesn't get talked about.

it is not stronger than it was before the fork. infact it is fundamentally broken. they built ethereum on uncensorable code as law, then they proceeded to censor it when they got an outcome they didn't like. if anything they proved that their blockchain is worthless since vitalik can just hard fork whatever outcome pleases him.
there were a lot of bugs in ethereum that needed to be fixed, but the sheer volume of bugs in ethereum are just proof of the developer's incompetence. obviously you can't prevent and predict all bugs, but they have had so many hugely disruptive bugs that trying to call their protocol strong or their developers swift and effective is absolutely insane.
i could create a blockchain with a bunch of bugs and then hard fork fixes to the blockchain over the course of 2 years, but that isn't evidence of my competence, it shows that i'm a fucking retard that didn't know what they were doing.
these types of things don't happen in bitcoin very often. there's a reason for that: the developers are very careful about what they put into bitcoin so that we can avoid ridiculous situations where we need to force through hark fork after hard fork.
you can call that stagnation or whatever you want, but either way it is better than ethereum in every single way. there is no upside to using ethereum. ethereum is garbage at best, and a scam at worst.
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:05:07
first of all that is a false dichotomy. there are many options other than the 2 you suggested.
second of all they still are working on the bitcoin protocol. there's a softfork that is waiting to signal as we speak. so I don't know what this stagnation is that you are speaking of. just because we don't hard fork every 2 weeks like ethereum doesn't mean we have ossified.

i agree that we've learned a lot from them. just because ethereum is a scam doesn't mean that it isn't interesting to observe. there are plenty of devs that do not understand economics that are involved in this space that do not realize that they are scamming.
zooko and zcash is another great example. these people are running ponzi schemes. they don't know they are doing it, and atleast as far as zooko is concerned, he is doing interesting science, but that doesn't make their projects any less scams.
hard forks are things that should be avoided at all costs. the only reason you should ever fork is because there is no other choice. it is a very dangerous thing to do. the more infrastructure you have built out, and the larger your network effect the more dangerous it becomes.
ethereum is capable of doing it because there is no real commerce being done there. all of the capital that exists there is speculation, and a large percentage of the ether that people own are held in exchanges, so the responsibility of keeping the client working lies with the exchange holders and not the users

no is a subreddit that is heavily censored(or curated depending on who you ask). that said i don't think it claims to be a bastion of free speech and open discussion, so it doesn't personally bother me. i think if reddit doesn't see an issue with the way he is running his subreddit, then he should be able to do it(i would personally hold him to a standard of being clear of the rules and being consistant about it. he seems to do this so it's fine by me).
reddit generally has a hands off approach to communities so long as they aren't breaking the rules.

I'm not saying people should or should not invest in bitcoin. People should do what they want.
I don't have any issue with people responsibly investing in bitcoin, that part I agree with you on. The part where I disagree is the part where you make predictions about the future. There is no way to know what the future will bring. It's possible that bitcoin displaces the dollar and becomes the world reserve currency, but it's also possible that an exploit is found next week and bitcoin dies an irreparable death. Any number of things in between those 2 options are also a possibility.
There are people who have bought bitcoin and are in debt. In fact a day or 2 ago someone wound up quite in the negative by trying to do bitcoin daytrading. There are people who bought in 2013 that are in debt, but we are on an upswing. What if it goes up to 1200 hundred again and people keep buying all the way up and then it drops back down to 500? You have no way of knowing whether that is going to happen or not. If that does happen then suggesting people invest right now would be a huge loss for them.
Obviously if you discount all of the losses then everything is going to be profit. If you ignore the part where it crashed and burned enron was a pretty good deal too.

@_date: 2016-12-03 04:50:12
what evidence do you have that that is the case? if there was no competition to get into a block the fees would likely be lower like they were before. it's entirely possible that with a 100 percent increase in block size would lead to a more than 50 percent drop on a per fee basis that would cause the fees in total to stay the same or even possibly go down.

you say smart move as if the market as a whole is an intelligent being. that is most certainly not the case. The market is just an ecosystem that fluctuates as variables change. there are most definitely a series of variables that could come up that could bring bitcoin below 1k under those circumstances. You are the type of person who would have never believed that we would drop from our previous high of 1200 back down to ~240. I hope you don't make all of your investments based on superstition, becuase if you do, you're going to have a bad time.

i'd say the biggest offender was when they lied, stole 150 million dollars worth of ether from a person(or group of people) who just interacted with the code the way that it was designed, and split the community in 2. the splitting of the community being the strongest evidence of a failure as it is directly damaging to the consensus of the network. i would have been more sympathetic if it was a bug in ethereum itself, but it was a bug in the dao. that would be like hard forking all of the people who lost money in mtgox their money back.
that said, ethereum was dead on arrival. it's been a scam since day 1.
@_date: 2016-12-06 01:05:20
plenty of people get into things without intending to run a scam, and they don't realize they are running a scam until it is too late. look at trendon shavers with his loan based ponzi, mark karpeles with mtgox, griff green with the dao. those are all examples of people inside this space that got into whatever they were doing with no ill intent, and before they knew it they were in over their head and their project went tits up and they were running a scam.
daniel larimer has started multiple ponzi block chain related projects that he "handed to the community" aka exited his position in the ponzi and left the greater fools to suffer.
ethereum ran an ico, which is a security and likely a ponzi scheme aswell. even if you ignore the ico, the fact that he made a promise about his project and then lied, and stole many multiple millions of dollars from menber/s of his community is by definition fraud.
vitalik was also trying to sell the community on quantum computer based mining before he was working on ethereum. he is literally a serial scam artist. he may or may not be aware that he is scamming, but either way he is still doing it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:28:47


No that isn't what he said. He said he was selling now so that he could buy it back cheaper before he edited it. He even joked about how he would fomo buy it back when it shot back up. That IS NOT cutting losses AT ALL.


I agree that hodling is also gambling. There is always risk in literally every investment. This includes bonds, index funds, and whatever investments you consider safe.(note: I do know that it is a spectrum and some are safer than others, my point is that taking a position in anything has risk.) Trading and trying to time the market in any given asset HAS TO be more risky than just holding it though. Holding it is NOT less risky than trying to time the market. With day trading you can wind up with less than you started with, whereas with holding it you cannot.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:51:19
Maybe you are misunderstanding my position, or maybe I misstated it. I'm not saying whether he should hold or not. That's his decision. Both buying and selling are reasonable things depending on the logic behind the decision. I'm not telling him to hold. What I'm saying is that the logic of selling with an expectation that you will buy in later at a better price is trying to time the market which is a bad idea. I would make the case that no one should time the market, but that would just lead to a bigger argument, so I'll just say that if you are not an expert you should not be trying to time the market.
I would make that case that you should decide whether to take a position based on if you think it will be successful long term. I don't think you should take price movements into consideration, because I don't think that is useful data. If bitcoin is successful it will go up, and if it isn't it will go down. Short term day to day price fluctuations are irrelevant in the long run, and will accomplish nothing but potentially reducing your position that you are trying to increase.

which spec is bitcoin? bitcoin core? bitcoin2x? bitcoin cash? depending on who you ask you will get a different answer. your netgear router and linksys router both speak the same specification. bitcoin core 0.15.1 and btc1/bitcoin 0.15.1 do not. being explicit and clear which implementation and specification seems like it would be important, rather than a vague "whatever we decide at the time"

@_date: 2019-12-03 09:44:48
you realize we've had stuff like merkle trees, linked lists and hashes for decades right? when people say blockchain technology they are referencing stuff that isn't new or novel. what made bitcoin novel was proof of work(more specifically the way that satoshi implemented it to tie it all together). if you remove proof of work then it isn't new, interesting or innovative. you are just left with a shitty database. there is nothing interesting about a shitty database unless you are trying to hustle VCs or naive investors into giving you their money. thus a buzzword. There is no reason that facebook couldnt have done this 15 years ago. these technologies have existed since way before bitcoin. The only reason they are doing it is because it's the cool and hip thing to be doing right now.

thanks for the input that definately is interesting, and was the direction i was trying to push the question.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:15:45


that is interesting and makes sense, but i'm not sure that ports over, because i'm not sure that blockchains without proof of work are better than traditional databases for stuff that banks would use them for. maybe if you mean just using traditional databases with more up to date components.. but then we have morphed the word blockchain like 12 different times from it's original meaning to the point where it doesn't mean anything at all. at that point you are just talking about "database technology"


that definitely isn't true. centralized databases can be modified even of it breaks the linked list or they could just modify the entire database to make it so that the new link works. even in the case of bitcoin it isn't permanent. it's just probabalistically permanent. if someone were to expend enough proof of work they could rewrite the entire chain up to the last checkpoint.


this is definitely not true when it comes to what the banks are doing.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:02:00

They were also the first vpn to accept bitcoin all the way back in 2010. They are also spearheading monetarily supporting wireguard, the new vpn technology. They also don't require an email to sign up. They have always self hosted the way they accept bitcoin, not leaking your data by running it through a third party like bitpay. The number of things that mullvad does right and has done right over the last 10 years is amazing. The fact that they aren't the biggest vpn out there is shocking to me.

the rest of the post isn't interesting. he's publicly stated that he would overpay miners to mine on his pool. this isn't news. also, that isn't a sustainable model, so doing that will only cause him to lose a lot of money and go bust in the end. it isn't a problem.
if the op wants to burn a bunch of money buying hardware (making bitmain money ironically) and then burn a bunch more mining at a loss, i don't care. that's also foolish and unsustainable. bitcoin doesn't run on altruism or reckless decisions. if bitcoin can't survive roger ver, then bitcoin is a failure.
also roger can't "win", because his ultimate goal is to fork off the network. if you don't like his goal then just don't follow him off the network. stay on the unforked network and i fail to see the issue.

it creates an incentive for them to mine empty blocks and it blocks many potential avenues for protocol upgrade. i have no issue with efficiency being added to mining, they've been doing that for years, but when it creates bad incentives then it needs to be fixed.
also it says a lot about bitmain that they would produce or perpetuate a narative claiming that they are just trying to make bitcoin better when if this is true they have severe ulterior motives.

i really hate when people talk about "satoshi's vision". there are so many problems with that statement that it's absurd. first of all you have no idea what his vision was. he has plenty of quotes that you can use to promote whatever your agenda is and plenty of quotes you can use to disprove whatever agenda isn't. second of all it is incredibly naive to assume that satoshi's "vision" or perspective hasn't changed since he wrote the white paper. he had no way of knowing how bitcoin would grow or if it would even work/scale/whatever. there are so many things that he didn't predict that would absolutely change his perspective now. third of all who gives a shit what satoshi wanted or even what he wants now. bitcoin will fill whatever niche finds it useful. it will grow as it can and as it is needed and in the way that is possible. satoshi's vision is nothing more than a propaganda term that is used to force through an agenda. it doesn't matter if you use "satoshi's vision" to support uasf, bu, big blocks, small blocks, ec, high fees, low fees, tumblebit, ln, sidechains or whatever thing it is that you happen to like.

could you run a personal node where it builds the blockchain from the begining and just parses through all of the blocks solely in memory, and once its to the current year it'll start storing them? would that be for the most part as secure as a full node? will this make it so that hard drive space is no longer a bottleneck in increasing the block size?

holy buzzwords m8, you would make a great marketer. bullet proofs and ct are for all intents and purposes the same thing and are not even in the pipeline for being implemented(and more than likely will never be implemented). drivechains and the person behind drivechains have been actively ostracisized by the devs and the community due to not invented here. mimblewimble isn't something that is compatible with bitcoin and is being turned into an altcoin. sidechains without drivechains are entirely centralized and uninteresting. ln, segwit, schnorr and mast are cool though.

the first issue could be solved by forcing everyone to have arbitrary addresses. or you could do what the tor hidden services or some bitcoin vanity addresses do. make it so that it is a hash. it's arbitrary and equal opportunity, but if you want to expend a large amount of energy you can come up with facebookcorewwwi.onion. or you could expend less energy and be stuck with facebook********.onion or you could expend even less energy and have fbook********.onion.(i dunno how reddit syntax works so all that shit is just gunna be bold...) that is kinda similar to your hashcash idea, but, rather than it being proof of work to get your address it's just bruteforcing a hash.
as for the second problem isn't that just basically the fungibility problem we have in bitcoin today? couldn't that be solved by using some ridiculous obfuscation cryptography such that the miners don't know what they are serving or what they are doing? like ring signatures or confidential transactions? or even the ridiculous shit that zcash is trying to do.

well, it's different than ip addresses, because aren't ip addresses controlled by icann too? it's also different than ip addresses because if you want to expend energy you can give yourself a distinguishable  ID, but if you don't want to you don't have to. likely though, we'll continue to have a centralized committee control DNS for stuff that doesn't have a risk of being censored, and stuff that is at risk of being censored will continue to use the dark net. it seems to work fine the way it is right now, though I think it would be cool to see some torrent trackers move to tor or some darknet project.

if that happened today it would be a SERIOUS problem. they solved that by going back and reorging the chain. luckily back then it was easy to just put software out there and tell people to run it and they did. that doesn't happen today. we can't get anyone to agree on anything today. on top of that, back then there was no infrastructure that was riding on top of bitcoin. right now there is over 1000 transactions put into the blockchain every 10 minutes. back then it was people playing around with it and there was an average of less than 3 transactions per block. even if we assuming that the bug is discovered, fixed, and deployed in 24 hours which would be ASTOUNDING, you would be undoing hundreds of thousands of transactions.
another potential failure mode is that the game theory doesn't wind up being as sound, or scaling up as well as we thought. maybe people start selfish mining, maybe jihan decides to 51 percent denial of service bitcoin because he likes bitcoin cash or segwit2x. maybe jihan and his buddies decide to short bitcoin for a large sum of money because their miners are losing their efficacy, and their new design either didn't have a high yield or don't work properly so when they short they start selfish mining and reorg the whole blockchain after a couple of days or any number of 51 percent attacks. Maybe we deploy paul storzc's drivechains and the game theory doesn't line up there and the miners wind up stealing all the money on the sidechain.
maybe some rogue developer sneaks in some bugs or exploits intentionally.
maybe there's a sidechain with very high fungibility like monero or zcash and there is a bug that is discovered or planted by a dev that allows for hidden, secret inflation inside of the sidechain. using payment channels and atomic swaps you can creating infinite bitcoins inside of this high fungibility sidechain and get your money out using atomic swaps such that no one will ever know there was a problem until you settle the transaction.
Maybe the regulators come in and close down all of the exchanges. maybe them doing this removes the overwhelming majority of the liquidity from the space and makes it difficult to get in and out of bitcoin. maybe that causes the price to crash.
maybe bitcoin ossifies to such a degree that it can't even implement upgrades to the protocol that it absolutely needs to be competitive in the space and it gets replaced by something else.
these are just a couple of things that i thought up off of the top of my head. there could be any number of other problems that i haven't thought of, and there could be any number of situations that no one has considered yet. even though you analyzed it and solved it for us that doesn't mean it's a sure bet. that is far from the case. 
this is coming from a person who is a huge advocate for bitcoin. i love bitcoin and it takes up an overwhelming portion of my mental energy, but i'm not nearly naive enough to think that this is a safe or guaranteed thing.

bitcoin most certainly could go to the moon, and it is heading that direction today, but it also very easily could go to zero if for one example, a serious flaw is found in the cryptography. any number of other things happen that could cause bitcoin to fail.

if they can do something then by definition it isn't invalid. just like they can double spend and they can block all transactions from ever happening on the main chain ever again. they can do a massive reorg aswell. what matters isn't what they can and can't do, because they can destroy the value proposition of bitcoin at any time. what matters is that the incentive and the game theory is robust. obviously we can't know if the game theory works out until it is active, but there is an argument to be made that just like they have a huge disincentive to attack the main chain, this incentive will also apply to drivechains. if they steal all of the coins the value proposition of drivechains will be destroyed and it could create uncertainty in bitcoin itself. even if they do try to steal the coins there is the potential for the economic, non-mining nodes to do a user activated soft fork to prevent that from happening.


i agree, but that doesn't mean that drivechains can't work and that they aren't useful.

don't try to time the market. you WILL lose. Also don't listen to anyone here. Almost no one here knows any more than you do. Coming here and asking if bitcoin is a good investment or if now is a good time to buy is like going to church and asking them if god is read. The answer will always be yes.
Here's the deal. Bitcoin may or may not work long term. Put time and mental energy researching and coming to your own conclusions. If you come to the conclusion that bitcoin is a good investment then invest only as much as you would be okay with losing if bitcoin exploded and stopped working tomorrow. Don't make crazy impulsive buys. That is stupid. Put as much as you are comfortable with and then just leave it there. Don't try to buy low and sell high. That is just gambling. Just hold on to it.  Put it on a hardware wallet and forget about it for like 5 years.
If you are having concerns about your investment it possible that you are either overexposed or you shouldn't be making the investment in the first place.
Another thing is no one has any idea where the price is going especially in the short term. People who claim to know are both stupid and lying to you. You might as well be asking your magic 8 ball or an astrologer. Maybe bitcoin will be 5k tomorrow, maybe it will go below 4k. Maybe it will stay where it is. Nobody knows. NOBODY.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:04:30
all it does is extend the assumptions we already have. bitcoin does not work if a majority of the miners are bad actors. even without drivechains miners can freely double spend to their heart's content and censor any transactions they want. bitcoin relies on the fact that the majority of miners won't do bad things. they have a huge disincentive to attack the main chain due to the money they have invested into infrastructure. attacking bitcoin would kill their business. drivechains relies on the same assumption that bitcoin itself already depends on.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:11:41
on one side you have the people saying that bitcoin is worse than useless, it is infact destructive. being a bubble, nothing but a scam, used by terrorists etc.
on the other side you say bitcoin is the best thing the world has ever seen. it was delivered by our lord and savior, satoshi nakamoto, the infallible diety. making claims that it will lead to an anarcho-capitalist utopia. claiming it will disolve all governments, end all economic strife, will revolutionize all the things (healthcare, identity, notarization and everything else you can think of). 
my position would be that arguing with either of those types of people is generally non-productive, and that they are both wrong. that seems like a very reasonable position, but you can feel free to disagree.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:30:12
there is no such thing a real value. value is subjective. if people are willing to buy, hold, and use bitcoin, then it is valuable, no matter how much peter schiff claims it isn't.
even if we pretend that fundamental value existed(which it doesn't), bitcoin has plenty of utility. here's an incomplete list of things that bitcoin does better than anything else and is non-speculative:
capital flight, buying drugs on darknet markets, tax evasion, cryptolockering people, secure store of value, it is an on ramp into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. maybe you don't like those things, but that is the "fundamental value" that nothing else can do better than bitcoin.

how would you suggest altering the license while keeping it open source that would prevent jeff garzik from using it? (hint you can't) by the way the fact that you can't is a feature not a bug. jeff garzik absolutely should be able to later bitcoin core and start as many forks as he wants with it. imagine a world where the benevolent core developers become corrupt and starting doing bad things with the codebase. you will sure as hell hope you will be legally allowed to alter the codebase and distribute those alterations.
what restrictions would you  suggest we put in the license?
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:25:07
if you tell people how they can and cannot use the software, or how they can or cannot alter the code, then it is by definition NOT open source. open source has a strict definition. you literally have no idea what you are talking about. thank god you don't make any decisions for us.
feel free to read and understand what open source is and why it is important. imagine if linus torvalds instead of releasing linux under an open source license, used the MIT license altered by restricting all of the people he didn't like from using it. linux would be dead today. not only that it never would have even taken off in the first place.

everyone is saying that he should just call off the 2x hardfork like it would be that simple. then he would be put in the position where instead of just being hated by core extremists, he would also be hated by the extremists aswell. on top of that it would also accomplish nothing but create more uncertainty in the space. it would also do massive amounts of damage to his reputation.
it seems pretty clear to me that barry silbert wants what's best for bitcoin. he was trying to help. i also think that there's a strong case to be made that he is a very large part of why segwit activated as early as it did. people love to say that bip148 caused it to activate, and while that was also a very large contributing factor, a LOT of the core devs besides eric lombrozo and luke-jr DID NOT support bip148. greg maxwell went so far as to call it a bad idea and claiming that he was ready to sell luke-jr's altcoin as soon as it came out. sipa also thought it was a bad idea. i think that wladimir was nuetral to slightly positive on it.  it's likely that bip148 by itself wouldn't have been enough. we were stuck in a stalemate that was becoming more and more problematic as time went on. this whole segwit2x/nya brought it all to a head. 
it should also be noted that even if barry silbert were to have not gotten involved, it's likely this issue would have presented itself in some other way. this problem was compounding itself over time. if it wasn't barry today it would have been something else next week, next month, next year.

literally the only way you could have lost money holding bitcoin is in the last month, so if you lost money holding bitcoin then it HAD to be in the last month. you leaked your time frames, i didn't just get lucky. so you either lied about losing money or you bought it in the last month.


i'm here because i find bitcoin fun and entertaining primarily. if bitcoin makes me some money along the way that's great. i rode bitcoin from 1100 all the way down to 200, so clearly i'm not here to make money or i would have just left in 2014 when it started taking a shit. if bitcoin were to go to 0 tomorrow i would be okay with that. i've thoroughly enjoyed my time here whether it goes to a bajillion dollars or it explodes in magnificent fashion.
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:55:31
uh what? the only way to disallow jeff garzik from using it would be to make it no longer open source, which would be absolutely retarded. there are so many moral and practical issues with doing something like that, that they couldn't even be listed in a single reddit post.

i would also recommend not storing your bitcoin in a custodial account. if you are going to be investing a non-trivial amount i would suggest picking up a hardware wallet like a trezor or a ledger.

DONT BUY A MINER. In almost every single situation the money would be much better spent just buying bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is a highly specialized area where nearly all of them have free electricity. You cannot compete with them. You are just looking for a way to print free money. It doesn't work that way. If you want some bitcoin then buy it. Coinbase is great if you are in the states and kraken is a popular exchange for people in the eu. By the way, do not invest any money you can't afford to lose if bitcoin exploded tomorrow. Bitcoin is gambling. If you feel comfortable gambling then have fun. Also don't try to time the market. You will lose. If you do decide to buy some, just buy it and leave it be. Bitcoin goes up. Bitcoin goes down. If you can't stomach seeing it go from 5k to 4k overnight, then bitcoin is not for you.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:45:50
with this type of response you shouldn't be investing.  do not invest money that you can't afford to lose, especially in something as volatile and risky as bitcoin. if you have 100 dollars that you wouldn't miss and you are willing to gamble on bitcoin then go for it. if you don't, then don't.
maybe spend a little time and read and research and then come to your own conclusion. people telling you to invest and promising you returns are nothing more than charlatans.
if you do decide to invest in bitcoin write it off. if the price goes down, hold it. if the price goes up hold it. if you try to do something stupid like time the market you will accomplish nothing but buying at the top and selling at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:21:14




make up your mind. either you tell them to buy bitcoin or you don't. if you do, you should stop because it's irresponsible. even if we assume that bitcoin is going to go to the moon (which isn't a sure thing by a long shot), what happens if they put a non-trivial position into bitcoin and it drops by 80+ percent like it did in 2014/2015? first off they will probably be mad at you, and second of all they will probably get scared and sell somewhere near the bottom to recover their losses. even if bitcoin does go to a gajillion dollars, that doesn't mean these people that you are giving investment advice to will have the stomach to hold it through bitcoin's extreme volatility.

let's say they do invest, and the price goes down by like ~500 dollars like it has done in the past week, they may panic sell and lose money ultimately having a very poor experience.

as far as i have noticed satoshi labs does not seem concerned about their device being exploitable currently. i have a lot of respect for slush, who has been around in bitcoin for a long time. he created the first mining pool and was involved in the creation of the trezor, the first hardware wallet. i don't get the impression that he is incompetent, and i would be surprised if they were aware of an exploit, or if they knew that trezor was fundamentally compromised, because i don't think they would try to cover up that information. i also haven't seen any reason to believe that it is from the community either. i imagine if there was any public knowledge about zero day exploits, or unsolvable exploits that it would be all over the place. that said you do appear to have a specialization in the field, so it might be better for me to defer to your opinion.

the number of things you could be conflating is so high that i don't even know where to start. when you send a transaction it gets put into the mempool and then assuming you put a reasonable fee on it it will get added to a block. blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes and every block that is mined starting with the one that included your transaction is considered a confirmation.
now that's only if you are interacting with the blockchain. if you bought bitcoin on coinbase or cashapp then you aren't interfacing with the blockchain directly. they are a custodian for your funds so you don't need to worry about confirmations.

you can both have good intentions and have stupid ideas. i don't think it was obvious to him at the time that it was that bad of an idea. now that he's staked his reputation on this agreement he's put himself in a difficult situation where it is hard to back down from it. i also don't even necessarily think that it was or is bad for bitcoin. it certainly helped get segwit activated. i think that november will come and go. bitcoin will be just fine, and now we have segwit. it's much better than the retarded stalemate we've been stuck in for years. there's no telling when or if segwit would have activated without it.

this is a dangerous question, and even more dangerous are the answers you are getting here. bitcoin is free floating in the market. there is no guarantee that the price will go up. hell there's no guarantee that bitcoin will even work tomorrow. any money you put into bitcoin consider it gone. write it off. don't put any money that you cannot lose into bitcoin or you are going to have a bad time. also if you are going to speculate on bitcoin don't try to play or time the market. i promise you the market is way smarter than you are. if you try to play the market you will do nothing but buy high and sell low.

well if i tell them not to buy bitcoin the advice would have been neutral, because they wouldn't be effected by the price fluctuations of bitcoin....
telling friends and family to invest in something because it will make them rich for reelz dawg sounds like a great way to ruin a friendship and create serious problems in your life. I have been following bitcoin for years, and understand how it works, and also understand the implications of investing in it. It could be worth something someday, but it could also go to zero, which I would be fine with financially. Telling people they need to invest in bitcoin because it will make them rich is basically acting like the onecoiners.
If bitcoin is found to be usefull they will discover it and use it on their own eventually.

wow, that seems a bit uncalled for. i spend more time, effort and mental energy on bitcoin than anything else in my life. i'm active on reddit, i'm in the coin dojo, i'm in the core slack. i listen to multiple bitcoin related podcasts weekly. i watch youtube videos. i watch lectures. i read arcticles. i follow people the space. just because i don't participate on twitter you tell me to fuck myself? do you realize how absurd that is? I will look through twitter when i discover that there is something relevant to be found there. just like i told you when you mentioned they do not accept criticism i literally went and checked their twitter.
i'm aware of people on twitter. i'm aware of mrhodl, samson, whalepanda all of the twitter stars. i'm also aware of the core criticizers like emin gun sirer, seweso etc etc. i've also read a number of their relevant tweets they have made i think if you were to go back and read through your post you should really reconsider that position, because that is frankly insane. just because i'm not active on twitter and don't actively follow it doesn't mean i don't pick up most of the relevant stuff from there via other sources....

if we can't compromise over this then there will never be a compromise. this is really sad for me to see. if they aren't implementing segwit in a feasible way, maybe reach out to them and tell them how they can fix it so that it works better. it's really going to be this or there absolutely will be a chain split. maybe a chain split is what we need, but if we want to avoid it like everyone seems to want to do, we need to find a way to make this work.. let's stop being so divisive and try to work together....

 my goal isn't that i am right or that they are right or that whoever is right. my goal is for all of us to work together and make bitcoin work. all we have been doing for 2 fucking years is standing around and shouting at eachother. there is finally an agreement whereby seemingly an idea has gained a large portion of the economy's support. if people have problems with the proposal or think that it can be improved, it would be much more productive to contribute and offer solutions than it would be to stick your fingers in your ears and scream "NANANA FUCK U".

well, they get to choose what they buy. if they are concerned with a 30 percent hit, they can choose to scout for a better deal. even with a 20 percent discount it can take a couple of days to fill depending on the circumstances. i imagine if they really wanted it they could fairly easily get it at a 15 percent hit which is pretty good for a gift card. it's not like amazon credit is comparable to a liquid currency like dollars, euros or bitcoin. so them taking a hit is only reasonable. also, as to why, i'm not sure how deep this market is, but are there that many other options for them?

much better than the psp. it can emulate n64 and it also emulates ps1 better than the psp could. as for the nvidia shield... that's just a high performance android device right? it's probably pretty similar(the shield is actually probably more powerful), but the pyra has the upside of having a full-on linux desktop. it can run anything that can be compiled under linux. it also has multiple usb ports, multiple sdcard ports, a full keyboard, 6 face buttons for things like sega controls. 2 l and r shoulder buttons. i think it also has display out via hdmi, but I'm not sure about that. it's also open source and an open platform by design. you want to run android? go for it. Want to run debian, that's fine too. want to run gentoo or arch? you got it. i can't imagine you would be able to do those things on an nvidia shield.
as for the price... yea it's unfortunate, but that's the reality of what the hardware costs. when you buy a phone for 200 dollars it's being subsidised by multiple companies along the way. it's being subsidised by your carrier since you are locking in to a 2 year contract (which you pay off that subsidy over time). it's subsidised by google, because they wind up making money off of you buying stuff off of their store and viewing their ads. it's subsidised by the hardware vendor since they preload a bunch of software that they are being paid to put on there. also they have the benefit of making multiple hundreds of thousands if not millions of devices so they have a much higher economy of scale. the people making the pyra don't have any of that... all the money they make from the device is from them selling it and that alone, so that's what it has to cost.
it's going to be a niche product. yea it's expensive. yeah it's unfortunate, but there's a niche group of people that are willing to pay the additional money for an robust, open ecosystem full on computer.

economy of scale. if they were selling 100 million of them the price would be cut down dramatically. Obviously they aren't selling the pyra at cost. that would be stupid. it's been bumped up a little bit to compensate for the fact that they are going to be supporting a linux distrobution, the r&amp;d that went into designing each of the pcb's, making it modular, etc... and many other things go into the cost.

i never said people should ask for permission to run software or that they should give up the software they are running. my intent is that if it is important to avoid a chain split then working together with the entire ecosystem to come up with a solution is going to be needed. this is a solution that seems to have a lot of support throughout the ecosystem. maybe it would be in the entire ecosystem's best interest to work out the finer details such that it is satisfying to everyone(or atleast the overwhelming majority). alter the way it implements segwit such that it isn't problematic etc.
that said if we do not want to work together as an ecosystem (which maybe we don't?) then there will be 1 of 2 outcomes: either we will be stuck in a stalemate and the protocol ossifies or there will be a chainsplit. i don't think that we will be in a stalemate for much longer, and it seems very clear to me that people are not interested in coming together around any sort of proposal so a chain split is inevitable. maybe that's for the best.

you can think the bcc is stupid. you can think that it's irresponsible, you can think that it won't work, but suggesting that they intentionally try to mislead them by planting intentionally compromised code in their repo is very against the spirit of open source. imagine if debian was intentionally giving ubuntu buggy code because they were a bunch of petty cunts. that would be bad for both debian and ubuntu. it would speak very poorly on the character of core, it would be counter-productive, and it would be harmful to the ecosystem as a whole. core isn't obligated to help them or save them from making mistakes, but intentionally trying to feed them poisonous code is is a terrible idea. by the way it's pretty difficult to "leak" open source code. if it's open source they already have access to all of the code.

that has got to be the most loaded, biased, insincere question i have seen in a long time. that's a lot like asking would you rather have the warmonger, child murdering, of the pizza gate conspiracy hillary become president and personally destroy your life, or our hero donald trump whose sole concern is to make america great again.
maybe consider presenting the question better next time... and that's coming from someone who would generally be on your side of the argument.

the block size staying at 1 mb for the time being doesn't necessarily damage bitcoin. it's a risk/reward analysis and there are arguments for both sides. funny thing is 90 percent of the developers have picked one specific side over the other, and I don't think it's because they are trying to destroy the thing that they have devoted countless time, money and even put collateral into.

Who cares. This is such petty nonsense.

it's retarded to think that people will be running beta software in production. that would be like suggesting that redhat would be running unreleased git kernels or unsupported, unstable kernels in their servers. obviously they would not do that. in a production environment you avoid running unreleased, unstable code at all costs.
people running that code on mainnet may or may not be retarded. i imagine that their uptime isn't nearly as important as bitmains though. if some random person's armory node crashes they don't lose any money. if bitmain's node crashes they risk losing tens of thousands of dollars if not more.

No you are suspect because you have showed up randomly after having disappeared for 2 years and are making insincere bad faith arguments trying to sow dissent. On top of that you have a thread asking if you have been shadow banned as one of your last posts a few years ago.
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:37:27
your account history is quite suspect. other than this thread you have made 1 post in the last 2 years and the year previous to that is a thread asking if you are shaddow banned. you have made multiple comments in this thread very obviously trying to sow dissent and being insincere. if this isn't a perfect example of a bought or repurposed account i don't know what is.

i'm not endorsing bitfinex. i wouldn't touch bitfinex with a 10 foot poll. my only point in my last comment was that that guy is a VERY obvious fake account/bad faith actor.

is a cesspool of conspiracy and vitriol. if they got their hardfork they would just continue to do stuff like harrass gmaxwell, a person who has put more time and effort into the project than almost all of them combined. they would still spout conspiracy theories about different people, or groups because atleast the vocal majority there are absolutely off their rocker on the verge of paranoid delusions.

i've tried using other search engines but none of them are even half as good as google. their base search results are way better, and even though their curated search results for specific people is a privacy nightmare, it is very very good, and cannot be done without it.
i dunno which search engine you are using that you think is better, but i think you are lying to yourself, because google is likely objectively better.
@_date: 2016-07-16 08:20:39
it's not silent. they have made it clear that they are doing it, and they are doing it to cover their own asses. there is no conspiracy here... yeah, it's unfortunate, yeah it sucks, but it's the way it is. it's no secret.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:24:33
you are not helping anyone or anything with an attitude like that. people like you are part of the reason there is a hardfork in the first place. i'd be willing to bet that you offload your thinking on to your oracles just like the majority of does. with a name like yours it is obvious. are you even capable of having independent thoughts, or are you only capable of spouting petty tribalist rhetoric?

this one one of those events where taking a hit that large could mean they are operating at fractional reserve. luckily for coinbase vcs absolutely love throwing infinite money at them so this likely is not the case, but i would still remain cautious. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:39:56
you seem really desperate to lose your money, so you probably won't listen to me, but here goes anyways: don't trade altcoins. you are going to lose everything. there are people that are way smarter than you that will wind up on the winning end of these trades. if you want to hold bitcoin or even an altcoin that is fine. buy whatever coins you want to hold and then just hold them. they will either go up or they will go down.  if you try to trade you will just wind up buying at the top and selling at the bottom.
also on top of that most if not all of the altcoins are outright scams.

I started using mycelium shortly after it came out. I used it for all of my mobile tx. I was a very satisfied user. I had no intention of stopping the use of their product. As soon as they announced their ICO/crowdsale I transferred all btc that was in their wallet into copay  that very day and haven't looked back.  I wouldn't be caught dead using mycelium these days.

well if Analyst says so it must be true!
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:24:00
obviously the miners aren't going to be running beta software. do you think they are running git releases of core right now? i'm not saying they will wind up running segwit2x when it is released but your logic is retarded. these releases are for the testnet.

bitcoin will scale in layer 2. trying to scale on chain is insane, and you will do nothing but ruin it by trying to force it to scale that way. the worlds transactions literally cannot all fit on chain without having it centralize to the point where it's all in a single datacenter, at which point it is worthless. I don't see why that is a problem. You can do things like side chains and lightning network to scale. You can build infinitely on top of a decentralized system, though once it's become completely centralized all of the censorship resistance and premissionless innovation dies. You can have inhibited and seemingly poor protocols do quite powerful and robust things. Look at ipv4 for example. It's pretty bad as far as today's standards go, but once you introduce things like NAT and all of these kludgy additions it functions well enough... to the point where we cant even replace it with IPv6 which is a strict upgrade. Even if we never raise the block size again and bitcoin becomes nothing but a settlement layer it will still continue to scale and work in layer 2 just fine just like ipv4 does.
2 mb may not be dangerous, but it still can't just be forced through especially since they are already in the process of pushing out segwit which is already a nearly 2mb on average block size.
As for what both sides want.... Only 1 side is doing real science. The other side a pissing, moaning and bike shedding and not actually contributing anything. The reddit community shouldn't be designing the protocol... the developers should be. There are very few people on the side of big blocks that should be taken into consideration... Gavin, Jeff and maybe a few others everyone else is a fucking idiot.

the person who made this tweet doesn't know how bubbles work. something that is in a bubble can most certainly go up. that's what bubbles do. what someone claiming bitcoin is in a bubble is saying that it is not on a sustainable trajectory, not that it won't go up...
there have been many bitcoin bubbles in the past. when bitcoin  nearly triples in roughly 1 month with no sign of stopping, that it a pretty good sign we are on an unsustainable trajectory at least for the short to medium-short term.

yes let's base jeff garzik's current competency on a suggestion he made in 2010.  if you think his opinion and understanding of bitcoin hasn't changed since then, i don't know what to tell you. that's not to say we should stand behind what it is he is working on right now, but your logic is absolutely retarded.

god i am so fucking tired of self righteous retards speaking for satoshi. no, you don't speak for satoshi. what his vision of bitcoin was in 2008 most definitely would be different now almost a decade later. satoshi was wrong on plenty of things. satoshi is not a god, so stop treating him like one. even if he did have a vision and it was laid out perfectly, it  wouldn't necessarily make it right. people are here doing science. the information and conclusions can change over time. usenet used to be used solely as a message board and now it's used primarily for sharing binaries. sometimes what things are intended to be used for and what they wind up being used for are entirely different. people are here looking for perpetual motion. it doesn't exist. we are doing the best we can. we'll see what happens. if your ideas are good you should be able to present them without saying stupid shit like "satoshi would have wanted it this way". fucking stop it.
