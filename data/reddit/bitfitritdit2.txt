Lol.  Paypal and venmo will let me transfer for free.  I can transfer massive amounts of data by email for free.  I was able to transfer $1000 for 1 cent a year ago.  Bitcoin has only become the worst available option recently.

Huh?  Bitcoin got over 1100.  It's lower today than it was 2 years ago.  A blind monkey would have won on shorts.

This seems like a pretty good example of problems with bitcoin.  Are users really supposed to calculate price per satoshi relative to market rates?  I had no idea a decent size transaction with a 4 cent fee would sit in limbo.

Lol.  That is literally the stupidest economic argument I've ever read.  How much do you pay to use facebook or google?  You do understand that technologies and companies can have profit models not dependent on fees right?  The block reward is still gigantic.  Bitcoin could easily run on a no-fee model for another 5 years, just as it was a year ago.
Do you really want to compare bitcoin to stamps?  Have you heard of email?  How much do you pay for email?
Heck, I can transfer money via paypal for $0 fee.

Bitcoin has had exponential adoption, which means the average bitcoin buyer has probably lost money.  
Farrrrrr more people bought bitcoin above $500 then below $100.  The same was true of the tech bubble in the 90s by the way.  The stock market went up for 10 years in a row and even after the fall was in the black, but most people lost money, because mom &amp; pop mostly bought in during 1997-1999.
