No, they said they would offer both Bitcoin and B2X and would call Bitcoin "Bitcoin" and s2x "segwit 2x".
Are you really demanding they not follow any changes to Bitcoin? It was a contentious fork that was about to happen, supporting both and keeping the original name with the original was the best possible outcome, I don't know why people are still bitching about this.

It can technically work with just about anything, but there are some hoops to jump through.
LTC is chosen because it's very similar to BTC except for the hash algorithm (sha256 for BTC vs scrypt for LTC), but there have been atomic swaps between LTC and DASH already for example.

Yes, but you could easily get away with a single blockchain transaction for your entire life if you make it with a reliable node, or possibly using channel factories in the future.
Since LN is bidirectional, you can get paid in LN and pay for things in LN

That's like asking "if 9 women try really hard can they make a baby in 1 month?"
More developers isn't always the answer, and even if it were, it takes a long time for developers to become comfortable with a system.
Generally it just takes time, which is the last thing anyone wants to hear (the customer, the owner, the shareholders... everyone). But there's nothing you can do about it. Software complexity grows almost exponentially, and adding a new feature to a small wallet software is nothing compared to a realtime worldwide trading platform that handles billions of dollars a day.
You fuck up with a wallet (that has easily 100x less code) and you could lose a few people a bunch of money. You fuck up exchange code, and in seconds your company could be bankrupt and you out of a job. Any exchange that did segwit in less than a few months of work is irresponsible in my opinion, because all it takes is one small bug to literally bankrupt a company and everyone that uses it.

Unless the mempool is basically empty, there would be no incentive for a miner to ever do that.
Assuming coinbase has 10 blocks worth of transactions to consolidate, that would cost a miner $600,000 in "lost income" to mine them (using the average total income from TX fees per block for the last week).

There's a reason the DA can't drop quickly right now, it's to prevent a kind of attack that BCH was VERY vulnerable to for a while.

I completely agree, just don't try to understand everything at once. Bitcoin is complex, but not difficult. There are many small ideas that all combine to make up a very elegant and suprisingly simple system, but if you start off trying to understand the whole soup-to-nuts system you'll get overwhelmed.
I always advise that people start with understanding mining first (which requires some understanding of how hash algorithms work, but only on a basic level). Ignore how transactions work for now, just get the basics of mining down, then learn difficulty adjustment and how it works, then start looking at how transactions work and how they are made up of outputs from other transactions, then understand how they fit into a block, etc...
If you take it piece by piece, it's really simple, but you need to lay the foundations first.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:54:34
They would STILL be throwing money away, since it would be more profitable for them to accept fees from everyone else than it would be for them to consolidate dust transactions.
If you can make $60,000 in fees for finding a block (average right now), not accepting any fees to consolidate $30,000 in BTC would be pointless. You'd be better off just taking the $60,000 in fees and ignoring the $30,000 in dust.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:51:22
That's what mining fees are! They would have to pay them enough to offset the cost, which would need to be equal to what others are paying in terms of sats/byte.
There really isn't a way around it, it's like trying to convince someone to sell you $20 bills for $10.

No, you don't need to "fund" channels on the blockchain.
If I have a channel with you, and you with coinbase, I can fund my LN by buying BTC from coinbase and having it sent through you.
Even if I had 0 BTC left in LN, since I have a channel I can increase my balance instantly with a few Satoshi fees as long as I have a route to an exchange that supports LN
At the same time, a vendor could accept BTC on LN, then "sell" it for fiat by sending it to an exchange instantly without any additional blockchain transactions.
When I say the blockchain becomes for dispute resolution only, I mean it. If LN ever gets to that widespread of adoption, there will be basically 0 need to ever transact on the blockchain unless someone fails to do their job, or someone tries to steal from you.

No CPA would ever say like kind is allowed ever...
If euros to USD isn't like kind, and gold to silver isn't like kind, and selling facebook for google isn't like kind, why the hell would trading ETH and BTC be like kind?
You'd be better off just not reporting taxes at all, you'll be less of a target than willingly turning over evidence of you breaking the law.
Edit: to explain a bit more, like-kind was meant for non-fungible items. It's so you can treat 2 diamonds with roughly similar qualities as the same thing even though they are uniquely identifiable and might have different values in the future. It's not so you can trade assets other than USD and not pay taxes.

In the US phone carriers aren't legally allowed to stop porting of a number. In fact, you can do it without ever talking to your current carrier.
If I have Sprint as my carrier, and I call up AT&amp;T and tell them that I want my number ported from Sprint they will request I "verify" myself via name and address. Once they verify that, they submit a request to Sprint, and Sprint cannot legally refuse to port the number, they have to allow it by law.
Not only that, but if it costs money to port from your carrier, the carrier will just bill the name and address on the account after the fact, they aren't allowed to refuse to port the number until payment is made.
Anything tied to your phone number is laughably insecure, because all someone needs is your name and address to take it over.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:05:44
So the whole reason LN is fast is because you don't broadcast the transaction to the whole world, the information only gets sent to the person you are transaction with (possibly through a few hops, but you can ignore those for the sake of this discussion). There is nothing hitting the blockchain until you close your channel.
Therefore it doesn't need to worry about global scaling, and can scale independently per node. So even if one node can only handle 10 transactions per second (I made this number up as an example, there is no reason a single node can't handle thousands per second), there could be thousands of nodes that can all handle that same amount per second independently.
And because of the "network" part of LN, you will route around congested or underpowered nodes for the most part like your connection to Reddit servers routes around slow connections along the way.

So we should all be fine with them driving fees up for everyone, as long as they pay their own?
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:17:14
Miners would never agree to that, since they could make more money by just mining the way they normally do.
Imagine you make $1,000 a week in your paycheck. Then one day I come up to you and say "If I give you $200, would you give me your next paycheck". Would you ever agree to it?
Miners are making on average $60,000 per block, unless coinbase is going to pay them $60,000 to mine 1 block of UXTOs, then the miner will never go for it. So coinbase would need to give the miner $60,000 or more to get 1 block of UXTOs included in the blockchain. If that's the average, why not just pay that in transaction fees and get in the next block rather than doing it outside the system where the miner could backstab you?
Back to the analogy, if I'm willing to give you $1,000 for your paycheck, why wouldn't I just keep the $1,000 and not deal with you at all?

Authy uses their own proprietary format, and has a fallback to SMS. I don't want anything to do with that.
For starters, because I need to trust their app, but also because SMS fallback makes you VERY susceptible to someone calling your carrier and transferring your number to them so they get the SMS 2fa code.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:22:02
Yes, you can cheat by broadcasting a previous transaction to attempt to steal the money, but there is a way to stop that. Basically LN acts like the police. You can't stop you from doing a bad thing, but LN WILL punish you for trying it.
Example: you and me have a channel with .5 BTC in it from us each. You pay me .4 BTC today, tomorrow i pay you .8 BTC for something else. I could cheat and broadcast the first transaction to try and steal the .8 BTC I just sent you back. But here's the cool part, if you see that I do that, you can broadcast a special transaction that proves I cheated and it forces the blockchain to give YOU ALL of the money in our channel (all 1 BTC in this example).
And if you try to broadcast that transaction saying I cheated if I didn't really cheat, I can broadcast a transaction that proves I didn't cheat which gives ME ALL the money...
There is some more complexity to it, but that's the basic idea. LN transactions are still just as trustless and counterparty-risk free as normal Bitcoin transactions.
And because LN is instant, the supermarket can spend that money right away, literally the instant they get the transaction, so milliseconds from when you send it!
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:03:08
Which I'm absolutely expecting them to.
LN allows a trading engine with no counterparty risk. Someone like bittrex could start an exchange that holds no crypto and just facilitates trades.
Even someone like coinbase should be salivating at the idea of LN because it provides such a stupid amount of liquidity, and liquidity means $$$ to an exchange.
Honestly I'm not 100% sure that LN will succeed, it is such a drastic departure from how Bitcoin currently works that I'm afraid that the ecosystem will struggle to adapt. But if it does, it will absolutely revolutionize cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:45:11
Not permanently, but within a specified time frame. 
So if I setup the channel for a 1000 block locktime, you just need to check during those 1000 blocks, and if someone does try to cheat you, you have 1000 blocks after their TX is broadcast to "dispute" it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:01:17
It's all a guess, but people are saying that a significant amount of Coinbase's money is locked up in dust transactions that they can't spend without it costing them more than the value of the BTC.
So they might be in some real financial trouble, even though *technically* they have  the money.
I personally don't really believe it, because they send each transaction you send them around a lot internally, so they consolidate at points internally, but it could be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:56:46
Because you can use SSSS without increasing transaction size (multisig increases the TX size with each signature), without transferring funds, and you can recombine and resplit as many times as you want after the wallet is created.
Plus it keeps the keys simpler which means more wallets and software that can spend, especially after a decade or more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:26
So Coinbase is probably your best bet.
You can signup at  link up your bank account, and buy in at a specific price quite easily. It's all pretty simple, and to be honest they are going to do a much better job of securing your bitcoin while you learn about the ecosystem and the "dos and donts" over time. Just make sure you write down the login information to coinbase and store it in a safe place just in case something were to happen to you, so your family can easily get it if you weren't able to complete the "process" for any reason.
Then I would recommend buying 4 "hardware wallets" for your 4 grandchildren, setting them up (it's pretty easy, and there are a lot of resources online to help when you get them), and backing up the "mnemonic phrase" by writing it on paper for each of them and storing it in a separate location than the hardware wallet (your will might be a good place to write the Mnemonic phrases down). They aren't the cheapest (at around $80 to $200 a piece depending on the model you get), but they are the most secure, and best choice for long term secure storage.
Then you can store the hardware wallets in your safety deposit box, and you should be good to go!
Another cool thing about bitcoin, is that you don't need to have access to the "hardware wallet" to send money to it. So you can set everything up right now, then when the hardware wallets are in the safety deposit box, and the phrases in your will (or whererever else), THEN you can send the money to each address to be safely stored.
To answer your phrase question. Yes, the "phrase" is all you would need to recover any bitcoin in that wallet, from anywhere in the world. That's why it's extremely important that you keep it safe, and don't let anyone see it that you wouldn't feel safe giving that amount of money in cash and letting them take it home.

More roads is the answer to traffic though, not more lanes. That's a fairly well known part of traffic optimization.
And "proving" it isn't just a half a day, it would be several months, plus a hard fork, possibly affecting the block chain forever in ways that are impossible to undo.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:11
Because nothing is ever that easy.
You can't scale a site like coinbase by just "adding more servers", there's no button to hit to say "make it go faster!".
Engineering around a trading system that runs 24/7 with a stupid amount of transactions per second is really really really hard to do. You can't use tricks like eventual consistency (reddit uses this, if you comment then reload the page real quick, your comment won't show up, but if you reload again it will. Coinbase can't do that), sharding (facebook does this, you and your friends posts are stored on the same servers, while some guy in india and his friends are on a server in india, and while you 2 can talk, it will be slower than those closer to you, coinbase can't do that), and lax timing (chat applications use this, where it won't matter if 2 messages sent at ALMOST the same time can show up in a random order, coinbase can'd do that either).
They need to have all transactions be instant, NEVER make mistakes, never be out of order, never be slower for some than others, and the data that users can see must be what they can act on, not the data from a few seconds ago.
It doesn't matter if you have billions to throw at the problem, you aren't going to solve it in a week, or month, or even a few years in most cases. It takes time, testing, and careful planning to get to that point. And coinbase hasn't had the time to do that, since they are growing at such a stupidly fast rate.

It's not security by obscurity, it's proper security.
SE doesn't rely on hidden code, it relies on the principle of least privilege. It's the only part of the device that can access secrets.
It has the side effect that it means you can't write to the chip without a private key, which means you can't flash your own firmware.
It's a trade off, but it's valid engineering, and it's one of the most secure ways we have currently of managing keys. And it's the only way that isn't one vulnerability away from exposing the keys to the whole system it's on.
And the infineon chip issue was a RNG problem, but I agree that it doesn't imply perfect security, but neither does OSS ;)

It scales, but not linearly.
Using the lanes metaphor, 1 lane means you move at the speed of the slowest person on the road.
2 lanes means you move at the slowest of 2 people at the same point on the road.
3 lanes means you move at the slowest of 3 people at the same point on the road.
Ever wonder why most highways top out at 3 or 4 lanes? Because after that it doesn't help at all. A 6 lane highway will most likely have just as much traffic as a 4 lane highway, because the only thing more lanes "fix" is the problem of people driving side-by-side not allowing anyone to pass.
But adding additional roads around the main highway is the real solution. People can then avoid the highway altogether, which reduces the number of cars on the highway, which reduces traffic.
Bitcoin maps fairly cleanly to this metaphor. Adding more blocksize won't really help except in the extreme short term. What we need is a way to take transactions that don't really need the main blockchain off of it, which is exactly what Lightning Network is doing.

And a platform like coinbase isn't the same as a game or e-commerce platform. You don't run on something like AWS, you run on bare metal, in secured datacenters (because you are dealing with literally billions of dollars...).

Lol I'm not being a pedantic asshole, the difference  of computing power needed between a single round of DES (or more accurately triple-DES) and a single round of a Bitcoin address generation is several magnitudes.
Doing 90 billion DES guesses per second happens with a run if the mill GPU. Getting 90 billion ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256  per second would require hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment.
Not to mention that your search space is significantly larger than 2^60, even if you reveal half of the private key.
I'm not being pedantic, you are wrong by such a stupidly large amount that it's not even funny. You say that it's not the point that DES is simpler, but that's the whole goddamn point!

There are 2 distinct things here.
Payment channels
And lightning nodes.
A "payment channel" is what described above in the first part of their comment. These will most likely never have more than 2 parties part of a channel. I will open one with coinbase, you will open another with coinbase, etc... There will most likely never be "you me and coinbase all open a channel together".
Then the "network" part of LN kicks in, and allows us to use sets of channels between 2 people to send transactions. An oversimplified view:
let's say I have a channel open with you, and you have one open with coinbase. If I want to send money to coinbase, I can send the money to you with a script that says "if you don't send this amount of money to coinbase, I'm going to take it back", then you would send that amount of money to coinbase over your channel.
Technically no actual coins were "routed" anywhere, I paid you, and you paid coinbase. But in practice, it looks just like I handed you a dollar and you then handed that dollar to coinbase.
If you and coinbase close your channel, I don't care. Since I paid you, I don't need to do anything, our channel is still open.
If you try to backstab me and not send the money to coinbase, I broadcast the transaction that takes it back and invalidates the one I gave you.
If I try to backstab you and send the transaction that says "you didn't deliver the money to coinbase" even though you did, you can broadcast the transaction that proves it, which overrides mine!
This series of "everyone has the ability to override everyone else" is the beauty of lightning network. You can't stop someone from backstabbing you, but you can undo it when they do, and the act of "undo"ing someone actually penalizes them by taking all the money involved can away from them. A kind of "authorized theft" since they tried to backstab you.

IIRC there is no max in the protocol, but there might be a max in some clients.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:20
Well you can always just close a channel to get money on the "main" chain if you want.
And the idea is that LN will reduce pressure on the block chain and can reduce fees across the board. And after LN gets running, a blocksize increase would be needed at some point as adoption really shoots up, but it will want to be scheduled a year+ out
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:35:29
Unfortunately no, you'll need to send the money to another exchange that allows sells in your country and use that to sell for fiat.

You cannot because ledger requires firmware to be signed by their private key to prevent malware. Without that key, you can't run any code on the device.
Trezor gets around this by not having a secure element. It's a trade-off, and how the devices differ. Personally I trust the secure element method more, but if you don't then trezor might be the one for you.
Edit: it looks like your parent comment was talking about trezor, while I'm talking about the ledger. That might be where the confusion is coming from.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:19
No, payment channels can work fine without a malleability fix, however the "network" part of "lightning network" cannot.
Transaction malleability is required for it to function, and without segwit they will need to come up with their own malleability fix, which will either start looking curiously like segwit, or will require a hardfork.

Where to begin...
They are basically taking what they think is the good parts of all cryptocurrencies, and are putting it into one monstrosity.
* X11 based algorithm from DASH
* 2.5 minute blocktime from litecoin
* 4mb (closer to 8mb with segwit) blocksize from bcash
* difficulty adjustment algorithm from bcash
Plus they are promising some pretty impossible stuff in the "future":
* ZkSnarks from ZCash
* Lightning Network from Bitcoin
* Smart contracts from ETH
* Something called "offline codes" which god only knows what it means
Basically it's a shitcoin that is trying to lure people in with impossible promises and just taking what they think is the best thing from every major cryptocurrency and putting it into one disgusting abomination.
Oh, and they chose a loaded name to make sure they'd get some coverage in the "news". **This "Segwit2X" has literally nothing in common with the previous "Segwit2X" from november except for the name. Nothing else is the same**
If it quacks like a shitcoin, and looks like a shitcoin, it's probably going to be a shitcoin.

I've been saying this for a while myself.
Coinbase is adding an average of 30,000 new customers per day!
After doing the math, it looks like they will need to hire 3 new customer service reps every single day just to keep up with new tickets (and that's assuming only 1% create a single ticket, 5 minutes per ticket resolution, and the CSRs never take breaks).
And those estimates are all laughably small compared to the reality. It's probably closer to 10 new CSRs needed per day to keep up with NEW customers only!
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:46:50
That works well when the mempool is dropping, but if it starts climbing, you'll get fucked.
That's why wallets tend to "overestimate" the fees, in case activity starts to pick up, you don't want to get fucked and be stuck in the mempool for weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:39:09
That's basically what schnorr signatures are.
You can create one signature that signs multiple transactions at once, meaning consolidating a bunch of small transactions is as expensive as a single transaction.

There was speculation that it might be allowed, but I don't know a CPA out there that would have the balls to try it with any real amount of money, since it relied on a pretty "loose" reading of the law.

In reality, it was always the case, but the IRS hasn't given anyone that tried to the smackdown yet.

I'd recommend against that 2-sheet idea.
Not only is it vulnerable to destruction (if it gets wet, you are fucked), but it most likely won't age well (you'd better hope the ink doesn't rub off over time). Sadly, in most cases you are more likely to lose your keys than you are to have them stolen from you.
A much better idea is "Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme". You can put any string into SSSS (including passphrases or word lists or private keys) and you then select how many "parts" you want to create, and how many of them will be needed to recreate your seed. Then include instructions on what it is and how to "decrypt" it with each copy in case someone that needs to put them back together doesn't have the technical knowledge to do so (like a family member in my case).
So in my case I have a 3 of 5 setup. So I have 5 "parts" to my secret, and I need any 3 of them to "decrypt" it.
Doing it this way, I can put one in my will, keep one near my ledger, one at the safety deposit box, one at a family member's house, and have one with my online backups.
Since I only need any 3 of them to get it back, any 2 can be destroyed or lost without worry.

Application speed is very rarely a bottleneck. The application servers can be scaled out as many as needed, as long as the work gets done quick enough in a single request, application speed doesn't really matter. It's easy to have your application server be stateless and be able to spin up hundreds of servers to deal with spikes in traffic behind a load balancer, then shut them down when they aren't needed.
But the database is where you really hit scaling issues. That's where there is no magic bullet, and everything has a tradeoff. That's where you start seeing $300,000 salaries and architects with some really impressive credentials.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:29

You are relying on the device not lying about what firmware is on it.
I could build a device that says "I have V2.3.4" and you'd have no way of making sure that it's actually running V2.3.4

Because you need something like 1000 qbit systems to really outpace classical computers.
And that's just the break even point, at liks 2000 you finally start having quantum better than classical. It's not a threat any time soon.

Go ahead and add me as another person that you personally are pushing away from the community.
I supported bitcoin core as I felt they had the best ideas, they have the most support, they have the history, and I don't like hardforks. But if people like you are the ones that i'll have to deal with in the community in the future, I'll most likely stay out of it entirely.
I'd love to have a discussion about the pros and cons to each method calmly, but because that can't seem to happen, i'm doing my own research as best as possible and i've kind of come to the conclusion that Segwit2X seems like a good idea. It has the miner support, it would significantly increase capacity, and isn't likely to happen again as LN and other off chain scaling solutions will have solved a lot of the scaling issues. But to be honest i've only really read things in-favor of S2x simply because the "core" side of things just can't argue against it without slinging insults around and resorting to ad-hominem attacks.
I want to be told why i'm wrong, I want to know what the fear is and if there are any past examples of it happening or some arguments either way, but every time a good discussion starts, the insults come out, and I just leave.

I lobbed you the softest of soft balls and gave you a chance to make an argument, any argument, and you go back to ad-hominem.
And this isn't just "a couple angry posts", every time I ask I'm met with 2 viewpoints, one of which tends to be fairly middle-of-the-road telling me about the up and downsides and why the compromise is thought to be a good one, and the other responds like you, with insults, slurs, and attacks.
So there's no wonder why I would think that one of the 2 groups is more reasonable both in attitude and in ideas.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:18:04
I like this idea!
Let's make it even easier, people who drive a lot use a lot of gas, let's have the gas companies work with the road companies and charge for usage of the roads by charging extra for gas! No complicated tracking or anything! And to make it easy we can have all the gas companies charge the same amount and evenly distribute it to each road company based on how much that road is used!
Maybe we should get some kind of company to enforce those rules to ensure nobody cheats the system. Some kind of governmental body of sorts...

And that's the beauty of the internet, if you don't like a "1-strike" forum, you can discuss it with others in other places.
I am not like you, telling me I'm "a fucking moron" gives me literally 0 information. If you remove that from the sentence entirely, you still get exactly the same amount of info. I want to discuss, not listen to who can come up with the best insults.
I'm not trying to say all bitcoin discussion needs to be strictly technical with a 1-strike "ban you from the network" policy, just that I want a forum to exist that is that strict so people who are like me and don't like being called racial slurs because they asked a question can go.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:05:01
Perhaps you could have your government services compete based on location? Like have a section of an area controlled by one government, and another section by another. Then each can make rules and regulations based on their area and if people don't like them they can vote the government out and replace it with a new one, or maybe just move to an area that is more favorable to their views?
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:05:04
I really think I'm gonna go ahead and make a Bitcoin wallet because there are no good ones out there.
My requirements are:
* Able to spend from paper wallets without sweeping
* Able to specify a second paper wallet address as change addresses
* Able to set your own transaction fee
* Supports segwit
I'm probably not going to support real hot-wallet stuff (at least not in the foreseeable future) as that is a lot more scope than I want to tackle, but there are just no good options for this kind of spending... I've been toying with the idea of developing one myself for like 6 months now, and I think I'm finally going to start on it this weekend
Edit: clarify
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:30:58

You shouldn't be brute forcing if you have some ideas about what the password is.
Lookup Markov chains and how they can be used to do a "smart brute Force" basically using a dictionary of possible passwords that you create (basically any password or variations of passwords that you think it could possibly be, or even contain), and then tons and tons of variations on them.
Also, if you have any other Bitcoin, don't let it on the same machine that you are doing the cracking on. Hash crackers can sometimes contain malware, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

You're gonna get psychopaths yelling about how awful or great coinbase is.
All I'll say is that they are one of the few exchanges following all the rules and regulations (which alone pisses off a lot of the more "extreme" Bitcoin supporters), their support team is horribly small compared to the massive amount of growth they've seen, and they tend to take a "conservative" approach to things like forks (BCC they are taking their sweet time on, the BTC/B2X thing they are much more "middle ground" than many will like, but I personally think they are making the right choice).
Overall they are one of the biggest exchanges at the moment.

language is fundamentally messy, there is no "one true definition" of anything, especially subjective things like the term "bubble" (or are you going to tell me that you can factually say if something is pretty?)
if you think a bubble is one thing, I bet I could find a bubble that doesn't fit that definition.
the definition people like to tote around bitcoin of "a bubble is when people buy because others are buying" doesn't fit the housing crisis "bubble" of 2009, not to mention that it assumes you know why others are buying.
I'm in a shitty mood today, so let's play the "find the best definition that supports my claim" game. I pick wikipedia which says ["...bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, once a sudden drop in prices has occurred."](

If you buy on coinbase even via an ACH transfer it will purchase the coins for the cost at the time you started the transfer.
So if you buy 1BTC right now (at ~$7,000) with an ACH transfer, and it doesn't post for 5 days, on day 6 you'll have one Bitcoin in your coinbase account regardless of if it is worth $10,000 or $5,000
And the fees aren't all that bad on coinbase this way, especially when the market is so nuts right now, 2% in fees could be much less than BTC will increase in the time it takes to post 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:40:53
Off by a magnitude, or more accurately several magnitudes there...
A new S9 does 13 TH/s and would take (on average) 1 year at the current difficulty to find a block on it's own.
A GPU does about 2000 MH/s (which is 0.002 TH/s) which means it would take roughly 10,000 years for your GPU to find a block on it's own.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:01:55
Look at the numbers. They are getting something like 30,000 new users **PER DAY**.
Assuming 1% of them will send in a support ticket (300 per day), and assuming each support ticket takes 5 minutes to resolve start to finish, and assuming that the CS reps they are hiring and training are 100% efficient, they'd need to hire 3 8-hour shift reps every single day just to keep up with the new customers.
That's not a problem you can just throw money at to solve. Training thousands of new reps while actually fixing real problems is an extremely hard problem to solve. Especially when they are probably limited by the number of "core developers" they have working on their products, a problem that no amount of money can really speed up (the old saying goes that just because a woman can make a baby in 9 months, doesn't mean that 9 women can make a baby in 1 month)

Unless you can see the future, you can't know if something is a "bubble" or not until it does or doesn't pop.
Only in retrospect can you identify a bubble. So many other things in life follow different "curves", from some stocks and commodities going exponential then plateauing off, to other markets growing insanely fast then popping down to nothing, to some which grow slowly over many years only to pop down to nothing.
You can't know, there is no way to know, you can't "factually" say that something **is** in a bubble currently, you can only "factually" say something **was** in a bubble.

But the old coins aren't destroyed, just "un-reachable" by classical computers. At some point a QC will derive the private key and they will be able to gain access to those coins, unless we lock them away forever via a code change, which will cause lots of upset people from finding coins from x months ago that are now worthless.
I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it's not a quick fix and it shouldn't be ignored.
And this is way beyond a BIP, I don't have the expertise to come up with a good post-QC option for addresses and signing, and something like that you don't just do in one BIP. Plus I don't really have the time to tackle a proposal for more talking right now.
But going around saying "it's not a problem because someone else will solve it eventually" is the opposite of what you should be doing.

The idea is to use a second paper wallet as the change address.
So the flow looks like this:
* Import private key from address A which contains 1 BTC
* Send .1 BTC to someone as payment
* "Use" .001 BTC as a text fee (large for the example)
* Send .899 BTC to paper address B that was generated offline using the public key.
All in one transaction. Ideally only importing the private key at the last possible second.
As of right now no wallet allows this kind of flow easily. You either need to sweep the coins into a hot wallet, do your tx, then send the remainder to a paper address again, leaving the private key on the device for longer than it needs to be and being multiple steps. Or to import the private key, spend some, then return the rest back to the now "insecure" paper address, which is clearly less than ideal.
It's a wallet designed for only using "paper addresses" which are ever only on an electronic device at the moment of signing.

I wrote a bunch about this [here]( just recently and had a good discussion.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:45:15
But dead addresses won't update... And long-term-cold-storage addresses might not update. Reread my second-to-last paragraph where I addressed the options here.
Not to mention that this is now a new address format unlike segwit, so everything that deals with Bitcoin, from wallets to exchanges to hardware to miners will need to handle both formats.
You can be condescending all you want (I've got a CS degree too buddy, I just ended up not majoring in cryptography and instead kind of gave up going for my masters and focused on my job), but if you really knew your crypto you would understand how big of a deal this is, especially because there aren't really any well tested QC proof asymmetric encryption algos yet. (Lattice based crypto is my personal bet, but there are significant tradeoffs with it, and a lot of the implementations are copyrighted and patented for a long time).
I'm not trying to be doom and gloom here, I'm just saying that if we ignore this it will bite us, badly. If QCs show up capable of using shors algorithm before we are 100% done the move to post-QC algorithms, Bitcoin as we know it will be fucked. Anyone with a QC will be able to spend anyone's coins at any time. They will be able to sign messages as anyone, they will be able to mine new coins significantly faster than even the best ASICs (although that is about the least bad effect from them, it would just be a continuation of the efficiency gains with current ASICs and really wouldn't change much).
We will need to rewrite Bitcoin as we know it for a post-QC world, and if we don't, the result will be that a post-QC-safe coin will most likely take over as people move their wealth to the new coin as the threat of a practical quantum computer becomes more and more real (not necessarily a bad thing on its own, but it does mean that Bitcoin dies)

Well it depends on what you want to do.
Just because you can make a fortune putting all your money on black at the casino, doesn't mean it's the best business plan. If a company wants to ensure they are profitable, less "sure thing" money now is better than potentially more money in the future.
Also, running a large-scale bitcoin mining business isn't as straightforward as many seem to think. You need cheap power, cooling, a stable location, good connection, employees to maintain and manage the machines, monitoring, security, some kind-of-still-strange tax things, and more.
If a company knows how to make and sell computer chips, they will be able to make more money quicker and more  safely doing that, and even though they *might* be able to make more in the long run keeping it all in-house, that's now entering your company into a volatile new domain.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:40:28
It's always possible to choose your own route, but it will always be an advanced feature.
What's more likely is a slider or something like this:
    {cheap}-----------&lt;=&gt;----------{secure}
Secure will make more hops, and might choose to avoid large well connected nodes, cheap will make less hops, and will choose to rebalance unbalanced nodes if possible.

Ya know, except for running a handful of very successful companies, and being a literal rocket scientist.
But i'm sure you can top that! Don't be shy, let's hear what you have accomplished!
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:48:57
Yeah a version of your soft fork (its actually a hard fork, but with a long time heads up), would be the best option, but it needs lots of lead time. And you can't predict the speed of development of something like quantum computing accurately enough to know if you have 1 year or 5 years before that needs to happen.
That's my worry, Quantum Computing is going to happen, and we know now that Bitcoin is very very vulnerable to it. Let's solve it before it's a problem.
And as a side note, Sha is weakened by QC, just not "broken". So to a quantum computer you need to treat most current hashes as having half their "security", so it will lead to much faster SHA hashing in some ways, but not in a way that will harm Bitcoin (they might make some bitchin miners though!)
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:34:02
Yes but anyone that doesn't update their addresses in time will most likely have their coins stolen.
Not to mention the massive amounts of coins that were previously "lost forever" which are now up for grabs (think Satoshi's wallet). At the very best it going to be a monumentally difficult time for Bitcoin, at the worst it could be the final blow.
I love bitcoin, and I really want it to succeeded, but these things are a very real threat. We will need several years to design and implement a new signing algorithm, not to mention the amount of warning we will need to give people.
Every single address out there will need to be changed, every single one. Even segwit is child's play compared to a change like that. And to make things worse there is no "defined date" that quantum computers will become useful.
We have estimates (and even the more critical estimates believe they will happen at some point), but all it takes is one or 2 good breakthroughs and Bitcoin is caught with it's pants down.
I know you think that you can just think up an easy solution to this in 30 seconds, but the reality is that it's going to be a hell of a lot of work, and that work needs to start sooner rather than later. And in this climate where we can't even agree on small changes, what makes you think we will be able to handle moving away from ECDSA? That's WAY more critical to Bitcoin than even the PoW algorithm. ECDSA IS Bitcoin. And you can't just upgrade a private key to be a new algorithm but leave the public alone, that's not how this stuff works. Both need to be generated at the same time, they are 2 halves to the same coin, you can't change one without changing the other.
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:01:37
That's exactly how it works... Holy shit did you not even open the damn link? Like you just came in here and started shitting on the product without reading a single word on the page?
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:25:32
If you can derive the new private key from the old one, and using a quantum computer I can calculate the legacy private key from the legacy public key, then you have solved nothing at all.
With ECDSA the private key is king. If I can get that, I am the owner, full stop. With quantum computers I can get the private key from the public. So I can be the owner of any bitcoins ever, and I will continue to be the owner of those coins indefinitely in the future, as anything that you need the legacy private key for, I can just do myself.
And if you think this won't become an issue you are sadly mistaken. Quantum computers will happen. The theory is sound, it has been tested, and they are in development. We are still many years away from making useful QCs by most estimates, but they will happen. It's literally just a manufacturing and scaling problem now, as QCs don't become better than classical computers until around the 4k q-bit range, and we are right now making them at about the 32 q-bit range.
Trust me, I studied cryptography in college, there literally can't be an easy solution to this problem, because if there was it would mean ECDSA is broken already.
The same properties that make the private/public keypair system useful to Bitcoin are the ones that make an upgrade to that system impossible to do in what would be considered a "soft fork"
It would need to be a massive hard fork, basically rewriting most of the Bitcoin codebase to work with a second signing algorithm and address algorithm, and every single person would need to preemptively move their coins to a new address before QCs become powerful enough to break their keys.
The fighting on which new algorithm to pick would take years on its own, probably fracturing bitcoin into multiple groups in the process. Then there is the implementation, the testing, teaching the public how to secure their keys, making sure every single address is upgraded, then either forcibly "burning" all coins that are in all addresses via a code change at a specific block making them impossible to spend, or bracing for the inevitable flood of previously "burned" coins which will crash the price (not that big of a deal to be honest, but it will cause a lot of commotion)
My concern is that this is a pressing issue. We need to get started on a solution to this NOW if we want it to be ready in 10 years. And if estimates put QCs at 20 years out, all it takes is one big breakthrough and we are now racing manufacturing of these machines to get a code change out and everyone's coins moved before it comes online.

The idea is to use a second paper wallet as the change address.
So the flow looks like this:
* Import private key from address A which contains 1 BTC

I don't have one handy, but hop over to every now and then.
There is talk of a different difficulty algorithm, some fancy signature changes, and dynamic max blocksize adjustment stuff.

This is such a fantastic idea! Kudos on choosing a sustainable funding model!
I have one feature request, the ability to add lower and upper caps the purchase amount. So if you don't hit the lower cap, just roll that amount over to the next month until it hits that minimum (to help reduce coinbase fees), and if it hits the max just don't accumulate any more for that month.
I'm buying a house really soon so I'm liquidating some crypto right now, but after we get settled in I'll absolutely be signing up!
Edit: my bad I see you already have a max purchase cap!

And this is what drives people away from this community.
Not everything needs to be "us vs them", not everything needs to be an "embarrassing mistake" or some kind of joke.
If the bitcoin cash folks want to develop their own chain, let them. It doesn't make them wrong, it just means they want to solve some problems in a different way. Joking about how it's a "hard fork to fix a hard fork" not only misconstrues the issue, but is dismissive and aggressive.
People look at Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) and see nothing but arguing, name calling, fighting, and everyone calling everyone else "shills" and "idiots", and they leave.
If you think Bitcoin is the way to go, let it stand on it's merits. Stop attacking other coins, stop the name calling, stop the juvenile "haha we won" attitude. Learn to learn from the choices that others make. If you think they are wrong, say so, but do it in a mature manner, and don't ever write someone else off because of a decision they made.
Regardless of bcash's merit, they might have some good ideas. Stuff like dynamic max blocksize adjustment seem like they could be a good idea, especially in times of massive congestion (like the max block weight can go up to 10X for 1 block, then gets pulled back down. something similar could prevent spamming while still helping relieve congestion when there are big spikes of movement).
TL;DR: Stop with the childish bullshit
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:24:51
Lol okay how about this. That code was removed around version 0.13 or so.
So if you can link to where in the codebase it limits fees to a minimum of 1000 sat per kb I'll send you some BTC okay?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:05:20
That is absolutely not true, and I know of a handful of 0 sat/byte transactions that have gone through, one of which I helped someone craft a year or 2 ago to consolidate all their dust.
I'll have to see if I can dig up the TXID
Core has a "lowest fee accepted" field, but again it's per transaction, not per byte, and it's not "enforced". In other words a node can be configured to relay 0 sat/byte transactions, and a miner can do whatever the fuck they want.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:33:01
I agree, but the rate that value is increasing needs to go down by a LOT for that to start happening.
Why would I accept 1 mBTC for selling my widget, then turn around and spend .9 mBTC on parts to make a new widget when just holding my "starter money" for 2 months means it's doubled it's value!
As it is right now, pretty much all businesses are less profitable than simply buying and holding bitcoin. Why would I spend my time and money building a business to accept bitcoin when I can make more by just buying 1BTC? Running a business would be like burning money, unless it was making more than holding money in bitcoin would!
With an inflationary fiat currency, i'm encouraged to start a business as just holding my money means it loses it's value over time. So even if I start a business where I make 1% profit, i'm doing better than I would be if I was just holding on to my money. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:36:48
But the derivation of the address from the public key happens with RIPEMD-160 which is not post-QC safe (it's also pretty weak as a hash in general, so you shouldn't rely on it as a security feature even before thinking about practical quantum computers)
So the same problems exist, there is just one more (fairly small) step in-between seeing an address on the block chain and draining the account.

If by pushed you mean issued a blog post saying they would support both chains and would call the original Bitcoin and the new one "segwit2x" and then would monitor and open trading again after things were stable on both chains?
Then yeah, fuck them for that! I want my companies to not give me choice and to only do what they think is best!
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:28:39
I'll have to agree with and it has nothing to do with fees.
Bitcoin is deflationary, so if I spend 1mBTC today, it could be worth 2x as much in a week/month/year, so why spend it? On the other hand my $5 USD will be worth 70% of it's current value over time, so why not spend it ASAP and get the most value for it?
Lightning network is a great idea, and I'm looking forward to it, and I'll still use BTC for some things, but as a general "day-to-day" money, I'd want to use anything that isn't deflationary.

The problem is that you can't upgrade dead/long-term-cold-storage addresses.
So someone with a quantum computer capable of using shors algorithm would be able to easily get the private key from any public key.

Stuck coins will eventually drop from the mempool, so you are fine there if you don't mind waiting.
What I would do is try to craft it as one big 0 sat/byte transaction to consolidate them all to one address, then if it doesn't confirm in a week, do a child-pays-for-parent adding a bit more in TX fees, repeating that process until it doesn't make financial sense or it gets confirmed.

If you buy on coinbase you can "lock in" the price that you bought for, even if the transfer takes days.
On GDAX you need to "fund" your fiat account before you can purchase, meaning if you started now you wouldn't be able to buy for a few days at the very least.
