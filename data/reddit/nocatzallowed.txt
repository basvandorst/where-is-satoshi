That's what it says and when 40% of nodes are in usa where there's more network power than any other part of the net you want to say they don't mine 40%, say it. Then back it up with numbers showing where the most mining is done.
The article states 100% correctly over 40% of btc NODES are located in the USA and nodes do the transactions and mining. 100% FACTUAL Transactions and mining are done more inside the USA than anywhere if they're 40% of the 8K nodes in the network, now if you got other stats show them. 40% of 8K nodes in the btc grid is USA LOCATIONS

To ban Bitcoin for alcohol-related sales is like to prohibite people to have sex for prostitution-related cases.

What about if used DNA and cloning technology to re-clone an actual Byzantine General, could this cloned General solve the problem?
* of course we have to recreate his life exactly as it was based on crude records , but that would only take the construction of a series of small villages and teams of stage actors.
Would be worthwhile if we finally got an answer.

Bitcoin has the potential to take over the fiat money as we know it, but it won't happen any time soon.

Buy one of those real life Bitcoins, put it in a box and put a note behind the Coin with the login to his Blockchain account. In the Blockchain account, has the 0.1 BTC in there. Tongue Make the box look fancy.

They are insured, NOT their customers. I have made the exit strategy bold. Moreover, what would happen for an address collision is not clear.

I'm more worried about it being private than I am worried about it being safe.

Replacing Fiat is not a peace of cake. Bitcoin may become more preferred currency over fiat after few years but reaplacing fiat is not possible in even 100 years.

It's true, the media could be used by the bad guys to scare the masses out of Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin community should be aware of this and operate our own publicity campaign to counter any negative smears.
How about some Radio and TV ads.
Set up an official campaign for this and I will donate $1, I'm sure there are others who will do the same.
Let's get the public on board.

In my opinion, it's a good thing that more people are holding 
and spending Bitcoins, but the great majority merchants still 
prefer paypal payments instead of Bitcoin.

Nice channel thnx. Maybe you know where to find some more big discussions or round tables about bitcoins?

Yes! I once looked into the most profitable items and balloons were one of them. Only popcorn has a higher markup. The problem is finding a venue. A movie theater can sell you .20 cents of corn for $7.00, but that price wont work at a store. Same with balloons. If you own a zoo you can sell bags of air for $7.00. If you have to find a place to sell, you will find out that others have those venues for themselves.

Corrupt goverments are shit, but to my mind they have much less instruments for opressing or controlling bitcoins and stuff (they're just to stupid for it) than all those ANB and other jerks.

Why is that? Have they done something wrong?
