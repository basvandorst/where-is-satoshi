Don't try to argue with the BTC fanatics. Many have bet their life savings on Bitcoins. Rational arguments will fall on deaf ears.

Of course, there's no guarantee the official distribution is the open source code that's in the source repository. In that vein of thought, I don't think you should exclude open source apps by default.

You Bitcoin evangelicals never quit! Your arguments grow tiresome. Your false analogies are old. Most people who know better have quit paying attention.

And THIS is why you should be VERY CAUTIOUS about installing third-party firmwares and/or ROOTING your Android device. It makes them considerably more vulnerable. I NEVER root phones I depend on for security!
The third-party Android firmwares don't do nearly enough to warn laymen about the HUGE SECURITY RISK when rooting your Android phone. They are so eager to push their aftermarket Android builds that they don't want to discourage users. Anyone with any technical knowledge will quickly tell you that rooting any device you rely on for security is never a good idea.

In many cases, people aren't confident with their own home PC security and/or capacity to store bitcoins offline (cold storage) due to the *reasonable* fear they may lose them via a technical mistake.

Banks have FDIC insurance and generally give people's funds back in the case of fraud or theft.

LOL, simple but true. Vendors of Bitcoin mining rigs never have an incentive to sell if their rigs are really a good investment.
