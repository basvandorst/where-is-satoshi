You simply print out the private &amp; public keys for any given BTC address, and send funds to said address. Typically, these keys are printed in the form of QR codes, but text is fine also
You can simply copy n paste the keys from your favorite wallet, or use one of several secure web services that have some pretty cool layouts which allow you to fold the paper to hide your private key (DYOR before choosing one!)
I highly suggest securely deleting the document from your computer or clearing your browser cache after creating the paper wallet... depending on which method you choose from above. And keep it in something that's fire/waterproof

Make sure you're using a non-custodial BTC wallet which allows you to export/view your keys for a specific address (not a recovery phrase for multiple addresses). There are many options to choose from, such as Electrum, Exodus, Abra, MyCelium, Coinbase Wallet, etc.

Below is Craig's recent Medium post which includes  his reasoning for not proving quickly/cryptographically that he is who he says he is.
Note that he claims the only thing he will need in court to prove he's Satoshi is paperwork showing that he purchased the Bitcoin.org domain with his own personal credit card. It's comical to think that Satoshi would take the steps he has to remain anonymous, bit use a personal credit card to register Bitcoin's website.
