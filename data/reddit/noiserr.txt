Yup by burning coal to mine some random math equations so that people can speculate on a fad currency. Them polar ice caps never saw it coming.

How does a Charge back not get charged to the merchant (Doctors Without Borders in this case)? Also a high percentage of charge backs on ones account can freeze that merchant account as far as I am aware. So this could be really bad for DWB.

Placebo effect is a feeling of being cured after taking fake medicine without knowing it's fake.

The funniest part about the scammer claiming he never heard of photoshop is that he's a BTC user.
I think the percentage of folks who know enough to trade in BTC and have never heard of photoshop (a household name) is literally 0%.

Unconsented Windows updates have caused more grief to my company than any virus or backdoor yet. Great job there buddy!
I remember working with a co-worker on a major network outage and in the middle of it his computer decided to reboot and do a long windows update. He was in some Java app required for some of our network gear and I guess he didn't see the prompt.

Sorry after 20 years of working with `Enterprise Level` software and hardware, that is my opinion.

If I was going broke I would get a job. I mean I have a job not to be broke. 
Unless you're telling me that the guy who created GPG can't find a job? Which would be ridiculous.
Companies would hire him just to have his name on the roster. Linus, Guido Van Rosum all had/have real jobs, where they still get to work on their own projects.

multi sig helps but nothing is 100%. That's the first rule of security.
