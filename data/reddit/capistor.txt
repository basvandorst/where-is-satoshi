If there were no cap, can't the miners introduce self enforced limits to the blocks that they mine?  Some miners were publishing .75 mb blocks when the limit was 1 mb.  So if there were no limit, miners would self enforce their own arbitrary limit.  If most miners had artificially low limits, then others would find that increasing their own blocksize limit would generate more profit.
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:41:18

There is effectively zero friction with bitcoin already.  All of that friction is from working with the old system.  Over time this ecosystem will replace what there is now, picking up momentum as it absorbs niches.  
In the not too distant future, remittances will be from a laptop in one country to a dumb phone in another country, and from that phone to their landlord's phone.  No friction!  It's just that bitcoin is a quasi currency at the moment.  A few years from now the landscape will be completely different.

From the United Heritage CU website: 
"Effective October 19, 2013, United Heritage Credit Union will no longer provide wire transfer services (remittances) to locations outside the United States.
United Heritage Credit Union’s decision to discontinue outgoing international wire services is resultant from a new consumer protection regulation. United Heritage Credit Union will be able to service your international wire transfer needs until October 19, 2013 and we recommend that you use this time to research alternative means to send funds to foreign locations."

Is that a symptom or a cause?  Certainly building a significant capital base is not practical with widespread disease and malnutrition, but when other parts of the world already have enormous wealth and infrastructure it seems that perhaps the lack of *access* to these resources is now what prevents the elimination of malnutrition and disease.  
Many third world countries remain that way because the bureaucracy, regulations, and corruption prevents foreign direct investment.  If entrepreneurs in these countries are suddenly on a level playing field with access to credit and issuing stock globally, even for simple business models such as repairing cell phones, there could be a significant economic boom.  
If one of these 'black market' investments or loans created an extra dollar a day of income, what would that mean?    Food to eat tonight.

This is an excellent infomercial for bitcoin, from peter schiff himself. Notice that his conversation is changing. Earlier bitcoin's highly divisible nature was a problem, now that is a key feature, like gold.
I suspect that he will talk himself into realizing that mining is the aspect that Gave initial value to bitcoin for the reason that if you want the bitcoin that I mined, I must require a form of value to recoup the expense, and that exchange of value for an expense is assigning value to that prior expense. This is much like the boulder money on that island community.
