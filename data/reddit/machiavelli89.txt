Who needs fox or mainstream media? Typically months/year behind the news. Here’s a few predictions (order tbd) 
Kav gets confirmed &gt; Fisa declassification via IG Michael Horowitz &gt; rosenstein resigns &gt; mueller investigation over &gt; public announcement of officials involved in fisa abuse under investigation &gt;  hello sessions, hello John Huber 
We’ll check again before December end. 
Hopefully most checked off before mid terms though.

I love people who try to reconcile their view that Trump is “dumb” while at the same time he destroyed two political dynasties, overcame MSM 95% negative media coverage, his opponent having more money, full Wall Street support, full mainstream media support and top DOJ/FBI/CIA officials interfering in election and post election (silent coup) by weaponizing fisa courts/surveillance against him on behalf of his opponent. She also got debate and town hall questions ahead of time. He STILL won. 
Then there’s the elimination of isis, record stock market, tax cuts, record low unemployment and a magic wand for not 3% but above 4% gdp in less than two years. 
Tell me again how he’s sooooo dumb. If he’s so dumb, how dumb must his opponents be following 2+ years of constant losing while watching him succeed.

So emotional. So much hatred. I am starting to think you didn’t take the last election so well. I am also starting to think you won’t be able to psychologically handle the upcoming consequences following fisa declassification.  Going to be a long 6 years. 
For Trump being so stupid and doing such a bad job, Obama sure does love to take credit for all the things he’s apparently not doing well. 
Kav confirmed &gt; fisa declass &gt; bye Rod Rosenstein &gt; bye Mueller investigation &gt; hello John Huber
