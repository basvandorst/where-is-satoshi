Hope he got an honorable lawyer who won't screw him out of some of his btc donations.

Excuse my ignorance:
Can anyone tell me why Vault of Satoshi is constantly around $20 above other exchanges?

Thank you for the thorough explanation.

I'm here mainly because of the *Doge factor*. A month ago, it introduced me to the world of cryptocurrencies and have lurked ever since, hope some day I can buy some bitcoin too. It is truly fascinating.

Very generous, thank you!

If true, they're having the opposite effect on me, I guess they're doing it wrong. 
New here btw.

you're taking into account the initial spike all altcoins go through plus the giant btc crash. Doge/USD has been in the upper $.3 to mid $.4 per K for a very long time, stable. I don't understand the doge hate, doge is in a way giving huge exposure to btc. Doge is nourishing a whole new generation of bitcoiners, it is inevitable. Doge will be here for a very long time.

Thanks. At first glance it appears the Genesis1 is the more feature rich of the lot.

I subscribed to their beta program, I couldn't find a join or signup button anywhere on the website. I don't think they're open to the general public yet.

How do ATMs work? can you withdraw cash? do you type or scan your wallet address? fees? what exchange is the price based on?

Yeah having a guest in your house start criticizing it and going on about how his is better without any solid ground is not helping doge's cause around here. In a perfect world there would be a required crash course on cryptocurrency and its risks for every new recruit and it would be as transparent as possible. 
Dogecoin introduced me to the light hearted side of cryptocurrencies and I found out some of the darker sides all on my own. There is no competition between both currencies, IMO none will ever surpass bitcoin and in this case both can peacefully coexist and benefit from eachother.

Inexperience but mostly lack of spare cash at the moment.

That's why I wanted to use them. They at least show their faces and found out about them by a post submitted by one of their team members about meeting with mexican bankers. They certainly seem far more trustworthy than I expected.

I didn't mean it like that. He seems frail and apparently he's in a tough financial situation but now that he's got a little, he might be attracting the wrong kind of people.
