It is a good thing the police aren’t running around murdering a group of people that fit a certain profile. Oh, wait.

A loan is not income. You have an obligation to pay it back. No income taxes due.
If it was a 100k gift, you would owe no income tax on it, because it still isn’t income. The gift giver would have to pay tax on it.
If you win 100k, you owe tax on it. 
When people get tons of shit on the oprah show, it isn’t a gift, it is a prize.

I used this joke about a week ago on reddit and somebody made a snide commit about stealing jokes.
I choose to applaud your proper use of a good joke, bravo.

TVM (time value of money) 
1.8 m today is more than most people will make in their lives.  Since they could invest that 1.8m in bitcoin and it would be worth a lot more in 50 years, right?

I am with you in that the US is *better* than china. That is a low bar. Any assault on property rights by the government (especially civil forfeiture) should be met with fierce resistance. The horror stories from civil forfeiture are disturbing; conducted and condoned by the US govt.

Have you ever heard of civil forfeiture?

I always get a kick out of putting astronauts on pedestals. Someone a few weeks ago was talking about how smart they were, multiple phds. I pointed out that isn’t the case. 
Astronauts then were mostly test pilots, more balls than brains. I am not taking away from their accomplishments, everyone has a role. But those old astronauts weren’t put in space because they were some rare genius, they were the best at what they did, but that isn’t designing planes and rockets.
The brains of space missions aren’t on the rocket, they are the rocket.
