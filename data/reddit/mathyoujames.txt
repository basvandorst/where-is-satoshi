As an impartial party I can in fact confirm the other guy is right and you used divulge incorrectly.
It's a synonym of reveal or tell. You can't divulge into something, you divulge something.

This is what I don't understand. Belief in blockchain tech is not a reason to buy into bitcoin. The vast majority of people who buy into it are just trying to make money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:43:58
Except you can liquidate it? Not sure you're talking about btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:45
But how useless is it as a store of value?
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:08:25
I don't see how that makes any difference 
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:16:54
Is there any explanation for Bitcoin perfectly following the expected graph for a fad investment?
We had a huge spike and the peaks have been getting lower and lower. It's pretty hard to disagree with someone who says this is exactly what everyone said would happen.
@_date: 2018-09-15 00:15:43
Christ it'd be amazing if it could just remain stable. I actually like the idea of holding a bit of Bitcoin as a separate 'safe' place to keep some value
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:28:08
Except I've explained in other comments that you've got to be crazy to think that. It's currently a depreciating asset. Why would anyone buy it in 2018.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:53:24
All of that is amazing but it's losing value. Any Bitcoin bought between now and last December has dropped in value so what's the point of it being so secure? If it had a steady value I'd completely agree with you but why on Earth would anyone be interested in a store of value that actually depreciates.
I'm sure people will say 'oh but it's up X from 20XX' but the fact of the matter is it will only continue to go up if new people buy and why would anyone in 2018 buy Bitcoin as anything other than a massive gamble?
 
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:35:51
I mean there has literally never been a point where it looks more like  a passed fad though? If you zoom out it actually looks worse :(
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:06:40
Exactly. I'm saying it's not any different. Except people in this sub seem to act like it IS different and isn't just a big gamble.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:27:24
This is what I'm talking about. I've genuinely not heard any actual logical arguments for bitcoins recovery...
The argument that it looks like a fad investment holds up because it looks exactly like a fad investment. Apparently 'no it isnt' is enough for people...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:15
Not very hard. You can either do it quickly with some fees or do a longer process for less fees
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:17:22
This is what I mean about mindless arguments that make no sense. Essentially Bitcoin is in a good place if you bought pre October 2017 but in an awful state for anyone who has bought after that. Not just that but it's actively getting worse for new buyers.
How is that in anyway a healthy environment to grow Bitcoin? Imagine trying to convince someone to buy into this now, you're essentially asking them gamble rather than invest.
Hence my concern about Bitcoin and my surprise at the hostility to genuine questions.

Looking at the price of Bitcoin and then going on this sub makes me feel like I'm living in two different worlds.
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:51:50
I would love to hear someone explain why this sort of long term volatility is anything but extremely damaging to the future prospects of bitcoin.
For example I think a lot more people now know about bitcoin but don't hold any. That is a bad thing as reputation is what movements like this live and die on.
The post December crash when Bitcoin was at the height of it's popularity and subsequent insane volatility is surely doing absolutely no good for it's reputation and thus ability to bring in further adopters.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:52:12
That's a bingo
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:34:24
I was literally just about to post this.
This picture if anything is an argument that Bitcoin WON'T catch on as true game changing technologies have taken over their markets or grown exceptionally quickly.
@_date: 2019-02-02 10:41:50
Will probably get downvoted to fuck but the truth is the technology is much better now but also bitcoinhas a very permanent negative mainstream reputation because of the high profile collapse last year.
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:31:59
The sooner you realise this sub is like the_donald of investments the better
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:27:10
It's nice to return to this comment a bit later and be reminded not all of our friends across the pond are mental
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:27:18
I am not American and from the outside you look like a crazy person
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:07:34
How is that clear? Anyone with even a semblance of sanity can see Trump is a deeply unpleasant person. I've known that since watching American apprentice on Netflix years ago. But yeah keep on sucking his dick if it makes you feel like you understand the world better!
Also a tactical genius who bankrupted two casinos? Or did the deep state do that too?
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:51:26
As I said before I'm not American so why would I be watching Colbert or give a fuck what Madonna says? I think Trump is a fool because I disagree with his platform and goals and I also believe him to be a deeply immoral person which influences said goals.
All that being said this whole conversation is pointless as you clearly wank yourself silly to pictures of him and nothing I say could stop your opportunity to wax lyrical about him.
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:57:19
Why is it that everyone who criticises Trump is automatically some Oprah loving liberal? Most people don't like him globally because he's a fucking moron with a rabid fanbase who somehow thing being a crass, rude, uneducated fool is something to be praised.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:32:41
I would very much question your priorities if you believe he's improved your country but each to their own
