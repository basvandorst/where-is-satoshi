using the standard "on_user_has_entered_password" hook that all proper OSes come with. xD

rewards for mining are tied to the difficulty factor, which is tied to the number of coins mined; as more coins are mined (eg. faster than ever by botnet), the incentive for mining decreases, and so does the perceived value of a single BTC. relikk thinks it'll take 90-120 days for the botnets to perform sufficient mining to increase the difficulty to the next level, where the reward is cut in half again.

...which is nothing special, unless the user is IDIOTIC enough to run regularly as admin/root, in which case, they are ASKING to get fucked. ;)

great idea, and nice implementation (from what i saw of it so far). :)

Okay, four years, got it. :)

yes, fine, blocks won't be solved "faster", but payouts will be halved, so it amounts to the same thing. and i agree that it's unlikely botnets will surprise the system, as they are going to be limited to CPU mining and maybe GPU mining, which will be minor contributions once ASICs are widespread.

such clear and sensible thinking does not belong on reddit, or for that mattter, the internet. you should be ashamed of yourself. ;p
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:33:17
downvote for saying thanks? reddit, you are so fucking confused. :p

sounds like it still depends primarily on social engineering (eg. getting an idiot to run your unsolicited attachment at high privilege). i'm not saying there aren't tons of idiots out there, but they ARE getting slightly smarter every day. well, happy cracking, i guess. :)

bitcoin isn't comparable to banking. banking is more or less a system that allows money from strangers to be pooled to provide loans to other strangers to fund ventures that intend to make a profit, with the idea that part of the profit will cover the interest on the loan. bitcoin doesn't obviate this technique, it just offers a different way to exchange value.
