When central banks are printing money to buy stocks to artificially hold up asset prices, you can imagine this will push asset prices up.

Yeah, I posted about Venezuela once a few months back. Zero.
It is tough to get on without it being a meme

For whatever reason, the Yahoo finance price for BTCUSD locks to this price all the time.

Btw - run a different window manager. After I switched my memory did not run out.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:24:45
Here is one. We need lots of nodes to keep the system trusted. Otherwise a larger player can effectively control the network.
If a large miner knows that 25% of the network will reject their block, they probably won't take the risk.
This is a very low cost way to keep a very powerful group in check.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:19:57
Yes - switch to xubuntu. Why? I found the default window manager in ubuntu to consume a lot of memory. This would cause the box to run out of memory and fail within days.
Also - if you can, you will want to rate limit your connection once you are synced up.
I should write this up somewhere.
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:02:32
I run a node, and I agree with your sentiment. People have proposed solutions over the last few years. I have not looked at them in detail. 
Yet, at this time there isn't a solution. That tells me that the proposals are not viable. The problem must be pretty hard.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:47:06
Roughly the same numbers for my node as well.
To limit my bandwidth, I was in a hurry and went a little ghetto. I have my node on an old 10 mbit half duplex HUB. I rarely get spikes over 7mbit.
@_date: 2016-06-10 01:15:58
Looks like somebody got it to the top page after me. Happy for that.

Hi - what are people using as a heat sink on a Pi 3? Without good heat dissipation, the CPU will throttle a lot.
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:50:28
blah blah blah
let me show you charts of cpu frequencies
let me show you how we now need to use helium filled hard drives to get further improvements...
if bandwidth is so ubiquitous, why is most of the world not at 1gbit. By your chart, everybody should have it.
this is not so simple.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:51:55
Nice one Oleg ��
@_date: 2015-07-31 23:21:37
I just posted my proposal.

Thanks - I will read... but about to head to Pike's Pub.

Read the captions on the photos. Genius.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:08:18
I run a node! I agree.

Uh - where can you live in NYC for $120k a year?
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:06:13
My problems were memory leaks. I would advise this. Run the node on a quiet machine that you can stick in a corner. I don't know if Kubuntu will be good, but I have had zero issues with Xubuntu. Let me know if you need any help.

I'm going to assume it is linux and of the right version.
Go download the client then follow the instructions here:
Read this section:
Skip the bitcoin-qt part and just run the 'daemon' since you do not have X-windows/GUI.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:55:24
I didn't do anything special except leave my node up.
Did your node fully sync? How long did you keep it online?
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:28:27
Ah - it is an older HP Microserver. See my other comment below about Xubuntu.
I throttle the network bandwidth by putting it on an old school Linksys 10 mbit HUB. That pretty much guarantees it will not be over 7 mbit.
It has 4 slots for SATA drives, but I'm just running on the built-in 250GB for now. I will add SSD in a year.
It is not bound by CPU when acting as a node. I'm not doing any mining, etc. The CPU is an old dual-core Athlon.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:50:58
It benefits me to know that I'm contributing to a network that I think is one of the most interesting and promising technologies of a lifetime.
It benefits the world of bitcoin by being another node in the network that follows the rules.
If an attacker or miner wanted to push transactions that broke the rules of bitcoin, they could push it to the machines or nodes that they control. However, the transaction would not be allowed by any of the nodes that follow the rules (the vast majority). 
If a wallet or client on an iPhone or Android phone connects to the network, it might connect to my node (and many do). They would not see the bad transactions.
These hurdles become so large for a 'bad entity' that it is effectively pointless to attempt subverting the network.
Also, the other reasons that Jambozx said.
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:35:02
what kind of CPU does it have?
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:02:55
See my answer to user lunchables below.

For many reasons (security is most important), I prefer to run Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:08:23
Whoa - even better point. I will seriously consider this in my next upgrade.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:24:54
Awesome - thanks for your contribution!
When I first ran a node a while back, I ran straight ubuntu. I learned that the window system had a memory leak. So the box would run out of memory after 2-3 weeks. I would upgrade and update, but I would end up with the same result.
With Xubuntu, I don't have the memory leak issue. So, I just let the system run.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:56:59
I actually did that a few times, however, I like the network chart and the GUI. I have had zero issues with Xubuntu so I was able to get the node with almost no effort. Also, I just have that box running in the corner. It is not my main machine.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:04:59
Storage and network will go up by approximately 2 times. This will probably not impact my system. Most clients are not downloading the full blockchain. I may need to add a new disk in the future. That will not be a problem since I was going to do that anyways.
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:40:03
That might work. Just check the firewall to see if the UPNP worked. Or you can test it from some other server on the internet.
I just did it manually.
Thanks for running a node!
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:33:28
Hi - Great work.
I don't think wondershaper is a bad idea. maxuploadtarget is fine too, but they are definitely different.
I do not believe that either slows down the network. Its like saying adding slow bittorrent nodes slows down the whole torrent network. 
The key is that the client can have multiple connections and schedule traffic amongst all of them.
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:33:23
Hi - it hardly needs any at all. 1-2 ghz x86 should be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:09:20
Ok, what OS are they running and how much memory and disk/ssd?
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:03:36
Yeah, I would leave it up for a week, and leave that debug window open with the network graph.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:39:37
I don't understand what you mean "MB blocks"?
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:54:08
Hi, valid question.
The port only goes to that machine. That machine only has the 'Bitcoin Core' app for that port.
Given all the eyes looking at Bitcoin Core (aka good peer review), they haven't had any issues.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:39:00
I usually have over 100 peers at any given moment.
@_date: 2013-10-18 05:37:34
That is fine, it is just a matter of BTC then.
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:03:56
I would recommend not submitting if you haven't already.
Probably too late.
Lots of people suggest using a linux. I second that.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:26:10
There is a good chunk of work there. The reason for this is that the systems on the back end would require a bunch of integration work. Their are probably thousands of records recorded per minute (if not more)
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:26:58
Take an old pc, install Xubuntu, download bitcoin core, open the port in the firewall. Help the world :-)
Happy to answer any questions about running a node.

In related news, maybe the US should hold onto DPR's money. They may need to disperse it later vs. going back into the market and having to buy it.

give it time. That 12k will grow faster than anything else
(I hope :0)
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:10:33
Ok - that cpu is more than enough for the problem.
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:35:42
If true, then Respect!
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:29:19
I agree. They will not be around in the long run with this kind of business model. This is an "I hope we get acquired before the problem gets too big" strategy.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:50:25
what do you mean by 'site'?
