[P2Pool]( Done.

Most bitcoin exchanges I've seen pay above the minimum transaction fee to avoid situations like this. Once floating fees are implemented, applications using the RPC should be able to use them instead.

I'd like to see my carrier, Republic Wireless accept bitcoins. They're trying to present the brand of a highly progressive and low-cost carrier, and Bitcoins would fit with that.
[Here's the discussion thread on their forums about it]( with a quote:

True, but you can always bid above the base transaction fee to increase the priority of your transaction, so if someone spammed, everyone else would simply have to pay a slightly higher transaction fee if they wanted things to go through.

There doesn't need to be a change in the Bitcoin protocol. P2Pool is the solution. Individual miners don't have any incentive to help anyone else 51% attack the network: that would drive down the price.
No individual currently holds close to 51%, and as the network grows, this will be a less and less likely situation, just as no individual or corporation holds more than 51% of the world's wealth.
If miners use P2Pool, they're protecting *themselves* against a 51% attack which could damage *their own* wealth. The only disincentive at this point is that P2Pool requires more infrastructure and effort for each individual to run.

For anyone who doesn't know:
Apparently companies get a discount if they use the security code. The added advantage is that the merchants aren't allowed to store the code, so if a database leak occurs, it'll at least be a bit harder to charge the cards.
Unfortunately there's plenty of incompetent merchants that make if optional (like in HTL2001's situation), which pretty much nullifies the issue.
I find Amazon's approach interesting. When you add a card or change a shipping address, you have to re-enter the code, so they can reduce fraud. However, for convenience, they simply pay the extra fee when you've used the card before, so the user doesn't have to enter the code every time.

I don't know who MeowMeNot uses (I'm interested though!), but I have a node [with Crissic]( That ends up running $13/yr. I've been running it without problems for a couple months, and [I verified with them that running bitcoind is fine, as long as you somehow constrain the load]( (really only an issue during the initial sync), which [my provisioning script supports](
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:08:28
Well, since bitcoin is a trustless technology, it should ideally be able to handle *any* sort of abuse. The argument here is that the underlying incentive model doesn't do enough to prohibit this kind of blockchain abuse.

Assuming you're running it on localhost or on your LAN, there's no chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, so SSL/TLS is pointless.

The [default UXTO cache (`-dbcache`) is actually 100 MB]( You can safely decrease it, at the cost of increased disk IO. I was successfully running a full bitcoind node with 256 mb of RAM until a few months ago, using [honeybadger]( and a tweaked configuration, but the IO load was horrid, syncing took weeks, and monit had to respawn bitcoind often.
Seeing as the UXTO database isn't entirely in ram, I guess the real question is how well the cache scales. How much of the database is stale? How is the active portion scaling?

While you should theoretically be able to run bitcoind on FreeNAS, it's a FreeBSD derivative, so any Linux-based guide likely won't work correctly for you, and you'll probably have a hard time finding a guide for FreeBSD.
The easier option is likely to rent a cheap VPS somewhere with Ubuntu and use the PPA, or if you have a good way to set up VMs locally on your own hardware, do the same there.

Strange. The code must be taking the remote execution path instead of the localhost execution path. Can I see your generated `hosts` file?
**Edit**: I just realized that the documentation isn't very clear: When prompted, did you pick "*One or more remote servers (ssh, recommended)*" or "*This machine (localhost)*"? If you picked the former instead of the later, it would explain this error.
If this is the case, run `rm hosts host_vars group_vars`, and then re-run the autosetup script.
Regardless, I'll make this more clear in the docs and autoconfig script.

[Issue opened](
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:14:29
Well, the it's open-source, which helps, and the more people who use it, hopefully the more eyeballs on the project. I've also set up [a mailing list]( so I can inform people of critical security vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. I'm open to other ideas of improving this.
Arguably, we all depend on the core bitcoin developers, and if they wanted to sybil attack the network, they could probably figure out a way too.

I'm interested to see the results of that project. I'm not using qt -- this assumes a headless server. The closest things to a UI are some curses interfaces (like tor-arm) and nginx.
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:50:06
Heh, I meant the `hosts` file in `~/ansible-honeybadger`, sorry.
I'll add: if you have a github account, you can use  which may work better for troubleshooting than a reddit thread.

I'm currently using Ubuntu because that's the [only distro it's easy to install bitcoind on]( Honeybadger could install from source, but that would make auto-updating more complicated and prone to breakage. This pretty much rules out the first-generation Pis, but not the v2.
On top of this, I don't see much benefit in using Raspberry Pis, because home internet connections tend to be expensive/slow, compared to data centers, and there's all sorts of additional configuration issues with home routers and port forwarding.
If one were to target the pi, I think a better approach would be to provide an image one could flash onto the pi, rather than the ansible/ssh approach I'm using.

Thanks for trying it out! I don't use Windows, so it makes it hard for me to test the instructions. Can you try running `apt-get install python-dev` and tell me if that solves your problem? If so, I'll add that to the bootstrap script and the system-wide dependency check.
**Edit**: [Patched]( Just re-run the instructions, and the issue should be solved.

They computed the profits/losses as if you were running the rig for only a week. Nobody buys all that hardware to use it for a week, and you'd likely sell it on ebay once you were done.

Most cloud hosting services are about the same. EC2 and GCE both provision in about a minute or less (depending on server load).

Transaction fees could go up, as there would be more competition for valuable blockchain space.
The problem with increasing the block size is that running a bitcoin node will be more difficult if we allow the blockchain to grow too large, resulting in more centralization.

It's a perfect strategy... assuming you have infinite money.

You could use Coinbase or a paper wallet to store most of your wealth, and then use Electrum to store your "hot" wallet for purchases.
