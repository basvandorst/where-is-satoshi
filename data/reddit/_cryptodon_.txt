Just watched that movie again a few days ago. Still holds up even today. Very under rated movie.
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:36:36
I have seen some stupid shit posted here but this really tops them all.
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:24:59
Well that's just silly
@_date: 2019-03-26 07:47:39
Except it's actually not at all.

@_date: 2019-11-28 15:30:16
It doesn't need the rest
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:45:30
Try get a mortgage from a credit union, despite what many say in this sub about banks, without them we are all fucked.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:25:45
This is terrible advice. When the price goes up you should take profit.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:23:20
Charts are still bearish though. That will only change when the price opens and closes above 9500 on the daily.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:05:20
Would still need a bank
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:04:20
They exist but I highly doubt CSW has the keys to access them or will get the keys in 2020 as he claims.
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:34:35


Insane fees and rates

Irish here, confident the brits will fuck it up too and take us down with yous
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:02:29
And if you don't pay? Do I and 20 other million people get the house?
As great as it sounds to have a world without banks it is just not possible. Home loans, business loans, education loans. That's not even going into the problem of somebody losing their entire life savings and net worth due to losing private keys or a shitty wallet bug. You are your own bank is not a good idea
@_date: 2019-08-21 08:10:09
How are you gonna get a mortgage?
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:14:51
Nobody cares. Just another shitpost on this ever-declining in quality sub reddit
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:33:54
It never was
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:23:23
You are right, after thinking about it more P2P is not really a good description. And I was thinking that was the only point OP got correct.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:41:06
To do what with?
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:39:26
It's a single point of failure. Someone, somewhere with enough money and enough power will find an incentive.
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:39:24
wow - shitpost level 1000
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:08:11
muh muh store of value, not meant to be spent or some shit like that. I just trade it for dollars, at least I can spend those
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:44:55
Are you 12?
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:19:51


A miner or miners with enough hash power can destroy bitcoin and the nodes can do fuck all
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:35:18


This is how you know more downside is coming
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:26:16
wait until its 100k then to buy 1 BTC if that's your thinking
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:23:56
1) No, it doesn't. Pretty hard to onboard without a bank account unless you earn bitcoin through selling goods or services. It's mostly used for speculation so that kinda rules that out.
2) Yes it's P2P
3) Not as decentralized as you think. Pretty centralized among a few large mining companies.
4) Unless you fork
5) Bitcoin is not anonymous at all
6) Not if you invested anywhere above 10k in 2017
7) Gold is a solid store of value and has proven as such over a long period of time. Bitcoin is very new and has not proven itself to be as good as gold yet.
@_date: 2019-12-09 13:58:14
Nobody will help you if you use bitcoin. The amount of money lost because people don't back up keys, get scammed, or just send the wrong amount in bitcoin would be insane if the average joe was using it daily. Believe it or not, the world is not ready for a "be in control of your own money" situation.
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:29:03
Good one
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:17:28


Explain to me how you would get a mortgage or finance the purchase of a home without the banks?
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:35:08
Ok, let us imagine the world you want where bitcoin is the currency. Bitcoin is not evenly spread out, a very small amount of people own most of the available bitcoin. So if you want a loan who will you be getting that loan from? Some fucking whale who wants interest on his loan and we end up back in the same system we have.
One the next point, a drop in demand for materials and therefore a drop in price is not a good thing. That puts the suppliers of those materials out of business, which puts people out of jobs.
A new business usually takes a few years to become profitable. Most of the largest companies in the world are still not profitable. Twitter turned a profit for the first time in 2018.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:10:36
Whats at the end flag? Never see anyone say sell in here, just that stupid HODL meme.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:45:26
From who?
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:32:58
This 100% - Everyone likes to pretend they are in it for the tech or whatever other bullshit reason they come up. At least say it like it is and admit we are all here for the money.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:58:37


And you get to decide that why?
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:08:38
It's very rarely an option, that's my point. Bitcoin adoption and the ability to actually use it, even online, where it should be dominant is minuscule.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:18:56
And the builders who need a loan from the bank to build the homes? And the business that needs bank loans to get started or stay afloat to pay peoples wages. The grand idea of bitcoin is nice to think about but if it became a reality then the world is in deep deep shit.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:00:14
Did you then make the purchase with bitcoin when paypal was offline?
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:14:02
Well at the moment it is neither, it is not used as money in any real scale and is a terrible store of value. This sub is gone to shit, every single post is a price meme. There is very little talk of adoption or anything worth any value to the eco-system. The few posts that are half good get lost very quickly by the next 10K price meme or when moon.
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:28:19
\&gt; you're better off convincing them to own BTC due to it being a better store of value than convincing them to use it as a secondary payment system as it's hard using BTC for mundane purchases because it's now evident that, the trajectory of this nascent assets' price is upwards.
You assume the price is upwards, you have no way of knowing that. For anyone who purchased bitcoin after January 2018 it has been one of the worst stores of value available
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:30:06
I am not saying that people should not buy back in. Just simply saying there are smart places to both buy and sell. The HODL mentality says nothing about selling. There were clear signals to sell in the 2008 market crash and clear signals to buy back in. Just holding onto an asset because you know, it will go back up someday is not good.
*I will add that maybe getting investment advice from Reddit is not a good idea anyway. There are plenty of books people should read and do what works best for you. I do what works best for me and it works very well. But please base your decisions off something more than a meme on the internet.*
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:45:14
Yea when you see less posts about price and more about the actual eco-system then it is time to start looking for buy entries
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:19:29
Will get downvoted heavily for this but HODL is the worst possible investment advice ever. People who blindly follow this stupid meme deserve to lose money.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:20:54
Hows that store of value working out?
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:27:59


Is it money or a store of value?
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:51:21
Started setting one up myself, about 60% of the way through the blockchain download
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:32:54


Well that's the problem right there, don't try sell the top, just sell in profit. There is also this just HODL meme that people cling to. Don't hold, sell you idiots
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:37:59
Eh no, sell at a higher price than you bought it for
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:48:19
It's science 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:48:03


That type of money is of no use to a government 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:05:56


What about something that went for 20k to 5k? Not trying to have argument, just saying a good store of value it is not. It very well might be in the future but right now its a gamble
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:44:53
That doesn't prove it is a good store of value, you can pretty much pick any tech stock from 2008/2009 and see the huge difference in what they were worth then compared to what they are worth now.
A store of value is not something that appreciates in value by a huge amount, a store of value is something that holds it's value well. Saying that something that was once worth 5 cent and is now worth 5k is only valid if you bought at 5 cent.
Bitcoin is not a good store of value. It doesn't hold value, it is pretty much a gamble at this stage. Not to say it won't be in the future but it needs far less volatility to be considered a good store of value.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:29:42
Well lets say this world exists in the near future, money can not be printed, we are all using bitcoin instead. Now I want to buy a house, but there are no banks left because everyone holds their bitcoins on a wallet. How do I get a mortgage to purchase my new home? Or how does the guy down the street get a small business loan to create jobs. As much as a world without banks sounds like a good idea, it is not a world you want to be in.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:03:58
For anyone interested, here is that indicator - [
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:49:20
There are lots of tools out there to help with making decisions on when to buy and sell. Just blindly buying in the hope it goes back up is not good advice. Based on what I use for long term investing signals the sell was at around 13k and there has been no buy signal since.
Obviously with shorter term trades it is different but for long term there has been no reason to buy again after January 22nd
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:47:05


So which is it, store of value of serious global money??
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:32:07


You got downvoted for this but it is something people in this sub fail to realise. All that shit we use every single day without a thought about it doesn't pay for itself. Good luck using the roads when tax isnt collected anymore to pay highway maintenance.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:59:32
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:08:18
The fuck are you talking about. This entire post is about bitcoin is better money. There is a big picture and all, nobody said anything about gold.
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:13:58
Come on man, I would love to see bitcoin succeed like everyone else here but if you think it is better money in its current state like this post suggests then you are delusional. I can not go to my grocery store and use bitcoin, I can't use the lightning network to pay my bills. I can not use bitcoin to pay the mortgage on my house. 
As an asset class bitcoin has great potential. As money, in its current form, not so much.
@_date: 2019-09-04 09:17:44
What do you think he bought the car with?
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:45:09


Exactly my point.
I had the same TenX card and have a Coinbase card at the moment. It's not ideal.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:18:27






I simply said as money it is garbage. May improve in the future, but right now, unlike the OP's post claims, it is not the best form of money.
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:49:06


Not talking about American Tax Collection
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:29:06


It is not false. I can not use bitcoin in any of my local supermarkets or use it to pay for any of my household bills.


Like what? Lightning? See my other point, nowhere accepts it. At least not in my country.
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:39:19
Fair enough. That was pretty bad English on my part
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:39:55
Bitcoin is shit as money. Can't spend it anywhere, fees are high and confirmation times take too long. Great as a speculation asset but as money it is garbage.
Instead of downvoting me, counter my argument. Tell me why bitcoin is better money??
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:05:49
eh, it's up like 300% since the start of the year
@_date: 2019-09-04 09:51:41
Paypal, Visa and debit cards are not money. They are a means of exchanging money. Sorry, but 58 cents for a transaction is pretty high when it comes to everyday purchases.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:44:22


Whats the point in that?
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:35:32


Maybe and maybe not, you have no way of knowing that with certainty.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:50:47
Wow a post that isn't about the price. Brilliant
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:35:51
So when will you sell?
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:46:47
Just don't forget to sell when you are in profit. Ignore the HODL bullshit this sub spews out over and over again
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:08:14
Relax, you will be able to buy that amount again for very money pretty soon
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:05:54
Because even though a lot of people won't admit it, the main reason we are all here is to make money.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:14:07


But it's not easy to use. Takes awhile for people who are completely new to get used to it.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:24:33
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:28:03
Wrong but nice try. By the way, I was complementing your post.
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:20:31
But why?
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:17:55
Develop it
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:48:12
You don't need to understand it. The adoption only starts when developers make is super easy to use it as a payment system. Otherwise it continues to just be another speculative asset
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:35:07
The people who should have sold months ago but didn't because everyone told them to HODL
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:10:12


You think you do but you don't. Pretty sure your bank will have quarterly fees etc.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:23:25
Tell that to the guys who bought above 18k
