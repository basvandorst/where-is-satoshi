Lol, so much confusion in one post. segwit does not account for 1% of usage, you're just spreading fake news and misinformation around. I believe you might be in the wrong subreddit, I think you're looking for @_date: 2018-01-13 00:25:10

Price price price.... Is that all we care about? I though Bitcoin was a technology, an open source one. Do you guys realize how many problems does Bitcoin have, and the fact that it depends exclusively on us, the community, to fix them?
What are we doing to fix them? What are we doing to stop the ever increasing fees? Apparently price discussion will solve this, right?
Who gives a fuck about the current price? Bitcoin will always be volatile, at least for the years to come, are you x$ down on your investment? Don't give fucks and you'll see how everything works out, because it turns out you're not investing on a magic coin that changes it's price whenever it feels like... No no... You invested your hard earned money into a technology that is, as of today, is changing the world. You are just looking at the small picture, because you put your money into something without actually knowing what it was, but hey, they say ignorance is bliss, and it sure might be.
People of you have two options. You can panic sell and save us the trouble of having to constantly debate prices with you, that way in a few years when crypto rules the fucking world there will be like discovery channel specials to teach you how badly you messed up when you sold at 13k because "Bitcoin crashed" knowing that a few months ago one Bitcoin was 5k. OR... You could start making some research, and start FUCKING HELPING, either coding, spreading awareness, talking to your local community, opening spaces for Bitcoin and other cryptos, because you guys HAVE to understand... Bitcoin is fucking freedom to chose what to do with your own money, this is what we are fighting for, not the right to be rich in 2 months...

Binance is just an exchange, decision made by exchanges are centralized and don't affect Bitcoin itself, just the relationship between Bitcoin and said exchange. To vote you must run a full node and update accordingly depending on what you want for the system.
Let's say tomorrow part of Bitcoin's community decide to implement segwit2x, you could accept the fork (voting yes) by simply updating your node to work with this new set of rules, or vote no by simply not updating your node and keeping up the previous rules.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:58:59
You gotta do a bit more research. LN is a second layer network in the Bitcoin protocol, in plain English that means that LN is sitting on top of the Bitcoin network/protocol. There is no LN without Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:13:39
Yeah but I still see a lot of misinformation in the comments. Just trying to make things clear. As I said, nothing against OP, it's the comments that make me sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:34:57
Because Bitcoin core wallet was left kind of a side project once Bitcoin core realized there was other companies doing great software for their wallets, they simply decided to focus more on the really tough problems, like creating segwit, LN and a whole lot of little and big things that make the Bitcoin we know today. 
Then again... Bitcoin is open source, to shame them you must shame the world... If someone wants segwit implemented so bad in the GUI, why don't they just open a Pull Request? Or by now, help in the PR for that that has been opened for months..
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:35:18
There is a system for voting.
Developers do get a lot of incentives, it's just harder to push update due to its descentralized nature (more than 50% consensus needed). This is done on purpose, as immutability is one of the main features of bitcoin. Even though all of us here in reddit are screaming for Lightning, it is important to never rush it. There's a lot of people investing in Bitcoin, institutions looking into it, it is extremely important to protect the robustness of Bitcoin, because then again, is money we're talking about. Think about how quickly were internet payment available using credit cards, but how long it took for people to mass adopt it. People tend to be very conservative in terms of finance, specially in microeconomic subjects, a place where Bitcoin is slowly but surely disrupting everything in place before.
The fact that Bitcoin can't be changed at will, the fact that there's no central authority, a central point of code output, it's all in place on purpose. Bitcoin has to be this way, because that's its greatest strength. When a big investors finally moves his or her money to Bitcoin, one of the main things they'll probably think is that they feel safe there's no bribable or manipulable actor in the Bitcoin system. Bitcoin is populism free, it's bribe free, it is influence free... Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck if the world needs more or less socialism, more or less liberalism, it's just there to do it's job. 
Let's never change that... Please :)

I know I will, but rushing a bad solution is not the answer. That's why I trust in the LN, not as a company, because it isn't, but as a technology... Just like Bitcoin itself.

Maybe I went to far with toaster skeptics, but the blockchain technology is indeed here to stay. Many like to make that differentiation because they think Bitcoin will eventual crash. However, I believe they fail to undertand that Bitcoin is simply the best organized effort in the history of human kind to create a descentralized "revolution". I use quotes because it sounds cheesey, but it is... Bitcoin will never die because that way of doing things is also here to stay. Maybe Bitcoin will eventually change its name for whatever reasons, but Bitcoin itself will never die. Bitcoin is the technology, but it is also a completely new way to see things, and to change the world...
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:48:24
I don't think LN will under deliver. I mean if you believe LN will cure cancer and end world wide corruption the sure, it'll under deliver. But if you want fast payments and instant settlements, then no, LN will not under deliver.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:30:42
I know Bitcoin will be faster, more reliable and more efficient than anything we have in place now. With Bitcoin we trust a lot more on math than on conventional security. An archaic security infrastructure that means centralization, higher cost, and lost of freedom.
We are talking about money here, the reward of your work, your life, your doings. Don't you believe it is important that we make sure we have absolute control of that?
Sure Bitcoin is speculative, how couldn't it be, we are just speculating on how big Bitcoin's impact will be in our lives, but don't ever forget we are speculating on something we know it's gonna happen, because of all the previous things I said.. I know it, a lot of people with money knows it, and I believe you should to...

I think Bitcoin is a technology not a get rich scheme. Just like electricity or the internet, Bitcoin is a technology that is changing dramatically the way we function as human beings, how we transfer value between us. Volatility is induced by those who just want to get rich, panic sells are orchestrated by whales who know exactly what kind of people recently entered the market: uninformed, anxious and inexperienced "traders" who WILL sell their coins for a loss, basically handing money over to those willing to be patient. 
This is the story of Bitcoin since the beginning and with the crazy amount of people rushing to the market is only gonna get worse.
However, when Bitcoin reaches mass adoption and acceptance by the majority of the world, volatitly will be a thing of the past. Why would the world accept Bitcoin you might ask, well because it is simply better, cheaper and more efficient than what we have now.
Remember, there were sceptics of the internet, electricity, even fucking toasters, there will always be resistance to innovation, it is simply our self preservation instinct kicking in. That doesn't change the fact that innovation always win.

@_date: 2018-01-17 21:35:33
I disagree, I believe you should investigate more on what Bitcoin truly is, and what it will be able to do. But then again, it is your opinion and I respect it. 
I don't believe there will only be bitcoin. Bitcoin itself needs other crypto currencies in the ecosystem because Bitcoin can't simply do it all.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:29:14
The before mentioned companies all got together the last couple of years and decided what will be the main specifications, API architecture, and a bunch of other stuff before actually starting to develop their own products. That way they made sure there will be cross compatibility across all implementations of the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:33:27
Guys guys... I'm so sad you guys are excited by this... I really hope this was good news but they aren't. I'm a Venezuelan, I ran away from my country a year ago... This is the facts:
I ran away (just like many others) because there's no food, medicine, or security whatsoever.
There's no rule of law, only the powerful and connected can do, and when they do, it is whatever the fuck they want. Again, there's no rule of law whatsoever. Policeman are thugs, thugs sometime act as police.
There no freedom of speech, each and every TV channel and radio station has been taken by the goverment. There's been even multiple cases of people taken to prison for tweeting against the goverment. 
YOU CANT MINE IN YOUT OWN (or at least as long as they can catch you). The goverment IS NOT mining because they believe in Bitcoin, they do it because they have stolen thousands of machines from venezuelans and now they use them to fund their narco regime. I'm ABSOLUTELY confident they don't do it for ideological reasons ( they are communist, that means anti liberal), they just do it becausw the rest of the world is blocking their finances because EVERYONE knows it's all about drugs and death. No, I'm not exaggerating. Venezuela IS the most dangerous country in the world, with the highest murder rate, the highest level of child famine, the highest level of insecurity... The highest level of inflation in the entire world... 
No guys, the Venezuelan goverment is not trusting Bitcoin, venezuelans are not Bitcoiners by nature. Most of us see Bitcoin as the greatest tool to save our money from inflation and to help ourr family left behind, but don't cherish the goverment.
This Antminers are all stolen or bought with drug money. The Bitcoin produced is not controlled by the national assembly or anything, there's no control whatsoever. 
I know it's hard to believe a country can be so fucked up, but it is the truth
I am Venezuelan, born in Caracas, and I lived most of my life under the communist dictatorship.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:04:47
Segwit accounts to around 10% of transaction for the mere reason that coinbase and a few other exchanges, that account for the largest use in the Bitcoin network won't go for it. That doesn't mean most nodes have already activated segwit, and that it is available since it was first pushed to the main net.
It is a well known fact that with segwit tx fees will be minimal and there will be no mem pool. But hey, segwit still in the 10% of usage, but as of today, mempool is basically empty and tx fees are super low, it's only getting better now. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:49:16
I don't agree my friend. You see I am from Venezuela, a populist and communist dictatorship, I know what populism look like, I know how populism work.
Sure, most of the community is extremely excited about LN, and some people might even consider it the universal fix. I don't agree with them either, instead I see LN as the next logical step. 
Will there still be problems after LN implementation? Sure, Bitcoin is an ever evolving technology, just like the human race, we will still need to evolve and change depending on whatever new problems we encountered along the way, but LN is the living proof shit can be done this way, solutions can be found and implemented in a descentralized way. Companies, personalities, and common people, we can all work together for a common goal if the system and rules are in place.
That's why I believe Bitcoin will always be there, it could be overthrown as the main crypto with time, but I don't think it's ever gonna leave.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:01:35
I'm sorry, and no disrespect intended, but crytpo uses go far beyond dark markets. We are literally on a post about a crypto transaction for big wheat deal. Then again, you can either keep telling that to yourself and eventually shift in the future, or you could keep on loosing your hard earned money by storing it in Fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:41:20
 Not sure if it's a complete list, but there are some examples. And yes, the distinction matters, a token's rule is everything, it's pretty much what differentiates them from other and constitutes the main features of said token. Limited supply vs unlimited supply, anonymous vs public, etc etc.

Venezuelan here. Petro is not a crypto currency, it's just a new tool for my goverment to steal and hide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Petro dollars. 
Petro will not be a public mineable blockchain. It'll be like ripple but ran by people with an IQ of a banana and with a strong and vicious hate for law and order :)..
My country is absolutely obliterated by corruption and negligence. There's no regular supply of food, l medicine or whatever, no matter how rich or poor you are.
Venezuela is a failed state that still exist as a political project because the rest of the world is just way to busy making money to think of anyone else.

Well that sucks...

Just passing by to remind all people to CHILL THE FUCK OUT. We had a mayor correction and now you want it back to 20k in 3 seconds.
Do not forget Bitcoin fluctuates, it's not straight up all the time, as a matter of fact it is never straight up (except for last rally which was insane) so HODL your fucking horses.
Let the whales and the market do whatever they fuck they need, and next time, when the next bull rally kicks in, be mindful of your gains, secure your profit, make your own strategy for the next rebound so you can stop asking people for financial advice in fucking reddit.

No one is in charge. Miners decide what will their fees be. The more competitive they get, the higher the probability of more people coming to Bitcoin and therefore using the network, which in turn is more money to miners, as they have more work to do.

Surely, that's where lightning network comes in. This is the piece of technology we will be using for daily transactions. And from what I've heard, we could be using it in 2018 in the main net.
The thing I hope people understood is that the current way of doing things in Bitcoin is simply overloaded by the usage and the recent spike in popularity. The good thing is that our code guys have been working for a good time developing segwit (low TX fees) and lightning network (instant payments, technically 0 fees). Working together, we hope to make bitcoin a lot faster, reliable and cheap.

API or application interface allow apps to share information between each other. 
I can recommend using Coinmanager. Available for Android and iOS, not related to the company in any way, I just really like their app. 
Whenever you issue an API key, make sure you're only allowing to READ information, disabling withdrawals or any kind of transaction, you will set this up whenever you're issuing your API key. 
In bittrex, for example, you need to enable 2FA to use API keys. When you create one, you will get a Public API key and a Secret Key. Any tracking app will ask for both when you're setting up, make sure to put them somewhere safe after setting them up in your app.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:50:02
Don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm sure a lot of people will gladly help you answer all the questions in the world, but you will only truly grasp those concepts once you've done your own research and therefore drawn your own conclusions.
Bitcoin is a decentralized mean/platform/protocol to transfer value (money, in very very simple terms).
Ethereum, on the other hand, can be used for the same purpose, but its true intent is to be a platform for decentralized applications or dApps so people can host and communicate with apps and services in a decentralized manner. Therefore, Ethereum is not truly intended for buying you a cup of coffee in your local coffee shop (Bitcoin is), but to allow a smart contract (dApp) to transact with people or other smart contracts.
Ripple is a centralized cryptocurrency which tries to solve the problem of transacting huge amounts of money between banks and financial institutions. The catch being that crypto transactions are way faster, traceable and secure. Ethereum and Bitcoin are decentralized, public blockchains, while XRP is a private and centralized blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:05:38
Yeah moving the funds through eth or ltc could have proven a lot faster, specially in a hurry. For small amounts of money I tend to use LTC as it confirm transactions considerably faster.

1- CME and Ameritrade just opened Bitcoin future markets. Cboe last week. More people and institutional money coming in.
2- Positive regulations coming from Japan and South Korea

I'm from Venezuela. There is no general adoption whatsoever in Venezuela. There's a small sector of honest and educated middle class citizen who are protecting their savings with btc, for inflation is massive in our country. There is MASSIVE volume coming from the military headquarters and the government infrastructure as btc is being used for money laundering and the hiding of massive amounts of capital from corruption. In short terms, there is a lot of volume coming from Venezuela, but not the kind of volume that is helpful for btc, it's just making a bad image of Bitcoin as a alternative. Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:34:30
You certainly make a point sir. But I think your vision is shortsighted (precise though). Maybe Bitcoin is not the Holy Grail that will solve humanity's problems, and it surely have flaws. But I believe you're accepting Fiat currency as the best and only feasible solution, or at least not supporting and alternative solution.
To be honest, that's quite disheartening, as you surely write like a smart guy would. 
Having said so, I support Bitcoin because it's humanity's best effort to solve those problems we accepted as necessary to run our debt based economies. 
So yeah, you're getting the upvotes and I'll probably end up with the downvotes. But I'm standing in bitcoin for YOU. For your family and the people that will come after us. Maybe, in 5 years the best approach won't be bitcoin but whatever the fuck coin. As long as we are trying to make the world a just place, I'm all in, and yes, against those who oppose us (I know you don't necessarily oppose us)
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:17:00
Most you say is true. But there's a catch. It's really futile to debate over and over the same thing in this subreddit. I trust Bitcoin capability to adapt and to give everyone what we all are desperately seeking: transparency, freedom and swiftness. 
Is the Bitcoin Network overloaded and virtually useless for business applications in this current state?.. yes... But, has it the potential and the technology to solve one of the most important and underlying problems of our human society?... Yes.
Now I'm presented with 2 options. I could either accept our debt based economy and live a miserable life, or put my money, mouth and soul to the one thing that is trying to solve what everyone just though as a necessary evil.
That's how I see it.

Just laughing at all the fud spreaders and moonbois panic selling. Go ahead guys... Allow me to remind you the price of btc last month.. actually look it up by yourself. I'm just too lazy sitting on a 3x investment (pretty low for bitcoin's history) in the most important currency in the world.
I would also like to remind you that the point of Bitcoin is to give common people like us the power to use our money (our hard work, time, studies) however the fuck we want without unnecessary, unfair and often illogical boundaries and restrictions. If you think of Bitcoin as a get rich scheme and simply panic sells everytime there's a correction, you're just giving all that power to whales and people that in the future will use that control against YOU. 
Bitcoin is a gift of mankind's ability to solve complicated problems and overcome our own biological and mental limitations. You're just giving it away due to greed and fear. It's funny how so many people post how they suddenly got rich when they realized they had btc stored and simply forgot, without greed and fear, saved by their ignorance (in a good way in this case).
Go ahead guys... Panic sell. Hopefully hodlers like us will protect you in the future. Sounds corny, but never forget Bitcoin is liberty. Yes... Liberty.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:34:04
The problem is that people keep thinking that Bitcoin is all there is to know about blockchain or even worse, some people forget that Bitcoin has all the features (and possibilities of new features) that any other blockchain technology.
What if I told you Bitcoin is not just for paying, but to build a trustless descentralized system that can keep track of virtually anything that we need. Without a centralized overseer, high maintaince cost (in a centralized perspective, as costs are distributed between all participants) and much much more.
Blockchain is about using our massive global network to keep track of the TRUTH, truth in a pragmatic not philosophical way. Does person A received his payment? Does package X arrived its destination? Had pacient Y any history of X disease? Etc etc. All of this things could be available to EVERYONE, fast, cheap and securely, if blockchain technology is implemented for most things.
But yeah.. Bitcoin is useless..

There's no such thing as taxes in a country with the highest inflation in the world, ramping corruption in each and every institution and the highest murder rate in the world (top 3 at least)
Venezuela is anarchy, and no, I'm not exaggerating. There's a black market for EVERYTHING, even diapers and coffee, so you can imagine there's one for Bitcoin, with normal people acting as exchanges, buying and selling btc whener they need to. Localbitcoins is huge in Venezuela, and peer to peer transactions in general are widely used.
However this is not the case for the majority of the population. most Venezuelans are very very poor, with little or no access to an internet connection. The real Venezuelan Bitcoin users are either the agonizing middle class or the corrupt machinery of the military and the central government.

Surely. It's absolutely feasible when incentives are well placed in a descentralized framework.
If technology X allows us to solve problem Y and 50+% of the network has problem Y. Then technology X is rolled out.
Maybe there's 2 technologies that try to solve problem Y. Then the best gets rolled out. The best being the one that solves the underlying implications of problem Y.

Because they understand their power, and if they are early adopters in the pre Bitcoin era, they will leverage their power. 
When people (most of the population) finally understand what Bitcoin is, they will surely love it and ask their governments emphatically to use them. they want to be ready for that. And since btc has a limited supply, it is of vital importance for them to get on the boat early, as they could be overthrown in the future by a single person with a pocket full of btc.
It's no joke when people say "the 21 million club". Whoever belongs to the club will have a lot of economical power in the future.

Don't g to me wrong, there is technically taxes to be paid but you can pretty much not pay them without any consequences. Only if you're a registered business or someone with a good amount of wealth, you wouldn't want to be the target of the government as they love to strip people of their money.

Most certainly, I believe the correction that started yesterday is certainly that, they need to create gaps so they can buy as much as they can. However, they can't afford to crash it to deeply as the lost of trust in their clients will be to damaging. Also check Andreas speech that was posted yesterday in this subreddit. He clearly explains how CME will work, and how many people like him is making sure the CME is as smooth and healthy as possible for the btc environment.
However, do not understimate the power of hodlers, specially the ideological kind (like me). I'm pretty sure wall street dudes know about us as well. As long as people believe in Bitcoin, Bitcoin will remain in our hands and only be used as instruments by the government's and institutions.

Everyday I go on and repeat the same. I see a lot of new friends in the subreddit, and 90% of times most people is worried if this is a good time to buy.
Let me try to make this even more clear. RIGHT NOW is always the best time to buy btc. It's always gonna be "too expensive" (unless your hunting those dips).
What I am trying to say is that even if it goes down just after you buy, it will surely go up again and even further.
A few weeks ago (or so) I bought around 10k USD in bitcoin just after it went pass the 7k price tag. Bought at 7k and by the time I was leaving my office it was around 7700k. I thought to myself I did the perfect trade. By the time I got home, I read about Segwit2x cancelation and the market quickly fell, putting the price at around 5k. So in just a few minutes I had lost around 3-4k USD. A few days went through before the price recovered.
Did I panicked and sold? No. Do I still hold those Bitcoins? Damn right. Hopefully my story is useful for some of y'all :).

Yet Bitcoin in its current state is not built for day to day payments, it used to work because Bitcoin usage was extremely low compared to recent times. Lightning Network is being built for that, given the current circumstances.
Look, just like you there's a lot of people that is a sceptic about bitcoin, and it's understandable and healthy. But just think that people felt the same way about the internet a decades ago. In theory internet allow us to share data, and that's about it, with time we've managed to find thousand of cool and profitable applications of the internet, and that's the internet we know today.
 With Bitcoin and crytpocurrencies in general is the same story. Right now we only have a theory, features and a vague idea of how the world could be if bitcoin is massively implemented in our economy. 
The only thing I DO know is that Bitcoin (and crytpocurrencies in general) is simply way to good to simply be a passing hype. The world is changing with this crypto revolution, you could either be a part of it, or stay away, it's not stopping for any of us.

I'm a politologist so I guess I studied to answer this question.
Going into socialism vs capitalism would be a long and difficult endeavour, as arguments are simply unlimited for both sides. The ultimate conclusion being that it depends a lot more of how it is applied in practice, than how good it sounds in theory.
Regarding the last question, I can safely say Venezuela is indeed a state capitalism. I, as many Venezuelans, tend to willfully misuse the term because the goverment self describe themselves as socialist and communist. Inevitably we have grown to hate communist and socialist, and surely, most actions and policies taken by the goverment follow a strict socialist way of looking at things, naming things and doing things.  However, it would be false to say that Venezuela is a socialist or worse, a communist country, as there's absolutely no descentralization of power, there's a political incentive rather than a economical incentive in the government's doing. There's no heavy investment in social services like health and housing... And I could keep on forever.
I'm amused by your interest in Venezuela and it's awesome to know that is people trying to figure our mess out. Short story, Venezuela is certainly state capitalism, as the figure of state and goverment have been simply merged, and the acting goverment simply acts whenever it feels like, wherever it feels like and with how much money and manpower it needs like (even making up laws deliberately whenever it is needed), like a big fat billionaire of wallstreet with unlimited political power would. It's funny how extremely different ideas, sometimes look so similar :)

Million dollar question. People all over the community are actively pressuring coinbase to adopt segwit.

No need to worry, since you're not using segwit it'll take a while. Using segwit I've been able to transfer amounts of btc in as little as 10min. Remember there's A LOT of people getting into the Bitcoin network now. A lot more people that we were used to, our network will need time (and most importantly good code) to adapt to this increase in usage. Your transaction will always reach your destination. 
BTC NEVER gets lost transacting, the only way you could end up loosing btc in a transaction is if you send it to the wrong address. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:52:31
Venezuelans tend to be hodlers as the main reason is to save their earnings from inflation. Whenever one feels like it, selling incredibly small amounts of btc is good enough for a while as minimum wage is less than 3$/mo.
Selling 100$ of btc can last you a month or more, so you can imagine how a Venezuelan feels when he/she makes 10$ any given month and then thanks to volatility he/she gets an extra 2$-3$.  Whereas if he/she decided to leave the salary in the national currency, would mean a 100% devaluation on average a month. Compared to a 40% bitcoin "crash" of a single day, it's an extremely good business..
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:41:40
Great iniciative, although there's a lot of people abusing the system and just positing stupid stuff and jokes. It'll be awesome if we could build something that could localize the btc lost pointing to the wallet were they were locked out of the rest world.

I care for the new people getting into this new world. I would panic if I just bought Bitcoin in all time highs and then seeing a bunch of FUD spreaders all around  the subreddit. People need to understand what are corrections and why they're are good for us. Specially, people must understand why one is so much better positioned in life if you hold Bitcoin instead of USD. 
It's this simple, the btc you own, when it's gone, it's gone. But the USD you own, when it's gone, the government just print more. I guess it's pretty clear why you should care.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:28:48
This is they way I think of it. if it tanks to 7k, that is losing 2 times it's current value (some sort of catastrophe or some government crackdown) ill be left with that I started. Sure, it's probable but how probable? Not much, as all the news and ideas revolving around Bitcoin are quite positive, specially this days with all the cboe and CME operations, lightning, segwit, and freaking Andreas kicking ass wherever he goes. We are part of a strong, intelligent and massive community. We just can't go down that easily. Now what if nothing terrible happens, what if Bitcoin continues to fluctuate as it always does, but with it's solid upward trend. What if we slowly reach 100k? Well, it wasn't that big of a risk, wasn't it?

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:22:39
I disagree. High transactions costs is a problem. Being worked by iniciatives like segwit and the lightning network. However at it's current state Bitcoin has tons of business applications as it it still incredibly cheap, fast and trustworthy for moving large amounts of money. 
Still, the Bitcoin ecosystem, products, smart contracts are all part of the business incentives that Bitcoin makes available to people. If on top of that we have a solid and stable price, more and more people will put more Fiat into Bitcoin. Moving their business to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:40:05
If for some reason you still have the private key of that address you could get them back. Another solution would be regenerating the private key using the seed. Your wallet's seed is a set of words given to you when you created your wallet for the first time. 
Not sure if all wallets give you the seed option. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:57:37
IMO, sure it is. It's a great idea and has a lot of great developers behind it. I am currently working on my own dApp running on the eth blockchain. Doing the same using rootstock (bitcoin smart contracts), there's just a lot of stuff going on, and it feels great.

A confirmation simply means that a block has been published with your transaction listed as a previous transaction from a previous block. Remember that blocks are interconnected, hence the name blockchain. At 6 confirmations a transaction is supposed to be irrevocable as it will require a lot of computational power to recalculate the 6 blocks that precede it.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:16:13
Use an exchange, I would personally recommend bitfinex, kraken, uphold or shapeshift (bitfinex has segwit support up and running, kraken nor uphold have it yet. Not sure about shapeshift) which will ensure you low TX fees and swiftness. There you can trade your btc for eth. Afterwards the safest thing to do is to move your eth to a cold storage or at least myetherwallet. (It's the official site for creating eth wallets, beware of phishing sites)
Shapeshift is a bit different because you must provide the eth wallet that will receive the tokens, a myetherwallet preferably.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:13:17
Guys, if you want to sell for profit that's ok. But don't go around telling people that they should sell because the price might go down. Don't ever forget we are talking about btc here. In 5 years, you will remember when you sold at 13.5k because you were scared, and probably will regret it as fuck. Btc price go down, but man does it come up again...

It's a very enlightening experience to check this subreddit in times of bulls and then in times of bears. It's like the subreddit explains exactly what types of users we have.
Hodlers (true and intelligent ones) appear in times of bull markets to help and educate noobs. When the market falls, at first we see all the "Chill out guys" post, but then they dissapear as it is impossible to talk with fear.
Noobs on the other side, well it's pretty much obvious, extremely optimistic in bulls markets and extremely pessimistic in bear markets. No points in between. These are the true victims of price speculation, as most simply do not have the stomach and self control to sail through the storms. Worse, most don't have the wit to capitalize gains and strategize investments in bull markets. It makes me sad that most will not come back, and worse, feel extremely frustrated after the storm has passed.
And there's a fuck ton of FUD/FOMO spreaders that clearly have an agenda. Sometimes they try to disguise themselves as noobs or even worse, as wise hodlers. Fuck them.. really...

That's the whole point, to prove that transfers of data are just a matter of bytes. Still the central greedy system wants to charge you based on the amount you transfer (not to mention all the legal and tax bs) when the infrastructure required is exactly the same. At least for digital transfers.

Just wanted to say I applied and I'm very interested in this. I think I could really use this kind of awesome experience as I am currently part of a small startup making a btc exchange/POS app to be used in Venezuela. We haven't though on implementing lightning yet, as their is an great deal of limitations and political/economical/legal stuff craziness in Venezuela. Not mentioning the hardware and internet limitations. Yet, we are confident we can make it work, and I think this could be a great opportunity to learn how build better software. 
Sorry for the self-shill, I'm just excited :)

You gotta start reading. You will never be able to know what address belongs to what person/store. Having more tx volume than PayPal IS adoption as that means that the money is indeed changing from hand to hand, I.E there's an active ecosystem that communicates with bitcoin. 
Hate all you want, this again is just the beginning. 2 years ago having more volume than PayPal would be thought as impossible. Now it's a reality.
Tomorrow what will the new reality be?

@_date: 2018-08-30 06:34:33
As one guy said before, exchanges don't publish tx to blockchain, so these all are on-chain payments, by design you cannot know what address belongs to who. There are indexes out there that have managed to relate certain addresses to institutions or famous people, but that's it. You simply cannot know who's using Bitcoin and for what. Its like this by design. 
Regarding data, I can only show news and recent developments of companies like square or nyse that are implementing Bitcoin payment solutions. That is the true adoption, as people will simply follow what is hyped and easier.

.... Really dude?
So much wrong in your post. Decisions are always a unit, there's no half decision, there's no  6 part decisions. The fact that a decision can always be a decision does not mean that that decision must be centralized. There's no such thing a centralized democracy. The system, again, will output a single decision, but the fact that the decision is the output of many and separated inputs makes it decentralized. Democracy is a democracy because it's the many deciding a specific thing.  Bitcoin takes it a step further by not needing a a third party judge in order to decide and execute, as the algorithm itself is capable of adapting to it's environment.
I'm not saying you don't get bitcoin, I'm just saying you are confused with terminology.

Easy... You own your Bitcoin.  You will never ever own your money in the Fiat word. You will ALWAYS be dependent on a third party person/service to do even the smallest payment.  You will ALWAYS be affected by unilateral changes in your monetary policy. You will ALWAYS be susceptible to corruption and a constant detriment of your financial status due to inflation and the burocratic and highly inefficient financial system we all live in. 
And most importantly!!!
If we are capable of doing ALL of this, in a world surrounded by then internet of things, why the fuck wouldn't we do it? Why would we keep insisting in a system that is centuries old and that was simply made to protect us from problems that NO LONGER exist. Are you afraid of a pirate raid attacking your coastal town and stealing your money? Are you afraid of barbarians attacking your city? Are you afraid of the local militia taking extra taxes in their monthly town roundup?
No... In 2018 the only thing you want is to be able to own and store your money in a secure way without having a fat and bald banker taking a few percents here and there to pay for her new GF's boob job.

Well taking into account that when you buy a Ledger Nano you are prompted to write your seed on **PAPER** . Besides from misplacing that paper, there's virtually nothing that could hurt your funds. As long as your nano is sitting in your nightstand and your seed in your house's safe, you are unfuckable.

As usual. People writing shit they don't understand. Sure dude, I can't pay for my coffee in Satoshis, but if I'm allowed to instantly convert my btc to usd to pay for that specific coffee, I'm pretty much just doing the same. After all bitcoin is a mean of value storage (and transfer).
Yet, it seems to me that this incitative Starbucks is having is nothing but the born to fail attempt to make cryptocurrency fit in the fiat world, instead of doing it the other way around. 
Bitcoin came here to change the world, in one way or another people and business will have to adapt. Bitcoin is nothing but a technological improvement, those who deny it will forever remain in the shadows.

Bitcoin surely can be extremely helpful, specially when our national currency is worth less than the paper it's printed on. I've also been working in similar iniciatives, its certainly not a bad idea. However the underlying problem lies in the intricate control the goverment has over people. Over everything! From what we eat to what we see in the internet. Most people don't have any possibility to actually get to the internet or to accept Bitcoin in any way possible. Ignorance is encouraged and protected by the goverment, and they are extremely efficient at doing so... The barriers are massive both educationally and technologically.

I don't see any limitations, just give it a good though, just imagine a small community that uses bitcoin as means of transfer, then just go up increasing your scope, there are many things to understand, and it's safe to remember Bitcoin is still human made, so it's not perfect or have every single detail of every single possibility figured out. However,  I believe it's also safe to assume that as of now, there's simply no better proposition and working system as a whole than bitcoin.

Decentralization ≠ Communism
Bitcoin is decentralized because no matter how many Bitcoins some dude may have, he will never be able to alter the way the system works. He or she will never be able to tamper the truth or use their massive resources for their own advantage withing the system.
That's why...
@_date: 2018-05-31 11:18:07
People that do have an internet connection and enough education to actually know what is Bitcoin and how does it work ( a very small percentage of the population) use it as a safer and easier way to store their earnings. While buying dollars in the black market is way more common, people is slowly but surely understanding that they could do the same thing with Bitcoin, and you don't have to have all the requirements and capabilities to go, for example, to a US bank. Most people can't even leave the country and they have basically no infrastructure available to move their funds around. So people either rely on their distant uncle that left the country a few years ago with a panamanian bank account... Or they could go to localBitcoins and buy some Bitcoin. 
At the end of the day, people only want to trade that money back into bolivares but only for convenience and for short periods of time. To pay for specific things. But pure btc transactions for goods and services are still rare but are slowly growing, as most people are charging in USD anyways.

Descentralized: Not having a single point of failure, resilient and capable of mantaining the network against almost everything.
Question: how's Bitcoin descentralized when one account has a larger number associated than the others.
Me: wtf? That doesn't make sense. An exchange having a ton of btc does not make it centralized. Decision making, transaction broadcasting and every single aspect of the Bitcoin network don't give a fuck if x or y person has a ton of btc.

Only a hashrate attack could possibly do that, and we all know what happened when BCash and segwit2x tried that. It IS decentralized because it's up to the community to react to those events, and so far, I think I can confidently say that this community is well capable of handling that kind of shit.

Once again, I come here as a venezuelan trying to make people understand that even though I know bitcoin could and is doing great good to my country, it's not as nearly as adopted and known by the people as this sub thinks. 
The vast majority of venezuelans don't know what Bitcoin is, they don't have internet, no stable electric supply. Most venezuelans are so hungry to even think or debate about this kind of things. 
I do dream that my country will rise again from this communist madness, and I hope Bitcoin will lead that charge. I'm just trying to be informative in this sea of fake news. 
Yes, goverment has banned asic, they have done so in the past. The goverment will continue mining though, as goverment officials are well known to have large mining farms (of stolen equipment and by using state infrastructure for their operations), so nothing changes. Venezuelans stay hungry and ignorant, communist officials will continue mining while people die in hospitals because there's no electricity. And yeah, these bastards mine knowing that everyday power goes out in baby incubators making them die. Just yesterday 3 newborn babies died like that.

I believe it's a bit trickier than one might think. The problem being the size of the blockchain and the philosophy behind how we look at our network. Just think that we are all encouraged to run our own nodes as it's the only truly safe way to validate that something actually happened. 
Having that in your phone (running a full node) would give the user not only the ability to create, sign and broadcast transactions, but in a way in which the user is not dependant on any 3rd party. Yet the blockchain is like 90 gigs (can't remember exactly) so not possible as is.
I recommend you to check out what the guys at lightning labs are developing. The neutrino is a sort of a light node capable of very similar functionality without the need of downloading the entire blockchain.
Neutrino is open source, so instead of creating something new, I guess working with them would be the smartest thing to do.

What about you put that in google just for a second. You'll see many many services working or in development for those kinds of services. 
"If I have problem transferring my coin to another place or some dispute happened with my transaction with bitcoin, which customer support can I contact to resolve it?"
Please read a bit about how Bitcoin works, the whole idea of the blockchain is the fact that this is NO longer needed as we are interacting with a trustless entity. You will never have a situation where you're transaction "is stuck" or "stolen" unless you deliberately messed something up (that includes hacking, you get hacked because you messed up). Even in that situation there are 3rd party services that can help provided you manage your funds with them. But that's the thing, it's about choice, you could trust a 3rd party or you could simply don't. It's up to you. You can't do that with Fiat.
In terms of loans, blockchain is even better and more efficient and , again, we interact with a trustless state machine that will only react to truth (the loan was given, the client payed first invoice, etc etc)
But don't worry friend, I know I'm not the best guy to explain this, but with time you will understand how it truly works.

I personally do not believe Bitcoin's value is just established by demand. Demand is a consequence. Imo Bitcoin's valuation has a lot more to do with 2 factors: 
People getting sick and tired of the conventional financial system and corruption. The blockchain technology promises to fix or at least mitigate the problem of corruption in many areas, people is slowly but surely understanding this. Also, the fact that technology is changing us as a specie. Paying with our phones using digital means of transfer, with a trustless, inmutable and unbreakable (descentralized) system is just the next lógical step forward. It's not gonna be easy, change is never easy, but humanity seems to work this way. 
The price tag we see today is just the state of this battle for change we see right now, you may say they're whales or just the market's invisible hand, but there's clearly a push to dissuade, to spread fud and such, yet.. this is only natural, as well as the next upcoming spike...

@_date: 2018-03-31 07:45:47
1) censorship resistance. No one can ban Bitcoin 
2) You hold your own money and you decide whatever you want to do with your money.  Fiat currencies do not allow such.
3) Goverment's do collapse but most importantly they're corrupt. Bitcoin is not built to be the doomsday currency, but to mantain itself regardless of the economical or burocratic state of any country or institutions. That's another reason why Bitcoin can't be "shut down"
4) yeah Bitcoin is slow, but have you tried making an international transfer with your bank? It takes days, in Bitcoin minutes. 2nd layer solutions such as lightning network were built for fast day to day transactions.
5) volatility is a problem, but it's not there by design. It's the effect the emerging ecosystem is having on the way we're perceiving this technology, because is that, people speculating how important Bitcoin is and will be for us as socities. As with any other market, volatility will diminish with adoption.

Companies that accept btc payments increase the amount of value being transacted, volume increases, which means more transactions are being made using the Bitcoin network. With a healthy network more and more companies will accept btc payments (even if they insta sell their btc for Fiat). The thing is Bitcoin is a finite asset, so as more and more companies start using it, the more value must each Bitcoin posses in order to keep up with the amount of money being transacted, even if they depend on third party liquidity providers to handle the Bitcoin payments. This companies will still be stalled if for example, they can handle 300 million dollars a day in transactions, but the market, thanks to adoption, now requires 500 million. This inevitably makes a price increase necessary as it needs to be more attractive for Bitcoin hodlers to sell their btc in order to keep up with demand.

It does,  I mean... I could write a thousand words on what value is but I believe we can keep it simple. Has anything in Bitcoin drastically changed since the 20k valuation? Not really, if anything new things have been introduced and others improved, yet Bitcoin's valuation is more than 50% less than the last ATH.  Do you think Bitcoin is worth 20 thousand dollars? Then only sell your Bitcoin at 20k, it will eventually be pushed to that price. 
The thing not everyone feels this way. Actually, and I believe this is no secret to anyone, no regulations mean that people can do whatever they want. Even buying and selling from themselves.  So I, a massive whale (hypothetically), sets up 2 accounts, one with a ton of btc and the other with a ton of cash. I start putting very low sell orders with my btc account, and start aggressively buying them with my cash account. Since I'm a whale I'm capable of overloading the exchanges volume, pretty much mantain most of the operations between this 2 accounts, effectively dropping the price. However, the same is done when the intention is to pump it. 
This is price manipulation and it's Bitcoin's worst enemy. Not because what it does to it in the exchanges, but what it does to our minds. We start forgetting Bitcoin is not about it's Fiat value, it's about replacing Fiat. :)

All you said in your first paragraph can be done with crypto in a much better and efficient way. Just need a bit of research on your side and a little bit of time on their side for major adoption. 
"and in bitcoin money have to come from someone's pocket to another." Except for natural resources extraction, every other business works like this.
What are you, 12? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:12:09
And just a friendly reminder from a TRUE Venezuelan that understands how bad this is. 
El Petro, and all the "crypto" iniciative from the dictatorship was obviously DENIED by the national assembly THE ONLY legitimate power in Venezuela (the only one elected by the people, the other institutions simply have been usurped)
So, whenever this bullshit dictatorship ends and Maduro ends up dead in a sidewalk, the national assembly will push back ALL of this. Not only creating a massive expenditure for the people, but creating a really BAD image for crypto in our country. 
Go ahead and check transactions mades in petro so far. No official statement, no identities exposed, all covered in the shades thanks to the technology. They obviously are not open on anything they're doing, because they don't care. They just want to be able to trade their oil/drug money into crypto so they can send it away without having to pass through the international banking system which has strong sanctions on many goverment officials for their relationship with drug lords and guerrillas, as well as for the absolute destruction of human right protection and the economy in our country.

Bitcoin is backed by trust (arguably stronger by all the things discussed). Fiat is backed by the imposition of our goverments upon us. Guess we'll see what is stronger
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:32:10
It's a complicated question. The easy answer would be to say that people simply adapt. However this adaptation comes from 18 years of a slow but sure decline in life conditions and personal liberties. 
It also depends a lot on our conceptual differences of a decent and stable living. Perhaps for you, a minimum decent way of living includes a couple of meals a day, access to basic medicine, higiene products and a bit of leisure. In Venezuela buying deodorant is a luxury, and inviting your family to McDonald's is a month worth of the minimum salary.
People get by, people in Venezuela trade food, replacement parts, even toilet paper. Communities gather around and families help each other to get by. However, as time passes more and more people get caught in the hyperinflationary spiral, losing everything, and starving, if not simply killed in the streets.
I got away last year, my family is still holding strong there, I'm trying to get them out.

It is obvious it is not going to work. It's a project managed by the only goverment capable of obliterating their own country's economy having the largest oil reserves in the world and a whole lot more other natural resources. Petro it's not going to work because it won't have a public blockchain, it won't be publicly mineable and the supply is controlled by the same dudes that flooded the economy with hundreds of billions of bolivares to the point 2000+% inflation was reached.

The thing is you do not understand that we are talking about US dollars. It is not a mystery to anyone that my national currency is worth less the paper is printed on.  They make an enormous quantity of money (US dollars and other currencies) through drug trafficking, influence, arrangements, bribes, etc. They need an efficient way to store this good (but dirty) money in places where sanctions can't reach.

My only real advice is..  if you think Venezuela's "adoption" of crypto will have a meaningful and positive impact in our beloved ecosystem, you're wrong.
If anything, Maduro's doing will only hurt our image and our reach. The Venezuelan goverment is using crypto at a state level for money laundering and capital movements. They have a 30 million strong population controlled with a 2$/month salary and paramilitary armed groups in the streets killing whoever dares to raise the voice.

@_date: 2018-02-24 10:52:17
I really hope your questioning comes from curiosity and not trolling but here's the breakdown.
A common Venezuelan makes 700.000 BsF a month (with food stamps). Just so you can understand how inflation works in this country, a pack of 12 eggs can cost you around 400.000 BsF. That's more than half of your salary. A 2l coca cola can cost you 90.000 and 200 grams of cheese about 300.000 more. 
On the other hand, internet costs 1.200 a month, gas around 400Bs to fill a tank and electricity less than 4.000 a month. The goverment subsidize whatever they want and however they feel fit to control the population..

@_date: 2018-03-25 15:34:23
The thing my friend is that you're unable to differentiate Bitcoin's core technology from the ecosystem surrounding Bitcoin and other crytpocurrencies. Our ecosystem still requires a lot of work, specially in terms of ease of use, accessibility and security, and even though this is of vital important to Bitcoin's success it's not the same as Bitcoin itself. 
Sure, the price goes down when FUD appears. But then it goes up when FOMO kicks in. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, but how people see Bitcoin. It's still inmutable, it's still safe and fast to use, it's still descentralized, censorship resistant, impossible to take down, impossible to control, etc etc. 
You go ahead and spread ALL the fud you need to feel satisfied. Bitcoin's core features will still be there regardless of how you feel...

I laugh so hard on these Bitcoin adoption threads in Venezuela. Im really tired of going from post to post trying to explain the Venezuelan situation. This time I'll make a summary...
Venezuelans will truly care about Bitcoin when they're able to eat, sleep and cure themselves properly. Any Bitcoin adoption hit story you might find, any real evidence you might find is not true adoption but a desperate attempt to circumvent the actual problem. I'm not saying Venezuela is not more sensitive towards crypto due to the stupid high inflation, but my country is so destroyed and messed up right now, we do not have the strength, organization, even time to make this happen.
Our economy is broken, and btc will help out, but let's be realistic, Bitcoin will not magically fix our economy...

La gente se muere por falta de medicinas, los abuelos no tienen pensión, los neonatos mueren en los hospitales. Hay más de 100 presos políticos, inflación sobre 2000%,...

Well, if you can't equally access the crypto world, it's still unfair. What most foreigners seem to not understand is the fact that in Venezuela the minimum wage is less that 3$. And even more, there's a brutal scarcity in everything... Allowing crypto payments is not solving any of these issues because it goes beyond as a problem. The problem is economy is broken, and they obviously know this. They just want to use crypto massively for money laundering. That's what goverment has been doing the last 5 years. Don't you understand? They don't care if people eats or gets medicine, that only care for their money. Their money is being taken away by sanctions, they now want to use crypto to hide their money. It's very simple..

Do you think it is reasonable and respectful to the Venezuelan people that this motherfuckers are pushing a crypto technology in a country where people dont even have access to the internet? Do you think it is reasonable to simply forget the thousands of deaths, the fear and the suffering? In a country where newborn babies die because of lack of things as simple as sterilized towels, you come here and tell me this is the right step for our country?
No bro..  shit doesnt work like this. The Petro and the whole "pro blockchain" speech of the goverment is nothing but a slap in the face to the children dying of cancer because they can't get proper treatment.

A lot.  
You can't see how Fiat system work but Bitcoin is open source, it's not trustless, it's centralized, if one guy is smart enough to steal your money that's it, just take a look at the glorious American  and European bankers, owning  more money  than the population  of their countries...in Bitcoin that's pretty much impossible, because they system does not deliberately supports a specific party.

Because, as many people around here, you have the misconception that people only make the minimum wage. If that was the case we would have thousands of dead every day of hunger. People have to work many jobs, and make different arrangements with their communities and friends to make it through the month. Most people find means to make 2-3 or even 4 monthly salaries each month to make a living. It's quite complicated, but it's something that could easily happen. Then again, take a look at localBitcoins tx volume in Venezuela. If everyone is making 1$ month, how are hundred o millions a month moved through there?

@_date: 2018-07-01 11:31:00
Not really but you could slowly turn your finance into crypto. After all keeping bolivars for your work is pretty much throwing it away. So people is more incentivized to accept and pay in crypto even if it's small sums. This way everyone's work will stop being constantly devaluated by the printer in El Banco Central De Venezuela. I think it's beyond obvious that if suddenly all venezuelans started accepting Bitcoin, the economical crisis, to some degree will be stopped, as the constant stream of cash that is entering the market inorganically will stop being a detriment to the safety of transactions in our economy. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:36:09

Not at the real exchange rate. The goverment has its own exchange rate which is obviously a scam and nobody has access to it (only people from inside the goverment). 
The real rate is rather around 400.000 BsF / 1$
The official rate, no so long ago was around 10 BsF / 1$, so I guess you could imagine the kind of massive business was done. Probably the greatest capital leak in the history of mankind, and all thanks to the good ol' socialism

I guess it's a simple idea, the problem is how to make sure the user hasn't smoke at all.
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:32:26
Well, a smart contract is nothing but code, software. It certainly allows us to run that code in a descentralized, trustless way. Still it is software and there is so much software can do. In this scenario you would still need some sort of hardware capable of detecting if the user smokes or not ( a physical event ). For example, a tiny smoke detector that the user must wear (like a watch for example) capable of making sure no emissions of cigarettes smoke were detected. When the day passes, this detector could then tell the smart contract to release a specific amount of funds to the user, thus giving him/her a reward. This is obviously an example, but I hope you can see that even though smart contracts are very powerful on their own, they still need those bridges (in cases like yours) with real life to make them truly useful.

MAST is not so much about reducing TX size (although it does) but more about privacy. With MAST it will be a lot harder to track a specific users transaction history as MAST only requires the most immediate signatures in the tree as a proof of ownership, and not the entire merkle tree as we use now.

They just uploaded the new version of the app. Like a few hours ago.

So are we back to the positive posts and fun stuff or do I need to wait a little longer so people can go back to fomo?

The thing about the Bitcoin algorithm is that it self regulates its own parameters. Theoretically 3 nodes could sustain the entire network. It wouldn't matter, although more nodes means more security and descentralization.

I decided I wasn't going to post more on this threads.
Venezuelans are dying of hunger, we don't have medicine, food, quality services, we don't even have the certainty that tomorrow we will be alive as everyday many people die by the hand of crime and police brutality. 
Venezuela is a mess, and believe me, real hardworking venezuelans don't give a fuck about crypto. A lot of wealthy people is moving their money through crypto to either circumvent U.S sanctions or to save their work from the Bolivar (our national currency). Again... Hardworking common venezuelans don't give a fuck about crypto, they are hungry, they only want a real solution to the chaos. 
I'm not saying crypto doesn't have a bright future in my country, I know it will... Just not right now..

I'm taking screenshot now of the top comments, then I'll take another when btc stops falling. It's just amazing how the same people can change their minds so fast.

Guys... Guys... The wallet constantly generates new addresses... This is a standard for Ledger and Trezor, it's not only more secure, it enhances your privacy. 
You could still use "older" generated addresses, they do not expire or anything like that, however you could and should always use the new address that's generated, whenever you want to receive Bitcoin.

Guys read the changelog for the app, it's all sarcasm, the app creator is trying to say that the LN is everything BCash supporters ever wanted, basically saying that all their effort has been useless, as LN is part of the one and only true Bitcoin.

Certainly! MAST is quite exciting, I was just trying to explain that one of its main goals is to increase privacy and reduce traceability. It certainly reduce TX size (quite a bit) but Schnorr will give us even smaller TX and faster transaction as well. It's just good stuff after good stuff.

The only manipulation was keeping the price down. This is just natural..

Exactly the reason I support Bitcoin core team. Rational people with rational ideas.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:00:09
Yeah I mean, it certainly needs a lot more though, I was just trying to illustrate that certain problems can't be solved solely using a smart contract.

Don't worry guys, we got it ( haven't arrived to the office yet) get your spacesuits on!

Venezuelan here. He does have still a bit of support. Dictators are never alone, there's always people there for the money or power (or both).
Also there is people starving. Not everyone, sure, but people, many of them. Still, a person might not starve, but living on 12$ a month is a life no human being deserves. Most people might find something to eat at the end of the day, but at what cost? Never studying? Never having fun? No plans for the future? Nothing to hope for?
That's the chavista system. Keep you just so you don't die, but to the point where you don't enjoy life, at all...

You're right. And for 20 years anyone who spoke against the government ended up in jail.
As a matter of fact, hundreds of people are still in jail for political reasons.
Now, this guy comes and since he has support from the military and from many other governments, they can't put him in jail so easily.
