Oh I agree, but unfortunately, the politics of America will need a complete whitewash from top-down, and economics is part of the foundational structure of a sovereign nation.
It's the people in charge of the currency that we need to eradicate first before we talk about a pragmatic monetary system.

Yes, because Western Union takes bitcoin seriously and is probably shaking in their boots for the future of currency.

a quick explanation:
Silk road was hosted on ONE cluster of servers, much like...facebook is. Shut down very easily by taking that one cluster down.
Open bazaar is hosted on MANY nodes all across the world and instead of server farms, people can use their home computers to contribute to the network. Taking one node down would not affect the network much at all, think of bitTorrent (aka damned near impossible to shut down).

well we're at the point where the millennials are taught in their government funded schools, inner cities especially, that being white is a crime against 'progressive' nature in itself.

Yeah I mean, if you need live news or live sports, you're kind of screwed. But live news in America is nothing but white house bootlickers, and sports...eh. Nothing but commercials and ads in between the content that you are shown and cannot control.
I'm a little biased towards cord cutting though, this is all subjective opinion.

It is already here in America. Ghettos are being weaponized and the middle class is supposed to be ashamed of themselves for not giving *more* of what they already pay in wasteful taxes.

if by pro equality, do you mean me as someone who wants to do well for themselves working my ass off so the welfare recipients of any race can abuse the system freely? Pro equality seems nice until you realize the people behind it use it as a weapon to keep minorities in the trap.
Doesn't it seem strange to you that Baltimore schools get funded so much money on the American average, yet remain the most systematically corrupt and blatantly anti white? You're being taught real history that actually happened and you're complaining about that?
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:57:18
Makes me wonder if they're trying to drive down the price of BTC intentionally, losing in the short term..hoping for more adoption in the long term. If you were to buy a 2k dollar computer on tiger direct with BTC, do you have to pay tax?
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:20:03

Don't attach BTC to USD, 200 is the perceived price. BTC is going to be stronger than the USD will ever be..on it's own.
We really have to hope that mass adaptation will spread faster and faster in order to stop thinking about BTC's price with USD in mind.

I'm a right leaning libertarian. I voted for Gary Johnson last election and I'm hopeful for Rand in 2016 not to get completely censored like his father was in 2012--he will be the only republican I would vote for, otherwise it's just going to GJ again.

For one, she's perpetuating the American oligarchy, panders to the poor class in order to continue the growing welfare state to further her elitist agenda which in turns rips apart the middle class.. Let's not forget the Benghazi blunder and desperately trying to cover it up.
You look at her and it's like staring into the face of communism.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:58:39
They're not buzzwords though, they're words that describe exactly what is happening. Maybe if I stepped onto the set of MSNBC and said these things, no one would agree with me. 
But I have a feeling that Bitcoin enthusiasts are up to speed on the major bank corruption + American oligarchy 'politics' and don't care for the Clintons.
Maybe I'm wrong.

The $ styled B sucks though, try drawing it out on paper. It's inefficient.
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:18:18
I understand, and agree, but I'd go as far to say..old media is straight up pure federal sponsored propaganda / diversion tactics, and in many ways, trying to turn the middle class against each other.
Once we dump the brain-trash CNN, MSNBC and FOX news lies, we will thrive.
 It is imperative that GenXY teaches the millennial generation about the abhorrent baby boomer mistakes so we can work together years down the line to figure out a pragmatic solution to the unreal debt that we inherited from the boomers. (protip: we're not going to pay it.)

pretty much though. I haven't been to a theatre in years, but i hear they're playing actual commercials from TV now. you can dumb down an audience of an entire country with decades of broadcast advertisement-barragement in TV, movie theatres, radio, billboards, public advertisements...ect ect.
as a majority, we've become completely desensitized to advertisements that exploit us as an impressionable, curious mammal with potential intellectualism, instead, they'll turn your kids into a brat who NEEDS THE NEW THING /TODAY/!!! and warp your sense of self worth with products that will promise the world to you (REGROW YOUR HAIR WITH THIS PRODUCT, YOU BALD IDIOT, NO ONE WILL LOVE YOU IF YOU DONT'!)
And I especially love the advertisements for pharmaceutical drugs.. are you depressed? :( well this will fix you up, but the side effects are internal bleeding of the anus and you actually might want to kill yourself even more.
