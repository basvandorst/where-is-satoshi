Lots of curious onlookers not so much anti-anything. And we're here because of the aggressive bitcoin evangelists in the wider subs drawing us in. Where's the popcorn?
The three subsets of this is fascinating. The bitcoin anti-government theists, the speculators and the naive nerds.

Interesting! So it'd seem the system actively discourages micro-transactions. I wonder if they've a redundancy planned.

Does anyone that's seen their USD (actual spending) value collapse make that distinction?

Ask on - you can't expect unbias advice on here as they've a stake in encouraging people to take the plunge to inflate their wallet.

Can the bitcoin infrastructure handle [b]millions of simultaneous transactions? Were it to become used globally could it, for example, be used for micro-transactions on the stock exchange?
I guess we're just concerned that you're buying into a ponzi scheme - because it is a ponzi scheme. Different in that you're buying the idea not a sales model and it's seemingly not as centralised, but one all the same. Be interesting to see if it holds its value.

Your 'currency' is a tad shitty if it can't cope. What happened to the scalability?

But there was an underlying value. Until you can freely spend bitcoins it seems as though it's more speculative / ponzi in nature (ignoring the diehards).
I'll watch with intrigue and then hate myself if it creeps anywhere near the $2k some reckon. If there's a crash I might pick a few up for fun - shares minus the scary bankers.

Featured on BBC Radio 4's World at One show. You've hit the high brow news.
Shouldn't all this publicity be a good thing? Legitiamise everything ;)

Nah at $250 that's more than I'm willing to risk speculating. Not a risk taker... it just seems like the whole sub-prime mess the bankers got into trading virtual things with no real worth but for nerds.
I don't think the viable competitor or credible regulation are the concern. It's as people are discussing in the 'dot.com' thread - speculation!

Ah yes. The newly wealthy early adopters come hypocrites. The fight between them and the evangelists is great.

I wish I'd bought a few when I first heard about it a few years back and then forgotten :O)
Guess I'm doubly skeptical as it's a very specific type of person that seems to be in to this too. 
e: jeez this sub is tight - two comments &amp; the spam filters stopped me posting

Interesting. How do we justify the fee? I don't have to pay a transaction fee (however small) to buy things with GBP. It's already my money.
Equally isn't the fee optional? People buying into the ethos might be happy to attach one (especially with the rampant inflation at the minute) but the rest of Joe Public isn't so charitable. Does the system not risk grinding to a halt if it's not profitable to bundle the increased transactions? Or am I reading the wiki wrong?
