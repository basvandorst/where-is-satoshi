Once its open sourced, submit it to Fdroid.

Use Replicant and nobody will be able to tell you what you can or can't install.

This should not be downvoted. He is right.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:31:57
I wish I could understand why comments like these are made.

Thanks a lot for the answer. You reminded me of another thought I had. Say I live in America. I buy $100 worth of BTC. A month later I sell my BTC for 120 Euros. Do I have to pay income tax on my Euros? 
@_date: 2013-08-06 06:48:13
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:38:50
Yeah I know. Theoretically, they could take all of it, but god damn that would be the end of cyprus. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:31:15
Alright, I'll make some adjustments.

Along with a couple other people in this community, I sent an email to the Humble Bundle support staff. Two months later, bitcoin was implemented in Humble Bundle 8.

"Difficulty" still confuses me a little. If the difficulty is 4.6 million, does that mean that the chance of finding the bounty of bitcoin with each share is 1 in 4.6 million?
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:26:44
Exactly what I has thinking.

Ohhhh, I thought you meant [Clear](
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:20:49
Does the price fluctuate with BTC-USD exchange rates or is it consistent?
@_date: 2013-07-03 19:18:21
I love privateinternetaccess. The only thing is that I have reservations about them being based in the U.S.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:19:43
In a way I really don't care about trading for USD. Bitcoin is more valuable to me. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:00:17
Oh ok, sorry about that.

Yes, them and GOG.com

It's relevant, supplemental information.
EDIT: fixed
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:28:48
You didn't buy at the top. The only reason the bubble burst was because of the massive DDOS attack. Imagine where we would be if that hadn't happened.

I made that thread. [Here it is.](

I dont know the answer to this.

Your website is awesomely minimalist and easy on the eyes. I bought a couple blocks of soap. Thank you.

Which pool offers the best return? I'm using deepbit right now, but I think the fees are a little too high.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:17:32
I'm really going to have to wait till February?

You're welcome.

Coinbase had inventory for literally 45 seconds today. I managed to buy 2 BTC for $120 each. By the time I was able to make a thread about it, everything was gone.

Just so everybody knows, not all the 700k is lost. It is only blocked for right now so as to not cause a run on the banks. I agree that it is bullshit, but you should have accurate information. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:40:38
It's not the bank, it's the Cypriot government freezing his assets.

Add an "s" to the end of "user" and you're good to go.

By the way, they are having an awesome, completely unrelated sale right now.

Correct me if i'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the FinCEN regulations said that bitcoins are essentially a foreign currency for taxing purposes. As long as your BTC are never converted into USD, you don't have to pay income tax on it. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:42:51
Bitcoins are not taxable unless they are converted to USD.

@_date: 2013-04-27 01:15:50
So if I bought $100 of bitcoin, sold $100 of bitcoin, bought $100 of bitcoin, sold, bought, sold, bought, etc. Would I have to pay tax on $1000+ of "income" even though I started with $100 and ended with $100?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:26:54
What is the best way to buy bitcoins right now without sending a photo id?
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:04:37
What kind of a schedule do you work? 
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:44:29
@_date: 2013-06-18 22:33:15
No big deal.

This is not correct meme usage. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:35:35
The ellipses makes me think that you're being sarcastic, but the exclamation mark says otherwise.
