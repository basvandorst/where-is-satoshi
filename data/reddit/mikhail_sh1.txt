This seems pretty likely. And then a fork will occur with older users and developers that were only on-board with the original idea.

Good old carbon copy imprint machines. When I started working at 16 we still used them...and that really wasn't that long ago.

You clearly haven't looked at the case behind him. The bulk of the evidence used to convict him was not tainted or even touched by the corrupt individuals in this case. The evidence against will hold up in court on appeal.

If the case against Ulbricht had been made only on Force's info then yeah I would agree with you. But the bulk of the evidence used against him is in no way connected to Force and that particular task force. It was gathered by other compartmentalized teams:
[She pointed out, as the prosecution had done since the allegations against the two agents were first made under seal last year, that the two agents had been part of a separate, Baltimore-based investigation, rather than the New York-based team that had ultimately busted Ulbricht. “The Rogue Agents did not participate in the (Southern District of New York’s) investigation of Silk Road that resulted in defendant’s arrest and indictment, and none of the evidence at defendant’s trial came from the…Baltimore investigation in which the Rogue Agents participated,” she wrote. “That the Rogue Agents may have exceeded the scope of their authority in the…Baltimore investigation does not, in any way, suggest that Ulbricht was not the Dread Pirate Roberts.”](

Hey I agree entirely. I was merely commenting on the fact the revelations regarding Force etc will do nothing to change the fact that the government built the majority of the case on other information provided by other teams and not Force.

I don't know, it looks like given the number of investigations that were ongoing at the time and the way the various bureaucracies compartmentalized it all, I've been more apt to agree with those that say his appeal probably wouldn't go anywhere as the evidence to use to convict was largely untainted. I don't like it but it seems to pass the sniff test when researched a little further. They clearly didn't want to bungle this.

I mean it's certainly possible however improbable it may be. [An interesting write up]( I came across while researching some stuff while we talking. I was unaware that Ross had sent a letter to the judge essentially admitting guilt and asking for leniency. Now this very well could have just been a last ditch effort by the defense after everything seemed lost but interesting nonetheless especially for the letters content. Of course the prosecution sent a letter as well seeking the harshest sentence possible.  They operate in such a twisted fashion.

I mean if it was planted, then absolutely he should be freed or granted a new trial. But if you follow the chain of custody of the evidnece provided by SDNY its obvious that Force/Baltimore didn't plant the evidence.

Still has to face those charges in Maryland.

Supposedly though it doesn't given that the these two guys were part of the Baltimore task force while the majority of the investigation was handled by separate outfits in Chicago and New York. Supposedly not much is tainted in Ulbricht's trial.
edit: though I do wonder, with how much admin control these guys had and what they used it for, if they ddi set up some portion of the evidence...I mean they had **complete** admin control according to what I read after they rolled a guy that had the powers.

Damn well I am eagerly awaiting when someone gets their hand on one. I won't have the money to plunk down on one but I'll be super interested in what happens to the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:21:23
That's what i was wondering..is it still probably that someone could create a bitcoin/litecoin competitor/companion fork and just slightly alter the network dynamics ala litecoin and then set up some sort of decentralized  exchange whilst making the new cryptocurrency ideal for the transfer of value between the two currencies. 
tldr : Basically creating a fork with a decentralized exchange specializing in quick value transfer between litecoin, the new currency and bitcoin... 
sorry kinda random but I'm of the school of thought that bitcoin and litecoin are primarily the first wave of cryptocurrencies and even crazier schemes to attach valuation to digital prodcuts.

So what have people's results been lately with these? I believe a few people have gotten them right?

Do you mean like knowing your bitcoin address by heart? For some reason youre statement made me pause for a second...like we should be storing our bitcoin wallets in Johnny Mnemonic-brain devices.

By *a lot*! My gox live ticker currently shows 105 USD and CNBC's is stuck near 75 USD....data is delayed indeed.
Why would someone use a service like CNBC for btc valuation when the quote is so out of date...that data is useless.

If you combine the forthcoming Interpol's Global Complex for Innovation and the new access many agencies are going to get to IRS records we could see many organizations or people capable of this...we'll see.

Yeah just looked up Paper Wallets/Brain Wallets...pretty nice system actually..I've heard of something similar for other alpha numeric pass-codes but still cool.
