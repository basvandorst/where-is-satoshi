Hey u/Dreamerzz,
Thanks for highlighting all of these points with such detail. I'd like to thank you for going through so many of the reasons on the site. I will touch on each one in a little more detail. 
1. "Really wish this site was not for profit." - I don't know of any business in the bitcoin space that doesn't produce goods or services for a profit. Without profit, the world economy wouldn't function. Do you know of a way that I can get these shirts produced for free? 
2. "I'm sorry but spending a few days to come up with some mediocre reasons and putting those on mugs and other things isn't really novel." - This is actually a project that I started back in 2016 and never had the time to really devote since I was working so much but I have recently found some extra time to devote to picking this back up. I actually took a long time to put all of these reasons together by slowly coming up with them over the course of about a year when one of these ideas would come to me. The next step was to make them all fit on a simple square image that I could share on Instagram. Sometimes the words would hyphenate so I had to change the wording to allow them to fit the margins. I will work on making them better over time. 
3.  Reason 16 response: "I'm sorry, why is this a reason to use bitcoin? It might be a reason to buy it but this doesn't tell me shit about why bitcoin is useful, other then "because price going up long term" which nocoiners have heard millions of times" - Bitcoin is different things to different people. Some people care about privacy and cryptography while others may care about sovereign money or the economics of supply and demand. Different users will have different reasons to wear different shirts. If you're not interested in the economics of Bitcoin, then that shirt is not targeted toward you. Nocoiners are more likely to find other reasons more attractive. 
4. Reason 28 response: "You can send venmo payments and whatnot over the internet. How does this tell me why I should use bitcoin?" - No. YOU can't send Venmo payments across the internet. Venmo is able to send money on THEIR legacy payment network that they give you permission to use as long as you agree to their terms of service. Venmo and other similar payment networks are exactly why you should use Bitcoin and not some centralized corporate surveillance payment network. 
5.  Reason 41 response: " more lies. Venmo, Visa, Paypal, are these not innovations in money? But lightning network is??" - No. Venmo, Visa, PayPal, and others are NOT innovations in money at all. They are simply more efficient ways to send fiat currencies around the world. Bitcoin is about circumventing these types of centralized payment systems and having control of your own money on a borderless and permissionless payment network. Bitcoin is innovation in both money itself AND the payment networks. Also, I never mention LN anywhere on my site so I am not sure why you mentioned that. I DO think that LN is a very exciting experiment but that has more to do with payment networks than money itself.  
6. "Ok, but WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I USE BITCOIN?" - Since this is a project that is far from being complete, I will be writing an article for each reason as well as be creating a video and hopefully, an infographic to help people understand why they should use bitcoin using all of the digital mediums. I will elaborate on this further with text, image, and video. Stay tuned.  
7. Reason 53 response: "Ok, but again, how does this tell me why I should use bitcoin. WHy the fuck should I buy this shirt??" - Only buy a shirt if you feel that you can start a conversation with it and help new users to join the bitcoin community. There's no pressure to buy a shirt if you don't want one. 
8. Reason 62 response: "I literally don't even have the words here" - You actually have more words than any other commenter that I have ever had and I am really thankful for such detailed feedback. Money is a shared ledger between anyone who chooses to accept it. I will be writing an in-depth article on this along with a nice video that explains what money is and how it has been a shared ledger for centuries. 
9. Reason 89 response: "real low effort here" - It's true none the less and I have had a lot of people stop me in the streets or at the checkout counter to ask me what that means. The purpose of my project is to get people to ask questions and create curiosity. Hopefully, they will do some research and learn more about bitcoin. 
10. Reason 83 response: "Oh look, another vague statement with a typo in the main site. Did you even spend the 2 minutes it takes to click the ABC spellcheck before publishing this?" - Yeah, typos happen. I am noticing several in your comment above but I am more interested in getting more people to use bitcoin than to police grammar. The typo is now fixed so I appreciate you pointing that out. Bitcoin is borderless and already has a larger market cap than more than 50 national currencies. Some people will understand how that is already doing more to bring more people together than political unions and those people may want to buy such a shirt. 
11. Reason 34 response: "Do you really think the average person cares about whether a bank is open source or not? Your car is not open source, yet you drive it. Reddit isn't open-source, yet you use it." - Open source is an ideology. I use WooCommerce for my eCommerce store, which is free and open-source. I accept bitcoin and some other cryptos on my site with a free, open-source plugin called [NoMiddleMan Crypto]( which doesn't take any fees for payments and send payments directly to my Electrum wallet which is also free and open source. The more tools that are free and open for people to use and improve upon, the greater the impact of them. Sure, there are a lot of people who don't care about open source because they don't know the benefits of it. Bitcoin is a monetary policy that is open for the world to improve upon. Anyone can opt-in to use it and opt-out f they don't like it. It is freedom of choice. If the legacy banking system was open-source, the 2008 collapse never would have happened since the world would have known that those big banks were insolvent. Bitcoin is 100.00000000% provably solvent all the way out to 8 decimal places. Banks aren't. 
I also see that you edited your comment to delete the part where you say that I am only accepting fiat and I don't accept Bitcoin. I actually ONLY accept Bitcoin and a few other altcoins (which I exchange for Bitcoin - BTC) on the site. I do NOT accept VISA. I do NOT accept PayPal. I do NOT accept Venmo. Just Bitcoin and some alts. The purpose of the project is to get more people to use bitcoin so that is what I am helping to do.   
Finally, I would like to thank you for such a well thought out response. Peer review like yours is more valuable than you purchasing a shirt since it enables me to adapt and grow the project. I have made some adjustments to the site and taken some notes so I can make the project better. If you'd like to subscribe to my YouTube channel so you can get the full explanation of each reason, I'd love to have you on as part of the Reasons To Use Bitcoin community.

Nice. Congrats on the purchase. Its only worth spending if the merchant that you purchased from is also a HODLer. If they sell at point of sale, it’s not any different that you just selling for fiat to make your purchase.

My flair? I will have to figure out how to update it.
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:49:18
Here’s how it will work and already does for those of us who have tried. 
1. You have a wallet with Bitcoin on it and you denominate those Bitcoin in whatever fiat currency you want (if you want to at all). You can also denominate it in whatever BTC denomination you want. BTC, mBTC (millibits), uBTC (bits) or satoshis. 
2. You are anywhere in the world since you are part of the borderless economy of Bitcoin. You request to pay with Bitcoin somewhere. Assuming that the merchant accepts Bitcoin, they make a payment request and show you the QR code.
3. When you scan the QR code, you see the payment amount in both a fiat currency price AND the Bitcoin price in the format that you set in your own wallet.
Your outgoing transactions would look something like this:
“You are sending .01 BTC ($100.00 USD) to address bc1vt...b8C3” 
“You are sending 10 mBTC ($100.00 USD) to address bc1vt...b8C3” 
“You are sending 10,000 uBTC ($100.00 USD) to address bc1vt...b8C3” 
“You are sending 1,000,000 Sats ($100.00 USD) to address bc1vt...b8C3” 
This is already an option with many wallets. I personally prefer sats but everyone is different. 
4. You send the payment if you feel that the both prices accurate and equitable.
5. No crazy math conversions needed since both the sender AND the receiver denominated however they choose in both local currency AND Bitcoin. 
...just remember that if you spend, make sure to replenish ��

The amount of security that a lock provides is relative to the amount or energy/resources that is required to compromise it. 
That’s what Bitcoin is such an amazing invention. You’d need all the computational power in the world to break Bitcoin’s “lock”.
I’m sure that this could be compromised with little more than 3 paper clips and some skilled lock pickers.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:34:44
“Bitcoin hits new high” on the left and “Bitcoin hits new low” right next to it. ��
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:44:14
True. It could absolutely be 2/3. It could also be a 1/3 and using the wrong one causes the device to lock down. 
It’s just cool to see early attempts at trustless systems.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:26:10
It’s just to show how people have been working to limit the need for centralized trust since trust has been given to others. 
So glad that we don’t need trusted third parties to secure wealth anymore.

Thanks. Mining Bitcoin will be what gets more of the world onto renewable energy sources by eliminating curtailed energy and solving the problem of The Duck Curve.
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:07:57
Some good points. I’m not saying that all of these are viable for everyone but rather that any one of these can be used as a means to mine more efficiently and if you are in a colder climate, the excess heat can be put to use.
Thanks for your input though. I’ll def keep it in mind moving forward.
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:55:51
So awesome. Latin America stands to benefit the most from widespread Bitcoin adoption. 
I hope this helps Venezuelans and all of Latin America achieve a higher level of privacy and financial freedom.
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:26:20
I’m looking forward to the day that power-plants accept Bitcoin as payment so that miners have to compete with other bitcoin payments for the electricity. 
It could also potentially solve the “problem” that communities face of ballooning electricity prices in parts of the world where bitcoin mining is driving up the price of electricity.
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:19:08
Thanks for the input. I’m not saying that mining primarily as a means to heat is efficient all by itself but if you’re going to mine, it makes sense to put that energy to use. 
I wouldn’t switch from a standard heater to a bitcoin miner but if you have access to cheap electricity (such as curtailed energy), it becomes cost effective to mine and without consuming fossil fuels to do so. 
Can you elaborate a bit more on “create more waste heat”? It’s my understanding that the heat comes from the sun and the emission of greenhouse gases are the problem. 
Also, the infographic is to promote bitcoin’s utility to subsidize some parts of the renewable energy sector (without the need for tax dollars). If even part of the legacy banking industry is disrupted by Bitcoin adoption, there will be less emissions from operating bank branches, heating offices, lights, employee commutes to work, etc. 
I’m def interested in hearing more of what you have to say.

I use Google sheets for some basic cost average calculations but don’t put anything on there that you would like to keep private. 
This sort of stuff should be automated with a view only API. It still baffles my brain that no OTC exchanges (like Coinbase, CashApp, Kraken, Gemini, etc) have made this sort of functionality the default. 
If people could know their gains/losses with a single glance, way more people would hodl.
@_date: 2019-11-15 05:12:46
You get what I am trying to convey. Bitcoin subsidizes the cost of the production of cheap/remote/stranded energy. When the demand is higher for consumer use than miner use, that’s where the energy will naturally be diverted. 
Without the mining, it’s not cost effective. 
In that sense, Bitcoin is an energy solution, not an energy problem.

Bitcoin doesn’t care what NYC does. Bitcoin basically being outlawed in NY will only cripple them in the long term.
All that Bitcoin needs is miners, full nodes, hodlers, and developers. 
The price will continue to rise one halvening after another as the stock to flow continues to increase. As soon as the price reaches a certain point, NYC will bend the knee to Bitcoin and they will be faced with the choice of eliminating the bit license or get left behind. It’s that simple.

You would need to send it to an entirely different wallet. I would suggest one that gives you manual control over which UTXO you send from. Otherwise you run the risk of linking UTXOs to each other as you spend them. 
Do some research on “peeling chains” and “dusting attacks” to learn more about how the method you’ve mentioned here can still be just as transparent.
Also, blockchain analysis companies can watch the blockchain for “transaction fingerprints”. They look for things like When you send, what kind of addresses you use (legacy, P2SH, bech32, multisig) miner fees, UTXO consolidation, and of course monitoring KYC entry/exit points make retrospective analysis much easier than you might think to follow the money. 
Stay safe out there.

@_date: 2019-11-13 22:43:00
Thanks for the link. I’ll take a look. 
This infographic is to show how Bitcoin mining can be done without adding any additional congestion on the existing grid and can actually alleviate problems that the grid is facing such as energy curtailment and the duck curve. 
In that sense, Bitcoin is an energy solution, not a problem. Obviously there is much more to it than just these 6 points but I’m eager to see what other applications Bitcoin has in the energy sector.

It’s just a joke started by the Twitter persona known as American Hodl. 
It was in response to This tweet from CZ of Bincance. 
The response was that “If you own 6.15 BTC, you are guaranteed to get lots of “bitches” with “big titties”.

He’s in Washington so it’s most likely hydro electric electricity. This is actually how Bitcoin is an energy solution and not an energy problem. This mining operation is literally subsidizing the production of hydroelectric energy. 
Also, the heat that is contributing to climate change comes from the sun, not humans. The CO2 is the greenhouse gas that traps energy from the sun that is proclaimed to be warming the climate thus turning the world into a big greenhouse. That’s why they’re called “Greenhouse Gases”

They would destroy their fiat currency to do so as they would be dumping it for BTC. The price of bitcoin would skyrocket and the government would have a massive bag of BTC that they could do nothing with.
I would place a sell order for 1 satoshi on an exchange for $1 billion USD. If the government bought it, the USD price per bitcoin would be one hundred quadrillion dollars ($100,000,000,000,000,000) per coin. 
Miners would keep mining and have new absurdly highly priced Bitcoin that would circulate. 
In the end, fiat would be worthless and 1 Bitcoin would be be able to buy entire economies.

Miner fees will be the incentive to keep adding blocks to the blockchain. 
The block subsidy will no longer exist but as long as the demand continues to grow, then the miners will keep charging fees to add new blocks to the blockchain.
Also, the way that the Lightning Network works, payment channels have an economic incentive to have the most targeted and relevant payment channels with the largest amount of liquidity so that they can route the largest amount of payments. What most don’t realize is that this is effectively competitive HODLing and as the number of LN payment channels continues to grow, the price will continue to increase. 
Keep HODLing, my friends.

It would take a long time to get your initial investment back but bitcoin mining absolutely provides “guaranteed buyer” if you can’t sell surplus electricity. 
In my opinion, renewable bitcoin mining is absolutely going to be one of the next arms races.
Do some research on “Energy curtailment” and “the duck curve” and see how you can use mining to solve those problems. 
This (rather short sided) [video from VOX about energy curtailment]( touches on how much energy gets washed because of the lack of infrastructure surrounding renewables.

Whether it’s a feature or not, it’s still a way that banks control you and your money. That’s not possible with Bitcoin which is what the infographic is showing in simple terms.
It’s comparing Bitcoin and Fiat and Bitcoin can just free your addresses because it thinks that someone may be stealing your money. That’s a feature of Bitcoin. It’s like a digital form of cash. If someone steals any cash from you, the bank isn’t going to help you.

You don’t have to pay something to use what is already yours. You have to compensate the miner for their loss of competitiveness in finding the the next block and the block subsidy that comes with it.  
Tell her that paying a miner fee to send a tx is like paying for gas to move her car from one point to another. 
Ask her why she needs to pay to move a car that is already hers.
*This assumes that she has a car but you could just apply this analogy to anyone who owns a car.

If it was banned in any given jurisdiction, that capital would leave and go to a part of the world where it was legal. The last country to ban it would become so incredibly wealthy because it had all of the Bitcoin HODLers, it would have a lot of trouble banning it. 
It’s also possible that said wealthy nation wouldn’t be able to ban it because of the influence that the hodlers have on the economic system since they (the hodlers) are so wealthy and now concentrated.

The issue is that it needs to be able to seamlessly integrate with our wordpress site, woocommerce and the fulfillment service that we use for shirts. 
It could potentially work for stickers since I manually ship them out but I tried to do that for my first sticker sales and it turned into a logistical nightmare trying to manually keep track of shipping addresses, payments, txid’s, etc. 
Having a single place that we can direct people to to make payments and fill out a proper order form is the best way to keep track of everything and it also 100% automated so I can live my life while my products are for sale online. Maybe Blockonomics will add lightning support soon and it will become a non-issue. 
I really appreciate your insightful feedback though. Super helpful.

Duly noted. 
I’ve told people how simply and easy it is to make money with bitcoin time and time again. I tell them to buy and hodl for a few years and all I get is more questions about “For how long?” and “Do you have any data?”, etc. 
So, rather than telling people the same thing over and over and over again. I though an article would be the best way to communicate it’s simplicity and relevance. 
I’ll work on dumbing it down for people as  educated as yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:59:20
No worries. It helps me to realize the importance of the Kerning. I have no idea that so many people paid such close attention to detail.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:31:57
I think everyone should buy at least a little bit of Bitcoin and [HODL it for at least 210,000 blocks]( and make any decisions after that.
Also, Bitcoin is a massive asymmetric opportunity. [The opportunity for gain is far greater than the risk of loss.]( You absolutely could lose 100% of what you buy but the chances of you gaining far more than 100% are very real and we have already seen prices at 350%+ of what they are today. 
DYOR but I would HODL at least a little bit and forget about it for a few years.

\- Show its fiat valuation when the transaction was sent. 
\- Show it's current fiat valuation. 
\- Show the fiat price gain or loss. +/- dollar movement
\- Show the fiat percentage gain/loss

Seems like a good basic idea but I agree that cold canvassing is a bad idea. I would try to get users set up with online payments first since it would cost less than setting a LN node.

Totally agree. It’s just an easy way to gauge how long you might want to hodl since it guarantees a halvening.

Yeah, I have more research to so as well but a friend of mine works in oil and gas and he says it’s definitely viable. No idea what the quality of the gas needs to be but it’s worth doing the research on two fronts.

Not sure what’s so complicated about “Buy and hodl for at least 210,000 blocks” but I’m open to hear your opinion on it further. 
You’re right, any coin held for longer than the timeframe you mentioned has appreciated in value. That’s why I suggest that everyone hodls for at least that long. That’s the basis of the theory.

@_date: 2019-04-28 21:33:43
Thanks so much for the feedback but we can’t accept Bitcoin on Amazon or eBay so it’s not the best option for us. 
Part of the reason we are set up the way that we are is to minimize monthly expenses. We used to pay $30 a month for a Shopify integration and the only way to accept BTC was through BitPay which required even more fees and an extensive KYC process as well as the risk of being de-platformed. 
We have tried a lot of things to get he site to where it is today. 
We use Wordpress for our website which costs about $10 a month for server space, we use WooCommerce for our web store which costs $0 per month because we like to support free open-source projects and 
Finally, we use Blockonomics for our payment processor which is a sweet project that only requires an xPub and fees are minimal. 
It took a lot of research and work to get things to where they are today. If we sell on Amazon and eBay, all of those listing fees, monthly fees, KYC and risk of being de-platformed all come back. 
We will look into it though. Maybe we can find a simple solution that will integrate well with what we have going.
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:26:13
Great question. I am willing to ship anywhere that I am able but the shipping will probably be like 1000 forints. Would that prevent you from wanting one?

Thanks for the feedback. It's comments like yours that let us know how we can improve. 
We made these at the same time that we made the SegWit stickers but we will make sure to update the kerning if we decide to make another run.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:59:35
Yeah, I hear you. Past performance definitely doesn’t guarantee anything but backtesting is a common way to test a theory or strategy. 
Currently, this method of HODLing has a 100% success rate but that may absolutely change in the future. If/when that day comes, I’ll stop shilling the theory. 
What will really test this theory is to see what the price will be 210,000 blocks after the current ATH which took place around block 500,000.
I’m looking forward to see the price of Bitcoin when Block 710,000 is mined. 
Keep hodling and let me know if you find a TxID that disproves the theory.
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:42:48
I think all of us who payed Sonic can relate.

I don’t want to try to predict the future or get cocky but based on events of the past I think we  may see a new ATH within 12 months following the next halvening. 
I’m really excited to see if this will still remain true 210,000 blocks after the current ATH. 
Time will tell but we’re eagerly awaiting Block 710,000.

I would postulate that using only fossil fuels to mine creates any sort of a problem. The block reward incentivizes and in essence subsidizes the proliferation of cheap renewable energy. 
Bitcoin mining is the most exciting where it has the potential to solve the problem of energy curtailment the duck curve.

Yup. In theory, the longer you hodl, the higher the fiat valuation over time. 
It’s not a guarantee but as long as the supply of new coins continues to halve every 210,000 blocks, we should continue to see the price rise.

What wallets did you bounce through? Were you using HD wallets? Wasabi or Samourai Wallets? 
Simply pushing transactions through regular addresses won't suffice. You need to use privacy centric wallets like Wasabi or Samourai. If you're not interested in using these wallets, you need to use an HD wallet at the very least.

Give them $5 worth of Bitcoin when they are 8 but don’t let them spend it until they are 16.

BRD is an SPV wallet and they use their own nodes to verify transactions unless the end user sets up their own node. I suppose that they could potentially be able to see every BRD transaction. 
It’s also possible that BRD transactions have a blockchain fingerprint so that they know which transactions are transactions to or from a BRD Wallet.

It all comes down to basic supply and demand.
Bitcoin is scarce and as time goes on, the supply of new coins will slow down and the demand will continue to grow. 
This will put upward pressure on the price.

I currently do this but I would avoid Shopify since they have all sorts of absurd fees. 
I bought a domain with GoDaddy at first but now I have most of my domains with Google domains since they offer free privacy but I will be transferring all of my domains to Orange Website in the future because they are based in Iceland (privacy focused) and accept Bitcoin. 
I host with Blue Host but will also be changing this to Orange Website as soon as I can afford to and use Wordpress as my content management system. Wordpress is pretty much the industry standard for self-hosted websites. 
I use WooCommerce for selling shirts on my site [Reasons To Use Bitcoin](  for a couple reasons.
1. WooCommerce is FREE and open-source so my monthly overhead is $0 per month to have an online store. This is an important part of running a profitable store in the fledging bitcoin space. 
2. For receiving crypto payments, I use a woo commerce Wordpress plugin called [Nomiddleman Crypto]( because they enable me to accept Bitcoin and 40+ shitcoins and are also FREE and open-source. I pay $0 per payment processed which is another part of staying profitable in such a small and growing industry. 
I used to use Open Node for LN payments but they recently were forced to implement KYC so I dropped them. I am looking for alternatives but it will take some time. 
In conclusion, I sell shirts on a site that cost me $12 per year for a domain, $100 per year for hosting, $0 per month for my online store (WooCommerce), and $0 for each payment that I receive (Nomiddleman Crypto). 
My monthly overhead is about $10-11 USD and I only accept Bitcoin and some shitcoins that are easily exchanged for Bitcoin. 
Marketing is a whole different post. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I haven’t tried this myself but with the Cash App, you can get a bank account and routing number IF you get the cash app card. 
You can then add that as a bank account option on Coinbase and potentially withdraw to your Cash App account.
This could be counterintuitive since you can just sell via the Cash App but I’m not sure if you have access to that where you live. 
The Cash App also has daily withdraw limits but you should be able to slowly cash out as long as you do proper KYC. 
Good luck.

First of all, thanks for posting this. I am in the same boat so maybe we can help to troubleshoot each other’s problems. 
Are you setting up BTC Pay Server for LN payments or for on-chain payments? 
I am working to get my own BTC pay server set up for LN payments but for on-chain payments, I use a WooCommerce Wordpress plugin called [Nomiddleman Crypto]( which sounds like it is exactly what you need until you can get BTC Pay fully integrated. 
All I do is paste my xPub key in the plugin and I am all set up to accept Bitcoin payments with no third party fees. I can also accept 40+ shitcoins but I only accept ones that I can easily exchange for Bitcoin without having to do a bunch of KYC. 
Until you can get BTCPay to fully integrate, I’d encourage you to experiment with Nomiddleman and see if they work for you in the meantime. It’s a free, open-source plugin with 0% fees so it’s still true to the ethos of bitcoin and can help you accept bitcoin until you get your BTC Pay server up and running. 
Let me know if you make any progress with your server or have any questions with Nomiddleman. 
I’m all ears and willing to help learn/troubleshoot with you as you get things set up.

If you’re looking to mitigate the risk of loss due to volatility, I would suggest slowly buying via [dollar cost averaging](  in 20 increments of $100 or 40 purchases of $50. Since the next halvening is next year, I’d suggest that you buy as soon as possible.

I totally agree. 
Last night I was actually thinking about LN game theory. Bitcoin mining is a competition between whoever can mine blocks with the least amount of resources (mining efficiency). 
LN is a competition between HODLers with the largest amount of BTC (liquidity) and in the most relevant/active channels. 
Whoever HODLs the most BTC in payment channels and in the most relevant channels will get the greatest ROI. It will become so competitive that everyone will want to have as many active channels open as possible.
Once so much BTC is tied up in channels, the price is going to increase substantially as it becomes an arms race to buy up as much bitcoin as possible on exchanges to fund new channels.

This sounds completely bogus to me. 
The only way that you can accept payments in your Coinbase account with Blockonomics is if you manually paste an address from your Coinbase wallet and use that same address for all of your payments (address reuse).
Coinbase doesn't give their users access to their xPub keys so there's no way that you can use Blockonomics with Coinbase to automatically generate new addresses for each payment. 
"But the worst part is that the bug leaks your account logins.
If you're using any of these wallets then it will even leak your password:"
What are you talking about? Blockonomics doesn't require passwords to any of these services. 
I'm interested to learn more about the issue you've encountered and would be willing to help you get it sorted.  
"I've had to uninstall the plugin, maybe I should even report it as a scam since I could have lost all the coins in my account." 
Bogus FUD. I've used Blockonomics for years without any issues or ever needed to give my password to any third party services. They only require an xPub and that's only if you want to generate a new address for each payment.

BTC Pay Server is great for those with more technical expertise but Blockonomics absolutely lets you accept BTC directly. I've accepted BTC on my site with Blockonomics for a while now and never gave them access to any usernames or passwords.

Thanks for the insight. I obviously need to do some more research on how transactions wait to be confirmed and how nodes work. I guess I always thought it was one collective mempool and the miners pick the transactions that they want to include in the next block.   
Can you elaborate on how this works or link me to some reputable sources? 
What do you mean by "network location"? Isn't the network distributed? 
How do nodes "configure" differently? 
I'm gonna do a bunch of research on how nodes work.  
Thanks again for chiming in.

Sorry to hear that you Local Bitcoins experience was less than enjoyable. 
It sounds like you paid a premium from the seller but that how it goes on peer-to-Peter markets. 
When you purchase on markets that don’t require intensive KYC, you’ll almost always pay a hefty premium for the privacy, convenience and eliminating the possibility of having your account flagged or seized. 
It’s not uncommon to pay a 30%+ premium on P2P markets. 
If you’re looking for an alternative, I would try [Bisq]( It’s a software download so it doesn’t require KYC and it does pretty much the same thing as Local Bitcoins. There are a number of different payment options. I believe you can pay with PayPal but you can see the prices of BTC for sale in a clear fiat valuation price. 
Again, sorry to hear that your experience with Local Bitcoins wasn’t a good one but there are good companies in the space who are working to eliminate these sorts of problems.
Stay the course. We’re glad to have you in the Bitcoin space. Buy some and [HODL it for at least 210,000 blocks]( I think you’ll be glad you did.

It wasn’t my parent comment but the further left you go on the political spectrum, the more authoritarian it gets.

Yes, you read that correctly. you need to KYC to buy coffee. It's also a taxable event too so not only is Gemini the custodian but you're also liable to pay taxes for buying a cup of coffee.

Why would you short BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:43:31
I’m going to have to check that out. That would be awesome if you can. Thanks for sharing.

Why not HODL at least a little bit? A [210,000 block HODL ]( (about 4 years) is currently 100% profitable.

Agreed but premiums charged by private parties are different that the actual market rate of BTC. 
Those premiums are for convenience, privacy and mitigating the risk of using a custodial service. 
For what it’s worth, I think we’ll see the next ATH in December of 2020, not 2021. Time will tell.

I hope your cautious assumption is correct. 
If you’re outside of the US (like approx 96% of the world is) the halvening gives us something to look forward to every 4 years.

It’s good that Bitcoin is getting more awareness at local businesses like the grocery store but since it’s required to collect full KYC, it’s ultimately bad for the ecosystem.

If I add one right now, would you buy it?
I can get one added on a white shirt in the next hour for you if you’re willing to buy one.

The first rule of Bitcoin club is that you always talk about Bitcoin. 
The second rule of Bitcoin club is that you NEVER talk about YOUR bitcoin.

If you EMP the entire planet, we have bigger problems that Bitcoin not working. Everything with electronic components would cease to function and we would have global chaos far worse that Whether or not Bitcoin transactions would still receive confirmations.

This is nothing but more police state surveillance bull shit.
You need to KYC to sign up for the service and then you can only spend your crypto at some of the largest corporations on the planet. Both are antithetical to the ethos of Bitcoin.
Every time any bitcoin goes in or out of a system like this, it opens up a treasure trove of retrospective analysis on chain. It's a total trojan horse on behalf of the exchange that literally ran ads that said "Crypto Needs Regulations".
This just sets up Gemini to be a fractional reserve crypto bank and compete with Visa. It's just layer 2 (and 3 and 4) scaling but with corporations as the second layer instead of a math based framework like LN.
Absolute garbage for those of us who actually believe in Bitcoin being a tool to increase global liberty and individual sovereignty.
This is great for the sheep who think that this is somehow bitcoin adoption. It's not. Fold App has been doing this for a while and others have done it for years before them.
I intend to use bitcoin as a payment between peers; not several multinational corporations who erode my privacy and the privacy of others.
I would avoid this like the cancer that it is.

Yes, but BTC never actually hit $20k anywhere but South Korea I believe. 
I think the current ATH is somewhere around $18,700 on most markets but you absolutely understand the theory. 
The next halvening is set to take place in May of 2020. It’s also exciting to note that halvenings always take place about 6 months before US presidential elections.

All of our standard shirts are $21 worth of BTC. If you get in the site and add any shirt to your cart and complete the checkout process (except for the payment) you will be able to get a shipping price quote. 
If that final price is ok with you, I will get both this and the Nintendo shirt added in the next couple hours. 
I can also get LN payments enabled. 
Let me know what you think.

Solid advice but if Coinbase is HODLing onto your BTC, you'll probably come out on top with the way that markets are trending upwards right now. I'm not sure how much "interest" you'd otherwise be making but I doubt that it will beat BTC's current market pump.

I wasn't talking about sales tax. I was referring to capital gains tax.

I wish. I wish a LOT!
Def have 25 sats tho.
If I was part of the 21 BTC club, I’d be making mad gains trading.
