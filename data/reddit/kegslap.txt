How would ebay even work without chargeback/customer protection? Why would the person ever actually send you the correct thing ever without the threat of the money going away?

If you have income you need to pay income tax. A genius plan of "what if I just didn't TELL the government I made income" fails just as much with bitcoin as it does with anything else. 
Like it's the sort of thing you almost certainly can get away with if you use your dark powers to be a super criminal that doesn't pay tax on some 30 dollars you got somewhere, but if you are actually making a living with adult wages and you just don't pay taxes on it they aren't going to be super fooled by the "I just won't tell them I have any income!" plan. Regardless of how much bitcoin does or doesn't hide your income.

The blockchain doesn't actually enforce that at all in any way. Sorry if someone told you it would. It's not a DRM system. Or rather you can pretend it is one and then people can copy that image just fine.

Isn't the general point of learning to save to learn about interest bearing accounts? 
Like I mean we all hope we can buy bitcoin today then we get lucky and it's worth more tomorrow, but there isn't actually any promise of that and it's not really a 'savings account' or anything with regular predictable money growth or anything. It doesn't really teach kids about saving. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:37:25
I guess the point is that with bitcoin you can't set goals realistically. If you want to save up to buy a bike in 2 years there is no possible way to know how much bitcoin you need to buy today. If it is a 100 dollar bike to get it in a year you could need to save 200 dollars of bitcoin or 50 dollars of bitcoin today and either is fully possible and not particularly extremes in bitcoin price swings.

I feel like sometimes I get this glimpse of why there are people that are so super excited about blockchains:
They think that satoshi invented cryptography and public/private key encryption and that those things require blockchains. 
Like that makes bitcoin seem SO much more revolutionary if that stuff all is new stuff in 2009 instead of 40 year old technology that everything already uses. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:15:18
I mean, a third party and chargebacks is the obvious correct answer but then why use bitcoin at all instead of not doing that? 
@_date: 2015-09-30 01:54:21
See, this is where you are clearly confused. The blockchain does almost nothing to fix the sort of trusts you are talking about, it is only trust free in data consistency, not trust free in the content of the fairness of the transactions done. If I'm selling you a bridge the blockchain will make sure the coins are transferred with no interference by a middle man but say nothing about your ability to trust me to deliver this bridge.
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:58:58
How much faster could this have been without the blockchain though? Bitcoin seems like a really slow step in this one. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:37:59


This strikes me as weird, if you are not a big fan of typing long arbitrary strings of numbers bitcoin might not be the currency for you. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:07:57
Oh boy, bitcoin might scale to a whole 7x60x60x24x4 (2,419,200) users per day making one single transaction maybe in a few years under ideal circumstances and 1.8x60x60x24x4 (967,680) users under observed transaction size conditions! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:55:14
Properly secured anything can't be lost. If you lost it it just means you didn't do it properly enough. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:08:12
Are you misunderstanding? They don't care one bit where the dollar bills came from, they want to know who or what transfered you value, they don't care how you are holding it. They want to know if you are putting a loan from your bookie up for a loan to try and cheat them. They don't care what dollar bills you use, they care why you are the guy holding them. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:43:20
The protocol works the same as ever, but major players like circle and changetip are pivoting towards being more US dollar focused and sending bitcoin to the background, while major players like bitpay are apparently collapsing. 
Bitcoin isn't dead exactly, but the economic ecosystem around it is in a really rough spot right now. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 19:24:55
And he talked about not everyone being a node but even then he was talking about "node" meaning the same thing as "miner", the functions splitting apart is pretty outside the design of bitcoin and leaves functions without proper compensation. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:45:38
An average confirmation takes 10 minutes by design, but can be anywhere from seconds to hours, so if you are doing thousands of transactions expect on average it to take 60 minutes but for any 1 transaction it could be anywhere between 6 minutes and 6 hours.  
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:43:06
Bitcoin was intended to be P2P originally and a miner was a node was a user. The reason to be a node was because you were mining and getting paid to mine and because you were a user who needed the blockchain to be able to use it.   
Now users are split from nodes and miners are split from nodes and it's basically left as an abstract charity thing where the incentive is that abstractly someone somewhere has to be a node or bitcoin is dead. 
 
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:58:46
I think you are confusing the one very very specific sort of 'trust' bitcoin gives in it's transactions with some sort of really generalized trust in a social sense. 
None of the issues banks have had are due to people rewriting transactions or hacking each other's databases. They already have cryptographic change logs on that stuff already. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:09:10
You seem to be conflating a ton of different meanings of the words 'trust" and "validated". 
The issues you have with the banks are not issues of database validation, the blockchain that is not an AI that gets rid of "trust". 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:33:25
Questions like this are dumb, most of the bitcoin is already handed out, so if everyone is going to own it it has to come from somewhere. Do you think you are the only one that has the dumb idea that once everyone has it you will be the one guy that thought to hide it and not spend it and now your gonna be super rich? That is what every single person speculating on bitcoin thinks they will be. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:21:45
Why not just run a database and not worry about blocks at all then? 
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:56:50
It requires exactly 100,000,000 "satoshis" to make one "bitcoin".
One dollar is around 420,000 satoshis, so your 60k is worth around 13 cents. 
People are trying to avoid answering your question directly because the whole "make people think they have a large number of bitcoin but actually it's some tiny fraction of a penny!" is a big way people try to scam others into bitcoin. Now they are going to suggest that you buy more from them since you have so little but already got a wallet. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:39:24
I mean it's cool if bitcoin is just a hobby thing for a few people, that is really a reasonable future vision for it, but unless it can scale to at least millions of users it wouldn't even be useable for a single large store or as a game currency or anything meaningful. 
Like it's cool if bitcoin can't be visa but it's less cool if it can't even be like, big enough to handle a tiny town or something. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:08:13
Lots of people dream of a day of an honor system based restaurant but that seems pretty silly to do. I could just pay or not pay or pay the wrong amount then leave and no one would even know. (unless they then go check on the tablet, in which case why not use that tablet they have to carry around all the time in the first place?)
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:21:39
I think it will be worth 10 threads a day where everyone in circle jerks about bitcoin being worth enough to make them rich in 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:33:33
Okay but mercadolibre isn't going to be an illegal market, like there is zero chance it's going to help you with illegal activities why would it be any help with "getting around capital controls"?

If no one will buy from first time sellers than how can they get reputation?
If some people will buy from first time sellers why wouldn't scammers use that forever to steal money forever? 
Why would I pay a price premium at all instead of using normal people money with normal people consumer protection that solves these problems already at no price premium?

The whole point of currency is to have extrinsic value. It's the whole point.

I mean in 1993 visa was doing 800 transactions per second, so bitcoin would need well over 250mb blocks (13tb per year) just to match visa from 20 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 19:15:29
 I think I mean extrinsic value! Exactly like I wrote! 
@_date: 2015-09-29 00:01:36
"I sold bitcoin" isn't an answer of where the money came from. If you said "well I just converted 5000 euros" it wouldn't answer either, you had to answer where the money actually came from.
And yeah yeah you can paint it as a nazi occupation and they have no right to ask, but you are the one trying to get the loan and it is perfectly reasonable for them to have whatever conditions they want to loan you enough money to buy a house. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 21:22:31
If it does they aren't using the blockchain. There has only been 85 million transactions ever in the history of the blockchain and tons of things like satoshi dice and the recent stress test that make up tens of millions of those alone. There is not really room in the number of transactions that exist to have over 1 million users. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:12:44
What does 2 or 4mb get us that 1mb doesn't?  
7x4x60x60x24 = 2,419,200 users a day under ideal conditions where bitcoin was really 7tps per mb.  
That isn't even 1 transaction per person in chicago per day. How is that any better than 1 was? What is even useful for going through a whole traumatic hard fork and ending up still too tiny to even process one single city let alone all the crazy toasters paying refrigerator stuff? 
@_date: 2015-09-29 23:07:24
Search this forum, even beyond 'double spend' attacks you can find a ton of examples of something going wrong with broadcast transactions, it's absolutely important to wait for a transaction to be in the blockchain before counting it as real. 99% of the time you'd be safe just assuming it will be but there is no short supply of goof ups and lost transactions before they are written. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 15:10:48
That really isn't true. What you are talking about is the fact the price has gotten so small that even relatively large swings seem like small numbers of dollars. 
Like in the last few months the price has been 220 and 280 and because both are 200 something it seems stable to someone not looking too hard. But it's really a 22% drop. 
If it was 1000 dollars and dropped to 780 people would see that as a giant crazy swing. But it's also a 22% drop. 
It's less that it's extremely stable and more that smaller numbers mean even big percents are smaller moves in integers moved.

A proof that regulation works!

This whole article is based on some weird claim that people were skeptical of paper money and look how that worked out so that means that if people are skeptical of bitcoin that will work out too. 
People were skeptical of beanz and flooz and company scrips and all sorts of other crazy new disruptive types of money that came and went and never caught on. 
They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright Brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.

Do remember that is a curve of "hype" not some magical promise that some random price line will somehow match that line somehow.

somebody wrote the whitepaper you know. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 02:10:25
Visa is used as the standard because visa has always been very open about it's statistics (because it knows they are the best of any company) people compared bitcoin's tps to visa because visa is the company that most frequently distributes the actual real numbers of how many they do and announces their internal maximums. 
People could compare bitcoin to some much smaller service but smaller services don't actually talk as openly about what they can handle. We know visa can handle 56,582 transactions per second.

Wow, seems like deflation is bad for currencies!
