Satoshis and kilosats is by far the best.

These cars (mcclaren, ferrari, lambo) are so rare and with such a long waiting list for the new models, it is unlikely they will lose much if any value unless he drives it into the ground or crashes. That low liquidity actually means values hold up (kind of like BTC)

This absolutely not true. 1 in 10 americans don't have retirement savings, much less Bitcoin. See? I can make up shitty stats too!

Referencing a variable before initialization (in languages where that matters) should have caused a compilation error (or warning at the minimum). Seeing as that didn't seem to happen.. was the code even compiled? 
I believe bitcoin is written in C++, which requires compilation, so does this mean it was compiled with error/warnings off?

These people in Africa aren't mostly going to be daytrading.. they are going to be pulling supply out of the market.

Not true. I spend a lot of money monthly on a personal Amex, and I just got a Shift card (Visa debit backed by BTC on Coinbase) so I could transfer month-to-month expenses from the Amex to the Shift card. That way I buy BTC weekly/monthly to refill the balance, the capital gains taxes are limited due to averaging out gains/losses over the short term, and any left over BTC can get swept monthly to another account.

Yeah, but then I would have to live in PR, home of crappy internet, hurricanes, no power, a bankrupt electric company that runs on imported gas &amp; oil, general corruption, terrible roads, limited water supplies, and general humidity.
I looked at Act 20/22 in 2015, and back then it required you setup a company with 3 employees, pay dividends, and live on the island 6 months out of the year. Fundamentally, the act 20/22 thing is designed for hedge fund managers from NYC, not for average guy with a few BTC. 
As a digital nomad who is also a US citizen, the god-honest best way of avoiding US taxes is not to move to PR where the local government may decide to terminate the 20/22 tax breaks on a whim (cause admit it, PR is perpetually broke), but instead to just renounce your US citizenship and move someplace where you pay taxes on a territory system, instead of a citizenship system.
Or buy a passport for St. Kitts or something. It's only like 150k donation now to the island after the 2017 hurricane.
All of which are much better options than moving to Puerto Rico.

Here is an overview from a global law firm:

Funny, lack of power, water, and food will make things like a cryptocurrency less useful. Can't trade BTC when the lights are out for weeks at a time.
