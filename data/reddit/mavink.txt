If 80 GB of storage is a significant expense you either have the wrong VPS provider or you're storing a lot of copies. Amazon EC2, Vultr and DigitalOcean all charge $0.10/Gb/month for block storage, so that's a whopping $8/month. I'm sure there are even cheaper options if you look hard enough.

"3 times the money" is a bit much; it's more like +20-30% on average. And Josh only does payouts once a day so you get about one iteration per 48 hours.

You create a paper wallet or brainwallet. This new wallet has a unique Bitcoin address; you then send your bitcoins from Coinbase to this new address.

I have lots of options, there is healthy competition in the Netherlands. But they all have their own issues. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:25:25
First off, your account at MtGox needs to have "verified" status. If you are verified, this is how the process works:
* Sign up with bitcoinbuilder and submit the required documents so Josh can verify your identity
* Next, you can tell bitcoinbuilder.com what your own "real" BTC address is
* Buy bitcoins at MtGox
* Transfer them to the "GoxBTC deposit address" bitcoinbuilder gives you; this transfer is completed instantly
* Sell the "GoxBTC" for "RealBTC"
* Request a withdrawal. Those are typically processed the next day
* You now have real bitcoins in your own wallet. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:03:38
Also, there's a market for trading "GoxBTC" to "RealBTC". Anyone that has the nerve to make a USD or EUR deposit to MtGox can make a nice profit.

I have experienced the exact same thing last year. Calling support won't do you any good, they'll insist you have a virus on your computer. Apparently there's some malware in the wild that tries to buy bitcoins when it detects you logging in to  
The good news is that your bank card will still work; the bad news is that you'll need to request a new login/password for the electronic banking system and you'll need to physically visit one of their branches to retrieve it. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:15:19
They said I had a virus. After several calls they gave me the name of a Windows virus, even though I don't own a single computer running that OS.

Most altcoins are believed to have the same "issue".
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:23:20
BTC-e.com also does this; they send you an e-mail with approve/cancel links. I was a little annoyed when they first implemented this, but once you're used to it it's just 10 seconds extra work and does improve security quite a bit.  
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:18:41
You can always receive cons on that address; since you generated it you have the private key necessary to spend the coins you received again later.
As for sending: keep in mind that the default behaviour of bitcoin-qt is to spend the *entire* balance of the address. 
Suppose you have 1 full bitcoin stored in your vanity address; if you buy a pizza for 0.02 BTC the other 0.98 BTC "change" will be sent to a different address that is also in your own wallet.

I'm pretty sure there are lots of people that would be happy to have money on Mt.Gox right now. In fact, I think you could get a nice premium for any funds you currently have there!

There are services that allow recurring payments from an online wallet; Coinbase is one party that does so: 
The service provider can also add a small surcharge for payment via bitcoin to cover the risk of non-renewal.

The current going rate for 1 BTC on MtGox is about 0.7 "real" bitcoins: 
So at this moment the general consensus in the market is that there is a 70% chance of them surviving this crisis.

I'm not sure whether OKpay will work from the UK and how fast their current AML/KYC procedures are, but if using them is an option for you they are pretty fast. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:10:40
The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone will re-buy bitcoins that they spend. If the fiat value of your bitcoins rises you can spend some of them without re-buying; in other words spend your "profits". In this way deflationary currencies might actually stimulate spending to a certain degree.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:21:44
We already have a "bank" that handles this for Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:16:07

A simple counterargument: if my BTC becomes worth more, I can just keep on spending them while retaining the same total value in fiat currencies.

No. If you mine a new block you can specify the address the block reward goes to, so you can receive the block reward and transaction fees for several blocks on the same address. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:14:17
Not yet. At this moment you could create the transaction and store it offline to send (manually or automated) at a later time, but you can't pre-broadcast it to the blockchain. 
A possible future implementation of "sent this amount in the future" could use an external "oracle" that evaluates the current date, see  for more details.

The fastest way to deposit money is through okpay.com; but if you have faith in Mt.Gox re-enabling deposits there is an easier way.
* Sign up at 
* Deposit BTC
* Buy "GoxBTC" 
* Have the "GoxBTC" deposited in your Mt.Gox account and wait for them to re-enable withdrawals
The going rate is about 0.7 bitcoins for 1 GoxBTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:16:01
This won't work; you need the private keys for those output addresses to do this.

The Gliph app does exactly this (instant messaging + bitcoin payments).

It would only protect against a race attack. There are other forms of double spending are not prevented by the scenario you describe:

No, not really. They can withstand a short flame, but if they are in a serious fire don't expect to recover them. That's why I always order two cards with the exact same keys and store them in different locations.
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:46:30
Most Bitcoin wallets allow you to import a private key from a paper wallet (if it's BIP38 encrypted your options are somewhat limited, but for a normal key there are more than enough options). So take a computer that you know to be properly secured, install your Bitcoin wallet of choice, and import the private key into that wallet. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:14:16
No, but their customer service is completely clueless about computers. They sent me a name of a Windows virus even though I do most of my banking from my iPad. After telling them so they said I boot my iPad in safe mode and run a virus scan on it...
This is the same company that built a balance checker for your bank account on top of MSN Messenger and now has an iPad app for which you can set withdrawal limits -- from within the app itself.

This wouldn't work regardless of the chain selection algorithm; the reference bitcoin-qt client includes a "checkpoint"; this is a hash of a known block from the "correct" chain. The current client has a checkpoint of block 250.000, so you'd have to start mining your alternative chain from that point. Any alternative chains that don't include the correct block number 250.000 would be discarded. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:50:17
According to that paper the main financial risk is that a double spend could be hidden from your Electrum client. That would however require a rather significant amount of hashing power (&gt;10% of the total network) to be controlled by the attacker.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:26:44
Have a look the Litecoin hashrate for the past month; the price of LTC has been decreasing even faster than that of Bitcoin. 
In the last month the total hashrate for this altcoin has gone down by 30%; the same thing could happen for Bitcoin if the price drops further. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:06:44
I used btcrow.com for a couple of transactions last year (amounts of 5-15 BTC each), never had a problem with them. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:27:12
IIRC the amount of fiat currency recovered is way less than 20%, so depending on how the remaining assets will be distributed a large amount of bitcoins might be sold to pay back the outstanding fiat balances. 
On the other hand, some statements have listed 200k of the missing 850kBTC to be owned by MtGox, so if that's true more than 20% of the bitcoins owned to creditors was recovered. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:44:16
As long as the wallet you use has the option to export your private keys you should be able to spend your bitcoins with a different wallet. 
If your wallet uses BIP39 and you still have your seed you're fine as well (BIP39 allows your new wallet to regenerate the private key using your seed as input)
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:38:43
If even one large country started using Lightning Networks the current block size, even after deploying Segwit, would be way too small. Quoting the Lightning Network whitepaper:










Segwit and Lightning Networks won't magically solve the scaling issues, and larger blocks will be required in the future. To keep with your GPS comparison: the current block size is like saying there can only be 2 GPS satellites for the entire world, and if your GPS receiver doesn't see those satellites you're out of luck and will have to use a different navigation system. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:03:39
I'm not sure comparing this with the price of a wallet is the right way to look at this. I currently pay about $20/month for my bank accounts. If I can have a distributed, trustless system for the same price sign me up!
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:32:44
I didn't say BU is the best solution. But if we can compromise by increasing the block size to 2 or 4 MB at the same moment Segwit is activated I think everyone could get behind that for now, breaking this deadlock. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:37:02
That is already in place. You can easily buy bitcoins online from several websites and pay using iDeal (online payments system supported by all Dutch banks).

The way I understand the current development plan the inflating rate will be about 1% per year after the switch to Proof of Stake: the developers are aiming for 10% of all coins to be staked and a 8-10% reward for that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:13:38
Unfortunately the market is moving in a different direction. Have a look at the bottom chart at 
Most of the new money coming in in the last month has been going to altcoins. Sure, Bitcoin went up a lot. But other coins have seen much more money coming in, and we're getting very close to a point where less than half the money in this space is in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:06:50
January 1st of the year you're declaring for (so January 1st 2016 for your tax filing over 2016), same as anything else in Box 3: 
I'd personally use a "reputable source" such as bitcoinaverage.com or the Winkdex value for January 1st. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:59:20
The point I'm trying to make is that even the Segwit developers say larger blocks are necessary, and the current transaction volume needs that increase. The Core team has said they plan an increase shortly after Segwit is activated  too, so why not do that  I right now? 
If you look at  the number of nodes has gone up quite a lot this year. If 1000 of them drop off the network with larger blocks that's no disaster. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:01:49
I'm a happy customer of vultr.com. Fast and cheap servers, lots of locations, and a decent API for firing up new servers automatically. If I remember correctly I had to pay my first $5 with a credit card but every other bill can be paid with BTC.

The plan is to switch Etherium mining from "proof of work" to "proof of stake" (PoS). In a PoS system miners are still rewarded with a block reward and transaction fees, but you need a way to make sure everyone stays honest. In Proof of Work that is done by making miners use electricity for PoW calculations; that way a dishonest miner will have to spend a lot of money on electricity if he wants to subvert the network by rolling back transactions/working on a different chain. 
In PoS the miners are kept "honest" by making them "stake" some of their coins. To mine blocks and get the block reward/transaction fees you have to put some of your coins at stake, and if it turns out you have been working on a wrong chain you lose those coins. The implementation will of course be a bit more complex than this :)

The 1MB limit is "semi-hard"; increasing it would mean upgrading your Bitcoin client. That is something you'll need to do regularly anyway, and we're about to see an example of how that is handled in action: 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:02:53
Go to Finances -&gt; Funds -&gt; Transactions History. There should be "re-send email" links for every pending withdrawal. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:57:14
At this moment, if you can get your hands on the right mining hardware (i.e. Avalon or BFL ASICs) the electricity costs are such a tiny percentage of your mining income that they are simply not a relevant factor. 
If you're thinking about buying PC's with GPU's: don't even try. In a couple of months the mining difficulty will increase by a factor of 10 or more. Even with free electricity it would take a year or more to recoup your hardware investment.

There is at least one active developer, and a fix is already being worked on: 
@_date: 2013-08-15 19:53:17
You can download any bitcoin client you can run locally (i.e. on your PC/Mac). Generate a new address and save the corresponding private key/wallet.dat file somewhere safe. 
Note that the newly generated address is *not broadcast to the network*. The only time your computer can be linked to the new address is if you *spend* money from it or someone hacks your computer and finds the private key.  
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:52:37
Yes, you can think of every address as a new virtual bank account number. But be aware that most Bitcoin clients won't let you choose *from* which address you send payments; so when you spend bitcoins all accounts will be treated as one big pool. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:32:01
In the finances screen click the "History" button near the bottom. It lists all your trades and withdrawals; for unconfirmed withdrawals you have the option to re-send the confirmation mail or cancel the withdrawal.

VAT applies to almost all sales. But selling bitcoins is treated the same as other forex transactions, so you only need to pay VAT when buying something with bitcoins, not for converting them to euro's.

My advice in general is to forget about mining; the amount of BTC you'll earn per GH/s of mining output is roughly halving every month. In most cases you'll be better off holding on to your bitcoins.

In my experience, SEPA withdrawals/deposits to/from Bitstamp are about a day slower (Kraken: 1-2 business days, Bitstamp: 2-3 business days). In other words, both are an order of magnitude faster than mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:22:54
In fact, I recently had a SEPA transfer deposited in my bank account the same day. Banks in Europe are so efficient we don't really need Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:34:19
One of the reasons is that if you use a predictable (i.e. BAD) random number generator, reusing the same address for more than a single payment will enable hackers to recover the private key for that address. Google "android random number generator bitcoin" for an example of the real-life consequences.

My best bet is that they will go up fast. For 12 hours, everyone was able to withdraw their bitcoins but all fiat money is stuck. So there will be a lot of potential buyers with euro's, dollars and what-have-you-not burning a hole in their pockets.

The press release says that DNB (the Dutch central bank) does not have any authority to regulate or monitor Bitcoin or other virtual currencies. 
There are some quotes from them over at  they are basically saying "we don't know wheter we'd like to regulate this, but that's a moot question since there are no laws that allow us to do so".

There are dark corners in the "real" economy as well. How is that war on drugs working out? What about the prohibition? There will always be a market for illegal goods. That has nothing to do with bitcoin as a currency (in fact, you might argue that there is *less* illegal activity in the bitcoin economy: 
The best comparison that I see is between the bittorrent protocol and its use in illegal filesharing. No western countries have banned the use of the protocol, but some of the hotspots of illegal activity *using the protocol* have been banned. A good example of that is Piratebay; there are several countries where using bittorrent is perfectly legal but all ISP's are forced to block that specific website.

Think of a wallet as a bank vault that stores your money. But while you probably think blockchain.info is the location of the vault, in fact they only store the *key* to your vault. You can download a copy of that key so you can access the vault if blockchain.info disappears. The actual vault itself is stored on every computer connected to the Bitcoin network, but without the proper key nobody can access it. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:09:41
Basically, don't worry about this. Right now there is lots of volatility, but that goes both ways. Some weeks you'll get some extra profit and the next week you might lose a couple of dollars; in the long run this should even out. 
As others have suggested there are several services that remove this risk for a small fee. My take on this is that once bitcoin becomes popular enough to make up a significant portion of your sales volume the USD/BTC exchange rate will become more stable thus removing this concern. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:05:32
There is nothing preventing your bank from issuing a credit card that allows you to spend bit coins. It could be backed by a bank's wallet; just like your traditional credit card is backed by the bank's US dollar reserves.
I don't think this would make sense *right now* to issue this type of card, since you don't earn bitcoins to pay the card back with. Once (or rather, if) bitcoin becomes the most popular currency the deflationary nature won't matter if you are paying your balance every month; the economy simply doesn't grow more than a couple of percents per year.

For those that are interested in the Dutch banking system, here are some highlights:
* Accepting in-store payments using a bank card costs the retailer about €0.05 per transaction. Payments are credited to their bank account the next business day. 
* Accepting online payments costs around €0.40-€0.50 per transaction, with the full amount credited to your bank account the next business day
* Online payments between consumer bank accounts are free and either near-instant or processed the next business day. 
* SEPA transactions are also free for consumers, and generally processed within 2-3 working days throughout the entire euro zone.
