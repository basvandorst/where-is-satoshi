Then leave and don't come back, you cunt. Jesus the whining "Wahhh! my post was downvoted because I bring up tired topics that have been beat to death and then people downvote because they don't want to wipe the snot from my fucking lip"

Just bring something useful to the default unit discussion. Anything. What you did with this thread was a bunch of hand-waving about how you want two zeros after the decimal and how 'shit's not going anywhere' until that happens.
You know why I don't make a thread about the default unit? Because I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said. The "problem" is known. There's solid effort going to make uBTC that default unit.
Patience, FFS.

You do nothing but come on here all day and spout bullshit. It's painfully obvious you can't see down the road nor do you seem to be able to anticipate change. You see the here and now, and nothing else. Go do something worth while. Build something. Of course, anyone familiar with your posting history knows that won't happen. That's far too much work with far too much risk. I'd be concerned if I thought more people were like you. Luckily that isn't the case and there are people working to improve the current state of things.
But please, continue criticizing from the sidelines. After all, it's what you do best.

I've heard through the grapevine that the founders of this are discontinuing the service. Do you have special knowledge?

knock this shit off

There's no doubt that it's an issue. But your rhetoric makes it sound dire. It's not. People ask the question "well, can I have a fraction of a bitcoin?" exactly one time.

Listen to yourself...

I downvote every comment I come across from you.
If your criticisms had any semblance of optimism, I'd reconsider. But you just want bitcoin to fail and the fact you spend all your time here is all the more embarrassing.
Go fuck yourself.

Any idea who makes the hardware?

*If* the bitcoin economy grows, that increased growth has to be reflected in the same finite number of coins. The only way the price doesn't increase in the long term is if the bitcoin economy ceases to increase at a rate that exceeds the growth of the money base (which is increasing at a decreasing rate).

What's wrong is we have to sift through people like you making grandiose claims about how bitcoin's not going to see X until Y is fulfilled to a degree you're satisfied with.
You're not the first to think of this problem, you're not doing shit to solve it, you're not building anything, you're not doing shit. Stop complaining and use the search button.

Don't be such a prick. Do you live there?

You're right, because that's not Charlie Shrem.

Right, I think the biggest hurdle bitcoin will come across is that the average person is so out-of-touch with how the technology they use everyday actually works, and simultaneously can't be bothered to learn more about it.
"Does it take more than 15sec to describe? If so, I'm not interested."
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:58:54
This is such a brain-dead statement. Get a fucking grip.
I come across people at least once a week who have never heard the word bitcoin before. And this is in a very large, west coast city.
If you think even 20% of the global population is aware of bitcoin, you're a purebred fucking moron.
