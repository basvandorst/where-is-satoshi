Welcome to the future. 
We own the bitcoin network - your coins are our coins, but we haven't touched them that much so don't worry (:
Dogecoin is still around, and if you're unhappy with the situation, it's that way ---&gt;

How much money do you send to Africa again?

Dunno why you keep getting downvoted for everything, these are great discussion points. Last thing I'd want to see is a centralized bitcoin because the mainstream is too large and careless with their trust

Wow amazing! Where do I pre-order?

It's reddit :P -&gt; @_date: 2014-09-30 04:43:59
Yes probably. That makes this kind of interesting, the total bets against October should technically be a little bit below the cost required to make all the fake accounts

Surprisingly global eh? I wonder if they realize what bitcoin is about yet
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:48:00
Definitely need more of yous around here!

Yeah this isn't a smart contract lol. Also, since you're still matching this is no different than using any other bitcoin betting exchange or 'prediction market' ([BetMoose]( [Predictious](
Edit: Just had a look at fairlay - lol you guys have to resolve it? What happens if you get assassinated tomorrow? Funds locked in, no resolution? Lovely. At least create some type of automated, open-sourced resolution system where if you don't resolve within X time it automatically sends funds back. Would help with risk.

Double checking: are you using 2FA?
