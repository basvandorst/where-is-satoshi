I've been working on CashIntoCoins for over a year, we've learned a lot, and we have some cool bits of technology that help us out.    I have faith that we can handle anything that is thrown at us, and I know that as long as we are upfront with the community and our customers, we can handle things if and when they go wrong.

I am the CEO of expresscoin, we can usually process wires the same day.   Can I PM you to find out more about what happened?

I am pretty sure that more people  joined the foundation for the purpose of voting for Brock than people who have left the foundation because of him.
With the foundations history, all of us could benefit greatly from someone like Brock pushing for legitimate reform.

Good questions!
I've had a few people ask about which bank is preferred.  It's any credit union who is part of the swirl network, or credit union shared branching. 
The fee is deducted from the amount deposited/sent.   
and yes, that is correct on the tx limit.

it might not be shady, but your answers were shady *enough* and/or indicative of someone who isn't really on top of his game.  So you go thrown into the "too much risk" silo and shut down.
The fact that you are so defensive about and then posted this on social media only goes to prove their point that in an industry as regulated and highly scrutinized as money transmission, you are too volatile of a customer to worry about.
get your stuff together and try another exchange.

well, if is an old transaction, you have two options:
either maintain the relationship and give them the information (assuming its your private wallet)
or terminate the relationship and don't give them anything.  It's probably a benign request, assuming the value is over 3k usd at the time and its your own wallet.
If not...

This it just fundamentally incorrect and makes it  sound like you have no understanding of bitcoin or money laundering.
The fact is, bitcoin is a borderline worthless tool for laundering funds.  People try sometimes, and they often end up getting caught. The whole point of money laundering is to break the links in the flow of funds and then legitimize those funds back into spendable currency.  But with bitcoin, that is inherently impossible.   There are ways to fudge it a bit, sure. But there are also teams of people  dedicated to monitoring each and every transaction and breaking those methods open.   
Cash, on the other hand,  is completely legal to throw on a plane and fly it out of the country.  There is no automated tracking of cash, no way for third parties to observe publicly, there is no cryptographic proof of ownership, and no world wide network of computers broadcasting and maintaining a verifiable accurate chain of custody for the entire history of those funds.  
But the truth is, the real winner in money laundering is, has always been, and will continue to be, bank-to-bank wire transfers. No one launders money like HSBC and JP Morgan Chase, they are the real pros bitcoin could never be.

First, it's Blockchain Inc or Blockchain Luxembourg S.A.R.L  which is how any legitimate reporter would report it. 
Second, it's really a double edged sword, they do get a bonus of having a name that is common, but this practice is usually reserved to domain names because it makes it more searchable.   Having a word in common usage as your brand is usually a big no-no, because you can't trademark anything.  Which means anyone in the whole world can make a Blockchain Wallet and BC.info would have no recourse.  (as long as you don't use their imagery or content).   So while this is a pretty dickish move from an industry standpoint,  its got a lot of long term debt built into it. 
tl;dr, make blockchain websites and apps like its your job and laugh as they try and deal with all the issues they've caused for themselves.

They know that you or someone you know you know send coins to another exchange.
And now you've admitted that a redditor names XMR2020 buys bitcoin from coinbase and sends them to some kind of alt coin exchange uses XMR while you hope it and every point along the way are secure.   which seems like a really big assumption to me. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:35:22
my argument is that you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:10:54
yeah they do...

How many drug dealers or criminal organizations do you think prioritize safety over money?

I second this.  I can't cross the border anymore without some extreme aggravation.   Even when I am not traveling for business, so I know that I am on a list.
