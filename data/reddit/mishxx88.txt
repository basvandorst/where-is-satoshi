Exactly, governments abusing their power, good luck telling people where to spend their money, this will not fly, hopefully people wake up. This should backfire and people will go to bitcoin for safety, because bitcoin does not put limits on peoples cash. 
Like 85% of the world governments seem like idiots and control freaks to me.

Yea, right now we should worry about how to be protected from market manipulation which is apparently  alive and a big problem for adoption

Crypto is here to stay, this was the big question, but from what is happening - SEC will approve ETF sooner or later. If you buy now - you will not loose money in the long run. The wealth from gold will transfer slowly to bitcoin in the coming years, so I think these predictions are very possible. Once ethereum and blockchain companies takes off, bitcoin will follow and there will be a massive wave of investors and buyers on the market.

I think you are completely wrong - but its okay, see you soon after we get past the 20k

Bitcoin is about to shut down the US $ soon

If $ collapses, 100k ++++
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:07:07
Yea, good luck going against the 3 most powerful countries in the world. You may still be able to trade bitcoin after it gets banned, but bitcoin will be seen as illegal and without adoption, it will slowly fade away. Thats only if it gets banned, but I have a feeling it will be seen on a global scale for store of value once wealth transfer starts from the old to the new generations, so I think we are still good for now :)

The FED is the actual mob of the world and it is designed that CHINA, RUSSIAN and USA are all in on the $. There are very rich people that control the $ and that is why it is a world reserve currency. If you think that this MOB (that has been in power for decades) will just let you walk over them and take out the $ with bitcoin, that is not happening unless WW3. Bitcoin will be your digital gold and store of value if governments allow it, thats it.
@_date: 2019-10-03 05:24:50
Bingo and bitcoin is at 100k by then

@_date: 2019-12-03 02:46:53
I buy bitcoin to store value, I dont buy it to spend it on stuff. Bitcoin is a commodity and investment that stores wealth which could be used as a payment, but I don't see the point in that at all..
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:24:55
For crypto to succeed it will need to work with governments and have regulations, so I don't see how EU new regulations are bad in anyway for adoption, whoever thinks they will have crypto adoption without governments is either living in some dreamland or is expecting a very big chaos in the world where governments are no longer in control and there is massive protests and wars around the world, which at the moment is very unlikely.

Bitcoin is a commodity and store of value - its not money, but you are welcome to buy and trade with it for anything you would like. You won't be seeing Wal Mart putting prices in BTC on their groceries - thats for sure.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:39:16
Bitcoin is not to pay for groceries, its to store your wealth away from corrupt banks and people able to come to your home and rob you from your wealth. If nobody knows you have bitcoin, its going to be very hard for them to see your bitcoins, but if you have your gold in your house under your bed - it wont be easy to hide it or leave and take it with you. So, you should look at bitcoin as a world bank where people can store their wealth. I don't see anyone using gold bars in Wal Mart, but if they need the money, they exchange the gold and then from there they do the trading for whatever goods they want.
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:29:14
Haha, if you think bitcoin will get everyone rekt in the world and the only rich people will be bitcoiners, you must be living in some kind of dream world.. You will not be laughing at anyone, because if bitcoin was ever to become the finance back of the world, so you become rich with the 2 bitcoins you have, that means there is a total chaos everywhere.

All deposits are insured to $250,000, thats your MAX. Why can't I sell my house to you for Bitcoin? (who is talking about dirty money?) I can sell my house for 1 BTC or 2 BTC and its my choice, I can even do it for free if I want to, who will stop me? You get the title and send me my Bitcoins .. Every bank in USA has insurance for up to $250,000 in case it goes bankrupt, what about the rest of the 19,750,000, how are you getting them? Do you know how many banks in Europe has run away with peoples money thru the years from 2000. One of the banks a couple years ago actually bankrupted and all the peoples pensions were gone, so its not like the banks are very safe either.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:25:23
A this moment, I think governments are trying to understand crypto and see how they can control it and if they see its impossible they will issue their own digital currencies which they are already doing, but the problem is this, how do you tell someone not to use or do something, when you are doing it exactly the same. So, if governments are starting to issue their own digital currencies, that means they have to find a way to work with the decentralized networks as well otherwise it would be pretty dumb to tell us, well sorry guys, you have to use our currencies and blockchains and we are banning all the other ones, it just won't be fair and I hope people stand up for what is right if this ever happens and fight back (digitally).
@_date: 2019-12-24 20:07:27
If you have Bitcoin, you can buy my car or house or trade for something else with me. There are many people around the world that accept BTC now, its peer to peer, most importantly its for people that have wealth to store it securely, because if you have 20 million in the bank and one day the bank says well, we are sorry we dont have your 20 millions there is nothing you can do.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:32:15
If anybody is buying bitcoin under contract or paper bitcoins from Bakkt or whatever, he is missing the point of what bitcoin is. I have no idea why would anyone buy bitcoins without being able to store it in their wallet/ledger, so like Robinhood, buying bitcoin, but you can't send it anywhere.. pretty much scam.
@_date: 2019-12-25 02:06:31
Well, if I was a multi millionare and my country is at a civil war, because the government is corrupt, I am putting my money in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is mostly to store wealth, transfer it or make a big purchase of something expensive, its not to buy bananas and tomatos at WalMart.. so you are wrong.

Bitcoin = Digital Gold = Store of Value
Basically a hedge against the stupidity and overspending of our governments around the world (especially on military bullshit) and also, the ongoing currency wars that are happening on 99% of currencies. The only one still standing is the $, but the question is until when?
You will need a hedge against this coming recession which if you still have not figured it out - will be with fiat currencies. So, when shit hits the fan, you either buy GOLD or Bitcoin and since most of the new generation is digital people, we will probably drop gold and buy bitcoin as new generations do not believe in physical gold - they like digital shit - like bitcoin. 
 Wealth transfer from the old milonares/billionaires to the young generations will probably happen thru cryptocurrencies of bitcoin, government coins, either way, everything is becoming digital and tokenized, so no escape from that.
Good luck :)
