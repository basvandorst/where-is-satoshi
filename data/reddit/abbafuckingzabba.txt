The fact is there is still *some* level of risk.
It's very very small, but a very very small number * $150k or so works out to something.
There is a sat/byte level somewhere around 5-10 where the risk of including the transaction is not worth the extra fee from including it.

No. The pool had some sort of bug it looks like that caused the invalid block. Or they did it on purpose to see how the network would react. Either way the fact that they found the next block is a complete coincidence. They have ~12% of hash power right now so they had a 1/8 chance of finding it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:13:09
No. And presumably not even their own nodes validated it after submittal to the network because they found the correct block after that. Which would mean they had to recognize that their previous block was invalid in real time and start all the miners working on the same block again.

I’m speculating here but once the mining side of things thinks it’s found a valid block it likely propagates it everywhere just about as fast as it can.  There are some high-speed relays between major mining pools to get blocks out to the network ASAP. Milliseconds of delay can mean stale blocks. It does make sense get the block out there and then worry about if it’s valid later.

Yes, but if there is demand to buy futures pushing the futures price up, you will have firms arbitraging.  I.E. Futures launch and go to say 17k, while BTC is trading at 16,500.   Firm will sell a futures contract  and buy actual coin at 16.5.

Most miners won't process transactions with that low of a fee, even if space is available in the block.  The bigger a block is, the (slightly) longer it takes to compute and propagate.  So a miner making a full 1mb block is taking a very slightly higher risk of an orphan block over a miner making empty blocks.  Of course, paying reasonable TX fees more than covers this risk, statistically.

Depends on the motivation.  
I would guess it stays fairly flat this weekend and jumps a bit Monday. Probably continuing next week as more people get in.
But it is scary that it’s being very widely adopted. It can’t be considered some fringe  thing anymore. At some point banks will be willing to lose money to attack btc.  
Imagine if a bunch of big banks got together and spent $1 billion or so on coin. Then they got their lobbyists to draft Some very anti-crypto laws then broke the news and put in huge sell orders.  Then they got their media friends to widely report that bitcoin is a scam and that it’s dead.

Isn't it 30?
What type of battery bank do you have?  Do you have specs on it?
I had this idea awhile ago, but it quickly became apparent that the battery costs would be very high relative to the actual cost of the miners.  To the point that it was impossible to justify the cash outlay for solar/batteries VS just setting up shop somewhere with 4c/kwh power.  
I.E. if you're spending $1500 per miner and $10k in solar/battery/setup costs, the ROI is much better to just buy 6 more miners and pay 0.04c/kwh.  Not as cool though.

It also does two more things.  It does bring down the diff on BTC and it creates more demand for mining hardware.

This is how the world works.  The alternative is bitcoin being outlawed and basically killed.  Two steps forward, one step back.

Yea, because people use BTC for all kinds of shit.  the BCH transactions are mostly people moving their BCH to exchanges, so it makes sense they will be large transactions, and you only need to move all of your bch once.
Guaranteed hedge funds have algos to watch the blocks to see how much bch is moving to exchanges to sell and frontrunning it.  Relatively easy to tell... old address with say 500 BTC suddenly transfers 500 BCH to a new address - high chance that's going to an exchange for a sell order.
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:47:23
They don't hide this fact.  
It will get to the point where any exchange that is willing to do business with you is going to require ID and SSN ect.  Look at what happened to btc-e.  
And to be honest this is actually a good thing, as it legitimatizes bitcoin.  There were really only ever two ways this could go.  A move towards legitimization or a move towards making it illegal/ outlawing it.  
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:25:19
These are not the people that are going to move bitcoin though.  They have their role to play, but the real movement is from high net worth people diversifying out of traditional investments to get a small % exposure to crypto.
If someone worth $1 billion wants to put 1% of their net worth into BTC, that's a $10 million buy order.  And you might think, ok that seems a bit reckless, but the cost benefit makes total sense for an investment like this.  As it goes up, other money managers will chase it because they are "missing out" on the gains.  
I think it's very possible we see $10k btc by next summer.

The real problem is this is 20&amp; more efficient than Bitmain's 2 year old model.  
I would hate to have ordered a bunch of these when Bitmain decides to release whatever they have been working on.
They have been known to be rather ruthless in destroying competition by offering better products.

The land and the solar panels are cheap. The problem is they only produce power for ~8 hours of the day.  
The limiting factor in every bit coin mine is how much power the utility connection can handle. For arguments sake let’s say it can handle 1 MW.  well then you’re going to Install 800 KW of minors. But if you plan to run them entirely on solar you would need to be back feeding 3 to 4 MW during the day to cover all of your usage when the sun is down. And if you had the capacity to backfeed 3 to 4MW then it would be stupid to only install 800kw of miners.
The real best solution for mining is to find old no longer used buildings that used to have very power-hungry businesses like smelting plants. They have the capacity to deliver tons of power that would cost millions of dollars to build out nowadays.

One person doing a million dollar buy is the same as 10,000 people doing a $100 buy.  For that million dollar buy, a transaction fee of $10 or $50 or $100 doesn't matter.  You can totally use btc.  It's not practical to use BTC (or bch, eth,ltc) to buy lunch/coffee.  Visa has that market cornered and does a great job of it.  
Some of the posts on here act like the sky is falling if you have to pay a couple hundred sat/byte to get confirmed in the next block.  Pay $10 more? for most uses that's not an issue.  It will actually start to regulate itself in that people will stop sending small transactions because they are too expensive.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:09
The premise is that IF BTC falls and BCH becomes BTC (which I think is highly unlikely) it will show a lack of stability in the most stable coin of the crypto world.  This will discourage people from investing in crypto and will likely set back the growth that has come so far.

I would imagine Buffett has someone on the tech side of things that has explained it to him and he decided against it.

The way I see it is that there is an elephant in the room, Bitmain.  Everyone knows this.  While people can speculate and hate on Jihan and thing that he's trying to takeover bitcoin, put yourself in his shoes.  
What is the  most important thing? 
That crypto (specifically BTC) continues to rise and gain in popularity.   If this happens, Bitmain will continue to make obscene amounts of money and have a dominant position in the marketplace.
If crypto (or BTC) crashes for an extended period it will be financially ruinous for Bitmain.  
We know bitmain is holding huge amounts of crypto, we know they have hundreds of millions invested in mining tech.  There is no reason they would want to replace BTC with something else.  
The risk reward doesn't add up for someone in Bitmain's position.  They could switch all their hashing to BCH and sell all their BTC for BCH, but what happens if that just kills BTC and 80% of the users just go away? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:02
Why would they want to get out?  They have a ton, it's all they have been accepting for miner orders for the past month, not to mention all the buy orders to push the price up.  
Any way you slice it, them selling their BCH is going to crash the price.  So they just hodl it and from time to time buy/sell to keep it in the .2-.3 range.  
The big benefit to them is it will distribute hashpower away from BTC lowering the diff.  
It's a long story, but mining tech is sort of at a plateau.  10nm tech is insanely expensive to develop and will probably yield ~20TH @ 1200w.  Good, but not an order of magnitude better.  And with ALL the S9's A7's, and Ebit miners being produced, the BTC diff is skyrocketing.  If BTC were to stop shotting up like crazy and stay flat for 6 months, their miner sales would fall off a cliff as diff keeps creeping up without a corresponding price increase.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:53:41
They did actually plan this and time it just right though with the BCH diff fixing fork.
I would feel pretty confident that bitmain's holdings of BTC/BCH is well over a billion dollars.  They can move the price ALOT.  
But ultimately remember, BTC is what pays the bills at bitmain.  I think their goal here is to make BCH a viable alt, not just something miners mess with and flip to BTC.  Maybe bump ETH market cap out of  spot.  
If they try to flip BCH to be dominant over BTC it would take a TON of money (more than they have) and it would create a divide amongst users that would be bad for crypto (and by extension Bitmain).  
If they could get BCH into  spot, dump on ETH a bit, I think they'd call it good, and then everyone can focus on fixing the BTC scaling issue (or in reality the vulnerability to a TX spam attack without which the current 1mb segwit would work fine).
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:04:47
I don’t think there is a way to do this. But if you believe btc will go up why would you want to sell calls now.? The call price will be based on the current price and volatility. You really want to sell calls when you think the price will stay flat or decline and volatility is high.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:27:14
The problem I see is more the other way around.  People (in the real world) generally don't care if they overpay a bit if they are aware of what they are paying and get the desired result.  
  
So if your calculator tells them to spend 50 sat/byte for 1h confirmation and a bunch of blocks come through quickly and it would have cleared even if they had paid 10, they likely won't even know or care.  
The opposite is really a problem though.  If they pay for "next block" but no blocks come for 45 min or something and suddenly they are pushed back a few blocks.  THAT is usually the reason most estimators over-estimate.  Most people don't really want to know the finer points of how it all works and just want a fee that will work.

No, this is not a scam attempt.  This item is not co-mingled.  This is another customers return that amazon sent out as new.  It does happen.  Human error on the part of the returns grading workers.  
Basically when Amazon gets a return back the employee has to decide if it has been opened/used (in which case it gets sent back to the seller) or if it's new and ready to send back out to another buyer.  They can often make the wrong decision when processing so many returns per day - and likely not even knowing wtf a ledger is.

I hate this argument.  Buying $X of bitcoin is a gamble.  You are betting it will go up and not down.  
Buying a miner is an investment (although TBH 741's are a bad one right now).  You can calculate a ROI and how much income it will produce.
