You would control your email/server just as much as you control your Bitcoins or your Blockchain email.
If the government outlaws email, they can come take your server away.  If they outlaw Bitcoin, they can come take those away.  If they outlaw EncryptedEmailCoin^TM they could come take that away.
Blockchains don't circumvent government force in that capacity.


Absolutely!  Of course the value in that comes from the decentralized nature.  If China blocks all inbound BTC transactions, or the U.S. blocks all Block/RPC/SPV we'd have a problem.
Where Bitcoin shows some imporvement over tradiaional email (SMTP) is the ability to quickly and easily circumvent these blocks (mostly by sending the data to/through multiple other parties).
Which is why there are encrypted messaging solutions that mimic the traits of Bittorrent.
So yes, there are certainly projects out there that try to obtain that level of anti-censorship, without the compromise that would come with storing your emails in perpetuity on everyone's computer.

Why do you want email on the blockchain?  What is the point?
There is a seriously insane fad going on where everyone thinks that every technical process should now somehow include the blockchain.
The blockchain isn't a magical black box.  It has a specific purpose, with an indefinite amount of use cases.  But it doesn't not have an indefinite amount of purpose.
To summarize the Bitcoin blockchain simply, think of it like a massive Excel document.  It's one big document that everyone has a copy of (it get synchronized, securely).  "Bitcoins" get moved by putting entries into this Excel spreadsheet, that is acting as a ledger.  So the blockchain can be visualized, as such:
Sender | Receiver | Amount
Bob| Sam| 2.5
John| Bob| 1.0
We now know at the end of that "block" that Bob has 1.0 coins, and Sam has 2.5.
Now, additional data can certainly be included in the transactions, so you could include "emails" in there and even encrypt them so only the address owner can read them.  It's certainly technically possible, and it's obviously possible to create a different blockchain that is built for this purpose.
But why?  Why would you do this?  Is there a need that your emails be forever stored on a very massive amount of computing systems.  There is a reason our "excel" example above must be on everyone's system.  But does the email to your wife about picking up milk on the way home really need to be distributed to thousands of systems?
You risk the content eventually being decrypted too.  So there is in fact a real privacy concern as well.
If you are looking for the immutable aspect, you can achieve this with standard email cryptography.  Look into digital signatures and non-repudiation.
Finally, if you're still in search of some messaging capabilities built on the blockchain idea - have a look at BitMessage.

From a privacy standpoint, encryption (like PGP) over Gmail is just as secure, if not arguably more secure than the blockchain approach you've mentioned.
If your PGP key is compromised, only Google, and any intermediate servers, as well as the recipient servers/company can read your email. (Basically anyone who has a copy of the email)
In the case of your emailing existing on a public blockchain and your key being compromised, anyone can download your email at any point.  (Basically anyone with access to the blockchain: everyone)
Same is true for who you communicate with, except in the case of the blockchain, everyone can find out instead of just Google and friends, and obviously this doesn't depend on your key being compromised.


Not exactly true:  If you just use PGP over Gmail, then yes, Google owns you account.  If you run your own server, then you own it.


Interestingly enough, email is a perfect example of a decentralized system that has slowly become centralized.  You can run your own email server.  If you do so, you will control it entirely.


Yes, in fact there are other decentralized messaging systems that existed before the blockchain popularization as well.  Obviously, as I said email itself is decentralized, but there are other solutions as well.  So you're right, having communication platforms that are not controlled by centralized parties is certainly a valuable thing.  It's just not something that benefits from a distributed database (which is effectively what Bitcoin is).

I understand, and that's the great thing about Bitcoin, as I said, it provides options.  It would be pretty hard to send paper money to someone across the ocean (and cost prohibitive).  Face-to-face transactions are the only thing close to a person-to-person Bitcoin transaction.
You can choice to NOT use a bank account, not have credit, etc.  But you don't have to.  Some people will not want to run a wallet, of any kind.  Those people can store their BTC in a bank, just like USD or CAD, or EUR, GBP.


Well, there are so many other non-functional benefits that I think are just as, if not more, important.  Fiat currencies are massively manipulated by both the Governments and banks.  This will become a non-issue in the a Bitcoin future.  This includes the lack of inflation.

They can just use Coinbase as their processor. Coinbase already has this.
Seriously. I know Bitcoin is innovative, but it's not is foreign. These problems have bee solved.
Guess what, you can't pay Netflix (via reoccurring payments) if you don't have the money already. That is, unless you have credit - which you could easily just get in BTC verses USD.
Either way, Netflix would need and use a payment processor. Either you keep money or a line of credit within a system the payment processor can access.

While on the surface your comment may appear to be true, it's not entirely true.
With most Hypervisors (the virtualization platform) you can encrypt the VM image and files.  Anytime you did want to boot up your VM you'd need to enter a passphrase.  You could even utilize a passphrase with the OS installation (within that VM).
One option is a non-persistent VM, so long as you are using a lightweight Bitcoin client.  Of course, you can also run a Live CD within the VM guest, and then there are no residual files, nor persistent malware, to worry about.
With all of the tools/sharing disabled the host doesn't have direct access to the guest (from a userland/software perspective).  You'd want to be using hardware-assisted virtualization to reduce any direct kernel level interaction as well, but most modern systems support hardware-assisted virtualization by default now.
That all said, there is the risk of indirect access, VMI (virtual machine introspection) does exist.  The host can still monitor VM activities, even with hardware-assisted virtuilization.  [Research]( is underway to allow VM modification at the hypervisor level as well.
However, I'm not aware of any malware in the wild that has implemented VMI for data theft; and furthermore, none have implemented writable-VMI for the purpose of modifying Bitcoin transactions.
Really the biggest concern you should have for your VM data if the host is compromised is: keylogging.  But then, you're hopefully not typing out your private key, and even if an attacker does obtain your passphrase, without the private key, it'd be useless.


A LiveCD (or Bootable by any other means - USB, SD, etc) is certainly going to be more secure.  So I'm certainly not claiming a VM is more secure, or even as secure - simply that you can run a high-security guest within a low-security host.

Yes, of course they are.  But people outside of the US seem far less hung-up on credit cards.  Maybe it's the sample size of people I know, and confirmation bias, but they don't seem to have a culture based around purchases with credit cards.
If you're outside of the US, there are other exchanges, obviously I can't speak to the ease of use so broadly.


It was no more effort than PayPal.  Easier than a credit card application (if you don't already have a card).
The initial wait is the biggest hindrance.  But it's only four days, once.  (Then 30, for the next level - which I agree is insane).  But that's just waiting, the effort on the user's end is minimal.




Never say never.  But that aside, I'm not sure what your point is?  I never said Gyft was superior in every case over Credit Cards, Debit Cards, and Cash.  I gave a list of reasons why you'd want to use Bitcoin and Gyft.  Literally none of them stated it was "easier" or "more convenient" or "average joe proof."
* If you want to support Gyft, you might use them.
* If you want to support Bitcoin, you might use them.
* If you want to support Coinbase, you might use them.
* If you have Bitcoin and you want to spend them, you might use them.
* If you want to buy Bitcoin and spend them, to influence the market, you might use them.
* If you want to use Gyft points, you might use them.
* If you want to earn Gyft points, you might use them.
* If Gyft has a promotion, you might want to use them.
* If you have Bitcoin you want to 'cash out,' you might use them.
* *I'm sure we could come up with others...*
And seriously, Gyft is just a Gift Card vendor, that happens to accept Bitcoin (there are other Gift Card vendors, and others also take Bitcoin).  People, the "average joe," already buy Gift Cards.  Bitcoin can act as a currency, no different than USD, EUR, or any other currency out there.  Many companies are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.  And some companies are starting to offer Bitcoin as a compensation option (payroll).
If Bitcoin continues onward, the future will result in many people, and possibly even the "average joe" having Bitcoin.  And the "average joe" is still going to buy "aunt sally" a Gift Card for Christmas.
The one issue I tend to have with the average viewpoint is that Bitcoin _has_ to replace the banking industry.  Guess what, they can co-exist.  It's far more likely the Banking Industry accepts, and adopts Bitcoin.  You have a bank account that holds Bitcoin.  You have a Visa credit card that's balance and currency is Bitcoin, and that you owe a payment of Bitcoin on.  People still have loans, and credit, etc.
The great thing, is in such a world, the "average joe" get's a lot of the Bitcoin benefits - like instantly buying his Gyft cards, or instant remittance.  It's like cash, but can be used online.
In that world, this would certainly be an option for the average joe.

It's vague, at best.  But still, I believe clear enough.
A company dealing with Bitcoin is not to "invest" or "store" their earnings and profits in Bitcoin.  I think we can use "store" and "invest" interchangeable in this single case, as Bitcoin is an investment capital, not a currency, as far as they are concerned.
This however, does NOT mean they cannot hold Bitcoin.  It's just an asset at that point.  The company would have a certain "stock" of Bitcoin for day-to-day business.
But just like McDonald's doesn't store it's capital value in burger patties, Bitcoin companies (following this regulation) wouldn't be allowed to hold their capital value in Bitcoin.
Which is beyond insane.

I've had this discussion recently, there are basically four criteria for something to be a currency.

Many think PayPal will be the first large, main-stream, Digital Payment/Money Transmitter to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon.  And truth be told, if PayPal want's to stay cutting-edge and relevant, they likely will give Bitcoin a try at some point in the not-too-distant-future.
But this is a perfect opportunity for Amazon to steal some of that wind from PayPal's sales (pun intended).

This requires the person to have a credit card, when using a debit (or check) card, your actual money is tied up.


I'm likely going to sit down and formalize this in the future, and post it; but:  It amazes me how many perks people attribute to Bitcoin that is available with any fiat currency.  "No chargebacks" is my favorite, I'd love to know how a chargeback works with physical US dollars.
If Bitcoin is treated as a currency and your bank is willing to hold it, and is willing to give you a line of credit for some amount of interest - it would all work like credit cards do now.  You'd be given a line of credit based on your credit history, you'd owe the credit card company/bank an amount of money once a month, etc, etc.  Then only your credit (Bitcoin) would be tied up at a Hotel.
I'm certainly not saying Bitcoin doesn't have benefits over fiat - it's clear that Crypto Currencies run circles around Fiat and the current banking system - it's just that Bitcoin gives additional choice, it doesn't HAVE to replace the current banking system, and I think it's naive to think it will.

Good point, and I actually do check to ensure the public key matches the address.  My short answer is I want to ensure you don't make a mistake when you enter the data.  But I could easily be convinced to just ask for the public key.


Totally agreed, I need to do some serious "documentation" writing for newer users.  Signing the raw transactions is a fairly technical process, just as obtaining your public key isn't an overly easy or obvious step.

No - I listed various possibilities.


That's not true.  Plenty of cards have 3% cash back - yes.  But not everyone, and not everyone even has a credit card.  Just because you personally have access to 3% cashback on a credit card doesn't mean that everyone does.
I can tell you many of the offers I see have restrictions on what you can and cannot get the cashback bonus on, and the bonus amounts vary on purchase type.


So you're entirely discrediting the fact that some people have a LOT of Bitcoin and might be willing to spend it on luxury items?
I'm aware many people are holding Bitcoin long-term, but just like cash, sometimes you have to spend your money.


Some people don't have access to credit cards.  Some people pay fees on their cards.  Etc.  Using Bitcoin is like using cash and _can_ be cheaper for some people, compared to Credit/Debit.  As for why they used Bitcoin over cash, I think that's self-explanatory.


If you've used Gyft for any big ticket items (bought a bunch of stuff on Farther's Day from Home Depot?), you'll want to use those saved points at some point.  And that's going to require you to spend more through Gyft (vicious cycle).

The biggest diffference is that those companies typically tell you that they are only offering BTC-based purchases in the US.  Or at the very least, you can very quickly confirm that it's US only.
Xapo has been talking about this card for a long time (in Bitcoin years) and even provided signups, registrations, etc.  They could have easily explained that the US wouldn't be allowed now or ever, or whatever the case may be.
Instead you're told you're going to get something on X date, X day comes and goes, you're then told Y date, only to find out you may never get it ad if you do, it won't be until at least Z date.
I'm not discounting out non-US friends who miss out on great vendors offering Bitcoin based deals, but it's a bit different in this one case.

Just because people don't have or use a credit card does not mean they have bad credit.  One more common reason is having 'no credit,' a common issue for the younger users.  But some people just don't believe in credit.


Meh.  Read below.  I'm not sure if you've ever bought BTC with Coinbase, but after the initial verification I can tell you 100% that it's far easier than finding a credit card offer and filling out their form, and waiting for the card, and...seriously, it took longer to write this than to buy Bitcoin with Coincase.


Well, in the US (and I assume we're talking about the US here, with the continual talk of credit cards), Coinbase makes it SUPER simple to buy Bitcoin.  With "Instant" purchases, you can purchase Bitcoin, buy the Gyft card, and rebuy your Bitcoin (if you want) all from the Gyft mobile app in a minute or less.  It's actually very easy.  And I hate cash (especially) coins, so I'd consider it easier.
Edit:  "One more common reason" - should be read as "An additional, and common, reason."  I'm not claiming 'no credit' is more or less common than 'bad credit,' just that both are reasons you might be without credit.

Well, digital transfers are much more convoluted for the general populas.  Banks, exchanges, and even retailers have plenty of easily accessible tools.  But it's a bit more involved for me to send you money if you're on the other side of the country.
Things like Paypal require us both to have Paypal, both of us to have current accounts linked.  And it requires Paypal to actually process the transaction.
Wire transfers are also an involved process, requiring much higher fees, and a delay.

Actually, I don't know if it has been proven (though mathematically it has to be somewhat true, 128MB is going to take longer to transmit than 1MB, but that doesn't mean the difference is substantial enough to be relevant).
Though even if it were untrue, perception is reality. People think it's true. And miners are commonly leaving tx fees on the table.
So if we find that it's essentially not true, we need to reeducate.

@_date: 2015-08-26 21:13:58
Just use Moore's Law.
Currently you can get a 1TB hard-drive for approximately $50.
That puts a 6TB drive in 2024 at $50.  And let's be honest, even that seems high, when a 6TB hard-drive today can be had for about $200.
Just using the current 6TB drive price, $200, in 2024 would net you a 36TB hard-drive.
It's hardly _$315/year_ worth of data a year.  Looks to be closer to $50 at worse.

I agree that there are many risks involved with the voting method, but I don't think a decrease in the block maximum is necessarily a bad thing (if done at the right time, for the right reasons).

@_date: 2015-08-27 17:19:40
Because it's equally a problem now.  People have actually thought about padding in the past.  I think this min/max provides a reasonable balance.
The problem the miners actually have an advantage or incentive to mine small blocks.  So even with massive growth and a massive block size, miners are still likely to choice to mine smaller blocks.  Which means massive delays (at scale) in transaction confirmation times.
This puts all the miners on an even playing field (whereas, at the moment, they are only on an even playing field when mining an completely empty block).  It also ensures that a certain volume of transactions are being processed when available (as the miners are simply going to include them for the tx fees).

@_date: 2015-08-27 16:08:18
Well, one of the problems is miners may still continue to mine smaller blocks, to avoid propagation latency.  So even if the block size was unlimited, the miners currently have an incentive to mine smaller blocks.  This solves that as well.

I won't speak about the specific security or risk of any particular software wallet.
Your transaction are cryptographically secure, they are in fact read and transmitted through lots of nodes.
While that means your transaction cannot really be altered. There are still some risks, like the transaction not being forwarded (censorship) -or- you getting invalid data from the blockchain (SPV clients, in general may be at risk).

**And I missed the point/joke in your message, that's what I get for half-reading on mobile.  Oh well, I'll leave the rest below because I took the time to do the math.**
Well, chances are extremely high that you won't be alive by the point in which all BTC has been mined.  Regardless you're view seems shortsighted.
Let's do some quick math:
The [GWP]( is ~$75 trillion.  Assuming the entire world uses Bitcoin, we use GWP to represent all currency, and an even 21 million total BTCs are mined.  A single BTC would be valued over 3.5 million USD.  That would value a single satoshi at ~$0.03.  Which is less granularity than we have today.  And of course that depends on the GWP not increasing by ~2140, which is unlikely.
Now if we use the total wealth of the world, we get an even larger extreme:  The total world wealth seems to be estimated around ~$250 quadrillion.  Putting a single BTC at about ~$12 billion.  Giving us a single satoshi valued at about $120.00.  So much for buying something off the dollar menu at McD, unless you're super hungry.
Not only would the divisibility be less than what we have today, you're missing a huge potential for more divisibility than what we have today.  With technology and automation we have the potential for things to require less than the value of a single penny.  Think of seriously low value micro transactions.
So...while we wouldn't need such a protocol change any time soon, it's not like there could never be a justification.
