Capital gains taxes apply when you “realize” the benefits. I don’t believe you are obligated to pay taxes on transactions between wallets however once you purchase or exchange your bitcoin for something of value if your bitcoin has increased in value you owe taxes on that.
Keep good records on your costs. There’s been some previous discussion on proper ways and tax approaches including to make sure you are following FIFO when determining what bitcoin at what cost is associated with what exchange. V complicated and this is not professional advice I suggest you do additional research and/or talk to a tax whiz.

Do not try and break the walls, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth... there are no walls. Then you'll see that it is not the wall that breaks, it is only yourself.

The correction is happening now... needs to continue correcting to its proper lunar level.

Shhh... don’t talk in growth rate terms. That’s only important when I want to think about like how much did I lose or gain relative to my position (who cares about that amirite?!) When we get to $100k I expect new 101k, 102k, 103k, etc. shitposts every minute. That’s like 95% of the fun of this wild ride to the moon!

I know I can’t wait to be on the dark side of the moon.
