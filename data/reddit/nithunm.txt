He explains it pretty well [in this text here.](
TLDR: He used a decent amount of his bitcoins to keep himself afloat while he went to conferences. He made it his full-time job and didn't get much money elsewhere.

Ethereum has higher market cap than bcash and the fees aren't all that high. (I don't know the exact difference in fees.)

Why not use IOTA or any crypto with low fees if that's the most important part of choosing bcash over bitcoin?

Wouldn't people sell with a lot of FUD like around the time of the China news? 
Moving money away from BTC to fiat would make sense when there is uncertainty in the market.

Because it sounds too good to be true and people in general are suspicious. In hindsight they were wrong but it's easier to take the less risky route whenever possible.

It just seemed odd to me that BTC reached ATH with so much FUD going on. Maybe Segwit2x is too far in the future?

While I agree with the rest, I'm pretty sure gambling is rigged in the owners' favour so they can keep making money while a lucky few gamblers benefit from it. Bitcoin doesn't have any such system and is more like the stock market.

Not sure what the exact definitions are but I wouldn't consider the stock market a gamble because there is an element of skill to predicting the market. In the same way I'd say that day-trading/holding Bitcoin is something that you can do research on to predict the future of it.
In that case a trust index or even putting money in your bank could also be a gamble because of the slight chance of something happening to it. Heck even having money on your person would be a gamble because someone could steal it from you.

Bitcoin is not a gamble because you can just set a stop-loss and walk away from it. never losing more than whatever you set your stop loss at. At most you lose some of it to fees but you are entirely in control of how much of a loss you want to risk and when to take it out.

That's what they want you to think! /s
