Even the media will tell the truth if there is money to be made. It doesn't mean you should trust it.
This guy is only revealing what is obvious. We've known that the NSA installs backdoors at all major service providers. These revelations are just confirmation of the obvious. It's just the stupid Americans that can't put two and two together until they hear it out of the mouth of some MSNBC media whore.

A commander and one foot soldier are left on the battlefield facing an army of the 1000. The commander yells, "hold spartans!" The foot soldier, not being a moron, kills the commanding officer as a gesture of surrender and lives to see another day.
Moral of the story: if you're going to be a pawn you should at least know when to move diagonally.

Article is stupid. The bubble could have very well burst at $36 like it did way back when. Nobody knows how large the bubble is going to be, or when it's going to pop, but when it does, a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.
In hindsight it seemed like these people were wise, but what real motivation did they have to believe it was going to go that high and not immediately crash? There was Bitcoin hype back then too. You don't know what the expected payoff is going be. 7x 8x 100x. Who the fuck knows? But if you buy at 250 now you are going to need it to go to 500 just to double your investment.
It's like a Ponzi scheme at this point. The late-commers to this exponential bubble are going to lose everything. Those who get out might make some money off the losers, but its all just a big gamble at this point because all it takes is a sufficiently large sell to trigger more selling. If the demand is high enough some buys might go out to stabilize, but if not, more sells will result creating an unstoppable crash.
One thing is certain. The crash will be epic and find its way into economic books.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:06:16
The greater the climb, the higher the fall. And as soon as a large sell goes through, others will quickly follow because the risk of not selling before any potential bubble pop will be too high. It's going to be a nuclear bubble pop that will leave economists rolling with laughter on the floor.
When Bitcoin was rising moderately I had some faith it might actually work. But this exponential growth rate removed all confidence. It's impossible to sustain, and all the people coming in are not in it for the long haul.

I want to see how MtGox handles the flurry of sell orders when Bitcoin does crash. Maybe it will jam up to the point where it can't crash at all.

If Israel is allowing Bitshekels when they have a firm control the US dollar through their control Federal Reserve, you should reason that something is up with your beloved Judencoin.
Anyone have any theories as to why the Judes seem to love Bitcoin, a currency which could theoretically harm the dollar?
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:22:18
The Judes don't want a competing currency which keeps them from robbing you stupid goys dry. The truth is that we don't need their system. It is their system which is Judencontrolled by the Federal Reserve which keeps you in perpetual wage slavery while they buy lavish yachts off of your hard work.
Hitler was right, people. Learn about how the Nazis subverted the Judencurrencies, and why he had to be removed by the Ziofascist moneylenders and their brutish mass-murdering puppets like Roosevelt and Churchhill. Once you understand this truth, all the facts begin to make sense. National Socialism would have resulted in a golden age not only for Nazi Germany, but for the entire world. But, the overwhelming power of the brainwashed goy masses stopped Hitler and his superior system from  dramatically improving the entire world.
And now spend your life making other people wealthy as you can barely afford to keep up with your mortgage payments. The Judenbankers have you by the fucking balls and you are too brainwashed into following to the political correctness script to stop it.
Well, I know who I salute. I salute the man who sacrificed every ounce of himself to take a country from ashes into a world superpower. One of the most lied about people in the pages of Ziohistory. One of the greatest men to have ever lived: Adolf Hitler. Once you understand his system, and once you dispel the lies of these filthy thieving kikes and their degenerate goy monkey slaves, will you truly understand what the Nazis were about.
It's tragic really. The collective world has entered a new dark age that will last for hundreds of years. An era of economic collapse and technological stagnation. The problems will surmount the solutions. Had Hitler won, we would have been entering a new era of enlightenment by now. Not dealing with social and economic issues that had been addressed a hundred years ago. Such a tragedy.

I've been following this channel because I wanted to be there when the bubble popped. I have no Bitcoin investment apart from some free Bitcoin some guy gave me 2 years ago so I better cash out and buy that sandwich before I can't even afford a Mexican candy.
Trolololo.... It's always fun to see people who try to make money speculating (gambling and theft) lose out. I'm laughing so hard right now that I can't even do my work.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:16
It's kinda hard to believe people like feldspar17 can't simulate the outcome in their head when it's fairly obvious it's going to crash down to rock bottom. Sure, someone might try to make a large buy order to save it, and it its big enough they might stop it, but Bitcoin lacks confidence and after this people will start looking for exit strategies. You need confidence to keep the bubble going.
Even though I know it DID have some inherent value prior to this crash, it will have none after. Nobody will believe in Bitcoin after this, at least not for a long time. This crash will find its way into introductory economics textbooks.
At the core this is the pirates dilemma. You have 4 pirates. Each pirate can double his take by killing the pirate next to him before the other pirate kills him. The safest way is if no pirate kills any other, but the payoff is less lucrative. And what happens when one greedy pirate kills another? The rest lose confidence in diplomacy and start killing.
A person putting out a large sell order is equivalent to a pirate killing the one next to him.
At the end of the day though, it's all up to the big money guys and how they decide to behave. Everyone else just goes along for the ride.

When the bubble crashes many people are going to be out of a lot of money. 
Just remember, you're not producing anything of value when you trade. You're basically playing a game of chicken and the winner gets the money of the loser.

Zionist Jews control the USD and they are corrupting it to the point that people are beginning to think about alternate currencies. Eventually these Jews will come-a-knockin' to Bitcoins door. Chuck Schumer, the Zionist Jewbag piece of shit, is already calling for the US government to fuck over Bitcoin.
Bitcoins value is skyrocketing because the Zionists are behind the curve. Anytime you remove Jews from the system, the health of the economy increases. This is why they have been kicked out of so many countries.
They are like the Freemasons. They collude to line their pockets while destroying the economic system that sustains us non-Jews. We need a new right-wing movement to rise up and stop these Zionist scumbags from raping our economy through the central banking system.

I'm so going to laugh when Bitcoin crashes unexpectedly and you all realize that is was being pumped by a few wealthy colluders who are probably Jewish.
Actually, I am going to laugh now. I'll laugh then too. You silly goyim are going to be had, big time. Nothing, I mean nothing, rises in value like Bitcoin has UNLESS it's a scam. It's not even speculation. It is a tightly coordinated SCAM.
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:49:54
No, I ask myself the question, "is it economically advantageous for this frequently lying shitbag to be telling the truth in this instance?" It has nothing to do with trust. I don't trust the MSM, even when they do tell the truth somewhat.
The MSM do what they do not because they work for the government. They do what they do because they gain economically from being the government mouthpiece. White House press passes are only given to the media outlets that act favorably towards the current administration. Shit stirrers without a reputation or a large powerful organization behind them don't get access, even if they are credible and honest news agencies.

I need you to make a follow up statement.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:23:40
Some guy gave me a $.50 worth of Bitcoin when it was at $30. Now I can afford a meal.
Speculation is evil, anyways. I got the evil out of me when I was younger and decided to get into AllAdvantage bots. Pulled in $800 in a month with no initial investment. Brought it to school in 20s and flashed it to the girls.
I really don't like easy money. It corrupts. It gives you a fever that's hard to get rid of. Money not earned through appropriately valued labor just doesn't feel satisfying or wholesome. Which is probably why so many people lose their easy money so easily.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:27:54
If you look at the charts you will see that the sells happen on Thursdays and Fridays and bubbles back on Mondays. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that the government likes to screw through legislations on Fridays. Or perhaps people are more pessimistic by the end of the work week.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:18:35
Because hockey sticks always fall off sharply after the rise. Please ignore the latent variables behind the curtain. 
Bitcoin will continue to rise because there is a demand that shows no immediate signs of wearing off. Everytime Bitcoin goes up, the rest of world hears about it through the Internet, causing it to go up even further. Eventually when supply stabilizes with demand it will stop going up. It's easy to obtain, easy to transfer, easy to use.
That's not going to happen anytime soon. Once people in China start buying up Bitcoin the prices will skyrocket. We're talking in the 1000 here. Probably even higher. The only way this could not happen is if:
large government steps in and legislate the fuck out of Bitcoin, or some critical flaw in the Bitcoin is discovered (currently the block chain is the weakest link because it's not scaling well at all).
So with that said, who knows. Bitcoin is such a volatile currency. It can go to astronomic heights or it can crash magnificently. The truth is that we need a currency like Bitcoin. It gets us away from the government and those corporations that have been killing small business with fees.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:34:53
You know, I was fairly certain it was going to spike when it started going up around $40 and news was traveling round the Internet. People tend to like investing in things that they don't understand that seem new and exciting.
But it's speculation which is just gambling. To make money speculating someone else needs to lose. It's not really an honest way to spend time or make money. I've been down the road of scamming to make money, and it robs you of your time and gives you a fever for green. It's not honest and wholesome, and symptomatic of societies constant need to make money without doing anything.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:11:13
It doesn't matter. Money like the USD is like government stock. As long as the country does well, and has a good military to ensure stability, the stock does well.

Hypothetical situation here. You have two people with 50 Bitcoins each, and they exhaustively control the Bitcoin supply. What do those two do to turn those Bitcoins into something which they can exchange for goods and services? How do they do it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:36:57
See, it's Monday. Look at the price. It will continue to rise till until around Thursday/Friday. 
Eventually the bubble will burst. It's obviously being pumped by one or a few big players, and eventually they will cash out. It will be very entertaining to see everyones reaction as it drops back down to nothing.
How soon? Who knows. A lot of people are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon so it might be a while. Maybe it'll even a reach $1000 before the big crash. Definitely possible.
But let's face it. The Bitcoin architecture is fundamentally flawed and shitty. It has no real way of becoming a widely used virtual currency. The platform simply doesn't scale well at all, not to mention the fact that those exchanges will likely be shutdown by the government.
Bitcoin will not survive. No way in hell.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:34:57
They're definitely going to be laughing at the historical Bitcoin Crash of 2013. I mean seriously, this is a textbook example of speculation. Exponential growth. I mean you have to be stupid to think that it's going to just level off at some point.

What are you, stupid? You better sell before you lose it all, retards. By now people have already started investing heavily in Bitcoin. They know that they have too much to lose if they stay in it. They will start selling, trigging more sales. The higher it climbs the greater the risk of the fall.
Once again I reiterate the message, Bitcoin is stupidity stock. As long as stupidity remains high Bitcoin will inflate. At some point though people will realize you can't do shit with Bitcoin and begin exchanging. This is the enlightenment phase. Stupidity begins to drop, people begin to sell, causing others to sell, until the crash. Nobody is going to buy, the sell orders will be placed ridiculously low, nobody will still buy, they'll go even lower. And you know what? Nobody will still buy. Why? Because Bitcoin has a very limited ACTUAL value and why would you buy something which is in the stages of a crash when you have no idea what it's going to crash to? Who is going to buy it? It's not like gold where you know it has some inherent stable value.
I am going to wager that by Monday Bitcoin will be under $50. There is simply nothing behind Bitcoin but speculators who have NO REASON to be holding onto Bitcoin other than to turn a quick profit. They should have called it Ponzicoin in honor of its dubious exponential growth properties.
If I had invested I would have gotten out as soon is the exponential growth became apparent. That is a big, red flag. Bitcoin does have some inherent value as an exchange medium, but that's about it. It's not stable enough to conduct sales with. It doesn't scale well enough. It takes too long to process transactions. There is risk of government intervention. Bitcoin will end up as nothing more than an experiment. Too many flaws as a currency. You can bet the farm on that.
I did learn an important lesson from all this, though. A good currency needs regulation by a central authority. People are shitheads and are perfectly ok to destroy an entire economy to fill their pockets a bit more. An unregulated currency like Bitcoin is simply too easy to manipulate. Currency is like government stock. A strong government ensures a strong currency. There may have been legitimate Bitcoin users, but the speculators ruined any potential for Bitcoin to be a widely used currency.

Bitcoin is a stupidity stock. The more stupidity the more it's value increases. But at some people people will become smart enough to realize there really isn't much they can really do with idle Bitcoin and they will sell, triggering a huge flurry of sells.
Only perpetual stupidity can keep Bitcoin value up.

Yea, but at least CC companies will maybe protect you if someone steals your CC info.
With Bitcoin there is no security or insurance. You lose your wallet, you're fucked.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:59:46
Notice the "maybe" part. Insurance is like that. They will find every way to disqualify you for big claims.
It doesn't mean that they are completely ineffective, although often you lose money through insurance anyways unless you know something about your risk that they don't know.
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:41:49
And now we see why Bitcoin could never work. Every viable currency needs a military behind it. If all of sudden people were to start using Bitcoin, a huge restructuring of power around the globe would occur. The status quo intends to stay the status quo and will destroy Bitcoin long before it takes off by locking down the exchanges and litigating against any retailers which accept it.
You need to protect your money tree with force.
