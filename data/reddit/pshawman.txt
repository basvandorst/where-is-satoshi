I Bpay (CBA) to Coinjar Mon-Thurs and it's in the next day.  How is it taking days for some people?
BTC-Markets also just lost their last real bank account (BoQ).  They are using POLi now too.
As far as I can see it will just limit the amount of fraudulent transfers hitting them.
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:20:26
$500,000 of BTC since May 2014.  That cannot be right.
@_date: 2015-06-24 01:49:04
Verified, back to normal.
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:28:17
No problem mate.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:33:33
I got mine a few days ago, from that free batch they offered.  I can't see myself using it.  Just wanted it to show mates.
Did just notice the 'inactivity fee', seems i'll have to kill it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:44:33
They can't even implement basic security practises.  I hope they are gone within the decade.
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:08:02
I just noticed on Comparebitcoins 'Patrick M' is now missing from the text about the owners.  Only Rick D is left there.  How did you hear about this news?
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:56:43
AU$ 900
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:48:45
God that sounds so easy.

I haven't been able to reliably connect for 8 hours.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:46:06
Same experience here.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:47:28
The site has been on and off for 8 hours.  I also have coins not credited yet.  I've seen this happen once before.  They turned up.
But goodbye to a day of BTC profits.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:43:46
Live in Brisbane, first i've heard about it.  
PS: First day is at Customs House.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:13:58
If it was really known, i'm pretty sure you would've linked to some source.
@_date: 2014-11-14 07:24:08
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:26:15
I hope they are also expanding their staffing levels.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:29:26
This why the price is dropping atm?
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:12:55
Just pulled my 2 BTC from cryptsy instantly with no delays.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:54:07
Yeah, they are happy to take your money.  And to let you buy coins.  
Then you find out withdrawals are capped at 0.05BTC/day unless verified.
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:28:33
The guy who runs this site is such a BTC pimp.  Helping all us Aussies out.
@_date: 2014-11-02 05:19:34
FTFY One bitcoin is 1/13.4millionth slice of the $4.4 billion market cap.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:37:12
This is exactly what it is right?  I can't wait to have an option that isn't eBay with their rip off fees.  And utilises my favourite thing, bitcoin.
I put in AU$3.  I know, I know don't blow all my btc at once.
Also when is a final release slated?  I see a beta is open but haven't figured out how to get on board on my WIN PC.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:56:23
Just posted about it on twitter.
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:41:14
Cheers mate.
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:30:02
It's also a DOGE ATM now!
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:23:34
Looks nice as!  Is there any price alarm mechanism?
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:02:27
It was the constant need to be staring at my computer or phone screen that killed day-trading for me after 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:41:46
Any representatives of the iGot exchange present?  
They advertise they are the first UAE exchange.  Not sure if they're correct.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:34:04

If there are still people using Paypal, you should probably do a charge back, just so the seller can learn this lesson early.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:48:55
The typical response is the coins were in cold storage.
@_date: 2017-02-20 09:32:46
Mine never worked, card wouldnt turn on.
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:31:43
I didn't even know one could 'review' a round chunk of silver...  The article played out pretty much as expected in that regard.
@_date: 2015-05-23 10:39:07
See if you have problems with verification.  I signed up and was rejected.  Independant Reserve declined to give me a reason.  Even though I successfully signed up at every other Australian BTC exchange.
@_date: 2014-09-19 03:26:38
Who the fuck up voted this?
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:14:21
Is there a site or app that can show local BTM's and list their Buy/Sell prices?
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:21:29
Same, using a high quality USB cable.  I dunno what OP is on about cause i actually use my trezor every day.  And it's been down twice in the last 2 months for me.
You have problems, close and re-open your browser.
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:58:20


 Shits on that site.
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:38:17
Cheaper BTC on Local Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:55:27
They were excellently priced a month ago.  Now their price is up about $8 per coin which has hurt.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:23:29
I figured as much, fkin Apple... says the guy who buys their shit.  
Bet you can do it on Android right?
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:57:30
Please get an API.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:34:12
WOW, found one of iGots founders on reddit.  Sweet.
PS.  Waiting on a BTC withdrawal ;)

I'll send a bitcoin to mycelium now if you give us a timeframe. Desperately need this. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:56:02
If you really want to know the answer to this you got to hit up 
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:49:40
I've had BTC withdrawals instantly processed today.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:14:30
Can iOS apps cause an alarm to go off anytime the price rises or falls outside of defined bounds.
This is the app I have been looking for but have never found.  At the moment I have bitcoinwisdom.com alarm on my PC during the night which is enough to wake me up.
If I had similar on iOS that could alert me during the day that would be fantastic.
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:53:39
I fkin wish, someone steal this idea and make it.  For the good of bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:47:58
With limits on new users and such you can negate most of this.  I still pull my coins at the end of every day.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:22:49
NEED LOCAL TRADER INCLUDED.  Please.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:55:19
I would love to have LocalTrader access on iOS.

Oh shit, sorry.

Cheers mate. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:53:53
You the guy who put up the $100k of buy orders?
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:51:15
They often tell me the 24 hour delay was due to retrieving coin from cold storage.
I told Jules if it takes that long it's TOO cold.
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:57:14
I've found that Coinjar's buy will look good on  but when I head over to the site.  There will be 0.3 BTC at the cheap price and the rest are much higher.
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:50:45
What kind of data use would leaving a full node running for 24 hours use?
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:44:51
And it's back.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:30:07
Some days I can withdraw instantly.  Next day will take 18 hours.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:45:02
Working again now.

@_date: 2015-01-17 09:24:24
Whats the app up to, it's breaking peoples what?
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:54:30
Im pretty sure iGot would argue this point.
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:49:59
Yeah you did.  When you tried to use a different account for follow up trades AFTER initially using an account in your REAL NAME.
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:00:41
Mine is so tight I have to force it round. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:47:14




It's good.
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:46:14
More info please:
Link me to the other traders profile, and specifically the ad you had used for the trade.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:22:43
None. lol, nice try
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:17:26
This is what is known as a "man in the middle' deal.  This is not allowed by localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:02:50
We're selling at that down here.
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:45:03


He probably did say continue, assuming that the account you will use is in your LBTC REAL-NAME as prior.  When the transfer hit, with a different name, red flags popped.  The trader did the right thing.


This is how you are supposed to operate on LBTC.  Start a trade with someone with a high reputation, a trusted seller.  If you were depositing cash then i would question the ID requirements.
Example: In Australia the banks have for YEARS required traders to do AML/KYC hence the ID request.  Recently almost all the big traders ALSO request ID for cash.
Platform verifications on LBTC are useless, hence why the trader didn't accept that and requested to sight the ID himself.
I would guess that you were purchasing BTC with compromised accounts belonging to other people.  As in you were laundering money you naughty criminal.
Be thankful that you haven't lost any of your own money, since I doubt it was yours.  Move on, and build a name for yourself as a respected and trusted professional.  It is infinitely more rewarding.
You'll feel like less of a piece of shit too. Win Win

The data is supposedly from USD ad's.  Im also not seeing them in the wild.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:21:14
It happens occasionally.  Staff  just need time to fix it, it'll move.
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:59:04
Just so everyone can maintain hope. I got my remaining 18BTC out a few days ago. Fingers crossed for all. 
Rick and iGot have had major issues of late, in the end I was finally looked after.  I hope he comes through for everyone !
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:38:19
I advertised another site once within my ad.  They turned off the ad and requested it was removed.  Wasn't held up from trading at all.  
I'd guess that's not why.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:27:39
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:55:58
The lawyer?
Helpful how?
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:28:28
Unless you have a crystal ball this is not good advice.
BB's is much better: Just don't invest what you cant afford to lose!

On this site.  It's an awesome comparison site for Aussies.  For a long time iGots BTC price was excellent.  
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:00:40
Coiny is great.  Support Australian sellers on an Australian site.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:46:12
So whoever you asked to trade outside dobbed you into LBTC staff?
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:58:45
Downvotes for confirming at least some operations are still running at iGot...
@_date: 2015-08-12 05:23:07
The fees are nuts on Swipe.

You just putting it here too for visibility?
@_date: 2015-07-08 09:04:52
Heaps of stand up peeps over there.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:13:37
This sounds like you're saying KYC/AML compliant exchanges are 'regulated'.   Just for anyone reading past, that's incorrect.  You could still lose all your coins on any exchange at anytime.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:15:11


You think anyone would use anything but those respected exchanges if we could help it?
The world is not America, here in Australia we have access to NONE of those entities.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:23:04
@_date: 2016-09-03 01:25:43
How about 0.5% worldwide as the new base.  That would be nice.
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:02:28
Third line of the article:

Yay another phone...

They were the cheapest, and functional for a while.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:57:31
If you worked with 15000 people do you think you would like everyone of them.  38:15000 is an excellent ratio.

Monday to Thursday it is, outside of that nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-03-26 09:05:33
I did comment on the original thread in Auscoin that head office banned them from using it currently.
Edit:  It was Totally annoying having 2 competing Australian Bitcoin subs.
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:02:24
OMFG iOS version would make Local Trader explode for sure.  This should be  on the to-do list.
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:57:34

@_date: 2017-05-26 00:10:45

@_date: 2015-10-28 10:24:19
No argument, Coinjar is shit.  And operated by a prior bad actor within the BTC community.
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:16:22
You ever used one of those 'Cash and Cheque' In ATMs?  You put a wad in, it's counted then dumped into a pile with the rest.  As if they're gonna be able to track back.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:46:28
When mytrezor.com goes down, or doesn't set fee right, or handles malleability badly or the next issue it doesn't effect you moving your coin.
Also their support has been shit lately.
@_date: 2015-10-05 01:32:21
I concur, just imported my trezor into multibit.  Much easier than importing to electrum.
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:33:55
So you didn't lose money.  You just didn't get the benefit.
@_date: 2015-03-01 00:17:00
As a guy who sent money there quite recently I can confirm '3-4 days'.  Im not just pulling these numbers out of nowhere.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:06:03
Oh look random person who's not OP.  Honest people tend to stick together.  I guess that's why you're here banging on by yourself.
@_date: 2015-10-07 10:29:17
After mytrezor andelectrum, now i'm on Multibit HD.  Easily the best I think.
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:23:31
So you post the same thread, twice from different accounts?  How does this help your credibility?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:09:52
This is bullshit. Nice try Douche. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 10:49:38
I just kept in contact with Rick.  Was a while ago now.  I trust you realise this.  All the best.   If I can help, let me know.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:21:57
I had issues with them today not having an up to date chain and therefore transactions not showing.  Something is up.
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:25:58
At least the deposits and buys were fast on iGot.  The withdrawing was their issue. :p
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:16:44
Feels like you kinda fell into this 'dude's a scammer' reasoning.  Don't worry man we're all still BTC bros.
Also you'd profit from the CC company, and that is fine!

Oh yeah, just run up a new utility...
