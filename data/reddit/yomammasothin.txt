I’ll put 100 dollars on amazon and 100 dollars on Google. I’m already a few bucks into Bitcoin. We’ll talk again when my not yet born son or daughter turns 18 and I ship them off onto their lives paying for it with my Bitcoin and blue chip savings. Whichever one is ahead, I’ll either be saying “I TOLD that paulej guy what’s what”, OR, I’ll be saying “why the hell didn’t I just put it all on that stock that guy told me, now you’re going to get a job, descendant number 1”.
Cannot wait.

I’m putting in what I can afford to lose. I don’t usually invest in something that’s not me, meaning new knowledge or tools.

What's the math behind that?

Oh ok now I get your original comment. 
I asked you because I (a newcomer hodler) had a discussion with a frienemy (speculative online day trader) about the market cap and the value of bitcoin if all currency operates through it. He spoke of 2500 dollars. And it seemed like you were saying just that and I panicked. 
Btw my math says around 2.5 million per coin if all money goes into capitalization. A very rough estimate.

This is the truth. My investment is not a lot of money now. Not worth an attempted robbery.

While you're buying, you're holding the rest of your coin.

Why doesnt it cause a spike in BTC first?

I bought at 1000 and at 2100, I'm no example. It took me long enough, and it took a lot of people fucking up "selling 10 % of apple stock at $800" style to get to 1000. It's going to go to unbelievable heights, whatever we can get is a lot right now. At least that's my bet.
So thanks again. You are the guys walking around with a brick cell phone that gives you cancer so I can bet on a mobile company in 1993 and wait until I'm older to give those shares to my kid so he can get a house.
