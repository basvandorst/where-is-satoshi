I mentioned this below, but we're wary of the Kickstarter model because we feel like they're sometimes cheating people.  It's using a loophole to allow crowdfunding without giving people any stake in the project.  
In an ideal world, we'd have a system to distribute shares to the Bitcoin investors.  We'd send them BTC to a pre-designated Bitcoin account.  But we're pretty sure that's not legal in the US right now.  But man, building a smart contract for distribution of funds to addresses would be impressive.
Giving out t-shirts for 50 dollars or the opportunity to be on set seems hacky to us. Maybe not though.  Maybe folks prefer those things.  
We also think that the press of a (hopefully) successful show would increase the awareness and value of Bitcoin.  
Basically, what we mean is, we'd prefer to not get charity.  We'd prefer to return to everyone more legitimately than a t-shirt and a mouse pad with the cast on it.
EDIT:  We also discussed releasing the pilot script, either as a whole or just the first half, if there's enough interest.  We'll also go into who we are, what shows (mostly network) and films we've worked on, etc.  We're not expecting people to pay into something anonymous. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:28:15
oh, and thanks for the info.  great ideas in there @_date: 2014-07-08 06:09:10


What's libre content?  I'm unfamiliar. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:50:57
Still got a ton to give away!  We want to hear about some good ways to distribute too.  Counterparty?  Mastercoin?  
How do we get the crypto and decentralization community involved in a scripted drama with a big decentralization theme?
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:45:11
3D printed directly from the TV?  *Autonomous robot assassins paid in Bitcoin?*  
great idea! Ever read that comic about the dead that rise from the grave with the sole goal of hunting down their killer? Reminds me of that, but somehow better.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:49:04
That's what we're hoping. Any other thoughts on it?  Are you actually familiar with it?  Great idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:10:09
Although a bit too upbeat (need some downsides and conflict in there), all good ideas!  @_date: 2014-07-08 05:32:34
can't block the blockchain, or a licorice whip! @_date: 2014-07-08 15:08:23
Sounds like a good idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 18:15:07
great idea @_date: 2014-07-07 07:49:07
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:40:15
Heh, thanks for the most genuine answer here so far.  Good story is all that matters.  And the only thing that makes a story good is character, conflict, and tough choices.  The rest is icing.  But icing is pretty good, too...
Don't worry, we're pretty proud of what we got.  And you'll be happy to know we wrote this first, and realized it tied in really well second. 
The Twilight Zone is often misrepresented now.  It's not a show about sci-fi and twist endings.  It's about what scared people shitless back then.  What were they afraid of most?  Serling twisted their fear of technology, space travel, the Nazis, and nuclear war into some of the best television ever made. Because it was about people.  
People come for the big ideas, but they stay for the relationships.
Two great ideas for you! @_date: 2014-07-08 05:27:18
now that's a good idea.  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:11:26
Fun and good idea.  @_date: 2014-07-08 05:46:06
anything with ancient-future-tech wins me over.  great idea @_date: 2014-07-07 18:23:13
Does anyone know offhand if it's still illegal in the US to distribute shares of a company through crowdfunding?  Or if you can offer backend points as a reward.
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:11:24
interesting stuff, good idea. @_date: 2014-07-08 02:10:31
great news.  we're pretty excited to see this implemented
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:03:00
I think you're on the right track, definitely.  A crisis affecting a decentralized network.  Our current script definitely has that in it... 
Assuming we gain enough interest, we'll post it online (maybe just the first half ;)) to get the ball rolling on fundraising.
great idea! @_date: 2014-07-08 07:19:43
Paying people to watch probably isn't the most financially sound model, but here!  Have a licorice whip! @_date: 2014-07-09 00:38:43
Yeah, one possible goal would be to sell to cable, but being in a positive to not have to would be impressive/amazing.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:16:11
Wow, yeah, folks do seem mad.
The guy claims they didn't crowdfund it, though.  
Sounds like they're saying the movie wasn't done until really recently, which is totally possible.  Most festival cuts are incomplete (using copyrighted music, temp tracks, bad mixes, no color correction, etc).  
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:36:34
it's so good... I think... I'm gonna tip it... again.  2 great ideas @_date: 2014-07-08 15:18:10
Interesting and good idea  @_date: 2014-07-07 06:46:21
Curious, what similar media projects are you referring to?  We'd like to take a look to avoid the same nonsense.
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:52:21
Good stuff. Good idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 05:29:04
creepy, good idea.  @_date: 2014-07-09 05:48:32
What's the downside?  What makes it silly?
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:27:32
I'm a huge fan of BitTorrent's potential as a distribution model and a way to involve fans in helping to distribute content.  Instead of fining people distributing content, we should find ways to involve them.  They're providing a service in many cases, and they're fans!  Otherwise they wouldn't be doing it.
Haha, getting people to donate to make an explosion bigger is brilliant... great idea again! @_date: 2014-07-08 06:30:50
oh baby, that's the good stuff.  great idea @_date: 2014-07-09 17:06:41
We'll definitely touch on the history of what happened.  good idea @_date: 2014-07-08 06:05:46


welp, that's just one of the best things I've heard all day.  great idea @_date: 2014-07-07 06:41:00
Huh, if true, then duly noted. 
EDIT:  Just realized you're referencing that Good Wife episode.  Haha.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:36:35
We're wondering that too. We're looking to hit the 3-5 mil range for the pilot. 
Our dream would be to create a distribution model where the "donors" are actually investors and receive a return autonomously to a provided bitcoin address. But in the US, we're pretty sure that's not legal still.  We're not huge fans of most Kickstarter campaigns because of the fact that the tiered "reward" systems are just a sleight of hand to make you not an investor, which seems unfair. 
We were also thinking of just doing this as a Bitcoin marketing push. If we pilot a success show in that range, the press will be massive and raise the probability of either viewership or a sale. Either one would have an important effect on Bitcoin.  So the money would end up being more like advertising. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:05:07
you're right.  good idea @_date: 2014-07-07 19:47:30
I'll check out what Levine is doing.  I listen on occasion but not a ton.  
Honestly, we'd probably end up having to offer rewards, unless we can figure a way to offer investments, or something similar.  Like donating gives you a token that allows for a proportional vote in decisions.  
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:06:06
that's a great idea.  I'll look into it. @_date: 2014-07-09 06:22:44
Agreed! 400 bits @_date: 2014-07-07 22:09:27
I listened to an interview with Katrina and it's an interesting idea.  It could potentially work with television because series are ongoing.  Something like a film, where there's only a single product and a finite run, it may be harder to find value.  But a show continues, like a band producing music.  I like it.  Definitely going to do more research into Counterparty.  It's definitely shinier than Mastercoin.
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:01:19
good idea @_date: 2014-07-08 05:28:11
great idea!  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:12:25
It's all sound and good idea yours have fart  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:19:16
Creepy but good idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 23:21:46
oh great, I'll read this.   This is the sort of genuine technical stuff we want sprinkled through the story.  great idea @_date: 2014-07-08 05:46:46
have a licorice whip, sonny.  @_date: 2014-07-08 05:31:10
go get yourself a licorice whip, sonny @_date: 2014-07-08 06:11:22
could definitely be a way to discover some serious corruption in another world.  good idea! @_date: 2014-07-08 06:51:00
Sounds great. I'll send you a tip later on... Don't you worry, it'll get there.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:48:17
Yeah definitely need to look more into this. I'm curious if people are using counterparty as a way to involve people with there being an IPO investment. Something that people can get a return on, on some level. If not money, then other ways. 
Have 3 dollars for a not-story related question!   @_date: 2014-07-08 05:47:24
can't agree with making propaganda, but I can agree with characters in the story using it! good idea @_date: 2014-07-07 06:39:54
We're not looking for any money right now, just testing an avenue.  Thematically, it seems appropriate for the script.  And we think Bitcoin has massive potential for the entertainment industry.  Not just as a way to raise money (we could raise money the old fashion way, that works fine), but as a way to be transparent about the people's money we're using.  
This would be on the scale of a union show.  We're not interested in a small production. 
We 100% would be holding funds in escrow for each stage of development.  This is exactly what we're excited about with Bitcoin.  Using it's trustless nature to develop a show.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:11:29
we're looking to do a TV series where the cast and crew are paid in bitcoin for transparency.  We need a payroll system...
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:33:38
good way to translate a somewhat complex topic.  good idea.  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:17:22
Heh very good idea  @_date: 2014-07-07 18:57:41
Sure, if they promised one thing and flopped, that's a dirtbag move.  I'd be curious to see how they went about raising money and what they promised.
We'd outline all of that beforehand.  Television also doesn't do any festival runs.  Write / shoot / edit / finish / distribute.  
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:31:24
have another licorice whip, my boy @_date: 2014-07-08 15:50:15
Very interested in exploring the positives and negatives of all-out direct democracy and anarchy. Great idea!   @_date: 2014-07-08 06:04:43
good stuff!  good idea.  @_date: 2014-07-08 05:33:16
no middle man and no banks in this future!  good idea!  @_date: 2014-07-08 06:32:27
This is actually the format of almost all dramatic television too, so it works well.  good idea! @_date: 2014-07-08 15:49:39
Hopefully we'll shout before that to raise money. But we're gonna need... A lot... 3-5mil. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:41:34
TV reference! Have a quarter! @_date: 2014-07-08 15:48:27
Good idea!  @_date: 2014-07-08 06:00:49
Thanks so much!  The old system is still functioning on it's current model, but it's slowly dissolving.  It still works (it'll continue to "work" until they're not generating money) but they have to protect their content by going after people legally.  We have to believe there's a better way to make a living in entertainment that doesn't involve suing people.
The experiment is to MATCH the production value and budget of network shows, and make something of equal visual quality (and better overall quality).  Talent (in all departments) costs money, so we're hoping we can find a way to raise a network-level budget without the network.
Additional content, web-series, and maybe side stories in our universe, are all great ways to keep interest going in the main story arc and hopefully keeping money coming in to continue creating the content!
great idea! @_date: 2014-07-07 06:41:28
re: Under the Dome - They try, they really do.  
We'll do the best we can to show you that we're legit.  And we can promise you we'll find a talented cast and crew.  But we'll do the best we can to not be cheeseballs in the writing.
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:49:58
Choose your own path stories are definitely workable in certain angles of the narrative. Could be great supplemental story!  Good idea! @_date: 2014-07-08 23:01:59
That's sitting on my iPad right now.  I believe its 2 down on my reading list.  Was it good?
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:52:01
Good question. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:15:15
Welcome!  Have a quarter!  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:16:57
Good idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 15:14:40
All fun ideas. (Script is actually already finished though). But good ideas!  @_date: 2014-07-07 18:39:57
Are they still doing the festival circuit and looking for distro?  Festivals have weird rules about when you can actually distribute your film.  If they distribute online or in theaters then they're no longer eligible for festival submission, so they might be trying to rack up accolades.  
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:53:51
Haha, thanks for the actor suggestions.  There's usually film vs tv people available, but I guess everyone has a price.
And, script's done. So we're not actually looking for narrative ideas.  But they're still fun to hear. And they might get worked in if they're thematically relevant. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:09:53
could be a catalyst, definitely.  good idea @_date: 2014-07-08 15:16:40
Hmm. So maybe that's why people have been doing the app coins. I've seen some artcoins too where you own something attached to the piece. Not sure how you could use it practically though. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:15:22
Good idea  @_date: 2014-07-08 06:25:21
I see what you're saying.   I think people should be able to use and remix their content all they want.  It's out there, and it should be open for others to use.  Valve definitely has got it right.  Things like fan fiction only expand the fun of the content. 
I'm hoping to show people what it takes to create an actual, highly quality series and involve the entire community in the project as much as possible, down to following their investment through the blockchain.  My hope is that this way people will understand the time and effort a team puts into the TV they love, and maybe that will give it a realistic value that people are willing to donate/pay.
