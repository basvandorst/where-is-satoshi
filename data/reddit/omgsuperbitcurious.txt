Sorry, how do I import a private QR address into my phone with mycellium?
The options the app gives me are: 
1. Send, Receive (within Balance menu)
2. Keys
3. Transactions
4. Address Book

So far I have created my first wallet at the blockchain (which says I have a balance of 0.00022105 BTC $ 0.22).
I have mycellium for android, where it says my backup is not verified. 
I have printed out 3 paper wallets from bitaddress.org
However, when I attempt to scan the public code on the left provided by bitaddress.org in Mycelium, the app says: "Unrecognized private key format".
Sorry for all the questions. I don't consider myself technologically challenged as I studied engineering, but the learning curve on bitcoin is a little steep in my case.

Thanks for your support/replies and the tip!
I'll be purchasing my bitcoins through Coinbase, and then I'll follow the instructions you've shared.
Answering your first question as to why I didn't purchase any bitcoins sooner, it mainly stems from moving from Florida to Central America, changing jobs, car repairs, paying for plane tickets to visit my girl up in the states, among other things. 
If you have any advice on whether Coinbase is a secure starting point to enter the bitcoin ecosystem let me know..
Again thanks for your help. Peace

I thought I'd get a question like yours. :)
It took a few months to find secure employment. Before then I was pretty much living paycheck to paycheck. It sucks but that's how my luck played out and believe me I would have loved to get involved sooner, as opposed to cheering on the sidelines.

I guess I should have expressed myself differently.
Yes I now have replaceable short term money.
