I hear ya, but I don't really think it matters.   If they are calling themselves SR3 and no one else seems to want to call themselves that, it's as good as SR3 in my book.

SC2 fans seem like the right audience in comparison to LoL.   I'm curious  how DOTAs crowd is as I just haven't gotten too involved in that seen.   
I  also wonder about some other games that might not have as big of followings.   I'd rather have 20,000 people get excited for bitcoin than annoy 100,000 that wouldn't be interested.

Neither.   What happens is Google will index something like a forum post, and associate the date of creation in their search results with the time the post was made.   New posts to the thread do not update the original posting date.   
So what is happening here is that the search result indicates the proper date it first associates with the post, and not the last post in the thread.   So Google is not fucking up, it's just the methodology they chose to implement here.
Simply following the link I was able to see the Satoshi comment you can see in the screenshot.
What's impressive is how quickly Google picked up the change and updated the description in the search results to reflect this.   What likely happened in the forum software pings Google every time a new post is made.   Google has a hard-on for new content, as a result the spider quickly scanned the article and updated the search results to indicate this.

You're just looking at this from a whole different angle than I am.   It's not that I fail to see your points, it's that I feel there is more than one reason for them to consider it.
Twitch.tv may currently be the big dog on the block for streaming video games, but they have lag issues and a competing service could threaten them.  If that service could put more money directly in a streamers pocket would certainly be more attractive.   If bitcoin itself allowed streamers to earn more money, and a competing service were to provide this why would a streamer stay on Twitch?   What is Twitch without its streamers?
As for entering in my credit card details it is a pain to enter it into lots of sites and keep track of who may potentially have my information.   It's just something I really don't want to think about.   Going through the hassle with Coinbase once isn't a big deal.   
Anyway, I appreciate your effort to clearly illustrate your point as I do agree aspects of it.    At the same time I've heard your rant many times here before and I think each use case deserves its exploration of both the pros and the cons.   I probably could have expounded more in my original post, but I guess this response will have to suffice.

Personally, I don't want my CC tied to some video game site if possible.   It's also a pain in the ass the to enter in that info.   It also slows me down from something impulsive.    Bitcoin is pretty seemless and I find it much easier for a micro payment like this, than having to enter in CC details.
Anyway, if you're curious I'm in my 30's and work full time.   I bring up Twitch on iPad before heading to work and carry that around with me watching streams in the morning while I get ready.   
Personally, I couldn't really care either way.   I never subscribe now, but I'm sure I would if there were a way via bitcoin.   
I'd happily throw bitcoin at Twitch if they let me pay to avoid ads using bitcoins.   I could easily use ad block, but that's not who I am.   If there was a button that said something like "go ad free for the next hour only .005 bitcoin, I'd be doing that constantly.

I get where you are coming from, but I'm not sure that is always the best approach for adoption.   Take a look at Facebook.   It appealed to a select group of people, and eventually hit this critical mass that even grandma started using it.
However, I agree it would be nice if there was some educational information to suplement the campaign.   Perhaps provide stories and information about how bitcoins can work with their bitcoins to enhance their experience ([trade]( donations, stream subscriptions, gambling, etc).   Those are the things that I think will ultimately increase it's intrinsic value for users as well.

I used to promote adult content several years ago, and maybe things have changed, but I counted on a certain percent of my referrals to get rebilled.  If the likelyhood of that dropped because of bitcoin I could have seen myself not promoting the sites that used bitcoin.   There is definitely more to this then simply ease of use.

Different types of enjoyment.   Some prefer participating while others like spectating.   There is probably something you enjoy watching more than participating.   Are the actors on Saturday Live having more fun than those watching?   Why watch Saturday Live when you can create your own sketch comedy group?

I actually stumbled upon this myself, and was coming to Reddit to see if it was already posted.   It really wasn't to hard to find in an honest fashion.   Here is exactly how I got there.  
1. Wanted to learn more about Dorian Nakamoto so I performed a Google search
1. Got frustratrated with only finding results from today.   So I adjusted my time settings to only show results prior to February 28th 2014.
1. I took [a screenshot]( of the results, and you'll notice the link is 4 results down.   
Needless to say the result caught my attention, and that's all it took for me.

I only started really follow BTC in the past few months, but if I decide to finally sink some money in it's going to be just as much for fun as an investment.  To me it's like betting on a sports game.   I don't find many pro sports interesting, but if I even bet a buck on a game it suddenly becomes infinitely more fun to watch.

I'd more than happily do a trade in bitcoin if they went first.   If they were ok with my rep then awesome.   I feel though it will work only for some though.

How does that help it take place of a real PC?   I haven't used an Android phone for myself, but I'd be surprised if I could accomplish many of daily work tasks on it.   I'd be surprised if there is AdWords editor for Android, and AdWords is where one of Google's big revenue generators.
I guess less limiting might provide opportunities for the creation of these apps.   These days I want my phone to be able to do about 5 things, make phone calls, text message, email, web browser, maps.   Anything on top of that I probably wouldn't even use very much of.   I suppose a bitcoin wallet could influence me though.

Most of those things are nice to do, but not necessary for me.  Plus I think you can do about 90% of that with an iPhone.  I guess I just don't see many reasons to chose one or the other.  I could see Android probably being a nicer choice for a tablet however.

If / when there is an opportunity I'll certainly bring it up at work, but cash flow is huge in this industry, and even if bitcoins seemed like a great solution publishers would still be the last people to see their coin.
