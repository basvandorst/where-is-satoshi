Wikibot is very good. I'm on mobile and I'm too last to load that page but it gave me a basic understanding of what it was.

Private means not government owned. I don't go to The US bank, I go to Chase, etc. The logic you are applying is like saying the local restaurant down the street must be public, since the government heavily regulates how food must be prepared and sold.

Thanks for having an open mind about the situation! As for education, I'm currently doing an independent study at my university focusing on the application of blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrency, so you're right, I'm not really qualified to speak on the subject yet, but I am working on it!
As for the topic at hand, the US jury system *loosely* resembles a Byzantine Agreement model, and I would be surprised if the system of picking a jury (of humans) who would make decisions on cases. Take a look at Algorand, the technology they are working on is very interesting.

In the case of crypto, they can be implemented as "natural laws" of the technology. If people try to behave "against the law" their actions will be rejected by the system. A basic example of this is Bitcoin rejecting double spend attacks.
