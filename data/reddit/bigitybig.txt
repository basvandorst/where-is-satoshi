Imagine how decentralised bitcoin will be with 300KB blocks. This is actually genius. Really out of the box thinking. Miners will be able to get more fees and it will put more pressure on for the lightning network to be implemented soon. Plus it will promote use of segwit.

Yeh, to me this seems like a list of the majority of the bitcoin economy.

How has the community got to a point that it doesn't understand this basic fact?

I suggest you read this.

There is no requirement for replay protection. This is just something some people have made up in the last couple of months. Replay protection increases the chance of a permanent chain split rather than a smooth upgrade.
Also your use of the terms "false" and "honest" seems very arbitrary.

What you are saying is totally incorrect. I suggest you read this post.
You purposely unhighlighted the section in between that states:


These are real attacks. The miners changing the rules by a majority vote is not an "attack" and is specifically described in the white paper.

The exchanges have an incentive to let the two chains battle it out in the markets because their business model it to earn money from trading fees. Therefore the more trades that happen, the more money they make.

I'm not sure what you mean.

Where's the attack part of it though? What you consider to be an attack seems to be indistinguishable from a normal network hard fork upgrade.

No, he actually predicted ASIC mining very very earlier on.

Good questions.

I think this community may have a sickness.

The explanation he gave was actually false. I suggest you read this post.
