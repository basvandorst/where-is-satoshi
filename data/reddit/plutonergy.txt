What I never really understand is why you want to buy a Trezor or similar, all of us have an old cellphone in a junk drawer, yes?
Wipe it and use that instead with the wallet of your choice, Electrum for example.
After you've wiped it (recommend OS encryption, San Bernardino), downloaded the wallet of your choice then immediately put it in flight mode (forever). Then generate your seed and use it to sign offline transactions and more. Trezor is cool, but why spend another $100 on more junk when most of us probably have an old Android in the junk drawer?
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:37:28
Coins you own before the fork is spendable on both chains. Meaning if you can predict the winner you can sell of the coins on the loosing chain at day one and keep "the same" coins on chain two for future usage.

Wipe, encrypt and update, and after installing the needed apps put it in flight mode FOREVER. Sign transactions offline using the camera to scan QRcodes back and forth and this will be much much MUCH safer than Trezors and similar hardware wallets!

I encourage people to spend like $10 on Bitcoins just to know the mechanics of it, send a few bits between different wallets, maybe buy something online for a few dollars, like a CD key or store token (Steam or Microsoft store for an example).
Bitcoin is revolutionary and complex and in a way very differently, therefore I feel that it is important for the investor to understand what Bitcoin really is before making the decision to invest a lager amount.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:51:52
You are wrong sir, 99.999% of the time does not fit the Cold Wallet criteria. Also I take it that you've never signed transactions offline using Armory/Electrum since you state that they must be taken online at some point. You ever heard of pushing/broadcasting transactions that you've signed offline?   Hacking ANY device that is connected to your computer is fully possible, there are no such things as unhackable software/hardware. Again any iOS device need to have their firmware signed by Apple themselves to alter the firmware (just like Trezor), how do you explain that most of their devices are fully hacked... With your logic Apple themselves released those exploits!

I understand the paradox, my thoughts are based on making it difficult to spam the mempool. Once a large block, 16,32,64mb... Insert value here is mined, it's back to 1mb blocks again for ~100 blocks again. A superblock needs to be somewhat random, otherwise spamming would occur in the hours in between.

Paper wallets are safer than hardware wallets, also cold storage solutions with i.e Armory and Electrum are also safer than Hardware Wallet. If you're a technical person you do not need a Trezor, you can use an old smartphone and sign transactions in air plane mode using it's camera.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:38:50
OCD here, DON'T use Trezor as recommend by others. A Trezor is HOT STORAGE... Yeah I know common people say "Cannot be hacked since FW needs to be signed by Trezor Inc." But guess what, PlayStations, Xboxes, Wii, iPhones etc have these securities as well, you cannot tamper with these devices without being able to sign softwares with a proper key. Still most of those devices are hacked, jailbroken, softmoded etc... Eventually Trezor will be hacked as well!
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:19:49
Best option would be an analog-generated paper wallet yes. Though I personally do put trust the Armory bitcoin-wallet and it's cold-storage solution.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:50:13
I did mistake you, I thought you where talking about online security all along. Didn't realize until now that you where talking about physical theft!
Since we are talking about physical theft I'm not sure which is the safest one between Trezors encryption and the encryption offered by computer OS:es. Guessing computer OS offered much more different chooises of encryption softwares where only Trezor offers one? Guessing computer os still beats Trezor in that area as well, besides if someone steal a computer from you they would likely wipe it and sell it. If they steal a Trezor they know it's used for one reason only... Still gives IMO a cold storage PC more advantages over Trezors. Both theft and online hacking.

I'm predicting that the 2x part won't be honored. And that we will have a pricedrop based on the guess that we've reached to top for now... Like always when we reach the top everyone cashes out and new adoption among rebuys occur when we reached the bottom. IMO the BCH fork did not affect the BTC ecosystem anymore than LTC did... They're all three different coins with different names different from each others, but only the two newcomers are using a majority of the code from the first one. They're not smart or committed enough to create such a code from scratch so they copy and paste. You can clearly see this when you compare the value of the coins (you need to multiply LTC by 4x to make its proportion justified to BTC)...
I like the BCH project, but I with they would code it all from scratch, that would've been something that could really compete with BTC!
Edit: you need to divide LTC, not multiply...

Guessing that currently 3 million people have a bitcoin wallet with some sort of accessable and resoneriable balace and if you cut out the "giants" guessing one in a thousand users is rich or extremely wealthy and together have like an average ~100 coins. 3000 people * 100 coins plus 2 million lost+satoshis coins.

Regarding Electrum, with the precausions mentioned above you might want to look into the "Master public key" feature.

I believe Apple, Sony, Nintendo paid $billions trying to keep hackers out of their devices, still they're penetrated. Private keys that's connected to a computer with internet access is considered HOT wallet regardless. I like your enthusiasm though standing up for Trezor and all, but it's not a cold wallet and nothing is that's connected to the internet one way or another. Somehow I find it cute that people live under the impression that things aren't hackable just because the developers claim they aren't, I imagine Microsoft prays that Everytime they release a new OS it's not going to be cracked since they blocked all the exploits from their previous versions, still there's in time a total percentage crackrate or their products. The difference is that big developers are smart enough NOT to claim their securities cannot be breached, Trezor developers, well I aren't claiming that they're less intelligent developers but if they got you to believe that their products cannot be breached why aren't they paid $billions for their security systems by the supercompanies?

"when" people get to worried that the wealth of 1 million BTC is in the hands of a single person or group thats holding their agenda back we might see another fork.

BTC/BCH is just one example... But a better one is ETC/ETH where the wealth from the DAO hack rests in a group or single hacker.

How about a hacker that has control over the PC that the Trezors USB cable is attached to, could it be possible to access the device threw the cable, the Trezor is in this way a Hot Wallet isn't it?...
An encrypted flight mode smartphone that signs QR-codes using only the camera to communicate with is considered a cold wallet in my opinion, but sure if a theif got access to any of the encrypted devices the privatekey could be compromised.
However​ I'm not trying to push anyone from using or buying Trezor, just saying that "my" smartphone setup is "free" and fully working, and I might even say that if a theif got access to random devices, a Trezor is directly connected to Bitcoin usage, an old smartphone have several usages.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:48:22
Tell me how could you attack an encrypted smartphone that is put into flightmode forever?
The attack should be within the analogue QR code, received threw the phone's camera lens and executed how? Creating a new QR code and force the other phone to execute another malware?
Seems VERY unlikely... Though I know that one should be openminded when it comes to securityflaws. But with no cables attached, and flightmode enabled, router password forgotten etc I'd trust my wealth in it!
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:15:59
There is, use an old smartphone with Electrum installed. After that put it into airplane mode forever. You can sign transactions using the camera on your phones (or laptop now as well, e.i any webcam). Scanning the QR codes back and forth seems as a bulletproof layer of security were there are no cables attached..
Mening trezor etc are expensive but funny gadgets, but any old smartphone does the exact same thing.
I recommend you encrypt the offline phone!

I do understand if you make a copy and give it to a trust has benefits for the next of kin, but Craig Wright suggest that he is no longer in possession of Satoshis keys?... Why would a grown-up choose to not possess something that in it's nature is designed to not be possessed by others ;-)

Why isn't 24x "snowball" a valid BIP39?

Throw it out and recompile?! --- shouldn't it be the other way around if you want this feature you add it to the source-code and recompile?

And without technical issue

SegWit has been ready since 2016, is the 2X part really that complicated since it's not ready and being delayed and they've had months to code it?

Does UASF prevent this?

I consider a smartphone to be a hardware wallet, encrypt the phone, put it in flight mode (forever), use the camera to sign transaction threw scanning QR codes back and forth with your "online"smartphone or laptop etc, well of course you need to a bit interested and tech savvy, but I ensure you, it's the same thing.
You save the seed the same way as any other hardware wallet if the old smartphone won't start.

I think these looks awesome, definitely something I would hard print on a piece of metal or similar...!!

people gave me the impression that Bitcoin would crash if SegWit came near it, why price so high?

I was under the impression that SegWit2X was the original SegWit and the 2X part was a 2mb block upgrade. 
Now it should be named SegWit2X-plus!

Exchanges lists two coins, market decides the winner and once it does lots of coins will be dumped on the "loosing" chain for a couple of days making it look alot like ETC a year ago. Shortly after that everything goes back to normal.

Since the SegWit part of the code has been ready for almost a year, I assume the the 2X part is like supercomplicated since it's being delayed?
Or is it delayed because someone found out that the SegWit 2X isn't just SegWit + 2mb, it is something like SegWit + 2mb + seeds to Jeff's private company, maybe plus some more stuff we haven't figured out yet.
First the name SegWit2X is misleading since we all was under the impression that the 2X part was only about block size. I've read that some think that the original SegWit was a Trojan horse, well Jeff just made that clearer whose Trojan horse ;-)...
It should be named SegWit2X-plus!

Using exchanges gives me the same feeling as a real bank, I'm not in control, someone else is.
Being the only one with access to my private keys gives me the opposite feeling, even if it's like $50!

Someone should make a sticker post with these answers. If you have the private keys you don't have to worry!

According to the SegWit2X code what would you estimate the recommended fee set to would be if there is room for all the pending transactions into the next block.
Rumors said that SegWit2X doesn't have the same discount limit as the original SegWit code, same rumors implying that 'miners' could spam the network to trick the Wallet to recommend a higher fee even if it wasn't needed!

ETC is a weak coin, ETH is not!

It's rather amusing that they're not using the original SegWit and go with a handshake to adopt the 2MB once that part is ready to avoid stressing code into the system.
Though,...I heard somewhere that they're not even using the original SegWit-SegWit code, they were not satisfied with the discount part, so that's changed in the "new" SegWit2x code. 
Can someone confirm?
