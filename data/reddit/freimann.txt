And thus enabling a minority to win elections. You need to put up your own representative to vote for. In the US the system is arguably beyond repair though (2 party system, gerrymandering).

ironically those flaws only exist in the friction zone between "real" money and digital currencies. bitcoin itself works like a charm and will continue to do so.

thats because you paid your money someone who used a template webpage to get your interest and yet has nothing to deliver. kind of like kickstarter.

yeah i know but btc24 had a hotwallet system in place that will at least limit the withdrawals to an acceptable amount.

fortunately i am on the receiving end of those errors but i am more worried about the bankroll of my account (without the obvious errors), lets hope the site maintainers dont drown in work and despair. i already was withdrawing all my cash when this happened ...

The problem in this case lies both with the executive and the customers. 
The executive has to investigate the claims of money laundering and fraud and thus has (rightfully in my opinion) seized the monetary assets of Simon Hausdorf, who, apparently let his customers transfer the funds to his private (!) bank account, which in itself is already extremely suspicious. 
The customers with frozen fiat assets on the other hand (myself included) panicked and saw their investment vanish and are now threatening to sue Simon Hausdorf for fraud which complicates things a lot and i believe will ultimately be more dangerous to the repayment in full of all frozen assets than the ongoing investigations.
My opinion is that Simon was very naive and very inexperienced when starting his business. At the moment i believe the fiat holders will see their money someday but i fear that many people will sue and thus prolong the situation unnecessarily and even diminish the recoverable assets as Simon will have to pay his lawyers at some point.
