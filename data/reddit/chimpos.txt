If I was given .004 BTC every time I've heard "Didn't bitcoin crash to $0/Bitcoin isn't worth anything now" I'd have 1 extra BTC.

Congrats! You must feel relieved and happy!

Some say it's safe from quantum computing.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:26:01
Sorry to hear. I spent stupidly with shitcoins. :(
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:51:39
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:37:58
So what do we do to get our coins?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:39:49
It's a bit quiet there. I haven't checked recently though.
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:12:49
And he's gone missing too. Hmmm.
@_date: 2015-12-10 00:10:36
Where is this on Google street view?

What does Crypto 3.0 mean?
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:40:12
Is that a good idea mtmox.com? Really?
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:53:56
Maybe it's a joke name. The site isn't up yet.
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:22:54
I don't believe that he "destroyed" the wallets. I believe he kept all the remaining coins for himself. Not so much a moron really. More nasty. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:49:46
getbitcoins.com.au and others are out of bitcoin and have been for a while. What's happening?
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:50:53
@_date: 2015-05-22 06:40:18
It's going to be $275 on Monday!
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:55:36
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:53:05
Yes. It's annoying. I've tried that bear whatever program and that didn't work too. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:29:34
I hear murmurs that World War 3 is going to be based on Bitcoin. And Tanks will start excepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:44:33
Sorry to sound like an idiot but is the price down due to mining being too difficult for the average person to afford?
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:11:03
I'm sad, Dustin.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:18:48
What's this about?
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:50:39
Yeah Baron Trump is a bitcoin shorter.
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:04:41
I thought I was going to be able to go to Mt. Kawazawazza now that BTC has gone down to $948 AUD it doesn't look like it's going to happen :(
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:36:17
Watching the video or using bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:41:06
Does Bitcoin always crash on Black Friday?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:37:04
Nothing has happened.

Drink Young Henry's! Where is BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:43:28
Where can you get BCC from?
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:26:20
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:26:09
Maybe 0.5 for me.

How do you know what I think?
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:05:29
1. Meet up with Craig Wright. 
2. Tell people a black man will be president then he will be followed by Donald Trump. Let them laugh at you.
3. Write a thread on reddit about Crypto Currencies
4. Write a script called "Joker" about a sad open mic comedian
5. Laugh at the CEO of Blockbuster
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:22:59
Fuck that's a relief. I've used mycelium for the first time and I freaked out a little. Then my mate sent me this link. Do we email it to ask them when it'll be back up?
@_date: 2015-08-14 06:55:03
I thought I could find a faucet from the way back machine that used to give out many BTC when it was at a low price. But no. It doesn't work that way. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 02:18:02






Same here!
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:41:39
What? I'm confused by this. Why would this change?
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:10:51
I get the same thing. And I just send some BTC to it. It's a little concerning. Is this on android or iphone?
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:19:38
@_date: 2019-12-20 03:30:49
How long has it been $1,000,000 for? Did John MacAfee eat his dick?
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:20:03
And it's not working here in Australia too.
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:33:42
It's happening on iphone too.
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:56:24

@_date: 2017-04-26 06:04:00
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:04:22
How long does it take for a faucet claim to send? I haven't used one for months.
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:12:34
Lol. I wish it was a BIG accident. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:08:57
THANK YOU!

@_date: 2015-11-04 22:11:58
3) Hmmmm. Is there evidence of that?
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:13:36
I don't understand why the volume can't be real.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:35:50


why is that?
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:17:20
Can I just ask you questions here instead?

They used to pump and dump on mcxnow.com but realsolid used to tease the muslims too much and they got upset and went to btc-e.
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:17:23
The fuck is happening?
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:27:28

@_date: 2015-10-30 04:06:36
Great. Now they own bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:41:35
Poor guy. He probably needs some money and awards. I'm going to send him some BTC via  and sign him up for some awards. It's what he would want.

Keep calm.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:06:02
Did they mention bitcoin was also dead?
@_date: 2015-10-16 04:07:58
Oh ok. Sorry.
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:19:28
Maybe Craig, Realsolid and Dick Smith are creators of Bitcoin!?
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:02:50

Yeah popular addresses. Would that be worth it?

They came they saw they stole.
@_date: 2015-10-16 03:37:52
That's why it's a good idea to buy some. It's an infinite cash flow!

@_date: 2016-05-05 22:16:45
I'm starting to believe this now.
@_date: 2015-10-21 03:55:14

The system works in an automatic mode, which means that you get paid immediately after creating your query.
