Are you sure nobody noticed? i would never be able to find the posts but I remember a few panic threads earlier this year about bitcoin days destroyed spikes, and I remember most people thinking it was finney.

offline transactions are pretty simple in electrum.  They are your only option from a watching only wallet - just copy your master public key from your offline wallet and create new wallet on online computer, enter MPK.

I got armory working on a livecd I made.  
It even works as an online wallet from the livecd.

wouldn't a debian live-build script be relatively easy to audit?
just a package list and a few wgets and whatever else?  Mind you I could never get it to work.
Also, an electrum distro from electrum.org would have to be at least as trustworthy as electrum.exe wouldnt it?

I think that if something is open source then you can print the source code.  Would this not be freedom of speech?
The US doesn't tell us what books we can or can't print, and I believe that's why Phil Zimmerman isn't in jail for munitions export.  
I also thought a court said money is speech but I get all my US news from Colbert and Stewart.

but, at 5 cents a transaction 2000 tps is $100 a second in transaction fees, that is $60,000 in fees on top of the block reward.  That seems like plenty of miner incentive, very little node incentive.

Would it still be a hard fork if an update was made now to accept bigger blocks, but actually producing bigger blocks didn't happen for another year?  Would that be like a soft hard fork?

once you have a watching only wallet you just create a transaction like you would normally but save to text file and sign on offline computer, or use QR codes.  I figured the non self explanatory part was getting the watch only wallet.

you could freeze addresses you don't want to spend from in electrum.  Not quite the same but close.
