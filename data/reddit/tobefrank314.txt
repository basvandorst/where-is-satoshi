Yeaaah, pretty sure that's bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:42:37
Dealing in bitcoin doesn't exempt you from your responsibility to pay taxes. It's this mindset that will force the hand of the government in further regulating points of commerce that accept bitcoin as a method of payment. Ultimately, I think this will adversely affect the likelihood of bitcoin being accepted as currency (over merely a store of value).
Here's to hoping you get audited! :-D
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:48:45
Which is even better when you're doing things on the level! Since you'll pay reduced capital gains xD . 
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:53:21
They can and do. All because there isn't some automatic method to force payments, doesn't mean it's not your responsibility to self-disclose and pay.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:46:43
How would we all be better without miners? There isn't a bitcoin network without miners xD . Part of what gives your coins value, is the computing power behind the network, which had to be invested in.
Also it's totally worth noting that you can't just "switch to mining some alt". Mining bitcoin requires purpose built hardware. The usefulness of which will be limited to "space heater" if bitcoin crashes.
If you truly have concern for the health of the network, you should invest in hardware to help with decentralization of the network. Put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:12:15
Awesome news! Even better is the salt on r/btc . xD

So you CAN run the S9 at 120v. Instead of buying the recommended APW3 PSU (it is an add on, it's not included), you use the same amount of money on a couple of 120v PSUs. Some people on Amazon have even gone to the effort to package it up for you:  . It's worth noting that you'll need to pull from a 15A circuit, or alternatively, 2 different 10A circuits, but that would be super easy to check for.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:47:47
So the APW3 PSU does NOT come with the S9, it's just what they recommend. You're correct that it only runs  but you could instead spend an equal amount of money on a couple 120v power supplies and run it using 120. People on Amazon already have it packaged for you  . You'd just need to make sure you're pulling from a 15A circuit, which is super easy to check for.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:55:20
As others have said, it's a voice, but it's not a vote. If you want a vote, you need to control some of the network hash. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:26:15
What do you mean by miner communication being poor? If you're talking about the heads of large mining pools, my understanding is a number of them have been vocal. If you're talking about solo miners? I mean... that's a lot of individuals who probably make their opinions known through mediums like *this* . 
I can't really speak to core's communication, because I haven't been following so closely, but I will say that it's easier to communicate with a collective when that collective has some sort of structure.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:40:21
So I in no way support BU or any of this nonsense drama that's going on, and I personally point my 120TH at slushpool mining Core, but I can't help but think that the people who helped to build this network should have some kind of say in the direction of things. For, without the miners, what is bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:21:37
As a small-scale bitcoin miner, can confirm, idgaf.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:31:49
Really well said! Thank you for taking the time to translate.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:26:12
I don't think it's particularly fair for you to blame the Chinese for taking the initiative and investing in the network. There's nothing stopping people in the US or anywhere else from mining, so if you're so concerned about decentralization, I implore you to purchase some hardware and get to work.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:04:57
That's fair. I assumed your swipe at "centralized mining cartels" was targeted at the large Chinese mining groups, my apologies. And as I stated before, I personally put my 120TH-Vote towards Core and Segwit, so in that regard, we are in agreement. I just find it frustrating when people downplay the importance of miners by saying things such as "they don't deserve a say in the development of the network". We've collectively invested more time and money into bitcoin than any of the developers have, and without us there wouldn't be a network.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:44:51
Yeah I mean, I'm running 9 in my basement right now, and all it took was running a couple 240 circuits, nbd. Was also a pretty cool learning experience. I think just about anyone could reasonable run 1.

@_date: 2017-03-30 17:38:51
My German girlfriend confirms. xD
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:25:15
So you believe that the people who invest and provide upkeep to the network, shouldn't have any say in how it's laid out?
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:44:44




I mean, you kinda did xD 
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:40:12
S9s, and .145/kwh. That said, I also have a 19.52kW Solar System on my property, which helps with the energy costs.
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:54:05
The math works out even better if you decide to do the mining as part of a business. I was able to take a ton of writeoffs on my 2016 tax returns as a product of having a bitcoining mining "business" being run out of my basement.
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:20:51
Hah, weird. Yeah, I do a bit of mining and have only used Coinbase as a means to sell bitcoin, and in that regard it's been great. The site is straight forward, I was able to get everything setup and working online, and my sell limit (15k/week) is reasonable. I looked into some alternatives based on all the bad press that Coinbase receives (on this subreddit) but nothing else was even remotely reasonable. Apps like Circle had frustratingly low transfer limits, and I have no interest in sitting around a coffee shop meeting the types of folks that buy bitcoin on localbitcoin. If you have another alternative, I'd love to hear it, but my understanding is that, at the moment, coinbase is kind of the only/best option.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:34:37
You can get your Coinbase exchange limits quite high, it just takes having a few months of history is all. Go through the legwork of getting everything verified, then request increases frequent and often.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:13:43
Thank you for the response. Very insightful :-) 
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:14:43
Not only you though, I think. There have been a lot of posts from people verbalizing problems with the platform. I'm not sure if it's just the outspoken few (and most people, like myself, have had no issues) or if I've just been lucky. I haven't had to deal with their customer service directly, so it's possible that's part of it.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:42:54
How you figure? At $900/btc you're currently grossing .30/kWh. Even at retail you make more than double what power costs you. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:38:28
So that's where my initial comment comes in. I think the real financial benefits are realized when you consider the tax incentives from making the bitcoin mining venture, a business. Besides the 30% ITC you get from installing a solar system, the IRS lets you write off 85% of the total cost, if the install is for a business (they essentially let you double dip on 15%). Figure, 10 S9s and 85% of a 20kW solar system, will bring your first year business costs up around 70k. It obviously depends on where your primary source of income is coming in at, but a 70k tax deduction sitting in the 30% bracket? That'll give you a tax benefit of around $21,000, which more than covers the 15k cost of your miners.
Obviously there are other things you should do to maximize this equation a bit. Taking your deductions over a few years, instead of all at once, is one way. You're right that heat can be an issue, but a bit of ventilation and a solid HVAC will go a long way. I personally am also running a 7 stage GSHP, which helps out in cooling costs.
So yeah, negligible (additional) cooling costs, and free hardware? Even without free power, I don't know why people wouldn't at least consider running a couple miners (assuming they have a segregated area, cause damn that noise). Sure, you could spend $900 and buy a bitcoin, or alternatively, you could spend $435 and give an S9 3 months.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:31:19
I've done basically this, and am thinking about expanding. With how my house is facing, and where I live, 10kW of Solar (or about 30 panels) amounts to about 1MWh/month on average, which is enough to run 1 S9 for a month. I currently have ~60 panels, and was recently chatting with my installer about adding another 30.
I think long term what I'd like to do is buy some property reasonably close by, and start a small mine. With a 400kW system, it would be possible to run 40 S9s for "free".  500TH/s ain't bad.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:50:27
Errrr, but now you have 500TH/s going without power issues? What's the rough math on that, 250k/year? Lol, seems pretty reasonable.
I think the investment is probably closer to 1 mil though, what with the cost of the property, all the electrical work, hvac, etc. Still, even if you're paying 15k/month towards the loan, you're still clearly 7k/month easy (plus, eventually you own this green datacenter).
It's just a pipe dream right now, but it's one I've been thinking a lot about as of late.
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:56:52
It depends. If you're investing independently or as a sole proprietor, you can offset any other income you make in the same year (like, for example, from another job you might have).
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:24:23
Look again, friend.
In almost all cases, your capital gains, after one year, is taxed at 15%. Exceptions are made if you make over $4xx,xxx/year (then capital gains is 20%) or if your highest tax bracket is 15% (then capital gains is 0%).
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:14:58
Oh, for sure. I think the rules will change though, as adoption increases. They're going to have to, ya know?

Thanks for the response, Max! I'm way ahead of you on the tax front. Have nice little spreadsheets and everything. Just trying to make sure it's all on the level, legally. I saw an article about a case in Florida where, while not mentioning Localbitcoins explicitly, a person was booked for money laundering using something similar. They eventually get let off the hook on account of the judge saying "bitcoin isn't money" though.
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:19:36
Yup, that's the one. And yeah, so I guess that's the real issue then, facilitating illegal activity? Regardless, the guy got off, so that's reassuring.
Anywho, thanks for your help! 
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:15:50
Oh, hear me out, I totally get it. By the IRS designating bitcoin as a financial instrument, and not  a currency, it makes certain things that would be easy with currency, exceedingly complex with bitcoin. There are benefits too though, for example, if the value of bitcoin dropped between you buying bitcoin, and exchanging it for furniture, you would have a tax BENEFIT.
But whether or not bitcoin should be designated as a currency, isn't the debate here. For the time being (and since 2014) it hasn't been, and so, you have to pay your damn taxes xD . 
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:01:30
In the US it's something like 15% after one year, which is basically nothing. People just don't like paying any taxes, that's all. xD
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:42:25
Right, I understand. So my next question is like, is there anything illegal about selling bitcoins on localbitcoin? I mean, it kind of sounds like it could be money laundering? There was a case recently in Florida where a guy got off on money laundering charges because the judge basically said "bitcoin isn't money".
Just wondering. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:35:35
Antpool mining empty blocks, and a large percentage of the network hash jumping between two chains every 3 days, are legit problems. High fees and a big mempool are symptoms. xD 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:15:01
Circle aggressively limits the size of transactions though, yeah? I have a 10k/week limit on coinbase, which I think is probably a bit low, but my understanding was that circle was much worse.

So if you do happen to live and work abroad, there is an IRS exclusion for foreign earned income and house expenses. It amounts to around a 100k + housing expenses deduction ( Also, depending on the country, you may be able to get around paying taxes THERE since you are a US citizen. That said, if only paying taxes to the US is not possible (because of rules in the foreign country) or the 100k+ deduction is not sufficient, yeah, why not leave? I mean, if it's truly to your benefit to do so?

Kind of a n00b here, but quick question. Most of the charts I see has BU as something like 5% of the global hash. Is that the case? And if so, why is it even noteworthy at that point?
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:02:24
Many people break the law, but most people don't tend to empathize with them. It's possible that the IRS is asking for too much, I honestly don't know enough to say, but that's not on Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:19:00
The tax bracket for income over $415k is 39.6%. Are you honestly complaining about paying HALF that amount for income from bitcoin sales?
You know, we could do away with capital gains all together, then you could just pay the almost 40% on it ;-) . 
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:42:01
Haha, thankfully not.
@_date: 2016-11-07 13:25:30
But maybe not particularly large compared to the rest of the community? Or is it that the BU folks aren't as vested financially into bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:26:50
Hah, okay, that was my theory. Maybe people pay 10% or so in order to have those funds be anonymous.
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:27:54
From a taxation standpoint? I'd say so. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:39:14
If you're willing to share, what issue is it that you have with Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:41:08
I apologize, I'm still kind of new here, but did I miss the part where people with interest in bitcoin are inherently "anti-tax"? If you make less than $37,650/year (the top of the 15% tax bracket) Capital gains is 0%! If you make more? Capital gains is taxed at a lower rate than the rest of your income. So yeah, it's not much. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:24:04
Exactly, I'd never recommend anyone keep coins on an exchange, even if I do trust the company. That said, I've bought/sold and it's ezpz. Also you can connect your coinbase account to mint.com! :-D

@_date: 2017-04-19 16:31:59
My guess is that your house/apartment/whatever is probably not the most ideal place to mine from to begin with (what with noise/heat), so why not look into renting space somewhere else, somewhere that you could get commercial electric rates? Just a thought.
And I think what will lead to decentralization is having a community that encourages and fosters small scale mining outside of a china. I truly believe that this subreddit's "US vs THEM" mentality is contributing to the problem by dissuading people who might otherwise pick up an ASIC.

Yeah, I'm with you here. I have a small mining operation going in my basement (around 120TH currently) and have invested a fair amount of cash to get it all up and running. I'm doing this in the US, where we desperately NEED more network hash, but where it's also a lot harder to turn a profit. I'm optimistic about the future of bitcoin, so I HODL like most people on this forum, but for some reason being a miner suddenly makes me the bad guy?
The only thing that separates me from the average user here, is that I've ALSO spent tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket to help maintain the network. But in the eyes of many users on r/bitcoin, not only should that account for nothing, but it also appears to be a strike against my character. xD It's one thing for folks to talk big on an online forum, but until a user is willing to put their money where their mouth is they're just that, a USER.
Sorry about the rant, I just get frustrated with all the children on reddit who think that all because they spent their allowance on a piece of a bitcoin, and run Core on their desktop, that they should get the same vote as people who've made actual investments in bitcoin's future. xD 
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:00:22
I've never had a single issue with Coinbase o.O . I know a lot of people seem to complain about them but their apps are really straight forward and intuitive, and I've had 0 issues getting stuff working using their platform. OP, why issue did you have that you're trying to have resolved?
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:39:12
Well that depends, are you trying to compete with a large mining company, or are you just trying to help the network by distributing network hash? In the first case, you setup your business in a place like Iceland. In the second case, you just deal with having lower profit margins.
In neither case do you "get on reddit and complain about how evil miners are" without actually doing anything to fix the problem. xD
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:16:05
As far as the manufacturing side of the house goes, Bitmain still acts as you have described. I've made a couple orders from them, and not only is there system pretty streamlined, but when I've had questions, they've always replied within 24 hours. Moreover, they tend to beat their shipping estimates AND sometimes provide credit for future purchases.
Say what you want about their mining pool, but the manufacturing side of the house has been really good to me.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:13:02
I mean, there's only 1 supplier, specifically bitmain. I think, atm the 13.5TH S9 goes for around $1300? If you find the hardware for sale anywhere else, it's just people buying and reselling the miners. As for the price difference between resellers? My guess is that has to do more with what they think they can get away with.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:45:10
Yeah, I think the issue has a lot more to do with China having cheap energy and labor, not that Bitmain is the only competitive manufacturer of ASICs. Any POW change doesn't *fix* that. If people really care about decentralization, they should consider running their own miners.
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:07:33
Same here. Good* UI, no issues.

Unless I'm reading this wrong, it looks like they're shooting for Q2 2018? That's pretty soon. Bitmain's leadtime has increased to ~3 months, which means you can count on one hand the number of S9 batches that they can push before a much more efficient chip hits the market.
It's becoming an interesting time to be a miner.

Long story short, nothing of relevance. The IRS hit up Coinbase for information, to verify people were paying their taxes. You SHOULD be self reporting, and if you're not, you're breaking the law. 
The only people affected by Coinbase giving information to the IRS, are people who are committing tax evasion.

Haha, can't argue with that!

Does saying you have 22k in bitcoin on reddit make you a target? o.O
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:52:46
No problem, thanks for the update :-D .
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:29:45
None of you know how bitcoin works. xD
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:40:45
xD Just need it to hold off long enough for me to get home. Sell high, buy low.

Are all the folks signalling BIP 91 right now, running the BTC1 software? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:16:59
Haha, understood. So it's still a bit ambiguous at the moment. Thank you for the information :-) .
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:21:43
So short answer is, "no, it's not as easy". xD
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:57:33
Ah, thank you for the clarification. That was my understanding. So are the mining pools that are currently signaling BIP91 running BIP91 compliant software?
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:43:14
So, if that's the case, what happens when BIP91 is locked in, but no clients recognize this?
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:46:42
Runescape is still around? o.O
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:22:51
Yeah, this is super true. Coinbase isn't vindictive/evil, but they do need more manpower to handle their customer service. I have no doubt that IF OP really is locked out of a 200k account, that Coinbase likely has a good reason... even if it takes a while to verbalize it. xD
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:24:43
Yeaaaaah, pretty skeptisch of OPs story.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:32:15
So, I understand them wanting to double check on some things maybe, but they're asking specifically about bitcoin. That sounds more like anti-competition stuff stuff, than "make sure this guy isn't funding terrorism".

Sorry if I'm still misunderstanding. What software implementation is orphaning these blocks? Doesn't a software change need to be put into place to cause this orphaning to happen?

"The country I live in wants to collect taxes on money I've earned, to pay for the services I use." Cry more. xD This isn't about the government "stealing your money", it's about living in a society. Hell, the government gives you a tax benefit if you LOSE money investing in bitcoin, and lessens the tax burden if you HODL for at least a year.
Stop being a child, and grow the fuck up.
