Interested in the technology, the exploration of economic systems and paradigms I would call it...
Can't really lambo with the amount of money I have right now, but if I had gone all in when I first heard about bitcoin I would be around 81 mil assuming I just held the entire time and never bought more with the gains. That would've been nice, oh well another lifetime.

If I bought bitcoin instead of gold in the amount and time when I did, instead of losing $1200 on gold I would now have 8 million bucks.
Hah it's funny to think about that, like how that kind of money is within reach for us if we just knew what the hell to do before it happens... 
REALLY makes you think about the potential opportunities currently out there... just have to know where to look I guess.

Could you sprinkle some bitcoins on the Paramus foundation? They're creating a reversible male contraceptive for the US market. Or you could invest in them longterm I would imagine, sort of like a donation.
Seems important. Thanks for being so generous, cool guy.

my philosophy is to ignore everyone's advice.

Is it a pump, or is it just more buyers than sellers... only a finite amount of it available for sale.
It seems to have hit a stride where people think this is neon jesus and everyone wants a piece of it.

Everything is unpredictable imho, just throw out any idea as to what you think is happening or might happen
