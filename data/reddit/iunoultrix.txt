The problem is that even if you passed the savings from CC processing fees on to the customers in full the discount wouldn't be nearly big enough to make those unfamiliar with bitcoin change their behavior. When was the last time you've seen a RL business advertise sub-10% savings? It's just not worth it.

Computing power isn't free - when mostly idle my processor draws far less power (underclocking itself etc.) than when running at full load. And I'd be extremely surprised if for whatever problem someone is trying to solve my home computer would not be significantly *less* energy efficient than commercial supercomputers. This scheme would be a huge waste of resources.
