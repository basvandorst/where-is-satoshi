Avoid u/LivingRoomOfSatoshi ! The exchange rates they use for transactions are 10&amp; lower than current market values. So they gouge you 10&amp; on every transaction. They keep 10&amp; of your coins on every transaction. Thats worse than the banks by far. Boycott LROS!

I didn't post it cos I didn't want to send any traffic to them. But its just realvision (dot) com
Then the video is same as post title above.

u/LivingRoomOfSatoshi gouges users with extortionate exchange rates 10&amp; lower than current market values for every transaction. If you sell 1 BTC you will get only 90&amp; of its current value using LROS. They keep 10&amp; of your coin for themselves. They are extortionate. WORSE than the banks if you could imagine it!!!!
Australians should avoid LROS like the plague!

Who cares, they are trying to profit off PlanBs work which he publishes for free. That information should be free, they shouldnt be using it as away to collect peoples email contacts and credit card details.   
So much for spreading the word on BTC.

Yeah exactly. Such fucking hypocrites. Oh we want to spread the word to support Bitcoin and everything it represents blah blah... just let us harvest your credit card and email details for a sec. 
That pompus, self-impressed Raoul Pal wanker has zero credibility.

Right so basically its about demand. Would this be an accurate way to view it:
The S/F model may turn out to be an accurate predictor of BTC price, but for that to happen it will rely on demand staying strong enough to propel the price to the kind of values the model predicts ($20k, $50k, $100k etc). 
Otherwise we could see a situation like LTC: if theres low demand, halvings seem to have little impact on price. You wont get prices running up if people aren't willing to buy and hold. 
Man I dont know. Are people seriously going to buy BTC at &gt;$20K? I mean people are buying at current prices in expectation of a run up in price, but where are the buyer / holders gunnu come from to get into the market at &gt;$20K? Seems tenuous to me.

Can someone please post a link.

Well if they want to finalise the transaction that's fine but it better be at the exchange rate I was quoted at the time I placed the order, and not the current rate. Otherwise I'd rather they paid me back the BTC.

I didnt get phished. I have full control of my Changelly account, I can see my past history of successful transactions on Changelly. Just this last one failed.  
And I have quoted the transaction ID to the customer support and they can see the failed transaction. But they say the 'security team' has to verify the transaction and it will take time.. but they cant say how long!  
They have no right to just lock people's coins like this, I am literally losing money on lost trading opportunities thanks to their action.

There shouldnt be a 'luck of the draw'. If they are running a professional service, refunds should be processed quickly not days or weeks after the event. I am losing money because of them, and so is everyone else who is in the same situation. This is NOT how an effecient, professional service is run.

This is actually starting to impact my health. I was unable to sleep last night for worrying about this. I can't get any information out of them.  
I want to know, will they process the original transaction? If so what exchange rate will they use? the current exchange rate will cause me to lose thousands, but if they use the rate I was quoted at time of the order, then I am ok with that. Otherwise will they pay back the BTC I paid for the order?  
Ive had no response from their 'security team' or their rep on reddit. This is extremely stressful.  
u/changelly_tom can you please comment on this? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:34:06
I had no idea that they had these kinds of problems. I used them a few times and the process seemed to work ok. Then when this transaction failed, I came looking on reddit and discovered that countless others have had terrible experiences.
