I'm venezuelan and all i want is to buy groceries with bitcoin but no merchant accept them

What kind of wallet offers you one time backup, if you missed it that time you are screwed
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:39:31
BTC.com wallet does not gives you access to private key or seed. I'm kinda upset that my 3.15 USD are stuck there unless i pay 1 USD on fees
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:08:39
But that is possible with localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:23:49
My question is if that fee is fair?
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:46:54
Where? 
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:22:38
Good, I'll hope Wikipedia do the same
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:58:42
False, some sellers accept like 3 dollars equivalent in Bs (at March 2017 black market dollar price)

Venezuela needs Bitcoin as a currency urgently
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:27:44
Hahahah the government just want the miners for themselves. To be honest they don't care what's illegal they only mess with people who is making money so they can steal it

I'm from South America but my bank account is in the US. Coinbase is not supported in my country

63 bitcoins wtfuuuucckkkk
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:54:56
Living in Venezuela, the country with the highest inflation rate in the world and merchants have no idea of what bitcoin is
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:07:00
Bitcoin volatility and stability compared to the Venezuelan currency? Would totally worth all those "complications". 
We are having these economic issues due to government wrongdoing:
-Cash shortages
-Credit and debit cards systems overload due to cash shortage and a bad platform (the government owns the only company in the country that provides phone and Internet services) 
I have spent HOURS in a line just to buy candy with my debit card to give to my relatives on this December and all that would be solved if the merchant accepted bitcoin, I don't care if I had to pay a small fee and wait 10 minutes 
@_date: 2016-11-06 16:42:11
I want bitcoin to become more popular instead :(
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:57:10
Is there any way to check if a known public key is linked to a known private key?
@_date: 2016-11-06 14:51:55
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:48:42
I lived in Venezuela. Everything else is more reliable than Bolivars, we started trading goods for food like medieval times. Nobody wants Bolivars
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:34:08
It may not but is a better alternative for countries with hyperinflation 
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:03:43
Why is this a big deal?
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:01:34
Great ill send that to my family in Mexico
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:25:35

Already tried m/0'/0/0 =/
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:21:48
The thing is that in Venezuela we are having problems to make payments to merchants.
I did not lie about making a line for hours.
Everything here is a huge line to try to do a deposit, using an ATM, buying groceries, etc...
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:40:41
Electrum, ease of use and multiplatform 
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:28:33
A new address that starts with "12P" I don't think I should have the original Bread public address if I reinstalled the app
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:45:51
I let it sync for a couple of days still £0
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:49:26
Yeah still £0
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:13:29
A domain Web name
@_date: 2019-02-27 12:42:17
Disappointed Venezuela is not there
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:09:12
Yeah Steam accepting Bitcoin went under the table, I didn't see any news about it until I tried to buy a game. This is huge 
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:33:18
You are joking

Pointless. Cash is scarce and useless in Venezuela
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:39:23
Yes, I think people is too stupid to keep privates keys (myself included) that's why I think services like coinbase are a necessary evil, they act like banks, we trust our money to a third party. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:16:42
Venezuelan here: Petro is a cryptocurrency controlled by the government, created to bypass US economic blockage. They want Venezuelans to adopt it but only because it will benefit them not to improve the economy
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:16:21
Hyperinflation sucks at levels you can't imagine (lived there) 
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:49:17
newegg.com and gyft.com accept bitcoins
@_date: 2016-10-05 14:07:19
I want this to be mainstream to stop using banks. Every cell of my body hate banks
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:05:19
Hahaha seriously? There are still people using coinbase and still running to complain here?
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:28:55
No we can't, only the rich people can do that. The Bolivar is devaluated that means converting it to another currencies (USD or BTC) is grotesquely expensive
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:27:46
What I mean is that only rich people can buy goods with bitcoin importing them from another country, wich is how some venezuelans buy goods. No local merchant accept bitcoins, only the rich people can exchange Bolivar to Bitcoin at the exorbitant black market rate (wich is the only way to exchange Bolivar to another currency) and paying import fees
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:46:30
not your keys, not your coins
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:23:42
I need coins so i can buy flight tickets and leave, it is no joke
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:15:47
Please explain
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:21:16
Mmhh I don't trust people keeping this electronic cash with no way to recover it if you loose them, if people wants give their bitcoins to 3rd parties (just like they were doing with banks) let them do it. That's the beauty of bitcoin, you have the choice
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:09:25
How can i ban Coinbase on this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:09:40
Yes
