Correct and you can actually buy the BTC back right away as well and still claim the loss. There are no wash sale rules with Bitcoin.

The author makes important points. This is why merchants must start offering discounts to people using bitcoins for them to become mainstream.  Otherwise it is not in your interest to pay for things with bitcoins unless you mined them or you have a large capital gain and want to take some money off the table.

'Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.' - what this author is proposing is that no changes be made to Bitcoin unless 100% of miner/users/core devs agree. Unless he agrees, no changes can be made. This doesn't seem realistic. Majority rules. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:26:29
Love your store - One question that I would like to ask you as a merchant:  why do you not offer customers who pay in bitcoin a small discount (e.g.) 2-3% based on the savings in fees that you receive and to make up for the customer's costs associated with getting the bitcoins?  Is this because credit card agreements prevent you from doing this or is it because it is too small a group to give an advantage too (ie can't make the CC customers feel like second class citizens if they are 99% of the clientele), or some other reason?  One problem that we seem to face is that merchants are willing to accept bitcoin but customers don't have much incentive to spend it (in fact it usually in their best interest to use a CC). thx
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:25:52
OK- I guess my main complaint is not being able to pay for the order at the check out time, but rather have to first get an account credit with Foodler bucks.  I often find I am a couple of dollars short when I am checking out and then have to go back to the bitcoin page to donate a few more dollars.
Also- absolutely ridiculous that they make you wait for a confirmation before they credit your account.  It is not plausible that people are going to try a double spend attack for a $50 take out meal.  There's plenty of time to cancel the order in the theoretic chance that someone would try this.

Not true. You can buy and spend almost instantaneously so if there is a discount you can lock in the gain quickly enough to avoid any fluctuations in the Bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:30:55
One key issue driving the greater increase in merchant vs consumer adoption- too many merchants seem to be hoping for the benefits of accepting bitcoin ( eg saving on credit card fees, publicity) without  offering consumers enough incentive to pay with bitcoin (exception  is Gyft).  Why would a new consumer buy bitcoins on an exchange (and pay a 1% fee) to buy something at the same price that they can get with a credit card?  The merchants need to incentivize consumers to pay with bitcoin - otherwise early adopters /miners will continue to sell off their coins to merchants without new buyers coming in. price will continue to fall and new consumers will stay away.

That would be interesting. Should work if you do some basic screening of the merchants.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:48:56
Not in the long term- if you spend bitcoin as a 1 time action, sure it counts as a sell order.  But if your spending is part of long-term pattern of transacting with bitcoin, when you sell, you will also be buying when you need to use it again (or getting paid in bitcoin in some other way).  This buying will offset the selling over time.  As more and more of the persons transactions are done in bitcoin, their net BTC holding will rise and price will increase.  Ways to spend at merchants will increase usability and transactional demand over the long term.

Bitgo allows you to control 2 out of 3 of the multisig keys. Therefore, it is a not a traditional '3rd party service' in the way that some of the other comments imply. You can spend your coins on both sides of the fork just as you could with a paper wallet.  Bitgo provided more protections for you against loss or theft.

All methods of storing bitcoins involve some risks. With Coinbase, the risk is that they will have a major theft that is not covered by their insurance. Also - as has been pointed out , if you are engaging in illegal activity your account could be seized.  Good thing about coinbase is that they protect you from making a mistake with your cold storage, losing your password or private key in a fire or physical theft, or in case you become incapacitated. They use good practices for cold storage but one problem is that you can't confirm your vault balance in the blockchain. I prefer xapo vault for this reason.  For the vast majority of people, coinbase is safer and cheaper than trying to store your coins yourself. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 02:46:35
This is the source of the base imbalance but the short sellers then amplify the problem and scare away the new buyers. It is self

You can definitely write off your loss and deduct on your tax return. Also- there are no wash sale rules, so you could buy it right back again if you wanted and still profit if the price comes back.  There is a limit on the losses if you don't have any capital gains to offset.

@_date: 2014-03-22 01:34:57
That's basically right.  If it's a local merchant, I am willing to do it this way to cut out visa/amex from the transaction. By not paying with a credit card, I feel I am giving them a tip.  But for a big online merchant, they should offer a small discount.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:38:43
That's not correct. If people were conducting, for example, $1 billion dollars worth of transactions each day in bitcoin,  the market cap of bitcoin would have to be at least that large to support that volume of transactions.  Remember, people would be continuously buying and selling in an equilibrium. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:17:02
Then you can transfer it to your bitcoin account.

Spending and replacing your bitcoin (i.e. buying the same amount at an exchange that you spend) is a much better way to support the value of your investment than hoarding.  It costs very little to replace your spent bitcoins at an exchange and if you use them at a merchant who gives you a discount, it costs nothing to spend and replace your bitcoin (as opposed to using fiat.)  Maybe some hoarders can get a free ride, but they also reduce their potential returns by keeping bitcoin mostly irrelevant as a form of payment at the present time.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:11:40
Agree- love the service but i am surprised that they haven't taken a few simple steps with bitpay to make it less cumbersome to pay with BTC. I'm not even asking for a discount but just to pay the balance of the order like I would with a credit card. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:46:57
Since all BTC transactions are recorded on the blockchain, it is a trivial software problem to comply with the tax reporting requirement.  We just need a few wallet developers to implement a solution and then it should have no real impact on BTCs use in day to day transactions
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:04:21
I agree that the proposed 'USD/BTC relative value metric' is based on market data rather than something you measure external to the market.  But if you are making a decision about buying or selling BTC, you may want to make some evaluation of whether the current market price is justified.  This metic may provide one way of thinking about that issue. Alternatively, you could just count the number of mentions per day on Twitter, as some do, but I find that harder to interpret.

You need to calm down and stop embarrassing yourself. You are completely missing the point of this discussion.  
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:32:03
The key here is whether the merchants will really offer more discounts to consumers who pay with bitcoin.  Its mostly a bad deal to pay with bitcoin unless you are getting a discount.  If you pay with a credit card you get award points, better protections, etc.  If you pay with bitcoin, it actually costs you  an additional ~ 1% fee (to coinbase, e.g.) to replace the bitcoins you just spent.  
@_date: 2014-12-25 17:04:37
This is a great solution to current economic disincentive to pay for things with bitcoin.  The merchants can't give a selective discount to consumers who pay with bitcoin (and antagonize their other customers) but they could agree to use a discounted exchange rate that still benefits merchant over credit card but would also allow the consumer to replace their bitcoins at same cost.  
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:17:42
Your missing a key point- if the bitcoin block chain is used to record important transactions (like equity sales), then more and more people will have a vested interest
In the security of the blockchain. The only way to keep it secure is to keep the value of bitcoins high because they are what the miners receive as reward for securing the blockchain (hashing). Therefore the more important the block chain is the more valuable bitcoins will become.

What you are describing is simply a reluctance to pay capital gains tax.  You made a great investment by buying BTC at a low price and in the US people have to pay capital gain taxes when they realize gains, just like you would if you had bought a stock at a low price and later sold it for a large gain.  My point is that reporting the gains can be made as simple as when you sell a stock at a brokerage with a few updates to the wallet software.  
@_date: 2014-06-25 11:17:07

The long term future of mining is millions of users of Bitcoin mining as a donation to the network to protect their bitcoins. When this happens they won't have the pressure to sell since they are not doing it for profit. The Coinbase award is going to end anyway and I don't think transaction fees will support industrial mining so hopefully this will come soon.

Agree- major disappointment that there has been no growth for bitpay.  Probably reflects that it almost always better to pay with credit card and get the 2% cash back from the credit card company then pay with Bitcoin and have to spend an additional 0.5% to replace them.  The economics are terrible for buying things w bitcoins when there is a a fiat alternative. Only reason is really just philosophical. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:23:48
Agreed - they just seem like 1 year behind coinbase and I was hoping to see some real innovation. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:20:31
I have been using it for several months and it is absolutely legitimate.  There are several fiat based micro loan sites that operate in a similar way: none of them have a mechanism to prevent the borrower from defaulting - rather the borrower has an incentive to pay back to build reputation and then get access to better rates. Also- you as the lender have to evaluate the loans and decide whether they look trustworthy. Need to diversify your risk.  This is an important bitcoin application since it provided better geographical diversity compared  to fiat micro loan sites. My apr right now is about 15%. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:12:04
If that is your approach- merchants will stop accepting it and your investment will decline in value.  Bitcoins value is related to how much people use it.

I know that markets can be irrational over short durations of time but eventually people will realize that they are paying ~$4.30 for an investment that can only return $0.30 if they keep holding it.  Eventually the greater fool will not be there to buy it back and the price will crash

This could be the tipping point for P2Pool that we have all been waiting for. Once P2Pool gets to ~ 2% of the network hash rate, the high variance problem will be substantially reduced and then all who care about decentralized mining will be able to join without the financial risk that currently exists. This vote will make or break P2Pool.

1. Sometimes you can save money based on a discount for using bitcoin. This is important over the long term.  Rather than having a merchant price include a subsidy for your frequent flyer program or cash back program, I would rather have a discount at the time of sale.  
2. Sometimes you want the convenience of a credit card but don't want to screw the party you are transacting with a 3% fee. This is relevant especially when donating to charity. Why would you want 3% of your donation to go to the Visa corporation? 
3. Some merchants no longer accept credit cards due to fees. Bitcoin is a way to pay them in 'cash' without having to go to the ATM. 
4, paying with bitcoin can be faster and simpler especially for digital purchases when you don't want to set up account and provide personal info. 
Overall it's not for every transaction, but good to have some to use when you can and support an open alternative payment system that is not controlled by giant companies that are no longer adding real value.

By comparing to ghash.io, you are completely misrepresenting the incentives and risks.  When ghash gets 51%, they can attack the entire bitcoin network and there are several well known scenarios where they could have a financial incentive to do so. If petamine has 51% of P2Pool, they are still taking a big risk due to variance. They need other people to join to make the variance go down and soon they would fall below 50%. If they attacked the share chain, everyone would leave and they would be solo mining, which would be bad for them.

It's up to you. Cold storage is generally considered safest but you don't have immediate access to your BTC  (takes 24-48h to retrieve on Xapo). Also -keep in mind that many people do cold storage on their own rather than use services like xapo. Down side of self- storage is you have to keep track of pieces of paper that could get lost or you might forget an important password. With Xapo, you don't have to worry about any of that but you do have to trust xapo.

That's the beauty of purse.io
The buyer purchases the bitcoins from me using a credit card. The fiat amount goes to amazon to send me the items that I want to purchase and the buyer receives my bitcoins once the item arrives.  So net result is fiat to Amazon, items to me, bitcoins transferred from me to buyer. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:31:51
No. Many people spend bitcoin and buy back an equivalent or greater amount later as it becomes more useful to them

Fine but my point is that nothing would happen to your deposit if the Bitcoin network shut down. It would still be there safe and sound as a fiat holding. You do have to trust that in this doomsday scenario they would come with a solution for their customers, but I would rather be in this situation than having held onto bitcoins that would then have zero value.

Anytime you trade BTC for USD, you are making an assessment about their relative values as currencies.  For example, you would buy BTC if you felt that it would make it more convenient to purchase something, your purchasing power would be higher over time, etc. The market price reflects the equilibrium of these decisions and right now signals that collectively individuals consider USD to be 1600 times more valuable as a currency than BTC.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:39:38
Bitreserve is essentially functioning like an exchange. All exchanges charge about 0.5% both when you buy and when you sell. The difference in using this service (as opposed to circle or coinbase) to sell your bitcoins when you think price is going to fall and then buy them back when price is going to rise is that here you get instant access to your bitcoins again. You dont have to wait 7 days for the fiat transfer from your bank. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:14:13
This project may be a scam.  It is currently down and after paying $10 in bitcoin, my so-called node has never been functional

They can protect you even if Bitcoin goes to 0.  They hold your money as fiat. So it will still have its value even if Bitcoin goes to 0.  Agree that technically to withdraw it again as Bitcoin, there would have to be some non-zero vale like 0.0000001 cents per Bitcoin but in this Catastrophic case, there is no reason to think they wouldn't find a way to distribute your funds in fiat. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:51:09
If you are spending and replacing, the current market price makes no difference (because you will be buying at the same low price that you are spending at).  When people start hoarding as the price falls, it leads to a negative feedback where price falls, people stop using bitcoin, bitcoin becomes irrelevant.

If you go to the advanced settings, you can set Circle to handle bitcoin URLs.  Almost all the bitcoin addressed allow you to click on them so that you don't have to use a qr reader.  Even so, circle definitely needs a mobile app with qr reader.

I prefer xapo. Your entire deposit in the vault is insured. Coinbase insures only their hot wallet not their cold storage. Also - xapo vault is a single address that you can check to confirm your balance on the blockchain. You cannot confirm your coinbase deposit on the blockchain. Xapo does have a nominal fee but storage is the main business for xapo whereas for coinbase it is more of a side project.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:14:32
How can that possibly be true? Do you really believe that there could be 1 billion $ worth of bitcoin transactions occurring every minute and yet simultaneously the market cap of all bitcoins could be worth , for example, 50 cents ? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:55:14
Right but think about if you want to send your friend 20$ to pay them back for something.  You don't want to send BTC and then have it be worth $19 by the time they login to claim it. This way you send the BTC to their usd account and it remains $20.  
Also this service allows you to peg to fiat without having a bank account to hold it directly.  The unbanked cannot afford to lose 20% of their money due to volatility. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:43:10
There is no way to prevent someone from defaulting even on the fiat sites or any recourse. You have to spread around the risk. There will definitely be some defaults.

Right- but if they offered a discount that 0.1% could grow quickly into something more meaningful. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:09:17
My point is that the record keeping can be easily automated since all the transactions are on the blockchain. I agree we should work to get an exemption from the IRS  for transactions under e.g $250 but even without it , the nature of bitcoin makes it feasible for the record keeping to be a minimal burden. Would be impossible without the blockchain.

Not true- Gold always will have some demand because of its use in Jewelry and in some industrial uses.  Bitcoin has value solely based on its utility.  If people dont use it, people will stop accepting it for payment, and it will then have no value.

You are an imbecile.  Of course the velocity can be greater than 1.  Can you point to any real world examples where the daily transactional volume of a currency is lower than its market cap?  Of course it is theoretically possible in a thought experiment but it would imply a daily velocity  that is hundreds of times higher than that of any real world currency.  The proposal that the market cap of a currency is completely un related is its transactional volume is ludicrous.

Good to see someone making sense here. You are correct. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:40:01
Right- The idea was that it would be useful to have some metric, like the P/E ratio for stocks, that could give you a sense of the relative market value and could be tracked over time.  Knowing the P/E ratio doesn't tell you whether you should buy or sell, but it does give you some information to help make that decision.

@_date: 2014-03-22 03:28:41
There is an equilibrium going on that fluctuates over time between USD and BTC and this is simply a way to quantify it.  Looking at the BTC price by itself, or the number of transactions per day, etc., doesn't give you any obvious way to know if the current BTC price is a good value.   What other way could you evaluate this question?

@_date: 2014-03-02 17:51:59
Main point is that only thing that drives wider adoption of bitcoin is merchants (who have real benefits when people pay with bitcoin as opposed to a credit card) share the benefit with consumers.  Otherwise, most rational consumers will keep paying with a credit card.  1% would go a long way IMHO.

Bitcoin is not for every purchase but it's good to have some on hand for the following reasons 
- take advantage of discounts eg 20% off all purchases at Starbucks with coinforcofee.com or 10% off Amazon with purse.io
- use it for online purchases where you don't need to provide your address eg downloads
- use it for groups you want to support like charities or local stores as you don't have to give a 3% cut to the credit card co. 
- micropayments / tips

One thing you are overlooking - the merchants have to pay fees for the benefits credit cards give to the consumer.  In order to avoid those fees, they may decide to offer discounts / incentives to consumers who pay with bitcoin. Consumers may decide these discounts are worth more than the consumer protections provided by the credit cards. There are a lot of times when a 2-3% discount would be better than having fraud protection.

Most people on this reddit will tell you to use cold storage or Trezor- but you need to ask yourself- is there any chance you will lose the paper/device or have them destroyed in a fire/earthquake or theft, or forget a password or die and not have your heirs know the password?  If there is any possibility of these events, you may want to consider an insured service (like Xapo or Coinbase) that will maintain your private keys for you even though most people here consider that heresy.

How can you call it a statesmen of fact if it hasn't happened yet? It's an opinion about the impact of future supply and demand on transaction fees,  but I think that it is a mistaken one as demand will not materialize in the way that is assumed.

Right- but still easy to create a hot wallet that is used primarily for payments. Agree there is a bit of tracking that would be needed but not realistic to think that big gains on BTC price fluctuations wouldn't be taxed (even if treated as a currency this would be true). Also- this way losses can also be deducted.  I don't think record keeping  needs to be a barrier to small transactions as it can be mostly automated.

@_date: 2015-05-07 16:14:40
I don't think so.  Until bitcoin becomes much more widely used and adopted for mission critical transactions, people will not pay higher fees to use the network. Creating false scarcity by limiting block size will simply discourage adoption and result in people finding alternatives elsewhere. Much more important to support growth and adoption at this point while the block reward is still creating mining incentive.

I have used this service for a long time (it used to be called coinforcoffee) and definitely vouch for it.  I don't know how they afford the 20% discount but was thinking that maybe Gyft actually has very generous profit margins after the 3% cash back they offer.

Also - one thing that is new is the industrial mines that made huge investments and need to sell the mined bitcoins to pay expenses. The early home miners were hobbyists that didn't need to sell their coins and treated them like an investment.

@_date: 2015-01-03 19:46:24
The price has going down steadily. Occasionally a big investor can reverse the trend but otherwise there is a fairly constant erosion of the price due to the 3600 new coins that are mined each day. They are not all sold at once but they eventually come to market.  As the price falls, they should be easier to absorb but the market will not be healthy until daily trade volume is greater than 300,000 bitcoins (excluding the bot trades on no fee Chinese exchanges). A market this robust could absorb the new coins when they are ~&lt;1% of daily trade volume.

Maybe there is a small short-term boost in price if everyone was hoarding, but long term it will make them worthless. There are simply not enough people using/accepting bitcoin to push bitcoin past the tipping point.  The only way to drive adoption is to spend and replace.  
Also, in terms of immediate impact on price, spending with replacement is the same as hoarding.

I'm not saying they aren't absorbing tiny orders on the upside but when you are allowed to trade with yourself it's very easy to turn a market to an uptick with minimal risk to yourself, especially when you have a huge incentive to see the price rise due to your mining operations.

In fact, it has been questioned many times whether bigger blocks will increase centralization. 
First - costs of storage and bandwidth are going down.  Therefore, blocks can get bigger with costs of running mode staying same or even falling. 
Second- if bigger blocks lead to more people using Bitcoin (by keeping transaction fees low), then more people may decide to run nodes and decentralization will increase. 
Therefore- the entire premise of your argument is misconceived.

Right but it will take too long for equilibrium to be reached by difficulty adjusting downward. That has never happened with alt coins.  by that time losing fork will be abandoned. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:40:56
I don't think that will happen. Takes 2 weeks minimum for difficulty to adjust but that could go up to 8-10 weeks if hash rate falls by 75% and by that time old chain will be dead. Also - there is only 1 Bitcoin - no way for exchanges to allow both chains to trade as all transactions on new chain will result in changes in old chain for coins mined prior to fork.  
@_date: 2015-08-27 01:30:56

But that's why fast sync doesn't build over a prior fast sync- you only can fast sync the initial time- if your node gets too big you resync the entire chain and then it is about 15gb.  State trie pruning keeps it about 15 gb without any need to resync.  But you are wrong - there is no security advantage to running a full archival node compared to state trie pruning- it is just an option if you need to do a research project.  Sorry.

Why does it matter if CC still exist ? All that matters for a merchant is to increase the percentage of their revenue that comes with the lowest fees but is still convenient for consumers to pay with. That will be Bitcoin Or cash but cash doesn't work well in most settings. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:22:52
No question there is a chicken vs egg problem here - if consumers bear all the costs of purchasing and spending bitcoins, not that many will use it. If merchants are willing to provide a small subsidy on the exchange rate (eg 0.5%), then people could spend Bitcoin without incurring extra costs and a lot more would start doing so. It would still be a major benefit to merchants after it scales up since you would avoid the 2-3% fee that CCs charge. But if you want to take the short term view, then merchants will be stuck with credit cards for ever.

That's not the point. The merchant should subsidize the exchange rate so that the consumer can repurchase the bitcoins they are spending for the same cost of the item that they are buying. As it is now, it costs a consumer about 1% more to buy something with Bitcoin compared to fiat if they plan to replace the bitcoins they are spending, after you factor in the exchange rate and the bid/ ask spread. If consumers don't replace the bitcoins they are spending there is no sustainable Bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:38:25
The subsidy would be smaller than the 2-3% fee they are avoiding in credit card fees, so yes they should subsidize it.

Although it is possible that a poorly implemented Btc option could distract some potential customers, there are a lot of merchants big and small that are very satisfied with Bitcoin. There is no way that companies like Microsoft, Expedia, and Soylent would be offering a Bitcoin option if it resulted in a loss of sales.

Is there any other voting system that makes a decision based on the 20th percentile vote? It's very experimental.

Absolutely agree- the 20th percentile rule will lead to collusion of the miners in the majority, which is a terrible outcome for bitcoin security.  This voting mechanism will never be successful at protecting the minority view miners and should be abandoned.  Using the 50th percentile makes much more sense for bitcoin security and it is way almost all voting processes work to resolve complex issues.  
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:47:37
My point is that the merchants should have option to subsidize the exchange rate to reduce the cost to the consumer and still allow the payment processor to stay in business. The merchant is gaining the most by having consumers pay w Bitcoin but they are putting too much burden on the consumer to shoulder the costs of buying Bitcoin in the first place.  Until they provide some subsidy, consumer adoption is not going to take off at least for main stream commerce as alternative to credit card.

Of course- but why should a group with such a minority of the hashing power (20%) be able to derail what the vast majority believes is best for Bitcoin?  Much more likely that the median vote is going to lead to the best outcome for blocksize than the 20th percentile. There are no good examples of important decisions that are made by bottom 20th percentile rule - whereas many complex decisions are successfully resolved by majority vote.

First of all - all you have to is first transfer dollars to your USD wallet on coinbase. Yes this takes 4-5 days because you are moving dollars from your bank to Coinbase's bank - surely you can't blame Bitcoin for the time it takes to move dollars around. Then once you have the dollars at coinbase you can buy BTC instantly and withdraw wherever you want instantly. There is no risk of having the price fluctuate while you are waiting for the dollars to move around. If you want to make your bitcoins anonymous at that point, it's easy to do.

You are right the merchants need to pass on some of their savings from being paid in Bitcoin to the consumers.  Best way would be to subsidize the exchange rate so that consumers could at least repurchase the bitcoins they are spending for the same cost of the item. Problem is chicken vs egg. Not enough Bitcoin consumers right now for merchants to care so we have to keep subsidizing them. Eventually tide will turn.

A mining pool with 20% of the hashing power can permanently block any increase to block size.  So if this is what people mean by an 'attack', it is not fixed. It is very unusual to use the 20th percentile of vote to make a decision. Much more common to use the median or 33rd percentile to give more weight to the majority opinion. The 20th percentile was just arbitrarily picked because it sounded good to jgarzic. Could easily result in control by 1 mining pool.

All mining is now centralized in china

Thanks ! Agreed appearing more legitimate is more important than explaining how the discount is achieved.  I think including press reviews and more info about your team as well as any guarantees you can make about the cards being legitimate would go along way. I really love your service but I wonder whether it would be better to actually provide a fixed virtual card, similar to Gyft, as opposed to keeping the number on a webpage as sometimes if I don't use the card for a long time I have found that it isn't there when I try to back to the webpage. (You have always provided a prompt refund in these cases, but still it can be a bit of a hassle and it can undermine confidence some as compared to the starbucks card you can buy on Gyft for example.

I suggest you consider Xapo.  I know a lot of people here prefer self-store options, but the biggest risk to your bitcoins with the other suggestions is actually you making a mistake- e.g. losing a piece of paper, forgetting a password, etc.  If you must retain the all private keys, then BitGo or Coinbase vault are good alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:33:30
I haven't had any problems with xapo and trust them more than I trust myself to store my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:54:40
Gyft accepts Bitcoin and gives you store credit. You get more credit paying w Bitcoin vs fiat. How does this undermine Bitcoin? Gyft is the reason to spend Bitcoin.

Can you do this large scale to bring the prices into alignment?
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:45:55
You use the blockchain to buy the gift card.

This twitter source is false.  The average fee for a n ETH transaction is 4 cents and you can send a transaction for under 1 cent and have it confirm in 2-3 Minutes.  The data is here :  - sorry that reality doesn't fit with your narrative

Another possibility is a small mining box in every home that people run as a donation to the network (at cost of eg a lightbulb) and collectively these provide a huge amount of mining power to secure the network
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:05:18
its legit.  they have been around for a while.  also ran coinforcoffee
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:59:08
The transaction fees will go down as they raise the blocksize limit.  Supply and demand 
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:50:18
your comments are related to current versions of bitcoin payment software/hardware and have nothing to with bitcoin itself
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:38:39
Have you ever heard of campaign donations? People who care are willing to spend a lot of money on elections
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:10:07
I just checked - it is working fine for me
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:20:39
I bet if you asked the pledgers, they would be happy to let you take the current donations and made a version 0.15 (instead of version 0.2) and then launch a new campaign when people are more familiar w lighthouse and your project. Hate to see you stop working on this.  You were asking for a lot of money in a short time - can't you split it up a bit more ? 
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:02:26
Don't you think it's worth it? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:04:11
Look- its a fact that billions of dollars are bet worldwide on the superbowl.  Its enough money to move the bitcoin markets.  Has nothing to do with the universe revolving around US. Give me a fucking break
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:51:15
Awesome - but how do you handle transaction fees? They would be nearly as high as the 0.05 cent tip
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:50:54
Great use of lighthouse - donated 0.3 Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:16:44
I prefer nitrogensports.eu
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:33:41
I think lighthouse is great and contributed to the Bitsquare drive. 
One problem is that it is hard to find a repository of important Bitcoin related projects that are using lighthouse.  
@_date: 2015-03-29 04:18:09
I store all my Btc w xapo.  Safest option there is. Would never try to keep track of a piece of paper. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:23:41
Thanks a lot 1 coffee
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:29:58
I think you Bitsquare needs to give the campaign a bit more time- people are still figuring out Lighthouse (its still in beta afterall).  Would hate to see them call it so quickly
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:28:45
Eventually the txt fee will be lower - cool project 1 beer
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:21:45
people that use bitcoin will like to have a say in the protocol.  This was Satoshi's original vision - 1 cpu/1 vote.  As long as it can be done relatively cheaply (e.g. $100/year) and you have a lot of people (e.g. millions) who use bitcoin for their transactions, I think you could get a critical mass that was mining as a donation to the network.  Much better than crowdfunding contracts which contributes to centralization.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:05:25
Working fine for me.  Did you try mobile app? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:39:13
This would be amazing - I love use cases like this that cannot be done with fiat
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:48:54
FYI- I think there is a problem with your lighthouse server- I am receiving a 'response code 500' error when I tried to make a pledge on lighthouse. No pledges are showing up Lighthouse.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:51:52
Bitsquare- there should be a service like this
