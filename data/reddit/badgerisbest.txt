Ya I think those parties work together. The people that want to trade it actively and always want high volitility are opposing.

Im just coming from to tell you to never try and "invade" our sub again. 
You probably have little understanding of how our credit problems arise in the first place, from runaway spending and problems of bad budgets and deferring payments from large amounts of debt. Bitcoin fixes absolutely none of that. 
We've had problems investing in various high risk bonds to finance our debt. Even with being shitty bonds, these are still incredibly safer than bitcoins wild speculation prices. 
Bitcoin is incredibly unstable. It's little than a gambling chip stock right now to the practical government or banking institutions. If our government our any of our citizens had put their life or city savings into that currency we could be seeing up to 70% shifts in our net worth which could ruin a city for the next generation. Which have all been going down too. I see the value of a bitcoin price has dropped another $100 of USA since the last time I checked, almost 28% when it was around $350. The last $1000 bubble was so tremendous and wild that I'm pretty sure it's not happening anytime soon unless it slowly went back up over 50 years or so. 
Luckily the community mostly agrees, you posted something very stupid. Take that as a wakeup call.
Maybe in 10 years when bitcoin has a stable daily price we could actually use it in society.
