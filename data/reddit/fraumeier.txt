Not in an unregulated market.

Yea. So there are two scenarios in this case. Either the block size will be too small to fulfill demand. Then fees will be high, which is bad for Bitcoin.
Or the block size will be big enough to cover transaction demand (to. Be expected with lightning). Then the miners will make very little to no money and the hash rate will crash, which is bad for Bitcoin.
Basically that's the reason why I'm long term bearish on Bitcoin.

There problem with proof if work is that it burns resources (electricity). These resources need to be paid for, either by inflation or by transaction fees.
This is a fundamental problem for any crypto currency using proof of work and it will be the doenfall of Bitcoin.
Let's have a look at proof of stake:
I show that I have capital, lock it up, and the community has to come up with a return on investment in exchange. Let's say that's 5% a year, so for a 1 Million capital securing it, the community has to pay 50 thousand.
Now look at proof if work:
I show that I have capital, I waste it by buying mining equipment and electricity, and the community has to come up not only with thr capital, but also with a RoI.
For a 1 Million capital backing, the community has to buckle up 1 Million plus 50 K (minus maybe the value of the mining equipment at the end of the year.)

I don't know if Facebook is a good example considering that it looks like they're going the way of MySpace.
