Even NY?

I agree. He is a constitutionalist. He respects the bill of rights, which includes the 10A - which says that anything not explicitly outlined within these pages of amendments is left for the states to decide.
How do people not understand that concept?

Welcome to NY.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:23:49
Reading the first 2 words of your post I honestly thought this was going to be a dogecoin related reply.
much sadness. so disappoint.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:23:12
And furby's!
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:14:18
We've got that and the Sullivan Act... yeah, he's done.
tl;dr - NY sucks if you aren't part of the wealthy elite ruling class.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:48:48
You must be fun at parties.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:34:00
I would maybe introduce to such a site.
Seems like a solid manufactured spending opportunity.
Ack - just saw your note about not working in the US. :-/
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:40:00
That is because he is pro-small-government, and pro-Constitution.
There is no "right to marry" in the constitution nor the bill of rights, ergo - Latin - via the 10A it is up to the states, not the feds, to decide.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:40:23
Care to back that up with anything?
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:34:20
Agreed. he makes too much sense.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:37:37


I don't want the government to have ANYTHING to do with regulating the internet in ANY way.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:47:29
It doesn't, but the overbearing catch-all clause is in the 10A in which all powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government fall on the states to decide.
@_date: 2015-05-11 21:22:29
In its truest form, certainly, however net neutrality as a political buzzword has become government involvement/regulation of the internet. Something I will never be in favor of.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:06:43
Why would coinbase care that imgur is over capacity?
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:36:32
Like marriage - where in the constitution does it say you have a right to smoke mj?
Hint- it doesnt, therefore, via the 10A - it is a right left up to the states to decide.
@_date: 2012-09-05 00:55:39
Loving the site btw. You weren't kidding about how slick it looks.
@_date: 2012-10-18 17:48:18
Better call Saul.

Color me crazy, but that doesn't seem like a terrible idea, aside from the whole decentralized currency aspect that wouldn't play well with it.
@_date: 2012-10-18 17:48:58
Or relish in the fact that BTC isn't really tracked by the IRS and they wouldn't technically know how to deal with it. Treat it like a commodity/property.
@_date: 2012-09-19 10:50:49
Reminds me of the Merit commercials with William Debay.
@_date: 2012-09-13 06:27:51
There is no such thing as bad press.
@_date: 2012-10-18 17:48:00
I actually like this setup.
@_date: 2012-10-18 17:44:31
I have some silver coins that I'd be willing to sell you for equivalent bitcoins.
I move BTC and use it to buy stuff all the time, so don't you worry - it will be back in circulation in no time.
@_date: 2012-09-13 06:30:54
Love it. If I didn't just start with BTC this month I would be sending you coins instead of asking for them. Cheers!
Edit- just got mine!!! :D
@_date: 2012-09-08 18:51:01
Personally. I wouldn't keep all that much in any kind of online wallet. Transfer to your computer after each transaction. That would keep you covered in the event of any kind of default.
@_date: 2012-09-08 18:48:17
I see shit like this on ebay from time to time. Most of it is done in copper bullion, so its much more affordable.
I'm a bit of a silverbug, but I'm not jumping on this. Too rich for my blood.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:21:11
This same logic applies to governmental attempts to ban firearms or drugs
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:20:51
This is going to raise concerns with the whole tax and what not if I'm not mistaken. 
I tried to figure out a way to purchase a house for silver, noting that the face value on the currency is substantially less than the value of the pm. My accountant (who is like a brother to me, he's family) couldn't figure it out and just steered me away from it.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:41:59
I'd gladly trade you 2 BTC for two silver eagles then.
@_date: 2013-02-23 02:04:45
I haven't gotten a single lead on local bitcoins. I guess my area is just a dry market.
@_date: 2013-08-12 22:24:58
NY trying to regulate something? *Noooooo*. Surely this is from the onion?
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:03:48
I've had a handful coins from trading and mining. My "buy" price average was like $15ish.
In the process of cashing out fully for other commodoties - mostly silver, copper, and ammo, thanks to the various denizens of the reddit communities. :)
@_date: 2013-01-29 15:36:12
Always bothers the crap out of me that I can't do that.
I try every couple of days or so - in hopes that they've implemented it.
@_date: 2013-03-05 14:05:24
I agree, and I respect that.
I started using it more frequently to purchase things online. Not a total liquidation, but definitely not in the "holding mentality" anymore.
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:21:09
Is that even illegal though?
I don't buy into "conspiracy" style charges. Its one step closer to thought police...
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:47:56
I always operate half up front, half upon receipt. I've only dealt with fellow redditors and people on my hunting board though. Never had an issue in maybe a dozen or so transactions (including a few that were several hundred dollar ones).
Sorry to hear OP.
@_date: 2013-09-08 02:37:05
I'd be more concerned about CA gun laws than worrying about BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:42:24
From the mouth of babes...
@_date: 2013-07-11 17:07:09
TIL Digg is still relevant.
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:43:06
I wish I hadn't used 2 BTC to buy myself silver for Christmas. If I had just waited I could have gotten like double :(
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:15:50
So it goes by "fair market value" then? Okay - perhaps my accountant is worth more than what I pay him (nothing - again he's family).
Curious how this would apply to silver if I were to buy a house or land using pre-65 quarters or half dollars. Could I get away with reporting the face value - or would I have to report the actual silver content price?
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:49:06
We need to ban iPods. Think of the children!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:58:43
I would rather have some form of two step authorization like this, than get hosed for identity theft and have to fight it out later.
