I actually think a tip jar would let us see some higher quality content posted, because who know, you might get a donation. It worked with YouTube, it might actually convince me to start reading Facebook. The only shit I see on Facebook is a damn cheese cracker, several times. 
Nonetheless, great publicity for Bitcoin if it does happen, sadly it probably won't.

Thanks so much for this response. I had no clue that they could do that where someone would actually convert bitcoin to bolivares. I know there's localbitcoins but I was not sure if that type of thing would be safe for someone in Venezuela. That's so cool.

It's just the way it's worded. Op made a comparison where he's intending to compare how much he loves his job versus how much that man loves his job, but the way it is worded makes it seem like OP is comparing how much op loves his job versus how much he loves the man.
Here's what OP said:


Here's how it can be fixed:

ugh I don't want to be a grammar nazi right now, but what your comment is saying is that you love that man a lot.

What about Liberland? [Liberland's national currency]( is Bitcoin.

You should check out A *lot* of people sell gift cards for Bitcoin.

I'll clear a couple things up.
Being a top trader (over 400 trades on my rep profile), as well as a moderator of the subreddit, you'd be shocked to see how few scammers there are on the sub.
While there are a lot of people who hang around there who have intentions of scamming, they usually cannot get far if the person they are trading with understands the rules and that they should not trade with someone who does not comment on your post, then you're probably just fine. Additionally, the mods will offer background checks on users prior to trading with a user. It's very frequent that a mod will have had an encounter with a user that you might be interested in trading with, and we can give you information about the user that you won't see without asking. The strict moderation really helps things run smoothly so that we don't get very many scam reports anymore. 
About the $99 limitation. This is a restriction for someone who is *selling* gift cards. You cannot sell $100+ in total worth of gift cards in a 24 hour period because we want to verify the origin of the gift card. High value trades are more important because if a scam were to occur it would be a much bigger loss than a $5 amazon gift card.
I'm assuming you're looking to buy gift cards, not sell them, so there's actually no limit to how many gift cards you can buy.
It's a great sub to consider for the future. People there really value bitcoin.

Thank you very much :) Both of you.

Ooohhh, that's a really good idea. I'll check that out :) Thanks

Oh. Hmm. Any idea what I should do with it then?

I'm 18 years old and I found out about Bitcoin in 2011-2012(maybe?) when it was just a baby. I did a few bitcoin faucets and I started receiving some bits here and there. I realize it was a waste of time, and I figured bitcoin would be a huge failure. I said 'eff it' and just left the coins in my wallet. Just forward to 2013. Bitcoin makes my news feed and it is worth over $1000. 
WTF? 
The .55 BTC I had earned from faucets and misc. tasks online now has value. It used to be worth so little, but now it is worth something. To a 14-15 year old, this was a *lot* of money! Think of how many video games I can buy! But something weird happened. I didn't feel like spending it on video games... I felt like saving it. 
That was the moment I realized that this bitcoin madness actually had value... not like, price value, but the technology of the blockchain. I became a huge bitcoin fan in 2013-2014 especially. I never 'cashed out' my bitcoin, but I did buy a few games on steam (whoops)... As an 18 year old, I don't have a job. I spend a lot of time on earning more money. Since last year I've been putting about 10% of my total earnings into my bitcoin balance. I'm forcing myself to never touch these bits until at least 2025. I've calculated that this 10% is the amount that I can afford to invest. The amount I can afford to lose. in addition to the 10%, I put 15% into my savings account. When 2025 rolls around, I really don't know what to expect. Maybe this 10% will be totally gone, or maybe it will be worth something more (then I could really go on that steam shopping spree)! 
I now deal with bitcoin just about every day, buying gift cards from people on and paying them in bitcoin. I can tell that bitcoin has real potential, and even though my teacher in economics refuses to listen to me when I talk about bitcoin, he's just old and silly. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:42:16
Sounds like you're thinking I'll be looking for something big. I just want to try something new on a very small scale. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:20:16
You can buy gift cards at a discounted rate.

Hi, welcome to @_date: 2017-03-19 18:57:29
I have some bad news for you :( 
I have a total of 50,000ish sticky notes, but we decided to bamboozle the sticky project after it took us 3 hours to get 500 sticky notes up, and of the 500 up we had to redo 200 because they were wrong. It became too much.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:47:12
I actually just found an app that says it will mine bitcoin on my android phone. This is what I mean by small scale. I just want to try it. I understand that I won't make anything, but I just want to see what it is like. Also, I know it won't cost hundreds a year in electricity if I use my phone. To charge a smartphone 24/7 for a year it will cost you less than $5.

I went to the federal reserve on a class field trip a few weeks ago. It was pretty cool. I got a bag of shredded money. Too bad I couldn't figure out how to tape it back together. It had all sorts of stats on it, like how there were all different kinds of bills in here, I believe 55 different ones, and the average total value of it was $314.4. 
Anyways, while I was at the bank, I asked some questions to a guy about bitcoin. He was aware of it, and I thought it was interesting how he was so open to bitcoin. He didn't think bitcoin would ever get to a point where it would replace fiat currencies, but it would remain as a currency in addition to the others. He does think that in the future, the USD will become similar to bitcoin, and it will be even less paper than it is now.
P.S: My friend found a homeless person outside of the federal reserve and went up to them and asked "Hey, want approximately $314.4!?" 
I've never seen a homeless person so disappointed with what they received.
EDIT: My friend is an ass. in case it wasn't clear.

I'm going to start up a business one day where I sell crazy costumes. I will be the one to sell costumes for a solid rate of 10,000 satoshi per costume. IDGAF about the price of bitcoin, I just want my satoshis!
Lose now, profit later.

@_date: 2016-12-25 01:39:55
They said it never would hit 1000 when it was worth less than ten dollars too.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:15:48
OMG LOLOLOL so sorry...
Wrong subreddit. I was about to ask why you were quoting a rule from I see now. 
Meant to post on :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:10:04
What we need for it to become an actual currency (in my opinion) is to remove the factor of fiat altogether, which I just don't see happening for a really really long time. The day we get a second line of "McDonald's" restaurants called "BitDonald's" where instead of having a dollar menu they have a Satoshi menu that doesn't have anything to do with USD. That'd be fucking amazing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:38:02
Haha, interesting way of putting it. I'm just interested in actual discussion. If someone wants to come start a discussion about BTC, BCH, B2X, BTG... etc.... nothing ever seems to get anywhere because it's almost always a one-sided argument depending on which sub it goes on. Oh well.
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:27:19
Thanks for doing this!
$241.99 Good luck!

Alright, well whatever you end up doing, I hope it works! Right now it really is hard to do something like this because of the fees, but hopefully you'll figure it out :)

Is the fear of getting banned for having genuine conversation on this subreddit really that big? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:34:00
Interesting. That really feels like it should go against reddit's guidelines... Banning people because of their opinions is absolutely *not* encouraging genuine discussion.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:02:36
No problem. I've seen a few notifications from it, but I've been able to read them before they go away. 
My only first questions -- Is there any way for me to check my current balance, check the status of tips, deposits, and how could I see/initiate withdrawals?
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:13:31
Awesome, sounds amazing. I really hope this bot works out and (if possible) you make some wise business decisions once it gets off the ground and becomes a great solution for all of reddit.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:35:33
Google "Richest Man in LA".
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:56:21
Exactly what I was thinking.
Low quality post, but then OP expects high quality comments.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:20:38
It likely won't at the rate things are going. I'm nearing the 48 hour mark, and I'm only moving $50 worth of BTC lol.
EDIT: I received my BTC.

I spent the last week or so asking this question and nobody answered it for me, and most of the time when I asked someone would respond saying 'you don't deserve to get an answer if you're too dumb to use the search bar.... which was no help (both the answer or the search bar). 
I spent a good while looking around Copay trying to find my private key and I was never ever to locate it. I decided to move all my coins over to Electrum and it seems to have worked really well, and i'm a lot more confident having them there. I also looked into a paper wallet/hardware wallet, and I really think those would be good as well. I like how simplistic a paper wallet is. 
I'm not a bitcoin pro, but I really wanted to at least see someone answer your question. Fingers crossed someone else will chime in with an actual answer for you.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:19:41
Didn't coinbase have live support in the past? I thought I remembered seeing a chat now button and if you clicked it you could get support immediately... Now I've submitted a support request over 3 weeks ago and I have yet to hear back.

In the whole scheme of things the hack will probably not affect the price that much, it will continue to go back down and up again. The only major effect will be on the rep of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:43:51
I bought $50 worth just to see how long it will take. It's probably been close to 20 hours now since I withdrew the BTC and it has yet to leave coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:23:03
ETH on Coinbase shouldn't be affected. It will likely only be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:08:47
Absolutely lol.. So much shit can happen with coinbase at any time.. Like I don't know which I'm more nervous for... The coins my dad refuses to move off of coinbase, or UASF/hard fork possibilities.
EDIT: I just realized that it is clear that I should be more scared for the coins my dad refuses to move because it also ties in to the UASF/hard fork drama.
