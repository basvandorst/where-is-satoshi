Did you mean $19-20k?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:06:26
How is that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:25:24
We'll see :) 
I just reach my personal moon at 15k and don't want to risk to lose what I've hodled. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:06:16
Exactly. The crash may come later, but it definitely will come. And then I'll buy back on the dip, having my dreams coming true and having even more btc.

1. If you attack pools of miners, difficulty will drop and any PC owner will be able to mine bitcoin. And transactions will be processed anyway 
2. Btc will go back to dark markets where it's been used before it went mainstream.

It's not about hatred. Just being rational.

I believe it's a bubble right now. Holding from 3800 and I'm planning to sell at 15k if we get there. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:21:45
So, you've got $275k
I'd be very happy to gain so much from crypto
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:56:32
By investing it. Or at least holding on a bank deposit.

Ask him if he'd like to pay the tx commissions (send you the equivalent in btc) so that you could invest 5 btc in cloud mining pool without losses.

Min 30% of your cryptofolio.

So many words, and so little said. It's an art.

Good bot.

How do you know what the price will be in 100 years? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:52:46
Btw, bought a little on 2980. And how are you doing?

Bitcoin and blockchain are different things. Don't mix them. Blockchain and smart contracts are conceptual inventions. Bitcoin is just an implementation. One of the many. It's first and the biggest right now, but not the only one and definitely not the best one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:55:51
But it still woooork!
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:07:25
That's the whole different point. 
Your initial argument was that it's a technological invention. It's not. And bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It's only valuable because it can be traded. 
It's a nice investment though. I have 50% of my cryptofolio in btc.
ps. Electricity is not a fundamental value.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:11:37
And US economy and army behind it

I could try to do a better animation. But maybe later on weekend. 
Remind me in two weeks.

It's not bitcoin that manipulated. It's people.
