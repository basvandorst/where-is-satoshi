Utility companies charge exponentially, not linearly with consumption.
If you are hogging up a substantial amount of the network's energy you'll pay a heavy price, thus mining isn't profitable and moves elsewhere. If you put everyone else at risk of brown outs, they'll just cut you off.
Bitcoin miners are heavily incentivized to find cheap hydroelectric power, cheap hydroelectric power is  almost always due to excess supply. The network is decentralized and adapts to regulations and excess electric supply.

Bcash has a big fat target for any govt that wants to take it down.
Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized and trustless, if you're using bcash you have to trust that the Chinese govt won't touch it. It goes against everything bitcoin was designed to do.
This is a huge tradeoff for reduced fees. 
Bitcoin is in a crisis while 2nd layer solutions are under development, we still don't know if these solutions are viable yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:53
Having so many nodes concentrated in one area makes it that much easier to take them all out.
If the govt truly wanted to take down nodes they could probably target &gt;95% of them in one swoop. 
Who knows if the remaining nodes could handle the load. This is bcash we're talking about here. Blockchain bloat is a real issue with bcash, since they scale on chain it will take an ever increasing amount of time to start up new nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:13:26
So if Bitcoin was electricity, LN is like A/C and on chain txns work like D/C.
We can cut down on costs by using a large mesh of wiggling payment channels, these channels can always keep themselves in check by executing on chain.

bcash code is controlled by miners. They have a large incentive to maximize profit and centralize, they'll change the code to their own best interests.

You'd need to collude with miners to change things which isn't impossible seeing as centralization is happening mostly in China.
IMO the biggest danger is a compromised codebase. Miners can easily influence whoever is running these nodes to enforce their own rules. 
Increasing block rewards to help pay for the massive amount of storage that bcash needs? This is completely possible. Incentives are completely out of whack when miners can centralize and influence nodes.
Bcash is going to be widely popular in the short term (cheap fees!) but highly centralized and vulnerable in the long term.

Utility companies can monitor usage and charge accordingly. Electricity costs don't scale linearly, they scale exponentially. So at a certain point the miner has to make a decision as to whether they want to keep on mining.
If Bitcoin mining was causing brownouts for utilities they'd simply cut them off.
Also electricity demand is falling:

The unlimited vs core debate is growing. Within the last week I was surprised by how dedicated the chinese miners are to unlimited. A lot of big names in bitcoin are commenting on it within the last week which means it isn't trivial.
The miners gaining consesus on unlimited would fracture bitcoin and more than likely tank the price.

5 minute block times would require a reduction in difficulty. This would result in miners finding blocks more often, this means that the chance of two miners finding a block simultaneously (practically) and starting to work on the next one increases.
This is a network fork and the chain that will be followed is the one that everyone knows about first.

Emergent consensus created by BU is a mechanism for miners to control the network by following the version with the largest hashrate. 
It appears democratic at first until you realize that Bitmain/WU controls almost all ASICs manufacturing. He can choose which companies receive his mining equipment and can cut you out if you don't follow his direction.
Bitmain/Wu don't want Segwit because it would allow for the development of off-chain networks which would cut into his mining fees.
The incentives here are obvious. Bitmain/Wu is heavily biased towards preserving the current fee structure.
BU is a move towards the centralization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:49:00
There have been other bugs in unlimited as well.

This hodl attitude has turned bitcoin into a self propelling ponzi scheme. 
Wasn't so bad at the beginning when bitcoin was showing lots of promise but now it's irrational hodling in the face of bad news. No one around here seems to care that the company manufacturing the majority of all ASICs is now actively trying to split the network?

It's a secure, frictionless digital currency that is resistant to regulation. It allows near anonymous exchanges between 2 parties with no middle man, just a secure network that keeps a ledger.

It will eventually reduce the role of banks in most modern exchanges.

The power expended is for security
Technically you can attack the network and compromise transactions, however you would need to supply more computing power than 50% of the network.
Anyone who has this much computing power would be better incentivized by just mining and collecting rewards/fees. 
Additionally if you were able to compromise transactions you would quickly devalue the currency and would be left with a lot of useless ASIC chips.

Posts about owning a biotech company
Posting about starting the next Ashley Madison.
Posting about buying weed.
Posts that he's a physician looking to open up a clinic.
Posts about coinbase stealing his money.
Several posts about daytrading.
Posts that he works at UCSD.
Now he has a very successful organic vertical farm that he started ~~6 months ago~~ 1 year ago (changed his story).

This is ridiculous.
3,030,740,624,000,000,000 hashes are attempted per second. Impossible to know the exact cost of electricity for that much crunching, but it's a lot no doubt.
The network can handle 5 transactions per second.
What is the average fee now? ~5 cents?
Mining rewards are relatively high ~18.50 usd / second?
Wondering about the total cost of running the network here, I'm guessing it's A LOT more than what Bitcoin is currently bringing in. Bitcoin's value absolutely must increase for this to be sustainable (or tx/sec). Please correct me if I am wrong.

Eerily similar to the attitude of real estate developers in the mid 2000s.
Bitcoin is a cool tech but the future is not solid. There is a lot of skin in the game and it's all digital, this makes for an interesting and volatile community. There is a lot of confirmation bias in this subreddit (and a lot of FUD, a lot of dreamers who psychologically are acting the same as lottery ticket purchasers.
I definitely hope that Bitcoin wins out, if it doesn't I definitely think some type of digital currency will prevail. HOWEVER there are some huge issues in Bitcoin right now.
For instance, is anyone concerned that miner competition has resulted in irrational behavior? If you look at the current numbers Bitmain has overbuilt by a lot, not sustainable unless the price moons. Price may not moon if miners act ultra competitively and focus on competing for fees and faster monetization. This could get ugly.

Do you think it's possible that miners are currently taking a loss and supplementing their losses with loans/investments in hopes that bitcoin's price will eventually rise to a level worth their original investment?
If so they may be also be trying to outcompete each other for whatever coins they can get now, despite their losses and an uncertain future. To me this is irrational behavior and should warrant caution.

Hal wakes up in the future to a greeting by Hawking. Hal and Hawking bond over their suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. Hawking has already gone through physical death but has long since uploaded his mental model into the web.
Stephen Hawking is already in contact with superintelligent AI, he seemingly threw a curveball on this subject when he was traditionally known as a theoretical physicist who researched black holes. He knows something that the general populace doesn't. His research into dark matter, black holes, and AI is shrouded in mystery.
Hal now possesses enough wealth to save mankind from (make up future dystopian bs here) and Hawking seemingly is guiding him along. Hal begins to wonder Hawkings true intentions (plot thickens)

For databases you don't have any public hashes of the intermediate states  but databases have records and savepoints, database rollbacks are very common. Database engineers have extensive backup records and rollbacks, it's common sense. 


No you'd have a public hash of the database configuration on wednesday. You can prove the state of the database on wednesday but not on monday. Have you ever seen a hash? They're gibberish and are used to obfuscate data in a provable way. You'd have to provide the entire ledger and all hashes around that time, but only the public ones can be trusted. This doesn't make sense.
I think you understand the basic principles of block chains but for some reason you're applying the same principles to databases. They're not the same, they're completely different approaches to ledgers.


Private block chains don't make any sense. Just use a database.

Well literally no one knows the future here. I agree that there is great potential but no one should act like it isn't super risky right now.
Miners are hundreds of millions (usd) in the hole. The network wouldn't even be able to take on the transactions of a medium size city as it stands right now. The infighting is getting really petty. SegWit pools aren't worth it for large miners as they can make more money elsewhere, hence the current standoff.

I really think Hal Finney's story could be extrapolated into a great novel.
Dude spent the last couple years of his life slowly degenerating physically but very active on the net. He very well *could* be Satoshi and we would be none the wiser. To top it off he had his head chopped off and cryogenically stored. 
If Bitcoin takes off and has staying power, and Alcor can ressurect him in the future (I'm talking hypothetically here) Hal Finney will wake up a very rich and powerful person.
Him and Hawking are have programmatically uploaded their models into the net, they're timeless and control the universe.
Plus his name is HAL!

Looks like you have a grow setup and lied about the rest of your claims. You're not running a miner like you claimed, your panels are still in the box.
Below are some of your grandiose claims about produce business:
["we grow organically with no pesticides. We go through two clean rooms before entering each greenhouse. We wear the same clean gear that they wear in the Intel commercials. We do not use any pesticide so we cannot have any infections. If we have an infection, we destroy everything in the greenhouse and re-boot."](
["When humidity becomes an issue from the underground water cooling then we use efficient HVAC systems. A night, we use our battery banks."](
["I sell it directly to the end user. You tell me what to grow and I grow it for you and deliver it to your house once a week.
Kinda like I am your personal farmer and I grow organically and in perfect conditions. And I sell it for half of what you are currently buying it for. And delivery is free."](
["We have a deal with 30 hospitals in Southern California. We provide weekly deliveries to a couple hundred employees right now."](
["The S9 costs $2100 right now. We run it 24/7. ROI is about 275 days at the current price."](

Here's a list of claims from "Dan", feel free to add your own:
[He owns the farmland](
[Greenhouses are glass airtight structures and you go through 2 clean rooms before entering.](
[His company is building a "a system which uses the cameras to zoom in and outline a user's personal crops on their app;"](
[Farm has a well on site connected to an huge underground lake, he uses this to cool the entire farm.](
[Greenhouses have efficient HVAC systems to cool these systems during the day.](
[His business custom grows produce and delivers it for free, you pay half of what the grocery stores charge.](
[His business has a deal with 30 hospitals for weekly deliveries, 2000 people have signed up for his service.](
[He lived in China for several years and can 'kinda' speak the language](
[Greenhouses can grow from 44F to 110F in almost any wavelength, humidity, nutrient mix, etc.](
[He owns several biotech companies](
[He's a mathematician who went to school for 'quantum organic chemistry'](
[His farm is running an s9 miner](
[He worked for 5 years at the UCSD super computer center](
[He's a physician who once wanted to practice outpatient surgery in a his own clinic in Mexico](
[He has a lab at UCSD](
He's managed to do all of this yet can only provide 3 pictures of 'his greenhouses'. The only pictures he has ever posted on reddit are these 3 'greenhouse' photos and a couple of pictures of some weed he bought. His 'company' has zero web presence, wait doesn't he have several companies? All unverified. His lab at UCSD is unverified.

Segwit is a major upgrade. If it's activated the entire future of bitcoin depends on getting it right with no major hiccups.
They've been going through several peer reviews and several meetings. From what I understand they're now trying to get miners, wallets, nodes, exchanges etc etc up to date with the latest version of core/segwit. 
You don't really want to fix major bugs after the fact (cough dao cough ethereum) I wish they could fast track it too but I'd rather core get it right the first time.

A while back I found a channel on youtube from a miner. In one of his videos he talks about how he started mining on a segwit pool but had to quit because the payout sucked. 
It's now completely obvious why so many miners haven't signalled for segwit. The payout sucks and they're making more money on other pools.
If all miners adopted segwit tomorrow the entire mining community is in for a big dip in the pocket because of Bitmain's antics, this is horrible.

I'm under the impression that *fundamentally* the value of a coin rooted in it's security and scarcity, which has to do with the network infrastructure and amount of energy diverted towards mining it.
And before you say it, yes people have to buy into/believe in a coin for it to have value I'm not disputing that.
So Bitcoin's infrastructure is massive, it's backed by a lot of electricity and a lot of hardware. bcash is basically a parasite on the network at this point, significant hashpower is being diverted towards what many see as a bad idea. 
Looking at the top PoW coins, many of them have clones. Exchanges are happy to accommodate these clones as long as they can make a buck.
IMO what's holding back cryptocurrencies is that it's scarcity is being attacked by clones. A single coin's value is basically diluted when you can fork the entire chain and get listed on a major exchange, we're basically reintroducing inflation. Coinbase's Brian Armstrong does not understand this.
Bitcoin will eventually win, but the longer we allow parasites on the network the longer we delay this victory.

Currency is suppose to represent a rare value, obtained by exertion of energy. 
Any service rendered for currency ultimately comes down to an energy exchange. E.g. A lawyer spent years reading cases and learning law (skills obtain by energy exertion) all to quickly asses your given needs and render a service in a timely fashion for you. 
Modern fiat has deviated from this rare value that currency is supposed to have. Printing money DILUTES VALUE. What does this mean? You're basically a slave to the govt when dealing with fiat, you're exerting energy but dealing with ever diminishing value from it. 
Bitcoin is a reconnection of currency and value. Each bitcoin created has enormous amounts of kilowatt hours thrown into hashing a rare value. The code enforces that inflation won't happen,  decentralization of bitcoin protects against govt fuckery.

Market cap is not indicative of money invested in bitcoin. It's simply the number of total coins produced times their value. 
A lot of people bought bitcoin early on when the price was still in the 2/3 digit range. 
The price of bitcoin is determined by the amount of coins available on exchanges and A LOT of coins aren't available on exchanges.

Everyone is talking about altcoins but really this discussion should be about hashes.
It takes about 13,800,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes to find a block. (rough estimate)
That is a **massive massive** amount of energy exerted to mine about a dozen bitcoins. Altcoins don't even come close when it comes to energy exerted in the bitcoin network.

Why not include all these other shitcoins then?
Why? Because it's a stupid idea and promotes FUD. Brian Armstrong has no idea what he's doing.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:24:22
Here's my stance. 
It doesn't really matter what coin is out there as long as it's using energy to hash. Electricity is ultimately the commodity that bitcoin/litecoin run their math on and miners adjust their hashing according to whatever benefits them the most. 
Security in cryptocurrencies is ultimately derived from electricity and a miner's access to electricity. 
Bitcoin and Litecoin are valuable because they have a large infrastructure set up around their hash algos and many miners have focused on them. 
It's a crying shame that exchanges have decided to legitimize coins that use the same algos, it really is destabilizing for the coins. Coinbase has yet to realize this. Brian Armstrong is a brain dead corporate stooge. 
Proof of stake is garbage, stick to proof of WORK. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:02:32


Or because there wasn't a large misinformation campaign behind it.
Either way putting 2 coins with the same hash algo on an exchange causes uncertainty. Everyone wants easy money, but if it comes at the cost of security then an exchange should be smart enough to ignore the clones.
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:31:21

@_date: 2018-07-24 20:15:39
If BCH started their own chain..
Instead it was formed from the original chain and uses the same hash algo. 
It's a destabilizing force in the world of bitcoin. 
Once coinbase added BCH everyone realized that the segwit FUD campaign was successful and that coins aren't rare when malicious actors can convince big name exchanges to accept forked coins. 
The bubble popped once coinbase added BCH. Forked coins are bad news and coinbase is oblivious.

Yeah that's litecoin.
It runs on a different hash algo and doesn't disturb bitcoin. 
BCH is a con job, and a successful one at that.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:18:49
Bitcoin began it's crash from it's ATH immediately after BCH was added to coinbase.
This was such a dumb move by coinbase, they created doubt and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency world. I can't comprehend what was going through their heads adding 2 coins with the same hashing algo to a major platform like that. (edit: nothing was going through their heads)
The only reason I think they may have done this is that they were under pressure from the miners, maybe they have a deal with miners to obtain coins? This is conjecture btw
Either way we can thank Brian Armstrong for this extended bear market, don't think Bitcoin will be able to climb again when a couple of FUDsters can push a misinformation campaign and con a major exchange into accepting shitcoins cloned on the same hash algo.

@_date: 2016-05-01 07:01:59
Thanks for taking the time to write that.
First I need to address this:


I think you're missing a major pillar of blockchain technology here. Blockchains are able to maintain records that everyone agrees on due to their computational power. Computational power is central to trust in the bitcoin blockchain since the amount of computational power needed to compromise the network would be better spent  participating.
Blockchain technology does a lot of cool things but I'm not understanding how you can just build a virtual machine on it in any sort of practical sense.
Uber, Amazon, Ebay all have massive infrastructure and process hundreds of petabytes per day. I fail to see how Ethereum or anyone else plans to decentralize a similar type site (or protocol?) at this scale. At some point you need databases and those aren't easy to hash and verify at large sizes.
[In contrast the entire bitcoin ledger (all transactions that have ever happened on bitcoin) is currently just under 70GBs.](
I definitely agree with you that automation of certain functions (economic protocols?) and elimination of middlemen is a good thing. However the internet has been doing that for a while and didn't need blockchains.
These currency markets are nuts. I definitely sense something shady going on with Ethereum, their webdev and presentations are all very slick but they have little substance underneath them. [Look at the current Dapps they've produced.](  There is nothing that provides any utility. Many dapps are unfinished and/or missing, one of them is literally a pyramid scheme.
I guess this can be expected when hundreds of millions is sloshing around.

I honestly tried to dig in and understand what Ethereum is about and what problems it solved.
Read up on it for a couple days and I've come to the conclusion that they're in way over their heads technology wise. Somehow they've convinced a lot of people that an unproven, still in development product is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
If you look through ELI5 posts you'll see lots of people who don't understand what ethereum is or why it's needed, while other users (read: investors) bust out the same buzzwords over and over again. Reading several articles and listening to interviewers from Ethereum employees you'll hear the same buzzwords.
I think the crux of Ethereum is their Ethereum Virtual Machine and from I've read it doesn't really work that well at all. It's slow and needs to run every single command in a decentralized manner on every node. Looking at it's architecture it looks pretty complex, the problem with complexity is unintended bugs and Ethereum can't have bugs. Their technology is ridiculously complex and is being developed at a feverish pace, I don't see any signs of sanity in their github. It's all ad hoc mish mash.
Worst of all there is a lot of money invested into Ethereum right now so there is a lot of misinformation and hype flying around simply because people want this to work so bad, they want to cash out like all the early miners of bitcoin.
It'll be interesting to see how this pans out.

Religion evolved over time to emphasize the most virulent, hostile and belligerent ideals instead of the original spiritual fundamentals. Whatever benefits the short term is the trait that wins out.
Similarly with cryptocurrencies forks that are rushed to market will select for whatever benefits in the short term, regardless of it's fundamentals. Short term benefits are almost always easy profit.
So many coins are just gimmicks that risk the fundamentals of cryptocurrency (decentralization and scarcity)
2017 was an example of hype fueled greed, thousands of coins popped up overnight and stole money from naive newbies.
We have major forks that are trojan horses being widely accepted, they'll provide short term gimmicks while putting the whole system at risk in the long term. Let's not recreate the federal reserve.
