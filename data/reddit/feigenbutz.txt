No thanks. You're gonna FUD any altcoin I offer up as an example.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:51:14
Of course not. No one's here to make money...

Exactly: *year* to date. And I never suggested cashing out.

c) Strawmen. None of these arguments dismantles the original argument, which was that it's possible to achieve a greater ROI on altcoins.

Let the record show that I did not do anything of the sort.

Not if you get in on the ICO of a solid project.

I realize this is the Bitcoin subreddit and everyone's all-in on Bitcoin, so let the downvoting commence. But...
If I can invest in a solid altcoin and get 1000% ROI in a matter of weeks, why would I invest in BTC which would take months, maybe even years?

Super relevant to the discussion.

It's pretty evident that Microsoft, for example, doesn't think Bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency. Hence, they went the Ethereum route. 
BTW, I don't even own Ethereum. I just think all this Bitcoin or bust stuff is illogical and immature.

Are you 12?

Yeah, it's gambling if you don't do your due diligence and just throw some money at some hyped nonsense. But if you do your due diligence, find a solid project with a solid team, and buy when prices are low, that's called savvy investing.

Point is, the "Bitcoin is the only crypto you should invest in" is illogical. It's predicated on the notion that there will come a time when ALL other cryptocurrencies cease to be. That's pretty unlikely.
