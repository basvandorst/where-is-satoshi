Much easier:
The  Explorer can do that.
Go to this page 
and click on "addresses".
You can then put in a certain value or even a range.
For only a certain value, put that value in both fields.
I played around a bit with some addresses and you barely get more than 1-3 hits, if its a random amount.
fun fact, only 29 addresses out there with 0.12345678.
I would have guessed much more.
Good luck!

I found out, you can enable error logging for debug, in electrum:
Maybe that will give you some info about whats wrong the file.

Just some thoughts:
1. Are you sure, that you used Electrum back then?
Maybe it was another wallet?
Some of them used their own file format back then.
Alternative: Install an Electrum Version from back then and create a new wallet. then compare the files. maybe its only some useless entries in the header that can be copied over. (works only, if unencrypted)
2. Given that the corruption came from the Upload:
Can you try to recover the file that you uploaded from your HDD maybe?
Its a small file and it might not be overwritten yet, even after formating and installing a new windows.
3. Do you still have a password for the file?
If so, it should be encrypted. If not and its encrypted, you have no chance to get the coins anyway, even if the file was working.
I hope you can make it happen, good luck!
p.s. an electrum wallet has no file extension, its just "filename". Not "filename.*" and I'm sure it was like that in 2015 also.
edit: 
should have added: Do not share the file with anyone. Nobody needs the whole content of it, to help you out.

Don't forget to mention that you store them in different locations.
Worst case, a Fire burns down the whole building and its all gone.

Me again.
You should also contact Dave and tell him about your problem.
Link:  
If anybody has experience with that stuff, its that guy.
He is specialized in wallet password cracking but im sure he also had to deal with your problem maybe.
He is a trusted person in the community and you can find reviews about him if you google him.
good luck

You can see it on the top of 
Currently showing "BTC Dominance:  65.7%"
If you click on the percentage, you will see a graph compared to some of the bigger altcoins.

Do not buy in all at once!
Buy in parts. Every week a little it.
This way you can build some trust into bitcoin over time and are more comfortable not risking it all at the beginning, when you don't know basics.
Here is a good start to educate yourself a bit about bitcoin 
good luck

I would also go for Blockchain.info Wallet.
Almost all other webwallets are gone/hacked by now (Instawallet etc.).
Also go through your emails from back then (search for 'bitcoin'),
these sites usually send you account/login infomails.
good luck

in case you mean, that you have a seed and want to recover the wallet/adresses with it:
1.open electrum
2.type in any walletname that does not exist and click next
3.choose "standard wallet" and click next
4.choose second option "i alreday have a seed" and click next
5.input your seed and continue from there with a new password...
good luck!

Be careful to install the original Electrum from Electrum.org.
There are many scammers out there that spread malware and fake wallets that steal your keys.
Better verfiy the downloaded signature from the original site, to be sure.
good luck!

Don't forget to make a backup of it, better make 2 backups, and store them at different locations.
Think about a fire that burns down the whole house!
Good luck!

they accept btc since years.
you can buy only 1 day or 1 week and give it a try.
no account or even email needed.

I recommend you to try Dave:
The guy has a good reputation, helped a friend of mine who was in a similar situation to yours.
He takes %20.
good luck!

Don't do it.
I had 3 ETH laying around there on an older non KYCed account and they wanted me to KYC to withfraw it.
But even if, you should not use Poloniex since like 2-3 years already. Please read up on it.
Good Luck.

hm, maybe try his twitter also.
it's been a while since this happened. 2-3 years i'd guess.
maybe he is not active anymore?!
