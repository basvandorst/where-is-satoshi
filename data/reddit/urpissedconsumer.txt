Really, I only mentioned bitcoin and even expanded on some of the organizational issues and sedwit and such.  Trust me I get it, do you?  Do you think you have a decentralized authority when single mining pools are making decisions about the blockchain.  And altcoins? wtf is that? I said I had an interest in cryptocurrencies, that is bitcoin, many other coins could be considered but to not care about them is foolish.  Hell most of them run on blockchain technology and might as well be called bitcoin by "".  I once spent 3 bitcoins at once, they were about $20 at the time, I didn't just jump into this.  what shitcoin did my dad buy? he buys multi-family housing and commercial properties, I'm his only son and he never mentioned it to me so how did you hear about this?  I hope you never lose that pamphlet on how bitcoin is the best, I'd hate to not be able to go over such technical details with you ever again ha

I would be happy to help you with making that a reality, In fact when I transfer you some I'll even be gracious enough to send it a few more times lowering the TRX feees.  Or heck I'll just send it with a satoshi to give to the miners  cause I'm a quality guy like that.  You'll see the transaction RIGHT AWAY.  And we will all be so happy that you can use bitcoin anywhere.  Actually, I'll be more happy at some point up to 3 days later when the crypto you thought you were getting from me comes right back.  Bitcoin, the best fraudulent boomerang.

why do you believe in bitcoin? I have an interest in cryptocurrenciues and where theyre going but i don't believe in it.  For a while I though bitcoin was done for when they couldnt keep trx fees under control and all the infighting around sedwid2x. 
there was a time when I had an argument with a friends dad about RIM, this was at the beginning and he dismissed me said it'll out demand x.y.z and i as trying to tell him about their org structure and problems innovating, how their ceo and cfo didn't communicate.  He made a rude comment to me about it and you know what it sort of hurt as a younger kid (17), but its better now every time I ask him how much money he would have made had he sold the day I told him (answer 1.2mil).  Don't believe in anything form a hypothesis or an opinion but by god have so facts behind it

Oh i see, well there was a time that 3 letter abbreviations referred to things other than cryptocurrencies.  RIM was a company you get to see go extinct soon, otherwise known as blackberry. I was explaining how at that time the market grossly overvalued RIM based on public perception and disregarded apple and google because they didn't fit the current model. It is very similar to how I see bitcoin today

ya u/carrja99, you can't make jokes in r/bitcoin.  It totally ruins the actual joke that all these people worship bitcoin like it's their messiah and how dare you make a joke that points out a limitation to bitcoin's feasibility in real life.  If you haven't shaved your head and changed you name to satoshi you are not welcome here. and take your shoes off, this sub is holy ground...

Oh that little white creature with a ball on its head in my avatar, sorry that's not me, he beats me in the cuteness factor by a few points

ya no fee oor 8 or 9% doesnt seem bad, but taka a look at the "martket value" of bitcoin.  It'll be like $8000 when it just traded on gemini for 7000
