He will declare himself as the winner and will look like a innocent person who won in the lottery. But even if the lottery winner is not the actual thief, he's participating in a illegal activity.

I think you got the numbers wrong: all assets= 194 mio
Lost assets:36% of 194 mio=70mio usd = 120k BTC
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:56:00
The price may be up shortterm because bfx buys some BTC  back. But mid to longtherm this hurts Bitcoin. It will get more volatile since nobody can risk having USD on the exchanges anymore. That will result in a lack of liquidity and more instability. Not to forget the angry people that leave the space because they are just sick of ongoing security issues, that I can understand completely.

Bitfinex could provide summarized data. Then everyone could at least check for plausibility.

I always kept my coins in my own wallet. I understood the danger for coins, but I was unaware that fiat is in risk too. I kept USD on the exchange to buy coins for the opportunity to buy cheap coins. I will change that now.

I signed up for bfx but did not deposit yet because I am happy with my current exchange. I just had luck. My interest is to not to let bfx to set a bad example how to handle such a disaster. It should also be in your interest to handle the case properly. If the loss is spread across all assets, thats how it will be from now on with all future hacks. You mentioned everyone had equal risks? USD cannot be transfered without a wiretransfer and other coins need a different wallet format. It's common sense to minimize risks by dividing assets across different asset classes. Maybe you just had BTC and are happy to not loose as much as if only Bitcoin owner lost from the hack. You should see that the choice to do it this way is wrong. Clients had a choice, the choice not to hold BTC and the ones who didn't hold are suffering now too. I dont think bfx would go bancrupt if they only let Bitcoinholders take the loss. They are doing it that way because they had their own assets in Bitcoin and that's shady.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:49:12
I agree, everyone knew crypto had more risks but also more potential. And now just everything is in danger (also fiat) in the exchanges. If this stays that way I will reduce my exposure in general. Exchanges are just too risky to store anything, even midterm.

Knowingly accepting property from a theft is illegal. Unless it's not linked to a theft. But there has never been a lottery giveaway and I don't see any other reason than rigging a lottery to wash the coins. Why now? Its close to the theft, so it probably is related to it. He will transfer the coins from his address to another address in his own possession. There are plenty of charities where the hacker could have given the coins to. But all addresses here are anonymous, so one of them is likely in possession of the hacker himself.

Bitstamp is a solid player but they still lack an optional insurance. I would pay money to get my deposits insured in the event of an exchange hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:27:05
There is a third option. BTC holders take resposibility for not keeping the BTC in their own wallet. BFX continues operations and we look how that goes.

I dont think such info can be revealed to public. The only way would be to declare a person who can look into the books. This person would need both deep knowledge of bitcoin and accounting knowledge, it would take a long time to analyze. Here the lack of regulation bites us in the ass. Only a independent instance could make such an audit.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:34:49
The proper way would be BTC loss spread across BTC holders. No other assetclass should be dragged into this. Or the whole point of exchanging assets on an exchange is pointless. Why are they doing this mixup?

I know its stupid to pay a randsome because you enable their illigal business, but our clients backup on an external harddisk got encrypted too, and since they had no tape backups.. Even the shadocopies where gone its impossible to get years of data back unless you have the key is then an easy decision. I dont wish anybody gets infected and everyone should have a deconnected up-to-date at all times backup, but our client didnt and had to pay the price, this time...

There seem to be issues that are "growing over time". Couldn't it be a solution to do a hardfork every x years to roll over all unspent transactions in a mega-transaction, basically making a cut and reduce memory usage dramatically by starting fresh every x years?

@_date: 2016-06-29 05:24:06
Bitcoin is still considered to be an experiment. I am for an experimental approach: Why don't we let the blocks getting fuller until transactions require a fee, that a significant amount of people agree upon to be "too high".  Then we know we reached a limit and counteract with a bigger blocksize?
@_date: 2016-06-27 05:07:23
I also refuse to believe that institutions  are buying BTC and caused the increase in price. It could be, that more people refuse to sell at a 400USD level and therefore the price spiked.  I think that's more likely.

Good question, at the moment Bitcoin attracts investors that use it as a leverage/investment/save heaven  and a cheap day-to-day transaction network. It looks like we can't achieve both in the same network. So while the first requires few transactions, transactions in point of sales usecases requires a lot of fast and cheap transactions. I would suggest to let the Bitcoin transaction fees rise to a 1USD level, so that people jump to the cheaper lightning network for low value (in terms of fiat value) transactions.

There are enough tools to catch someone if he or she has done something illegal with bitcoin. We have examples of such cases.

Bitcoin companies are struggeling because they lack on obvious benefits for their customers. Besides that most people that are using Bitcoin are informed about keeping their coins safe. So all this informed people don't need Bitreserve for that. The only sustainable business models I see, are exchanges and payment-processors.
I totally disagree that Bitcoin the currency will disappear because the blockchain only works because of the economy of Bitcoin. It's the only
 reason why the miners keep mining.
