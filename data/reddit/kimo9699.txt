I am a banker myself, what people get wrong is that negative interest will cause inflation, this doesn't always happen, i work in the EU and we already have Negative interest levels, inflation is going down, why? Because people take advantage of low interest to buy Real estate in huge ammounts, more money on the side that shouldve been pumped in the markets, or people save even more becasue they're freaking out about the future of the economy. this could of course help bitcoin, but not as drasticaly as you might imagine

I don't really care about his accuracy or words, what i meant was that someone in his position starting to embrace the fact that you can't stop something that exists everywhere anytime.
This is a good sign that crypto is being more and more understood by the mainstream media or politics.

True, but there are investments that are rated and pay Dividends, there are some that are attached to the value and growth of the company and you can actually kind of plan ahead. But Bitcoin and most crypto are valued only by the possibility that someone soon might be ready to pay more based on some news or promises.

That's horrible advice, you shouldn't invest more than 15% of your (Savings) in Crypto... its pure specutlaion. good to have in your profolio but shoudn't make most of it

Its from the Government's perspective, the challenge is to ban/control Crypto

Based on 60d chart the last two resistence/correction points over 10k where about 11600 and 12000, that's what my guess is based on

Isn't it a bit worrying when one platform has so much power on the course of bitcoin?
