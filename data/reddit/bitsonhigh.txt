That's a great point. But I think the number of preorders and excitement around their offerings, and subsequent outrage, is some indication that a decent number of people do want 3rd party services handling their bitcoins.

What? I can't tell if you are pro longer block times or pro-"the only transaction confirmation speed that matters is 0 seconds" block time? Saying "6 seconds is a lifetime" is entirely too hyperbolic. Most microorganisms live longer than 6 seconds. 
I think you're trying suggest that complaining about 7-10 min blocks, or even the occasional 20 min block time, is ridiculous. And I agree with that. I'm not sure block times are ever something to "brag" about. But I don't know why 0 second blocks would be either..? English is my first language.

The title doesn't answer much. I am, however, less compelled to be quite after reading it.

To my understanding, Zerocoin was a proposed "bolt on" to bitcoin that would have required little more than a software update, network consensus by miners. Of course it requires desire and cooperation on the part of the core dev team, which was missing. I think it's time.

1% fee is off putting?! What in the world do you expect? 1% beats every single localbitcoins seller by at least 5%. 
Also, every skyhook is independently operated. And most bitcoin machines will charge a much higher fee than 1%. They have to. 
Buying bitcoin with fiat isn't the cheap part! It can't be. If you want bitcoin without paying a premium, sell some product or service in exchange for bitcoin.

"I think a good portion of people and miners don't want to see Zerocoin implemented directly into btc, because it would likely make regulation like Bitlicense look like a walk in the park."
If by "walk in the park", you mean: fundamentally more ridiculous to implement and near impossible to enforce, I agree! A walk in the park indeed. If you mean that regulators would wish they could invade the privacy of their citizens all the more, I also agree. Failure to address this weakness in the Bitcoin protocol now, while it's relatively small and less regulated, is one of the only things that really jeopardizes it's long term prospects vs alt coins. 
What's more, there is no requirement that everyone use the zerocoin feature. The transactions that benefit from total transparency can remain transparent.

If you live in Denver, check out xbteller.com. More expensive than Coinbase for sure. But it's something 
@_date: 2014-09-02 06:18:29
Coinbase has a wallet, but it shouldn't be used as one. BTC-e isn't a wallet at all, although many people also use it as one. Coinbase to a CLEAN blockchain.info wallet and then that wallet with shared send (max repetitions) to another CLEAN blockchain.info wallet and then another. 
By clean, I mean set up and accessed only through TOR, ever. New tor identity each time. No names no 2factor to your cell phone. No back ups to email. Clean. Used only as jumping points.

Zerocash is of little benefit compared to zerocoin. The point is to make the bitcoin network and currency more resistant to changing political circumstance.

Parallel construction.. Maybe..

It amazes me that people even want a third party service to handle the portion of their money that was meant to be free of third parties. I get the merchant processors. But custodians? Come on

I'll take that bet. Dead wrong.

Awesome! I'll have to check it out tomorrow. I need some soil too, so... two birds.

As I'm sure your top regulatory council has told you, the MSB activity, Money Transmission, unlike currency exchange, check cashing, etc is not threshold or volume based. Where the later is not an MSB if the entity does not process more than $1000/customer/day. The former, money transmitters, are so considered at dollar 1. At which point registration as an MSB and adherence to all BSA/PATRIOT Act rules governing money transmission apply. 
You guys are effectively placing the compliance burden on your customers without either informing them or enabling compliance.
