Maybe I was unclear. My question IS why he Germans aren't buying, however this subreddit contains huge amounts of knowledge and experience so I figure this is the place to ask.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:15:27
We've just started. We advertise on Google etc. (soon on Reddit!) 
I've wrote about it here:
As for referral program, no problem, let's start one now: 
For every new user that mentions your User ID in their verification email, you'll both get 0.03 BTC (0.03 BTC for you, 0.03 BTC for him). This offer is unlimited, the more referrals you'll bring the more BTC you'll get.   
Your user ID can be found on your dashboard after registration.
This offer is valid to all users starting now + retroactively for existing users (we'll send them an email in a bit)
How does that sound?
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:56:00
Kind of a statistical outlier here. I'll ask the devs to fix it after they'll finish with the translation. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:09:00
It's more about adding currency support - but you're right. We're working on it. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:42:38
It was me, apparently if you give gold after gold in BTC you need to click an additional link which I've missed. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:54:54
That was amazing. Thanks!
Also, Gold. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:25:22
The steps are as follows:
The user chooses the amount he\she wanna buy (within [limits]( 
The user gets to the payment page - where he's notified in advance (BIG RED LETTERS) about the terms - nobody is gonna to be surprised. 
The user pays in credit card. We instantly credit the Bitcoins to his account.
As soon as the user provides us his wallet address we're sending him a request for KYC documents (ID Card, Selfi, etc.) 
After a waiting period of 14 days from first payment the bitcoins are transferred to the user's wallet. 
Repeat buy is much much easier.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:48:53
Wow... That's amazing. I really donno what to say. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:15:48
Update: will be live - 24 hours from now. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:56:29
All of your points are valid. 
The site was translated via an agency for the pilot purposes - obviously they did less-than-passable  work.   
The site will be live in full English in 23 hours.
The limit table is confusing. Fortunately we've got an OK from the bank to increase our limits to about 500 EUR per day per user, so the table is less relevant. 
Regarding the transaction - I'm assuming the status was "initiated" or something similar?  
Regarding the Germany\Israel\Cyprus\US etc. 
I believe I've answered it fully here, let me know if it'ss not the case: 
Thanks again for the kind feedback. Also, Gold.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:26:44
5% of every transaction goes straight to credit card companies\bank. We also need to take premium to pay for specific risk related services. 
Credit Cards are extremely high risk in bitcoin transactions - we're charged a lot more that a regular merchant, that's basically as low as we can go without losing money on every transaction.
When the  transactions volume will grow will be able to renegotiate with the bank and cut the commissions.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:47:30
The English version of the site will be live in 23 hours, that will solve the discrepancies in languages. 
Regarding the payment options - we have dormant options there that will go live as soon as we'll finish the technical setup (SEPA, Giro etc.)  
Thanks for notifying us for the encoding issue in the CC page, we're on it. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:53:29
1) 3D Secure transactions cannot be reported as stolen.
2) We put limits per card. You can't buy "all" the bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:30:45
Costs - what you see is what you get, no additional costs. It's also in the FAQ in the homepage. However, if you've failed to notice it so did others, so we'll try to think of a better place to put it, same with the description.
Also, Gold.
EDIT: Payed with BTC for the gold, might take a few minutes :/
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:17:40
First of all, all of your advice are great. 
1) Marketing 
We've started with banner advertising on Google network. I ca give a preview of the banners - very straightforward [LINK] (
So far results are mixed and the spend is quite high. We've tried Google Search but there's not enough searches in German for Bitcoin at the moment, the price drop did lots of damage to the public interest. 
2) Languages 
We are working on English. Adding more languages is heard as we'll need to hire more native speakers for support teams, which is costly, but it's something we intend doing. 
As for Greek, it's a very small market, we need to analyze the demand before starting the costly process of translation + hiring ad training support.  Right now we're planing on English and French. 
3) Bits  
That's a great idea. I'll run it trough my partners and if they are all OK with it we'll implement it right away. Danke!
4) Gold
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:40:09


Must admit I've never heard of them before. Looks amazing
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:20:29
Site will be live in English in about 24 hours from now.  
SEPA Bank Transfer will be possible in a week or so. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:19:13
Exactly. We're also not really taking the money. 
We "reserve it" AKA check for authorization, but the final "capture" is happening only after a few days when we've determined it's not stolen\fraud etc.   
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:40:09
It's a lot of effort to change the theme now, but you are making a really good point.  I'll talk with my partners, thanks!
Also: Gold.
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:59:08
Our edge? We can do Europe. They can do only US, each because of the specific deals with his Banks.  
Joining in... We all can and did nice salaries working for other people, we want something of our own. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:07:43
Working on it...
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:56:49
We're working on a new homepage, we will perform an A/B test as soon as it's live
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:44:12
I think you are comparing us to Circle.  When you buy from us it's just like if you've bought a guitar from ebay. There are no extra charges - it's not a cash advance.  Part of the reason we can't work with US banks. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:10:58
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:31:55
The English is a painful issue 1-2 weeks before it's live. Hopefully :/
Responsive design - unfortunately this will take a while. Not the we don't wanna, but it's relatively high on resources consumption and low on returns (most of our visitors comes from desktop) 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:43:19
Not much, it's a gesture of good will. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:35:24
We need good programmers more than we need translators, are you doing freelance? 
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:52:40
Thanks you for the kind offer, I might just take you on it.
Regarding your question: IDEAL, Giro Pay, Sofort etc.  are local payments methods with almost 0 risk involved (no charge-backs) , we do plan to integrate them and payment done via those platform will receive a competitive rates.   We aim for mass market, Bitcoin beginners, and currently Credit Card is the most  common payment method worldwide. 
Also, Gold. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:59:43
Increased to 40 as of now. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:00:27
You're not the first the say this, good points.
The design change will take a while, I've just commissioned a designer for a new homepage and site design. English will happen in 22.5 hours from now.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:50:33
I got it (after the explanation). I chuckled.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:40:36
Fair questions, i'll answer them to the best of my ability. 
1) 
Germany was chosen due to low fraud % and high 3D Secure penetration.  Basically as a case study for us to prove the bank we can handle the fraud.  The English website will be live in 24 hours. 
Cyprus was chosen (i'm quoting myself from another reply) as it is one of the easiest places to start a Bitcoin company in the EU, and even there the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy was horrendous. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet, we're working on making it so.
2) We're not competing with SEPA platform, we're offering faster and easier alternative, with a markup.
Our target audience are Bitcoin beginners (mass market) who wants their Bitcoin sooner rather than later.  We will soon also offer SEPA deposits and those will be free as well, but that's not our core business model.  
3) That's a hard but fair question. 
If you're worried about **Bitcoin theft**:  One answer is we don't keep your Bitcoins - after you've been verified we FORCE you (the user) to create a wallet and will PUSH the bitcoins to your account bi-weekly if you won't transfer them yourself.     
In the very near future verified accounts will receive their BTC near instantly after the buy to their wallets, so even there is no big bounty of BTC for us to steal, we drop it like it's hot.   
If you're worried about **Credit Card theft**:  
You are paying with the safest mean of payment for a customer. If we can't prove delivery - our bank will refund you.  
That's why we have the one wallet - one person policy. You sign to us this is your wallet, and from now on your BTC will be transferred there and if we can't prove by blockchain confirmation that this wallet has received bitcoins from us - it's extremely easy for the user to get his money back.  
Hope that answers your questions. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:29:07
Kraken are amazing, but they don't have credit card AFAIK
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:05:41
We buy the Bitcoin immediately. We'll loss if the client decided to cancel\fraud, the price plummets and we couldn't find a new buyer fast enough - but only on first time depositors.  
Repeating, verified customers are supposed to receive the bitcoin to their wallet almost immediately (10 minutes) and as soon as we'll have Blockchain confirmation we'll "capture" the transaction.  
  
 **Supposed** - currently we're only testing automatic transfers, it's something we'll implement before another external security audit (we pay a bunch of guys money so they'll try to hack us)  
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:58:58
We had the same debate ourselves and we're still not sure. Our UX guy insists it inspires "gravitas" and so far the customers we've asked agreed. However, maybe the ones who didnt agree simply never became our customers...  
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:10:45
App as Smartphone app? Not sure I follow
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:44:27
You can use pre-paid :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:01:06
Can you name some, (except Circle) if that's not too much to ask?
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:09:16
I'm not a native German speaker, my partners are, that's why i'm the one writing here and not them. 
The main reason we've started our pilot in Germany is because our bank has offered it, according to our research Germans are less likely to perform credit fraud - thus making it easier for us to "prove" the feasibility credit card payments on Bitcoin to the credit companies. 
Hosting - we're using CloudFire , I guess what you are seeing is CDN?
Registration - Cyprus is one of the easiest places to start a Bitcoin company in the EU, and even there the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy was horrendous. 
Bitcoin is not mainstream yet, we're working on making it so. 
Facebook Login - we allow one BTC wallet per user + one CC per user (which you have to insert every time, we are not keeping it connected). That means that even if someone hacks to your account - he can't buy anything and he can't steal anything. The only withdrawal he can do are to your own wallet. 
If someone wants to change email\wallet\credit card he will have to pass a video verification with us - and that's why we keep the users ID cards.
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:17:34
I agree, however there are no (that I know of) solutions for CC payments in Europe
EDIT: Correction - apparently you can via cash advance but AFAIK this involves a few more internal fees, so 2.9% is misleading   
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:53:00
Not at the moment. We're working on adding the option to pay in GBP and other currencies. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:26:05
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:46:26
I understand how it might sound, but the idea was to illustrate the workload caused by the fraud activity. When dealing with fraudster one must be super-sharp,  team that haven't slept would be easily fooled and we had some near misses. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:08:14
Glad someone noticed! 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:04:45
danke schön
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:01:05
O.... K.....
---taking a step back, slowly ---
Now seriously, we're working on the English version. Will be live in 2 weeks or so.
Pretty sure our head programmer gonna downvote this comment.
Also, here is a picture of a cat. [LINK](
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:02:43
It's the most prominent Bitcoin community out there , you people used/hacked/checked every platform around - if there is a place when people will see whatever fuckups there are in a sec - its here.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:15:28
I'm talking about the first visit
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:21:32
Interesting guess. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:07:27




Sorry what? You aren't supposed to pay any additional commissions the the bank for buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:21:20
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:36:49
Yep. We're actually losing money on the small amounts
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:17:13
We've talked with our bank. We're gonna increase the daily limit to 500 EURO. 
Site will be live in English with the new limits in about 24 hours. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:51:13


Cash advance is an opt-in feature that benefits the merchant, we've passed.  In addition, we tested the system pre-launch from multiple cards, none of them was charged any additional fees
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:34:17
Was I?
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:37:06
Frankly, Circle are VC funded, they can afford to lose massive amounts of money daily. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:32:47
Oh. Humor. I've totally heard about this Humor thing. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:41:10
Well, we don't require retina scan... 
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:52:21
In our system, the verification email is sent after the user has completed payment and now sends us his ID for verification.  Not so easily exploitable.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:07:49
Honestly asking: don't you also pay a cash advance fee + interest  in Circle? 
@_date: 2014-10-29 09:37:50
Could you please elaborate? I'm looking at it right now and it seems fine
