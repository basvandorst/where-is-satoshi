Nationalism and patriotism aren't admirable anywhere outside the US? Really? I've seen your other comments in this thread and they are almost entirely void of rational thought. You make things up to support illogical arguments and dismiss people who present factual evidence in argument.
I'm annoyed.

No, they aren't brokers in any sense. Revenue generated is only for ad postings and upsells.

The hashtag  represents a small minority. People from Backpage are sending hundreds of inquiries to the small exchange I'm with, and I only expect it to increase. The users aren't techies, for the most part, but a surprising amount of them have built their own website and are much more tech savvy than I bet the average person gives them credit for.
Backpage has millions (yes millions) of posters, even a small percentage converted to BTC would be valuable. Once someone knows how to use BTC and the benefits gained from use they will likely not stop use at a single merchant. I'm with OP and think this is a great opportunity.

This is absolutely the biggest issue. Especially with the user demographics of a site like Backpage, there should be a way to purchase using Bitcoins through a simple integration and single interface.

No for real though, how did you know this?

The sales numbers reported vary widely and as BP is a private company could be vastly underestimated.
