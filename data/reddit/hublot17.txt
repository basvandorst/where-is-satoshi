I have used this service quite a bit the past couple months. While all the payments have eventually gone through, albeit it 5 business days+ after they claim to have processed them, the customer service is not up to where it needs to be. 
When someone is sending an irreversible currency to someone and paying a premium for a service, I expect better and more reliable correspondance as a way or reassuring the client that they aren't being screwed over when a payment that a company claims as processed never shows up as paid. Having to wait 3 business days for a reply is unacceptable in my opinion and needs to be corrected.

If its me, I would ask Quadriga to cancel and give you the fiat back in your balance, use that to buy back BTC and then cash out via CoinSquare....They have not let me down since I started using them. I request a EFT on Monday and it's in my bank account by Thursday...

Has nothing really to do with your bank, its very likely the funds havenn't been sent yet.... they are having massive processing issues, but as you would expect as their growth has been 10000000x

With Coinsquare not quadrigacx... I have and know of others who have been doing eft each week since Christmas and have no issues or delays...

I've used them before, the last time I used them it took them almost 10 days to complete my payment, but then they apologized and blamed it on moving platforms and that it would be better in the future. This is the same group behind the bitcoin embassy in montreal, I've done many face to face transactions with them and had no issues.

PRESS RELEASE
Dooga Ltd, trading as “Cubits”, enters Administration
- Dooga was victim of a serious criminal act
- Impact on business led to decision to place company into Administration
- Administrators appointed on 10 December 2018, securing current position
London, 11 December 2018 – Dooga Ltd, trading under the registered trademark “Cubits”, entered Administration on 10 December 2018. Steve Parker and Trevor Binyon of Opus Restructuring &amp; Insolvency (part of Opus Business Services Group) have been appointed as Joint Administrators.
Dooga was the victim of a serious criminal act, perpetrated from outside the organisation, which has critically impacted its business and finally led to the difficult decision to place the company into Administration.
This decision secures the current position whilst the Administrators seek offers for the business and its assets. The role of the Administrators will be to work with those who are owed money by the Company and to collect monies that are owed. The key objective is to achieve the best possible outcome for creditors and recover as much as possible of the funds owed to the Company.
The criminal act happened in February 2018 and involved the accounts of three clients. Bitcoins with a market value at that time of approximately €29 million were properly delivered and subsequently withdrawn, with the customers apparently colluding with fraudsters. Dooga has never received the equivalent in fiat from the payment processor responsible for carrying out the transaction. Immediately after becoming aware of the act, Dooga has informed the responsible authorities in the UK, Malta and China as well as in Germany and has filed several criminal complaints.
Since February, Dooga has made every possible effort to recover these funds. Unfortunately – contrary to expectations – these efforts have been unsuccessful up until now. Amongst other measures, Dooga has filed two garnishee orders against the Malta registered payment processor which owes Dooga approx. €35 million, and commenced arbitration proceedings, with the largest share coming from the aforementioned transactions of the three account holders.
Due to the nature of the case, both Allister Manson, Technology Partner at Opus Restructuring &amp; Insolvency, and Nicholas Parton, Head of Forensic Accounting at Opus, will also be closely involved in this case.
Steve Parker comments: “We have assembled a partner team from Opus with specialist expertise in technology, insolvency and forensic accounting. Our goal is to achieve the best outcome for creditors generally at the earliest possible date. Dooga’s current position is secure, investigations are proceeding and we will be writing to creditors, formally, this week.”
