So I bought a measly $1,800 in bitcoin 8 days ago. at $10,200. It's now $11,700. I was going to buy last month when it was $6,500, but never "got around to it".
I have about $80k coming to me from an inheritance. I think I should put $60k in bitcoin....

See that's what I'm thinking...if it goes bust I don't care (I mean I will care but not the end of the world). If it doubles in a year, which could happen, then I will care a LOT.

By the time I type "It's at $x,000", it will be at $(x+1),000

I will return only if it hits 100k. If it hits 100 (without the k), I will start using a throwaway.

I think Bitcoin will hit $100k by the summer. Hold strong.

I just bought some bitcoin from CoinBase. It says "Arrives in 7 days". Is that normal? Will I get less bitcoins if the price goes up or did it lock in at the price I bought yesterday?

Thanks. I read that online in another reddit forum. I bought it at 10,200 or so.
I emailed my friend how to buy with it was 6500, and I didn't follow up. Oh well. I think every paycheck I get from now on, after bills are paid, will buy bitcoin. If it crashes my bills are paid. If it doesn't crash, my bills are paid.
