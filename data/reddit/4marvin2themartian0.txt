You unintentionally was dense by unintentionally saying intentionally dense unintentionally instead of intentionally saying intentionally being dense. Does that make sense about dense?

Capital gains are a fancy word for profiting.
If you sell a stock how do they pay you? Money. 
Still think zuckerburgs only getting paid 1$ a year?
Do you understand why zuckerburg doesnt take a salary? Because itd get ate up in taxes.
If he was compensated with stocks he can sit on them for 1 year and 1 day and avoid a dickload of taxes. So by holding his stock 366 days instead of 365 which is the length of a year, his short term gain rate would be 39.6% where as long term capital gain is taxed at 20%. Which is why he doesnt take a salary  which is considered short term capital gain which is why he takes the stock and sits on it for a year and a day. Which gives a multi-billionaire the same tax rate as a middle class citizen.
365 days or less= 39.6% tax rate
366+ days= 20% tax rate
Welcome to financial literacy 102.
Did i just explain capital gain to someone who called me financially incompetent?

You have absolutely no clue. Trump doesnt take a salary because it would force him to release his tax records by law which is trumps biggest fear. 
Gains beyong initial value A.K.A profit. Just cause you do your taxes on turbotax doesnt qualify you as a tax genius. And yes capital gains are factored into your annual income. Also stop and ask yourself why zuckerburgs stocks are all older than 1 year...2 reasons a.) Appreciation, b.) Avoiding taxes.

The fact of the matter is your slinging out meaningless stats in attempt to legitimize your argument when point blank period you have absolutely no idea of what your talking about. Let alone arguing about.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:49:16
Dollar salary? Yea. Ok. If you believe that youre smoking crack. 
At this point your just whoring out posts for karma. This entire conversation was completely irrelevant.

You know whats better than roses on a grand piano? Tulips on an organ.

Hence the part i said "not just because its rare" its valuable because its usefullness as well as the fact you have its scarcity.

But if we didnt youd be speaking german

Im not really sure how this initial conversation was  even relevant to my post but here it goes
A.) First and foremost if you and everyone else are too lazy to invite your friend to a party because you would have to text them or call them instead of tag him in a post, you and everyone else are some shitty friends. If you cant understand point a.), then your probably in way over your head for point b.) and c.).
B.) You make the argument that bitcoin is like gold in that its a storage for wealth. By arguing that your blatantly agreeing that bitcoin has massive price potential and is here to stay.
C.) What do you think is going to happen as they acquire more traffic from big businesses such as facebook? Do you think a digital company is going to continue cutting paper checks/ deposits or do you think a digital powerhouse is going to go for a more usable DIGITAL currency? What about when governments start acquiring it as a storage of wealth?
D.) Your argument for facebook being bulletproof is weak. At one point MYSPACE was what YOU refer to as an "institution." Where is myspace these days? O ya, it eventually failed. 
Its funny you say that if I dont understand this then im in over my head but yet you fail to see the irony. Your talking about how your friend quit facebook while trying to convince me facebook is unstoppable. 
Perhaps your the one whos in over their head???...
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:37:56
Also your taking everything out of context. Obviously zukerburg aint getting billions in cash but instead digital deposits from banks. Dont be that guy who twists peoples words to fit into your context.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:17:07
I bet if you crack your phone open and look inside youll not find a single bitcoin....but i gaurentee youll find gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:57:22
Not sure what your gettin at but bitcoin has a fraction of the traffic and look at the price of a bitcoin compared to a share of facebook. And its still in its infancy. What do you think will happen when bitcoin has as much reach as facebook? Shit will be crazy. Bitcoin and litecoin has nowhere to go but up.

Thank you everyone for the downvotes! You are the reason i wake up every morning.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:00
Thats retarded. Gold will never devalue. There is a reason its exspensive. Not just because its rare.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:58:41
Each form of compensation you mentioned is capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:19:01
Not to mention all that extra profit hes making by hiding all that money in overseas tax havens
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:20:51
Miss the joke?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:29:16
I dont have facebook anymore.... Deleted it last week...but i have a phone..an s8 active to be exact.. So whos the one being unrealistic? You claim to have all this financial literacy but yet you fail to realise bitcoin is a currency where as facebook is a product. In 10 years mark zuckerburg is going to be paid in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:11:41
Capital gains is anytime you sell a product more than you got it for. He may be paid $1 a year salary, because if he was to take his payment as cash hed lose 40% of his money instantly. By waiting a year and a day to sell his stakes he will only pay 20% taxes. And last i checked he most definitely makes more than 480k a year. When you sell stocks for profit a.k.a. capital gain, you pay taxes on those profits.. By waiting  366 days instead of 365 days or less, he avoids almost 20% in taxes.
Gains from stocks are factored into your yearly income. So if he only got paid 1 dollar last year but sold 500million worth of his stocks his income for that year would be $500,000,001.00
If you didnt have to worry about your bills getting paid, would you rather get paid up front and instantly lose 40% or would you rather hold something for 366 days an only lose 20% duhh 20% all day. Trust me he doesnt do it out of the kindness of his heart.
So in conclusion his salary and his capital gains would be his annual income which is what your taxed by.
You dont get taxed on total wages. You get taxed on total income.
It is literally a very well known fact about zuckerburg and facebook evading every red cent in taxes they possibly can.
