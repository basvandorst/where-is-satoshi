The easiest way is probably a bch adresse. So everyone wants to donate btc swaps his btc with services like shapeshift into bch and sends them directly to andreas. Seems much less hasszle than doing all this complicated lightning preps.

Thanks for all the answers. I feel much more important now!

I‘m not convinced. Old argument and very old missconception.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:08:39
I disagree. 
Everybody has something to deal or to store. 
The less it is the more valuable it is. 
Especially for poorer people. 
You don’t need verification to use BreadApp or Bitcoin.com-Wallet on your older smartphone. And you don’t need an Exchange when u pay for your meal with BCH. 
It’s an enabler a big opportunity.

Paypal is expensive for merchants.

What is sharding?
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:26:38
I don‘t get it?

Who cares what the US does and good luck with Paypal and their ridiculous fee structure. Bitcoin – which is now BitcoinCash, is more than just a payment method. It is an enabler for emerging countries. It is a bank and a payment provider. It is liberating it will be the hard currency so i it was silver or gold 200 years ago. With the difference that no third party (xx Bank or paypal or ...) will be involved.

I'm aware of my judgement. I can read, i can check and recheck what was spoken and what was decided from who. I can follow an argument. I can look up who gets enormous funding and has to act in favor. I'm aware that it will make big financial service industries less powerful. I'm aware of that. Yes i trust my judgment, can't effort to mess that up by 'heroic effort that was/is made everyday' - by powerful people who seem to have specific interests. (1MB Cripple Block-size-limit, RPF, segwit prosthesis) =&gt; Bitcoin – is now BitcoinCash thats just my opinion. Took me also a while to understand.

“… prevented it from going up” – What he actually admits with this comment and  graphic is that BTC is now rarely used because BTC is only for hodl ...

HODLing itself does not create any value. It’s the silly idea that ure coin increases in value by itself without making any use of it. If u like to do something in hope that ure coin will increase in value in the future. U should promote usage. Ure coins need to be useful in the first place before u can hope that they increase in value.

Good lord. What an honour we have you to tell us the truth. Your wisdom will be told.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:12:18
Thats why u cant use Lightning network.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:24:32
That’s like Paypal. Just another payment gateway. People seem to forget what Bitcoin was all about!

So what is this petition than for? 
Why so impatient when he is actually the one who decided to proof this in front of a court? 
Do u think Craig would go this way with forged documents?

A person can have a 6000 karma points and will even be wrong. This metric doesn't really count. It just amplifies the group thinking.

Have you  checked his CV, his field of expertise, the people he was surrounded with. Did you listen to the "Arnheim 2017" speech? 
Please check his degrees and come back. And  tell me who else is Satoshi if not Craig Wright. 
How likely is this? People!!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:33:38
And your conclusion? 
Can’t be CSW because Twitter said so??
How likely is it that the white-paper felt from the sky? Really!
