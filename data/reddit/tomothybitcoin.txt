Wow. I found this really interesting. On NPR today there was an article talking about Herbalife and how a financial investor had made a large short on their stock of over $500 million or something and then was going about getting political support to rally against the company and get it attacked as a ponzi-scheme. I haven't done any investigation on the company and it very well could be a ponzi-scheme but its still kinda ugly that he's actively working to succeed on his short sale. I realize that this is similar to promoting a company you have actively invested in. Just interesting.

I'm just happy someone's promoting 'it' and not their own agendas...

Most of the large banks are located in New York; the banks want a piece of the action; and New York wants to remain a large financial hub and are worried about losing out to NC, MD, DC. They want to play in this new game that's been created but don't know the rules and want to make sure nobody's cheating and that they don't get in trouble. Also w/ NYPD and terrorists this is right up their alley; of course the difficulty is always the market entry/exit points but the AML concerns aren't entirely pie in the sky crazy talk. You can fund anyone anywhere; what they can do with it afterwards is a bit more problematic currently. Its like cash though, depending on how they handle it encourages some businesses to just operate with cash to be more untraceable and here could just encourage more disobedience as opposed to compliance.

Still, in 20 years, to finally get copies and know the dirt relating to DPR, Liberty Exchange, MtGox... I'd grab some popcorn and sit back to read all that. Hobbies...

One idea that has been floating around which was posted in a conspiracy theory thread, talked about the idea that a large percentage of Gox's assets (I.e. Coins, hence unavailability/gone) are tied up in legal proceedings related to the Silk Road and U.S. asset seizure and the possibility of Gox being constrained by a Gag order. I was just wondering about your thoughts on that. Then there is the possibility that even if this is the case (Gov't seized coins); would the US want Gox to have the operating liquidity to continue functioning or would there be a governmental interest in seeing them replaced by a more pliable operation. Hypothetically, the bankruptcy proceeding allows Gox to prevent itself being raided by creditors in a long drawn out proceeding with the hopes that U.S. Asset Seizure proceedings finish before the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. I mention this mainly because of the chat-logs that stated Mark was taking this step to protect those with coins who were not part of litigation proceedings trying to get their coins out first. Just wondering; thoroughly enjoying the discussion albeit the pain and fallout surrounding these times.

Nah, guy alleges 'cryptsy' stole bitcoins from his account. Looks like he didn't have 2FA enabled, someone hacked his account and withdrew 240 btc or something like that. He's upset. The complaint is pretty 'meh'. I'm not sure why they didn't allege a claim for negligence but they've got an argument of fraud... Its pretty weak...  
The only sexy thing of how it could all play out is all cryptsy users agree to binding arbitration... so i'm not sure how this will really play out.

I know everyone will say don't mine but... maybe diversify, some scrpy, some btc, and maybe some scrypt mining to sell for btc... but.... :D

His compliance comments are so poignant, so sexy.

do you have to do something if you are a casual seller? and just sell some stuff 1x a year?

True, the twins are killing me; I don't really want to hear them speaking, they're just... /sigh

And that they get to decide how to selectively enforce said rules.

Liked the post; agree with a lot of your sentiments. I'm excited for today's discussions. I think regulation concerning mining will come when the IRS makes taxation guidance. I really enjoyed when the second panel asked how to quantify bitcoin/cryptocurrency and they talked about how you can use it to send money and therefore it should be currency and regulated as currency transmission; than you have lee jump out and start discussing colored coins and their usability as contractual documents, like proof of purchase, house deeds, etc etc and then the panel was like, "well crap, i don't have any idea what's going on anymore..." Then lee goes, so I think it's a bit of everything, a commodity, a currency, and more (or something to that effect). I think it just illustrates the difficulty of using existing regulations to cover something like this and helps suggest that something new and flexible be created to cover this.
I also agree with the sentiment that too much regulation or bad regulation will lower adoption rates and push people back into the dark web; I think the darkweb will always exist, but to what extent do you want it thriving...  Just my .000002 btc; again, looking forward to todays discussion.
I also got a laugh when lee talked about litecoin industry still being a basement industry filled with hobbyists; and then I see the gpu farms with 100+ cards just making coins...
the carbon footprint comment was a bitter sweet notion also :/ I'm babbling and should go do some work now

Is this something that could/should be foiled? Re Government involvement re Mtxgox?

Any suggestions for steps attorneys should take who are looking to get more involved in the digital space with Bitcoin but are more junior?

I still have issues with the attempt at classifying Bitcoin as a currency. I still argue it is a commodity. If it's a commodity, it wouldn't fall under the purview of FINCEN and KYC/AML wouldn't apply so easily. Even if it quacks like a duck, looks like a duck, since we want it to be a dog, that yellow quacking beaked thing is a dog... and now we can prosecute/persecute you accordingly...

But think about that profit spread. So on the total sale value, credit card interchange rate fees widely vary but say they are ball park of say 1.5% for the various reward cards world cards and such at a bare minimum plus like a $0.15 transaction fee and all that goes to visa master-card. Whatever the added amount between that and what the seller pays is their fee. So say its 3% both parties pull in 1.5% on fees. Think about how lucrative that would be for ebay/paypal if they could completely cut mastercard/visa out of the loop. It would be frigging great for them. Lower over head and immediately increase profits? That's frigging bank. Especially if they integrate it through ACH transfers or can figure out a way to cut out v/m. There is some big money they could pick up. Sorry for the rambling. :)

Honestly, this doesn't sound good. You should print copies of the e-mails and any additional correspondence. I would recommend going to the police. I think you may have been scammed...

Ok, so looking at your prediction; you think the market hasn't bottomed out? In light of the fact that the China news was fake, why wouldn't you expect a gradual rise with people taking profits all along the time, i.e. up a few dollars, sell, drops, buy back in, rinse repeat? Just wondering, I just keep losing at this forex game.
