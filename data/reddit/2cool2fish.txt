Well at least they have taken the next step: "We need a coin to settle the transactions."  
Steps coming soon:
1) "The settlement coin needs to have value, otherwise we are back to being an awkward spreadsheet."  
2) "That implies a market with purchasers of the coin."
3) "We could create a coin and try to market it to a voluntary market, but Bitcoin is now 10% of global aggregate fiat and altcoins are 3% combined." 
4) That would be an altcoin....So! So! So let's payoff our government stooges to create value through a nonvoluntary market!!! Yup, it's always worked so far!"

I watched Peter Schiff this morning.  He just keeps getting it 100% correct. The Fed keeps yakking and will not raise rates. There are no true markets until interest rates are what they would be in a free market (ie with low barrier to entry competitive monies.) 
Interest rates at market would mean a serious and prolonged depression, the reaping of cheapened price of money. In the absence of market rates, there will be inflation, a lack of capital investment and undue consumption.

At a $10B market cap, it's a pipsqueak of a money.  I think there is very good possibility that crypto money and quite possibly it will be Bitcoin, reaches market cap of $10Ts in today's dollar purchase power.   In fact, unless that happens, it is likely to be superseded by something else.   It's still a very high risk high reward investment; but it is looking better all the time.

You are not a serious person.  My standard of living is primarily from my work, that yes of course is helped a lot by standards of decency by those around me.  Law is only one aspect of that and I know many examples where defying the law is against decency and many where it is to uphold decency. 
You think that therefore implies obligation to unquestioning fealty to authority in action as well as thought. Well, only idiots do that.  I will fully rightfully take the fruits of society and tell idiots to get lost.
You will also have to accept that money as accounting institutions is probably become obsolete or at least only one option.  Law is moot. It can not dictate preference of value nor simple communication.  Not CNN or the Fed or FinCEN or you or any government "leader" can do anything about it.

I think the banks will need to get dragged to that point by Mr. Market.  The people that control fiat are far from daft. They do act out the part of well meaning bumblers but really? I think they will understand it long before they embrace it.  I sincerely believe that the only true manner in which a real permissionless crytpo money gets embraced by banks is through state conglomeration. I think that thwt is also destined to fail. I guess it would be hard to call it permissionless.
I have said this many times. Banks have only the choice remaining of their failure mode. Embrace Bitcoin (killing their golden goose at the BIS), develop an altcoin superior (ie more permissionless, no inflation surprises) to all of Bitcoin, Monero, etc. (not only slaughtering the goose but likely to fail), or stay with the fiat and its vices and inefficiency (the golden goose just gets competed into old age).

Good quality article.  
It is slightly dismissive of Bitcoin and does not treat it deeply.  It seems to skate past the revolutionary notion of a boundary-less money that has not required government support. On the same theme, while it correctly discusses that banks are really artful double entry ledger managers, it fails to discuss the primacy of the relationship of bank, state and fiat object.   It is not clear if that is a purposeful omission, trying to play nice with the establishment precepts or whether the authors are a bit blinded by the everyday normalcy bias of state money.

Ha! 
There is a bank and government imposed currency monopoly on most of the planet.  It is mostly coordinated and intertwined.  
Freedom to choose money objects is as fundamental to human well being as freedom to choose food type or person to choose to love.  
This monopoly of money is deeply harmful and it requires much interference against the natural expression of giving value between two people. Legal tender laws enforce local currency to be used in contracts for all kinds of commerce, Treasuries, insurance, commodity exchange, tax remittance and on and on and limit freedom, all towards the support of currency monopoly.  
It is rather clear that the end of the Breton Woods arrangement is being negotiated directly and through oher means.  This transition is fascinating and terrifying simultaneously, but it is hardly obvious how it turns out.  Money systems are rivalrous and have been historically unscrupulous subversion of some interest by another.  The dominant Anglo-American system is creaking badly, in fact it's bankrupt, several times over. What has always been the case is the common person is always the subject of the system.  It is the muscle, time and mind of the common person in trade for money that gives imaginary money real value. If there is a global money system (Russia and public Blockchain money will have something to say about that), it will be a coordination of the money printers to put value into notions by compelling the common man to use and value the money. Same as it ever was.
I think Bitcoin is in great shape. It will probably dominate the public Blockchain space.   Even if this Blockchain fails, all the amazing offspring will succeed.  
Monetary freedom is the application. Freedom to use, to enter the system; to create monies and futures and equities without access to the royal jelly prinitng press.
I am not at all counting on a smooth transition.  I have a faith that the old guard is becoming as invalid as it is ridiculous.

I would go a step further.  The primary purpose of banks is to make fiat "real."  Banks are how fiat gets to the street.  This is of course made unnecessary with Bitcoin as there are no need for third party holding of accounts with crypto assets. All other functions of banks are easily replaced.  Many of those functions can be replaced with applications.  I think the brand names in banks will cling fast to central banks, right into oblivion. They will not embrace a permissionless protocol. 
I suppose it will become sort of personal and cultural.  My kids think YouTube and Netflix is TV.  I don't really try to explain the old days of analog central broadcasting. Sure NBC still exists, Sure there is a regime of broadcast type video packets.  But it's not dominant or really even differentiated and for me personally, I rarely use it.  That's what will happen with banks. There will still be a Citibank, settling with DeutscheBank using some crypto Blockchain (probably Bitcoin), but they won't be dominant or even differentiated and some of us will rarely use them.

What is the mechanism for redeeming the IOUs?  Does a bank transfer a crypto IOU to a wallet of a central bank in exchange for cash on account?  When the reverse needs to happen does the central bank debit the cash account and transfer a crypto IOUs value to the wallet of the  bank?  Obviously this would be a highly closed system without a market of any sort, that is, markets require price determination freely and competing buyers and sellers.  They aren't as much IOUs as receipts or proofs. Maybe they could call it Faxcoin. "Just calling to see if you got the Faxcoin?" 
It seems like it's just really a notarizing system.  I am not expert in that field to judge if that is very helpful, but again I have to conclude, relative to the potential of public blockchains and adhoc trade able Blockchain objects to provide non hierarchical finance options; its mouse nuts.  And again I would go further, banks may well be facing their Kodak moment.

I agree that following the money is helpful investigatory technique. 
But gifting value in private is very much nobody else's business. Not only do I think this is justifiable moral stance, it will be defacto modus operandi for all finance within a generation. Just ask the Music Industry how easily control of digital objects is evaded.

Well, first, when dollars are added to the system, these come at zero cost to the bank, either the Fed when it increases its balance sheet  or a commercial bank when it expands via credit creation. The Fed has the unique position of arbitrarily adding dollar credit/debits. Commercial banks don't have the same liberty. 
Through a variety of laws, these bank currencies enjoy a near monopoly of being money. The units have value on the street. So when new units are created, they have identical value as units previously deployed in the economy.  Dollars on the street are an asset to their holder exactly because they are a liability to the bank. The Fed creates these liabilities from imagination and matching assets. So this privlelge is unique and supported by government suppression of other money.  As an aside, we are so accustomed to this that most people do not consider that there might ever be other types of money. State money has strong cultural dominance. 
The rent seeking is deeply systemic.  The culture and the mass economy nearly completely utilize this one form of money.  There is not much option to do otherwise. The rentiers are the conglomerate of bank and state, hinged at the central bank.  Government utilizes its claims to tax into the future to create bonds (nice nomenclature), the price in money of these bonds is highly influenced by the rate of change of the balance sheet of the central bank.  With a zero change in monetary inflation, market price for future flows of taxation would be lower, ie interest rates would be higher. Governments get more money today for their promises to tax in future.  They do not have to pay market or political price for expenditure. This makes government a rent receiver of its own participation in the system and codependent. 
Commercial banks have a fairly closed relationship with the central bank. Only a few have benefit of direct access to central bank credit. These few are significant shareholders of each other. Regulation squelches entry by smaller competition.  Banks are very tightly integrated with central banks. Since Glass-Steagall was removed, banks can invest however they like, take on all manner of risk, reap reward for the risk, but as chartered dollar vendors, will always have access to dollars regardless of their failures. Banks then are rent receivers of the fiat system. 
Banks allocate capital. In an open competitive, proper risk pricing environment, banks would be obligated by market necessity to allocate capital according to return. They would exactingly seek to fund profitable loans. In a closed, risk-free, no-cost money environment profit seeking is not primary.  Subprime no doc mortgages are a well known example. Bankers don't have to fund the most profitable applications, they are free to allocate capital for friends or political concerns. There grows an entire cadre of enterprises that are no more than friendly parties connected to bankers. These are rent receivers of a monopoly currency.  
The result is exactly as predicted by Austrian types and historians.  We have a culture and system of merit by connection, of extravagant plutocracy, of financialization and de-industrialization.  Currency monopoly always collapses under its own screwy incentives.   
It is perhaps forgiveable in an historic sense. Money is a critically important aspect to civilization. Perhaps a central ledger enforced by a sovereigns claim to dominance was necessary to create ephemeral objects of value.  But it's no longer true.

Imagine you are at a table in Vegas playing against the house. Not only is the game designed to take a little bit of your money over time, with central banks, they get to choose the next card.  Guess who gets richer and richer!

The main reason that IOUs work and in fact are necessary for markets and will be necessary for Bitcoin, is to accommodate time preferences.  
I am not really using my bitcoin now, so if I can receive compensation by contracting with a broker to take my btc now and pay me back later with more btc, that's a happy arrangement. The broker then of course contracts with those who need the btc now who will return more later.  If this broker becomes reputable and is willing to provide proof of reserves and proof of balance sheet, the IOUs themselves might become acceptable has having some value. Indeed for more interest, I might even be willing to lend into a fractional reserve scenario.  An IOU market might develop. 
Notice how very very different that is than a fiat monopoly system.  In fiat, a base dollar is not distinguished from a derivative dollar. The units on the balance sheet of the Fed are called dollars, as are the unite of IOUs at the retail bank. Notice, of course, that there is no open verification of the Fed's balance sheet, or any banks.  Notice, the freedom to use or not use any of the crypto currencies; no requirement for government compulsion to use.  Notice how the broker has no recourse to failed risk getting covered by monetary expansion.  Risk is rewarded because it's actually risk.

Ethereum and Monero have extravagant blockchains but awesome features.  A three year and out pegged value Sidechain coin preserves the "small" Bitcoin Blockchain over time, gets the features to market but does not necessitate permanent preservation of the large chains on distributed servers.  Interested parties can always keep a copy of the fossilized temporary sidechain, but it need not remain living.
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:46:35
So are these IOUs actually crypto assets? That is, are they transferable with a private key signature to a public key that can be derived from a random number?  Will they be intended to have markets where the IOUs have a value?  If so, then these settlement coins are public Blockchain monetary instruments in their own right. If not, then they are merely documents of settlement that can be used to prove redeemability, and they are not really coins but notary services.

I think the intermediate step is "institutional."    The sentiment that most people don't care about Bitcoin's prime benefits is accurate.  But there is a rich pasture between us early enthusiasts and the average dude.  O'Byrne, Winklevoss, Andreessen, these are the types that we already have that will carry the ball into oh, big value oil and gold contracts; bitcoin denominated actuary.
Oil and gold are very fungible but are treated somewhat as controlled contraband by the big banks.  Perfect fit for Bitcoin contracts. Who needs the permission of a bank if I have an enforceable Bitcoin contract with a gold/oil supplier?
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:11:51
I agree with this sentiment.  I get a little ill when I read from people that think that a rivalry between Etheruem and Bitcoin is some to the death match.  
Ethereum is trying to do something awesome.  Incredibly world changing.  And if it succeeds, it is a small possibility that Bitcoin will not be needed in this world.  Efhereum's ambition is so so far from being accomplished.  Bicoin anchors the entire affair for all the foreseeable future. 
The two rise together IMO.  A simple non-censorable abstract object money with transparent ledger (Bitcoin) is socially necessary and tremendously useful.  
A completely programmable system of immutable contracts is also extremely valuable. 
The two complement the other majorly.  Ethereum's little disaster tarnishes the whole thing.  TheDAO was the problem, the theft was just a logical result and the hardfork was a poor result of a poor dilemma. 
It's difficult to know what happens next. I honestly wonder if Etheruem's dream is realizable at all, but I sure hope so. This moment will pass.  Eth has more forks ahead of it already. Consensus algorithm, inflation schedule. blocksize and network scaling are all still undefined.   ETHC may be just the first branched offspring.  I am not convinced of POS, but I do like a small inflation to secure PoW and I doubt sharding can work, so I might follow a branching that does those things. 
Anyway...  Like so many times with Bitcoin, these setbacks happen. We are still insignificant relative to the outcome, so let's not despair here.  It's now completely impossible to stay up with the news of dvelolment let alone go deep on 10% of it.  The dynamic and complexity of the crypto asset world is unlike anything in traditional finance.
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:53:15
So, there are a couple of comments that are giving bad advice.  
DO NOT "import" private keys when the value in question is significant.  Importing the private key exposes the private key to the machine you are on and thus to the Internet.  Do not import!  Only sweep!  Sweeping puts the funds into a new address that has not had its private key exposed.  
When I abandoned Armoury, I ended up doing it manually, because of bad synching issues, etc.  I literally sweeped keys into Electrum by typing in the Armoury private keys because I was paranoid about USB etc. And then broadcasting transactions to paper and Trezor wallet addresses.  
The Armoury interface should show you a Base58 clear text private key if you have password, etc.  You will need Base58 format for Electrum for example.  Watch out for leading or trailing spaces or spaces inputted literally from the displayed Base58 string.  Electrum did not diagnose the problem but couldn't process instructions either.

I meant by the time the bank's get around to realizing that they need to divorce (or at least have a serious affair from) central bank money and develop their own money instruments, Bitcoin will be much bigger.

States exist.  The state is likely the predominant object of discussion in political philosophy of the past few centuries.  At its core, the state is merely a claim to morally accept a monopoly of initiation of violence.  As such, states are in terrible philosophic position.  Look, you don't have to adopt this premise. But honestly to say that it enters lunacy is just shitty on your part, arrogant, judgemental ignorant, not empathetic.  Voluntarism is a real, objectively moral, not terribly unpopular philosophy.  
Money is a necessary facility for civilization. I won't disagree, government money has provided benefit.  But it has also been a form of abuse since its inception.  Bitcoin is a massive improvement in money in the moral dimension.  Again you don't have to adopt this stance but consider opening your mind a little. Or at the very least stop pretending you are better than others.  Nobody else thinks you are.

My own bias is that whether private blockchains have a valuable purpose or not, they just don't matter much relative to public blockchains that create crypto transferable assets.  The former is perhaps at best a really excellent time stamped multiparty trustless documentation system (YAWN!!!). The latter is seed for inverting the power structure of finance.

Just going to pop in and say that it's nice to see this debate. My own thought is that the power of the powerful is at an historic maximum.  But there are signs that the peak has passed and that new freedoms are being gained.  I think it's a minority that now think their governors are of superior nature.  People consume more alternative than mainstream media. Recent hacks have revealed much (Snowden, DNC, H. Clinton, Soros).  Current events show the impotence of various empires (Chinese moving money abroad, US being rebuffed a second time in Syria,  Brexit, Turkey playing sides). Negative interest rates are an obscene desperate maneuver to maintain the status quo hierarchy but reveal the chains of state monopoly fiat.
And then there's Bitcoin. Not just free from hierarchy, but superior in money properties.

I think the real market is still finance non conforming to fiat.  Bitcoin is designed to evade central control. That is the whole purpose of it's weird and awkward form.

But if they have an excuse to control, they will not hesitate.  By becoming scandalized by this, you are playing checkers to their chess.  By being angered, you provide energy into their control.  Anything you want is available to you, anything, enjoy the freedom.  Whenever I sample mainstream media, it takes me about a minute to understand which false dichotomy is being presented.   Case in point:  "When will central banks raise rates?"  Gnash, fury, angst fear.  But never, why is it not left for markets to determine the price of money?

Paul Volcker said that he did not control interest rates.  Curious.  He went on to explain that the only thing central banks control is supply.  
How is it that the price of money (interest rate) can be held below a market equilibrium?  There is only one way, that supply exceeds (greatly for NIRP) demand.  Low, zero and negative rates are inflationary.

It's a bit tough to judge.  I really respect the notion of keeping the system as low barrier to entry as possible, ie small blocks, and am personally concerned about nil that there are fees now or even that fees become kind of obnoxious, if that's necessary to keep things decentralized.  Layer 2 solutions are fine by me including solutions like Bitcoin banks (something like Coinbase) who deal in account IOUs and use the Blockchain transactions only as occasional agregations.  That said, using the Blockchain should not be so far out of the reach of middle class Joe or small business that they can use it as well. It's difficult for me to quantify where we are at.  I don't think I have seen a concise "Engieering" analysis that models when blocksize really compromises accessibility.  For small multipliers of current size, I don't think storage or even RAM is an issue, nor do I think last mile bandwidth is. I wonder about global latencies but ten minutes is a very long time to settle on say 4 MB addition to the chain. 
I am skeptically trustful of the current plans and not fundamentally worried if it's the wrong approach. If it is wrong, well there are lots of other blockchains.

It's sort of a frustrating read.  
All that is required to determine the proper price of any given "money," is merely the free choice of which money a person can use.  Then a money that has a cheapened future value (the dollar since Greenspan), or a money that is radically disinflation (the Volcker dollar) can simply be avoided as an asset (Greenspan-Bernanke-Yellen dollar) or as a debt (Volcker dollar).

I think it refers to a mode of thinking that all crytpo currency and crypto asset will eventually use Bitcoin as the underpinning Blockchain. As such, the vast majority of value of currency application will lie in Bitcoin.  There is something to this line of thinking.   
There was article at Nakamoto Institute that describes the tendency of a money to art of gravitationally pull other monies' value into it and as one becomes dominant, people want it more creating a positive feedback.  
This has some evidence, ie US Dollar dominance, or even Bitcoin dominance. 
It is thought that all other crypto innovations will eventually just become either a feature or a Sidechain on Bitcoin.

I thought that was the only interesting point.  Bank of England said precisely that their Blockchain coin would allow them direct relationships with money users.  
While Bitcoin can be used "on account" at a central or commercial bank, it's not really being used in its best form that way.  Since it is based on private keys and not n identity, Bitcoin and indeed all Blockchain assets do not require banks of any variety.

It is impossible to know.
The short book, the text of which is freely available, When Money Dies, discusses the Weimar hyperinflation.  There is a substantial delay between the initiation of massive money printing and loss of confidence in it. It is the loss of confidence that causes hyperinflation but it is an inevitable result of money printing.
Clearly tbe situation of the USD today is very different than Weimar in 1922. The hegemony of the USD is powerful. It is maintained  through military imposition.  This is starting to wobble badly.  This event with Sauudi Arabia, Russia's and China's open declaration of resentment to the US hegemony, the domestic Libertarian dissent, the various currency swapping agreements by China, Bitcoin, are all evidence that people are losing confidence and want to be free of this imposition.  
The USD gained prominence largely through the Bretton Woods agreement, when it was backed by gold and an agreed to hegemony.  It maintained its prominence through military imposition of trade arrwngements, the most important of which has been the deal with Sauudi Arabia. 
This NYTimes piece is fascinating. It is literally one of the hugest geopolitical event in our times. It's a bit subtle but it exposes the terrible position the US Government has put itself into vis a vis its relationship to bankers' money.  The government of the land of the free must choose between risking losing a big piece of its currency hegemony and treasonous, seditious interference in a just inquiry into Sauudi involvement in the World Trade Centre bombings, an act of war. This says without doubt, US clout is waning. 
How much turmoil and abuse can the USD tolerate?  You seem to think it's an infinite amount or at least a lot more yet. I don't think so.  I recognize that the BIS and USD hegemony is still dominant. However this is rapidly changing. Adding another $1T to the Fed balance sheet is a bale of hay the camel can bear, but the camel is showing signs of fatigue. 
I think USD collapse is inevitable and increasingly imminent.  I prefer to predict via events than timeframes. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are all a little weakened currently but that is temporary in all three cases. When China publicly announces that it has sold a substantial amount of its UST thereby declaring its independence from the USD hegemony. Years but not many. 
Bitcoin will initiate divorce between commercial banks and central banks. They are each toying with blockchain coins that denecessitates the other.  They have no choice but to do so, and in fact the whole business model of "accounts" will be greatly deprecated by crypto assets. So, the event of a bankcoin release, be it commercial bank or central bank, is a death knell to the USD.  Years but not many.

This is such nonsense. Geez, think about it.  A unit of currency is imaginary. Adding or subtracting an imaginary unit can not change reality where people move around and need to eat. 
If you can't see that then go ahead and keep swallowing Keynesist swill, but here is the thing.  You go ahead and follow that. I think it's bunk. But I have the right not to buy in. You do not have the right by virtue of an overlaid government imposed currency money to impose your philosophy into my actions. 
Now perhaps you are not convinced that the printing of money creates an uneven benefit for some people over others.  I think there is overwhelming evidence that money printing creates the massive wealth disparity we have. There is ample evidence that the motive to have ability to enforce a currency domain into a real economy is the primary motive for war. 
Money is an imaginary store of today's labour for tomorrow's rent tradeable by the landlord for gasoline. That is its function. It's function is not to enforce law, nor to stimulate employment levels. Those are weird expectations, by the way.
When money loses its value because the imaginary measuring units are being subdivided by a central bank, of course that means people want to rid themselves of it. We measure the pace of this hot potato game and hold that up as the primary measure of economy measures in an alterable imaginary measuring stick. 
I don't want to be in that racket and I don't want my government to be in it either.

That's the true power of the central bank: to surprise.  Whether they yank the chain up or down is just the belief system. "Which way will I yank the chain? "  This is the method to domination. The chained comes to think: if only I can figure out by her mood or her slight variance in verbage.  Lower, lower, lower, must be lower, but can't go below zero, got it figured out, oh no it can go below zero, lower lower, ok hyperinflation it is, got it figured out, 20%, aaaaggh! Damn you Paul Volcker.  If you think zero interest sucks, wait til it's 20%!!!
This is masters and slaves.  The only path out is alternate money and market determined time value of money.   The Fed will only ever be ended by a more central master. The government will never cease support for currency monopoly.  Faith in any of the bankstate is completely fallacious.  There still isn't much choice, but it's changing.  Satoshi is a hero.

I don't think you really know what money is. Bank money (fiat) requires banks. Having a government installed lender of last resort and having a uncompetitive access to this lender is a social license provided to banks in order to keep money functioning when it inevitably breaks down due to debt cycles becoming excessive. Central and commercial banks have abused this license to the extreme, probably predictably. This abuse creates a vast array of moral obscenity (read about the motives for bombing Libya provided by Mrs. Clinton's illegal email server). 
While banks are useful but not necessary for asset commodity money like gold or Bitcoin, banks are strictly necessary for fiat money. 
The array of capabilities that are possible with a programmable, end user controlled, peer to peer money are vastly superior to those of money that requires third party account control. It's not really that banks will disappear in a puff of smoke, it's that they will exist in a space of finance that is a shadow of where the action is. Not necessarily (but probably IMO) extinct, just very much not mattering.
I will somewhat agree that if central banks get back to the business of rarely backing commercial banks in extreme situations, fiat stands a chance of maintaining relevance. Given that the current world power structure is psychopathic: central banks directing military intervention to impose monetary regime, I doubt very much they will heal themselves.

How does a central bank even survive Bitcoin?
A debt based asset that requires government compulsion, is arbitrary in quantity, is human modifiable in it its ledger, is held and transferred in third party account can't compete against an asset that is purely an asset, has no barrier to participate, has inalterable quantity and ledger and is held and transferred by user control. 
It's only a matter of time to enculture people about the usefulness of Bitcoin.
There are people that profit from central banking institutions. These institutions themselves are as artificial and imaginary as their partner governments.  They are creations of humans. There is nothing absolute about their necessity.  Money is certainly an important column of civilization.  Money of central banks was just one temporary form of it.

The notion of the state is not uncommon, or loony.  To state otherwise is the kooky argument. 
Bitcoin is money not associated with the state. To state otherwise is the kooky argument.  
My subjective opinion: government fiat is an abused system and is responsible for great harm.  That is not at all a lightly informed opinion.  Peer to peer transferance of value might ameliorate that.  That is a worthy pursuit.  That is the prime purpose of Bitcoin. Adhoc, low barrier to entry, permissionless money.  Bitcoin also has superior money properties and requires no banks at all to be 100% recognizable.  Banks are not much without their special role in the fiat system.

Of course. This is the tiniest tip of one iceberg.  
This is the mechanism by which the Rothschilds "disappeared" after amassing control of the planet's productive wealth.  It is how the money world is controlled from the shadows.  
Control of the ability to print pure notions that have value is literally license to print money.  The laws and institutions that give the notions value are facets of society that we have become compliant to even though they are deeply unfair.  This is wrongful as it puts undue burden on us to exercise preference of money.  It's practically impossible. Until Bitcoin, that is. 
Banks, the big ones we all know, are necesary retailers of money.  This is their main function to bring fiat to the street.  
It is childishly simple to understand that a person is free to cherish what he or she will. This is a matter of conscience and is beyond need of protections by the idea of a right. So there is a huge enterprise of law and media designed to compel us to use "government" money. In reality "government" money serves the banks, especially in the case of USD.   
This "leak" is a glimpse of the trail that disappears when it is attempted to follow legitimate finance to its true owners. Private equity firms control the financial systems.

I don't have a problem with banks, per se.  But it is clear to me that central banking has become a scourge. I do not have the faith or even hope that you do that governments and central banks can be contained. The evidence is very highly to the contrary. I think banks will do very well as all alocators of risk for Bitcoin denominated credit in the not too distant future. 
I think you are correct that many people see Bitcoin something like gold, partly as a hedge against systemic failure. I think the difference however is significant enough that by whatever vector, mass failure of banking or just slow plodding, Bitcoin's monetary properties may carry it to be widely used as I said a couple of posts above. I also think that the shitstorm of fiat failure is all around us now. That the biggest BIS banks are zero or negative rates means they are printing as fast as they can get banks to take the money. This is the function of a central bank but to be used only for the instance of bank failure.   The system is either broke or corrupted and I think it's both.

Seems to me that we can afford and should upgrade the blocksize. The sooner the better. But only once and with the next change also requiring a hardfork.
Just hand Classic's keys to Core and do a one time 2 or 4MB hardfork with Core devs with keys to all competing clients. 
That's what I would offer Gavin if I were u/nullc . We all get bigger  blocks without the danger of Gavin. Gavin exits gracefully and moves Bitcoin forward through a negotiated agreement. Hurrah, let's get on to bigger things.  
Or if I were u/gandresen, I would lead all the ClassicCoiners to double peg a large amount of their holdings into a Classic Sidechain. Live or die on your own merits.  Price movements relative to each settles the bet.  If even 20% of btc goes on to that chain, it's bigger than Ethereum.  Satishi himself could vote.  
That's the real deal with Bitcoin.  
It's fascinating that "Classic" holds a veto of sorts. Introducing a hard fork client from devs of Core, makes that client compete with old Core Clien and Classic Client, with no one guaranteed anything. Can hear Classic, "can Core come out and play?"  It's no wonder the devs of Core are frozen. There is an election coming!  
I would like to see four or five competing clients.

Yup.  If the asset is tradable via crypto signature, then it requires no "account", is therefore a bearer asset and needs no bank.   If the asset is to meet the bare standards of Bitcoin, it will be crytpo tradable, have low inflation, open source and require no authorization to own or transfer. And it will need to join altcoin parade.  Good luck. With such parameters from a bank coin, central banking is dead.

Check any US paper currency in your wallet.  It is not issued by the US Treasury (government). You will find the words Federal Reserve note.  US Dollars are issued by the Federal Reserve.  
The value is supported by demand for these dollars which is created by government in four manners.  Legal tender laws make dollars the most common settlement mechanism in USA. Taxes payable in USD means payors must obtain USD to pay taxes.  Most importantly USD are required to fund operations and programs of the government, so the government itself demands Dollars. Lastly, the US Government creates economy and trade internationally, mostly through military intervention.  
With this demand for dollars, the Federal Reserve creates dollars with impunity. The benefit of this flows largely to the owners of the Fed, the large banks, through preferential interest rates, the license to fractional reserve lend and the privilege to never fail regardless of moral quality or competence. 
The US government does benefit from this arrangement, through fairly cheap borrowing.  But much of this goes back to supporting the value of the US Dollar.
So tell me how you think it works.

Nah!!! 
Countries are as imaginary as the Easter Bunny. 
And I for one have come to this neat conclusion that I can make up my own mind on moral choices better than Evita Peron, Evita Barak or Evita Trudeau or Evita Putin ever could.  The evidence I have is they all lie and all kill and all own horrible killing machines and then tell me that they know how to spend my labour better than I do. And that's clearly more insane than thinking the Easter Bunny exists.  I mean at least the Easter Bunny only does nice cute things and never lies or tells me how to think.  The Easter Bunny never tells me that he or she needs to know my private affairs while hiding their emails while in public office.  The Easter Bunny does not bomb Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria with my money and  murderous and martyred boys with little flags I am supposed to feel loyalty to. The Easter Bunny wouldn't dream of telling me I can't use math to obfuscate ones n zeros. 
So not only will I choose what is money for me, I can certainly make up my mind which good projects to crowd source and see on a blockchain that it actually gets spent that way. 
And it helps if I imagine there are no countries, no religion too, nothing to live or die for. It helps if I can rely on the store of my labours as not being manipulate on the t axis distorting my functions against t.

I think there are several flaws in what you are saying. 
Sure anything CAN be money but in any context few things actually are. Gold is the only money that is money in almost all contexts.  Fiat money is money but only in limited time and space contexts. Bitcoin is money, but in a very very limited context. Obviously some of people, including me, think it's properties are superior enough that it will gain status in a much larger context. 
I think the flaw in your argument is so obvious that I wonder if you are trying to direct this into a Hegelian false dialectic. You want me to choose between the evil of fiat inflation and the evil of government debt. It is abundantly clear to me that those are the same beast. Central banks are very much a symbiosis of government debt. They do not exist without one another. Indeed I would proffer that the arrangement defeats any notion of democracy or republic or even autarchy because the banker is in charge of the statesman.   It is the governments claim to right of violence and thereby arbitrary taxation power that puts economic value into imaginary bank notions (notes).  
The reason there are bank panics and the need for the insurance of a lender of last resort (with zero external discipline of balance sheet) is because, as you indicate, economic and financial cycles are not precisely synchronous.  It is not economically helpful to have no banks at all when economy doesn't keep up with debt.  So to be fair, there is some real purpose in having functioning money, and the structures in place do make some sense.  But it is corrupted to obscenity. Cheating, fraud, rentier actions, manipulation of capital allocation, counterfeit, so called moral hazards, and my own personal bug, the use of war as a tool to impose monetary domain over economy. This to my mind is an inevitable product of trusting humans to be honest about holding the privilege to print money. That trust is violated every single time. 
The brilliance of Bitcoin is that it removes the human element. Trust in bank management of double entry ledgers is replaced by mundane proofs of work, quantity is algorithmically defined, no third party is required to hold or transfer the asset. 
The world financial system today is the fading vestige of the Bretton Woods arrangement. This was a system of IOUs representing gold.  A global scale banking system can be run on a pure asset money.  Bitcoin is far better suited to this purpose than gold because it is inherently verifiable. The ledge of gold is unkown. It is so perfectly fungible and invisible to monitoring that it is something of a chimera and can be counted many times over as being the same ounce. You might remember some of the scandal just a few years ago when Germany began to inspect and repatriate its gold held in NYC by the Fed. The specific gold bars that had been deposited could not be produced. They were gone and had to be replaced at the last instant. 
That can't happen with Bitcoin. If it moves, it is easily seen.  This actually enables a much much higher quality system of IOUs and fractional reserve  than either good or fiat.  
As McAfee says, the problems of central banking almost don't need to be worried about. The finance that will flourish outside of the domain and purview of the bankstate are so much more capable and dynamic, that fiat will, in my opinion, just not matter.

It will be fascinating and very important. 
While I agree with you that we need social organization, I am more certain that the current unipolar system is morally bankrupt. It is vastly inefficient, it is only competent where it serves it's rentiers, it grotesquely abuses it's claim to right to use violence, and provides a shabby degree of the public good that you seek. There is so much murder and malfeasance built in, that personally my preference is to rid ourselves of the notion of governance altogether. 
Now, usually when I say that, there is a capricious and irrational leap to a reference of the slippery deluge. It is argued that governance is the only mechanism to hold us from barbarism.  That of course is unsophisticated fealty to faith. 
A money born of a trustable proof of work ledger cleaves money from state. It rids most of the condition that allows for severe wealth disparity. It creates a more honest accounting of future costs of public works thereby sanitizing endeavours such as the military. The potential benefit is enourmous. 
So how do we fund good works without governance?  I do not know, but it's a problem worth solving. Taxation will hopefully become as anachronistic as fiat money, war and prison.

Imagine the world freely interacting and supporting and profiting from it without the costs of barbarism and monetary inflation, with the honesty of conversation without channeled media.  It would be a wealthier world, an order of magnitude higher. Now if 21M units were the transmitter of value for that, well each would certainly be very very potent.
@_date: 2016-04-08 12:53:55
Ok, but there are some substantial differences here. 
First, Lightning receipts can not be forged. A gold receipt can. Gold is highly fungible and there is no way for its owner to know that the custodian actually keeps 100% reserves.  This is where the innovation of fractional reserve comes from. Gold custodians realized they could cheat as long as they kept good books and that enough people trusted them that not everyone demanded their gold at once. The Medici family gained their famous prominence this way. Not surprisingly accounting innovation, double entry ledgers, was necessary to make this happen.  
Second, Lightning is not a credit system. These are not IOUs.
Third, a credit system based upon Bitcoin, would be an enourmous improvement over a credit system based on bank currency. Sure there is trust involved. But it's much reduced trust. The assets can be known, and locked in with multisig smart contracts. Legions of regulators can be replaced with a single high reputation notary. Fractional reserve ratios would be agreed to by creditors and debtors with small pools of smart contracts and visible on a blockchain. Reserve funds would not be movable with a pen flick. VISA type scaling is probably far easier to achieve than the way VISA does it. Keeping VISA's ledger sane is a huge task, that probably only a tiny fraction is necessary to do with Bitcoin. The asset side of the balance sheet self manages on the blockchain, transaction data could be maintained on an R3 style data blockchain, settlement rails can be done trustlessly using Bitcoin or even Lightning for that matter. And the vast majority of the accounting falls out with little human intervention.  Point of Sale is a Visa app for each the merchant and customer.

@_date: 2016-04-13 00:29:11
Sort of. 
Bretton Woods was the name of a far reaching international monetary standard developed in the 1940s. It was an attempt to ameliorate the monetary aspects of war.  It was supposed to essentially put all participants on a gold standard. The US dollar was to be redeemable for gold because the US owned majority of the world's gold essentially because it won the wars while all other combatants went bankrupt. I am using the term US, when more accurately it is the symbiotic beast of US banks and US government here. All other participants were to fix their each currency's price to USD. An Austrian economist's big dream. It failed. However the US economy is basically in the twilight years of the boom that was created. 
So there is no such agreement in place today.  There is a dominance in world money by the USD and a few other preferred bankcoins. The BIS coordinates central bank policy globally. The dominance is self-reinforced via military imposed trade networks that use USD for settlment, creating a military sponsored valuation increase to the USD.  
Does Bitcoin affect this?  Does it ever! Not in any real meaningful way in large scale of course. However for now, we have proven that the heavy (bloody actually) self privilege, self enrichment, and self empowering that the conglomerates in charge of currency issuance hold, is unnecessary.  
This is a revolution of the highest order!  Far from achieved but as inevitable as the Internet. Patrick Byrne calls it the extinction event for the current form of finance. Ed McAfee says its out of the bag and can't be put back in. The guy who sits in the presidents office is pleading with us to let him look at our encryption. 
Bitcoin literally has the possibility to end monetary hierarchy once and for all. Monetary hierarchy is the last and possibly greatest pillar of hierarchy existent. 
Does the US  bankstate conglomerate comply to this?  Heck no. But no nation bank state can coexist with Bitcoin. When I refer to Bitcoin, I refer to Bitcoin or whatever supplants it that will have the attributes of known supply, large capacity, adhoc crypto graphically tradable.  I think it will be Bitcoin but clearly it's not the only possibility.

When you "import" to electrum you run the risk of exposing those prvate keys to the internet. This makes it easier for a thief to hack your computer and steal your coins.  It is better to "sweep" into electrum, which is like an import but immediately sends it to a new address.    
From where you are at now and also from doing a sweep you should send the coins to a new address for its long term security via a new send transaction. 
And btw, bitcoins stored on a Core wallet attached to the Internet is not greatly secure for someone who is not really good at securing the computer in the first place.

I didn't say "capitalism" is control by the state, merely control.  It is a term for oligarchical control of money regardless of whether the actors are private or state sponsored.  Capitalism is not free market, although it can come about by rapid accumulation of industrial wealth.  Note that modern day industrial giants like Gates or Musk or Facebook or Google dudes ( their names escape me) are not nearly the capitalists that central bankers are. 
Today we live in a world of fascistic (ie socialistic) capitalism by state support of central and commercial banks.  
Neither form of capitalism,oligarchic or state sponsored is free market.  
Free market commerce in money is basically non existent.

Clearly the guys in the BIS chain of command are presently dominant and tyrannical.  Clearly they understand that The Bitcoin Blockchain is a threat to their monetary hegemony.  This report was commissioned by DoD and paid by taxes to discuss strategies of how cyber-sophisticated state actors can disrupt competing free market money.  What else does one need to know?  The state uses tax money to pay to get strategy of how to disrupt freedom. 
I have little doubt that detailed specific attack vectors have been developed and deployed already. Particularly in mining capacity and in social hacking of core devs.  
I have little doubt that Bitcoin has broken through and has demonstrated that non state money is an inevitability. Whether Bitcoin survives is another matter.

Majoritism is a terrible circular argument. Very few are willing to face and fight authority.  It is a losing individual  strategy. I asked you if your personal moral standards allow for people to be forced to act against their own conscience. Are you morally OK with government, through threat of violence, compelling a person to act against his own best interest, accept pesos when that is actually harmful to that individual?
There is no moral objective case against Bitcoin.  Nor is there any practical enforcement even if "laws" are written.  I don't need your consent.
I think "the end of the nation state" is a stretch. But monetary power is indeed a very significant power.  People who use Bitcoin will have a very much more enabled life. It (or something like it) is inevitable. Convenient, untraceable, transferrable without censor, programmable... It is better quality money. People will use it and those who do will do better than those who do not.  It will be preferred.  Bitcoin or its successors will indeed diminish the nation state.

Huh?  I am not as expert as you, but it seems to me that faking a block is pretty hard to do.  In a fake block, I assume that some of the transactions are real from mempool and that some are the faked variety.  The fake ones have to guess private keys with UTXOs attached to them to sign "valid" transactions.  The vast vast vast majority of private keys have zero balance.
So it seems pretty harmless for most people to just trust the network.  I am prepared to be corrected by some one with far more knowledge than me, like I think, yourself.

Ok. So now we are getting somewhere.  
Free markets is a term we agree on. We also agree on fascism.  
Where we disagree is in equating free markets with the term capitalism.  Free markets can indeed lead to concentrations of power and money.  In money, a free market might indeed lead to a situation of intense concentration of capital such that capital markets are oligarchal. This situation can not truly be called a free market.  Marx and others coined the term capitalist as a criticism of cartelization of money. His solution was cartelization of labour.  
The original poster here makes a similar logical mistake.  Our financial world is not free market in any sense.  Not only is it oligarchal, the oligarchy is a state joint venture (ie central banks and regulated commercial banks). Money, today, is definitively fascism.  It is also capitalistic, ie concentrated power of capital.  Thus using the term capitalism interchangeably with free markets is a confusion of usage of language. Yes free markets can lead to cartelism. In money, this cartelism is capitalism. But capitalism can also arise from cartelization by state intervention in money.  
In neither case of capitalism should things be considered free market.   So free markets and capitalism are very distinctly different things. 
The solution is not more state intervention.  The solution is to maintain freedom.  Cartels do not exist long without state support. The advantages cartels create for themselves brings new competition. 
That's why we must distinguish between capitalism and free markets.  We already have capitalism, oligarchal control of money, state sponsored central and chartered credit banks.  We do not have free markets.  
This confusion of language leads OP to a 180 degree incorrect solution. We do not require further socialization of capital. Exactly the opposite is required. 
If we really used the term capitalism correctly, that is a concentrated control of capital, the debate would be more productive.  As it stands we get a false choice, social control of all capital (really communism) vs big banks capitalism by state sponsor (really fascism). 
Big banks must be allowed to fail. Interest rates must be set by market. Currency must be allowed to be non state. Ad hoc finance must be allowed. That is free market. Which is far from what we have today, fascistic capitalism.

Hmmm. I thought there is only one blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:58:14
It's kind of blockchain masturbation.
They are creating a blockchain that communicates their interbank transactions in a private members record.  The value add is supposed to be efficiency in closing these transactions, that is, that records are better kept, more easily verified, more immutable so it easier to pay up or settle.  This is a fine and interesting application of blockchain technology, if it proves out.  
But very importantly, there are only a few possibilities regarding a token.  In the first case of no tokens, the system is really just a documentation system. In comparison to Bitcoin, or any adhoc publicly accessible ledger/token/private key, it's a silly gadget.  In the case that the token is transferable via a private key of adhoc creation by anyone, then the token is an altcoin and will be forced to compete on the open market to have any value.  This then is pitiful in application as a settlement coin as it would have radical price volatility that no bank could ameliorate without huge subsidy and is likely to fail anyway as most altcoins do. That doesn't merit attention until the banks start pumping it.  Note that banks may be the least creative institutions we have, so it's likely to fail.  The middle ground case, whereby the bank blockchain creates a token only available to the members, suffers from all of these problems.  It has artificial subsidized value. It is not money. It is hackable; key management between rival banks would be a nightmare. It requires more trust than court enforceable contracts.  
The standards of accessibility and trustlessness that Bitcoinsets is very high.  
Remember that banks most important function is a license of money expansion via credit of fiat.  They will live and die with fiat and will not offer an accessible coin.  
Far more interesting is the eventual development of Bitcoin credit, ie contracts to pay back more Bitcoin later for some Bitcoin today and secondary markets for those contracts that are then tradeable assets that can be fractionally expanded.  Banks are done if they don't do that. And they won't because banks are commercial extensions of state protected central banks.

If a data object is mined and is adhoc transferable via private key that is ownership, and the transferance has a free market price much greater than zero then the blockchain in question is an altcoin.
Else if the blockchain in question does not produce such an artefact, then it is an documentation system.

As to your main thesis.  Overall it was a healthy debate.  It seems to be settling in on a good solution.  It will buy some time for other layers to develop, it provides additional scale without more hard forks and it will keep Bitcoin fairly decentralized, if not fully.
The real problem was the pretty hefty character smears to try to get their way by several key people.  By and to Peter Todd.  By Mike Hearn to the Blockstream gang.
I am tired of the lot of them.  They all have gotten power drunk and all lack in humility. They all are blinded by their own biases and they as a group have reached a stagnation.  Resorting to character attacks in public reveals this.

Every person has rational self interest.  
Few people have real principles beyond that. They don't think, know or care beyond their own corral.  They thus are easily duped into faith that the man on TV knows how to administer their individual lives better than each themselves do.
This is the state of things throughout history.  The art of taking from the individual by evoking talismans is as old as human organization.  
Just at the moment of global zenith of mass manipulation, we have new tools of individual power; the Internet changes every power dynamic.  The loss of control of media was a devastating blow to power pyramids and they are reeling.  Look at the political turbulence in every country one can name. The truth is light as a feather and mass myth manipulation no longer really works, at least not on the people who dare to think.
Bitcoin finishes the deal. Money is purely notional.  The best money has no weight.  There is no real difference between a printed bill with $50 or €100.  Or an account with 10001010 or 11110001 in it.  The myth of money is perhaps the key talisman through human history; notions that move economy.  
"Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who writes its laws."   Money myth trumps all the other myths.  It is more powerful than the fear of neighbours or the fear of losing one's shelter or health, because it as an invisible myth.  It takes real intelligence, effort and moral fibre to see, name and stand against the crime of central banking.  Central banking is taxation unecumbered by politics. Imagine having the exclusive!!! right to print money.  Well, one could own governments, one could own the most powerful military and wrap it in Stars and Stripes.  One could force the money myth onto entire nations through the racket of war and economic hitmen.

This is a confusion of language.  
Capitalism is an abused term. It was coined and intended to mean the control of capital.  It is the opposite of free market.  
State control of capital is only a shade different than the world we have now.  Today we have fascist control of capital.  Fascism is a degree of socialism whereby production is controlled by the state with close partnership of corporation.  With money, this is as socialized as it can get because money mangement is beyond the competence of the state.   
Free market is not the current nature of affairs regards money.

Chartered banks do not print money, however they do create additional credit.  We treat this as money. We even call it the same name as central bank credit money.  A dollar printed by the Fed Reserve is called a dollar, credit money created by a bank is called a dollar but they really are not quite the same thing. 
You might indeed have full reserve banking and as a customer you might prefer that and pay more accordingly. But another customer may not need the filet mignon of full reserve and is OK with fat and soy ground in to the burger if its cheap.  A Blockchain bank will reveal the risk profiles to all sides on the loan in a fractional reserve loan.   The real value of the blockchain is truth.  
The current system sucks and is destined to break because central banks absorb all risk into the currency by increasing quantity of credit without limit.  Gold standards are attempts to rein this in but they failed. Fractional reserve is not the evil here.  Fractional reserve combined with business losses and malfeasance failure losses shifted on to the currency by central banks and then forced onto the general population by legal tender laws is the evil.
The conglomeration of bank and state should be obvious by now.  Its cleaving will yield great benefit.

Sigh. This is what passes for wisdom?
1) fractional reserve lending can happen over any underlying asset.  This is the idea behind gold standard monies of the past.  It could be done just fine for Bitcoin. In fact Bitcoin is an ideal asset for fractional reserve lending.  The asset is limited and fungible like gold, but unique and monitorable on the blockchain, unlike gold. There is a clear distinction between the underlying asset (blockchain bitcoins) and the asset in the IOU, loan contracts denominated in bitcoin with interest, which is an improvement over fiat.  The loan contracts can be made transparent and quite enforceable with help of blockchain technology. The contracts themselves can become currency in the economy, if needed to purchase labour and materials priced in any currency even bitcoins. A borrower can borrow bitcoins in exchange for a promise to pay back more of them later.  Fractional reserve futures is necessary for Bitcoin to become money. 
2) projects that borrow now with interest must overcome interest and other return requirements with profit.  A limited quantity of underlying asset indeed enforces a higher bar, higher interest and more prioritization of projects to be performed as the article suggests.  This enforcement of risk management helps ensure that projects are net beneficial. 
3) when banks can rely on free central bank expansion of money supply, they surely can be loose in choice of projects. 
4) the system that creates the best net benefit at a societal level is the one that prices risk correctly.  
The argument by the article is 180 degrees backwards.

I read the synopsis on scribd.  
The most important revelation is that money can be viewed within information theory.  Money is a medium of transmission. The information of the transaction is the signal. Information that comes from the medium is noise. 
This is revolutionary thinking.  It reveals today's monetary system as noisy and corrupt. It shows how massive monetization of economy removes the most important aspects of money as a signal for economic behaviour. And would intimate that Bitcoin with its perfect digital signal and perfectly knowable record is a vastly superior and much less burdened money system.  
I think it must be conceded that price value is also an aspect of information and that it takes a lot of effort to overcome the distortion that arises from price volitility.  Bitcoin still has a massive liquidity shortfall that requires a thousand fold price increase to overcome to compare to the noise of large fiats' inflation.

Before the printing press, copy was performed manually by the few who had such skills.  At the time, in most of Europe, the dominant form of power was the Catholic Church.  The Bible was hand copied almost exclusive to other works by monks and in Latin.  This led to a sociological hierarchy.  The moral and legal norms were by fiat of the Church and power was highly concentrated through violence and moral legitimacy by superstitional interpretation of the Word of God in rare and indecipherable Latin Bibles.  
The printing press made the Bible easily accessible in local langauges en masse, along with other works.  The ad hoc access to knowledge led to revolution, wars, reformation and enlightenment.  Printing presses remained dominant forms of media for a long time.  Much more decentralized but still very controlled.
The first good Canadian philosopher, Marshall Macluhan, said that the modern media of his time (television mostly) was an extension of the printing press.  He missed the Internet revolution but a close reading of his thoughts on media would see his theories play out in fair accuracy.  The Internet has decentralized ideas.
The most important form of hierarchy today is money.  With power over money, many of the traditional forms of control are brought under influence.  Culture, messaging, propaganda, filtering, censorship, violence, superstitious belief in the superior ability of some to rule, division, social debt, warfare.  
And then Bitcoin....
Uncensorable, global, remit of value, of power, of intention, between any two schleps with smartphones. 
By symmetry, if it is rightful for me to claim ownership of you then the opposite is also rightful, which can not logically both be true.  We also know inherently that forced fealty is wrong.  Somehow we forget this when they show up on TV and demand that we select which manager bosses us around on behalf of the money printers.  Legal tender laws, active extermination of competing money, revolutions and wars to feed economy into monetary regimes, national debts, whitewash of certain crimes and nations and darkwashing of others.  You are a controlled slave whose purpose is to put economy into dolla dolla bills.

I wonder about that.  I think you are correct but it seems like the thinking you describe is really flawed. That is, an altcoin needs an investor part to its community to fund all manner of things, mining, coding....
If an altcoin achieves a certain threshold, one could see that bringing its investors in whole to a porting to a sidechain is a great way to hold promise to potential investors to invest in innovation.  
So for example, I like Monero. It's current market cap is about $5M.  My understanding that it would require about 10,000 btc (safely assuming $500 btc by Jan 1) to lock onto the sidechain channel in order to for the existing Monero units to maintain value. So that might be a price worth paying to get to be a sidechain, ie, maybe a lighthouse assurety contract to raise 10000 btc.   I might buy some today if I thought that this investment wouldn't get exterminated by someone rolling up Monero-type sidechain.  When the existent Monero blockchain becomes ported, both coins benefit. 
The altcoin preserves investors, and gets access to Bitcoin network benefits.  Bitcoin adds new functionality.  
So if sidechains is about exterminating altcoins, it's cutting off Bitcoin's nose to spite it's own face.  
So is it even technically possible?

No, but someone can still fractionally reserve loans in a purely  Bitcoin world.  The loans are claims on bitcoins, rather than bitcoins themselves.   A claim on bitcoins on a reputable "bank" would have value in the market and could be traded for land and lumber to build a house, say.  You could use the claim against say 100 bitcoins to to be paid in one year to purchase, say, 92 bitcoins today.  An interest rate.  
In a blockchain world however, all bitcoin loaner and borrower  customers however have a lot more power in verifying the quantity and quality of reserves on the blockchain and in easy institutional risk spread perhaps with a DAC as an intermediary.  
All still hypothetical but I don't see any fundamental barriers other than Illuminati Lizards and their troopers.

It's a new type of asset class. Better than gold derivatives because each underlying Bitcoin has a traceable uniqueness while still fungible. Better than fiat futures because the minting process is well predictable. Better than bank promises because the contracts are transparent.

I think that is mostly true, but with a global, internet based alternative, there is much less imposed demand to use fiat and it would hold less faith and lose value, so taxation by inflation will be harder to do.

Of course.  I overstated things.  No government can legislate conscience. They can compel a person to do certain things, but they can not make that person desire to do that thing.  I am sure there are many in Argentina that desire pesos and many that do not.
There are many that are desire compulsion in general and many that do not.  
Money is purely notional and  is a matter purely of conscience.  What one actually holds dear can not be legislated.  But of course sometimes we yield to threat of violence.
As for Ulbricht, I don't think they got him for accepting Bitcoin or tax evasion.
If your only argument is that people do indeed fear government force and will comply, how do you feel about that, morally?
That is the point of the post.  Violence is repugnant except in a very narrow definition of self defence.

I am genuinely curious about your position on this.  
I think Bitcoin is awesome in many aspects. But the major driver of interest for me is its ethical quality.  "The Matrix" resonated because it asks one to look at one's current state of being rather than sympathizing with some fantasy world.  We do live in a sort of Matrix.  A tiny group of people control and own the money system, the media, the wealth etc.  That is not a result of some accident of meritocratic free market.  It is a result of concerted ambition of self versus others.  I do not resent a philosophy of self. I do resent being used and others being used to be gamed by media and politics to support evil.
So, yes, Bitcoin is more ethical money.  I do not think it gives a license to be preachy and superior.  It does however leave one with an obligation to inform.
How is it that you can sit ethically neutral on this matter?  Respectfully and genuinely curious.

Right. But in order for that to be terminal to the original chain, the fork coin must take an overwhelming hashrate AND the market price  ratio must be overwhelmingly in favor of the forked coin.  If say the forked coin gets 90% hashrate and price ratio is about 1 to 1, then the original coin must limp along for 20 weeks until difficulty rediscovery with long (100 minute) confirmations and small transaction capacity.  
That to me is not a catastrophic situation.  And when the market realizes it after say a few weeks, price will rise and hashrate will follow.  Also note that there are many people that can afford $5 or $10 transaction fees if needed. People will gripe, but those fees will save their investment.   It may be very painful for some months, but I won't be panic selling.   There is a large enough part of the economic community committed to security over convenience that the miners can either serve or not and then martyr themselves into money losses.  
In the likely event that the original chain survives, hashpower will follow to sufficient quantity.  Even the People's Republic can't stop that by compelling market manipulation of hashrate (which I do think is happening).
I don't see BU getting close to even 75%.  They are fervent enough to split at less than that.  Which would produce a pretty clean split and a Bitcoin Unlimited and a Bitcoin Core.  After some initial chaos, they would each be able to pursue convenience or security respectively.

Critical thinking leads to realization that one person can not possess rights of rulership over another by simple symmetry.

Thought experiment.  Let's say there were not a dominance (essentially a monopoly) held by a currency.   Say no more than 15% economic position held by one currency in the US.  
Explain how Keynesian theory or even Friedmann Monetarism even apply.  Will expanding the supply of one of these currencies influence the economy?  Not a chance.  
Monopoly over money is an abuse.  Fear of inflation compels spending. This is to the benefit of people who already hold capital outside of fiat and to the detriment of who holds fiat.  Longer term financial health is better provided to the individual by deferring spending.  Longer term societal well being is better provided by the en masse effects of individual improvements to well being.  Saving not spending is good for economy. 
Keynesian and Monetarist theory are establishment propaganda.  They do not have any meaning outside of a currency monopoly and they are held up as proper by beneficiaries of this system.  
You go right ahead with that.  Don't dream of interfering with my right to abstain.

That's what derivatives are for.  
Today's high capacity transactional networks move purely notional debt obligations around.  There has never been a network for a digital asset prior to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will be whatever it turns out to be.  I think given it's huge computational cost but perfect ledger and it's nature as digital asset that it (or one of its progeny) end up replacing central banks.  Organizations and networks of transactional capacity, not unlike Visa or banks will rise around it.  That is a much much better civilization than our current form. 
We want as much on chain capacity as we can get but not at a jeopardy to Bitcoin's highest attribute.

We will scale though.  That's on the table.  There are two proposals that are building support.  The overall ecosystem is not feeling your angst.  
I made a 1.3 btc transaction today and one last week larger, both confirmed first block and cost me less than $0.50.  The processor cost much more and the price was a tiny bit off.  The miners' fee was negligible.  And none of that compares to the net position I have gained by holding.   Fees mean nothing to me.  Holding this incredible asset means alot.  Of course my application is not same as anyone else's.  But it is one of the prime applications.  Its real utility.  
The price continues to say that there is no disaster looming.  
We will either never upgrade from here because that's what investors prefer or we will choose one path of transaction upgrade because that's what investors prefer.  Investment is the main app right now. You said it yourself. Investors, not transactors, pay the miners.  
So just chill and let it play out.  If you have tens of millions, you could bend things your way a little, maybe.  If not, just place your bets and enjoy the ride.

That's why there are several working codebases operating on the network that all add transaction capacity.  
You sound like you are trying to appeal to a decision maker.  Everyone is doing the best they can.  Coded proposals, competing proposals, network operators testing the waters, community conversation.  How else would it look?  
Bitcoin works great for many applications.  It's capacity is being bid upwards.  This is not yet really a problem.  When it is, the network operators will be compelled to abandon the cozy safe harbour where we are today.  That may take awhile. And the use cases wil indeed be the higher bidders during that period.  
There is not high impetus yet.  Maybe never.  If fees were dropping due to lack of economic value of a Bitcoin tx, I would be far more concerned.

With a diverse array of crypto assets and prediction DAPPs as insurance, there will be greatly reduced need for court enforcement. Banking won't include mainframes, imposing buildings or crooks in blue suits, or with a tip of the hat to Blythe Masters, in mid short skirts with long jackets.  Identity, debt, work and finance will all be abstracted to blockchains.  The obsolescence of banks as chartered partners of central power will be a very happy move forward for civilization.
The only need for central banks will be to service the prior generations' clinging to their propaganda induced idea that government money is even money at all.
The scurrilous crooks of banking won't want the drag and toil of life without a central bank.  Banks exist as symbiotic extension of the government-central bank-fiat complex.  With open source algorithmmic money accessible to anyone, their time on this planet is counting down.

When one is dispassionate about all of this by hedging (in Monero in my own case) and just taking a step back, then I agree with the thrust of your argument.  
There is no path blocked to a future with cryptocurrency as the most effective and important form of money because of the low barriers to entry for development, alt coin creation, alt client creation, investment, trading, etc etc.  
I have a specific problem with the current developers of Core. They are unresponsive to the reality that money is a social exercise.   The "commitment" to a July 2017 expansion of the block size is lead balloon.  It was terrible. An autumn timeframe would have stirred the community positively, swept away Classsic and improved Bitcoin's price (and possibly kept Ethereum in the shadows).  
It is imperative that developers of Core respond to investors and other stakeholders with an upgrade to block size.  Even if it is for the purely symbolic gesture to build community.  The longer this is left the more non credible this gesture will appear.  The risks of 2MB blocks seem to be decreasing in compare to the risks of a rising Classic or losing the network effect altogether of Bitcoin.  
I trust that developers of Core want Bitcoin to remain an accessible trustworthy digital base money and would never open up the block size to the point where Bitcoin becomes an inaccessible trust requiring currency. 
I would really like to see Bitcoin Core developers spend less time developing things like zero knowledge transfer projects and less time politicking on Reddit. More time on scaling and fungibility please.
Bitcoin is far from dead. Ethereum hasn't begun to figure out what problems it will have with scaling which will be orders (yes plural) of magnitude more difficult than Bitcoin.  Cryptonote is still not fully proven.

It's a debate over trade-offs between security and convenience.  
Bitcoin is still both very secure and very cheap and convenient for many applications.  But that has been changing.  It does not have the capacity to be both as it grows in popularity. 
There are many approaches to solving this problem that have been proposed.  The two that have the most support are Segwit and Unlimited.  Both have garnered a sizable part of support.  
Bitcoin is an open consensus protocol. Including in its manner of upgrade.  An upgrade is termed a fork because it bifurcates from the prior ruleset.   A soft fork is compatible with the prior ruleset.  A hardfork is not.  
The manner of selecting the new ruleset is messy.  The new ruleset must be supported by some sizable network.  Note that it does not need anywhere near the prior entire network.  
Segwit is a softfork, increasing capacity without breaking the prior existing ruleset.  It will only activate after 95% of blocks are mined as Segwit supportive.  It currently has about 23% support.  
Bitcoin Unlimited is a hardfork proposal upgrading capacity by breaking the prior ruleset.  It has about the same level of support as Segwit.
Segwit focuses on putting security ahead of convenience. Unlimited is vice versa.
Unless a clear dominance is established by one or the other, the prior ruleset will continue to govern.  We are in that state now.   The current state is likely to remain for considerable time.  There is no clear path to a dominant upgrade.  Significant interests are on both sides.  
The way forward includes several possibilities. The current status quo may be permanent. We may have to live with Bitcoin as is in its magnificent leap forward in trustworthy money with capacity having to build around it.  We may end up going down a path with either of the current proposals gaining its desired dominance. Another proposal may sneak out of the woods and steal the show.  None of these seem likely to me.  Upgrading is necessary and neither proposal will dominate sufficiently to extinguish the other.  I think we will see a bit-furcation into two coins.  
Both will have an ecosystem and both will live on.  Note that may be temporarily messy, it's not the end of anything.  It may release a lot of value. The two coins in aggregate may have better purpose than as one as they pursue their separate goals.  There is way too much economic momentum for Bitcoin to just disappear.
There are well meaning people on either side of the issue.  This is somewhat new territory.  And we all want Bitcoin to succeed in its mission to create true competition to central bank money. So it feels high stake.  Much suspicion with its basis in poor behaviour and poor leadership has crept in to the debate.   There is also a fascinating array of people and incentives to ponder.  
What do you need to know........
I am biased but try to be humble.  There is only one disaster scenario for me and I just don't see it happening but have prepared anyway.  I don't like Unlimited. Its goals are off, it's code has unworkable incentives and the motivations are angry and power seeking. In my opinion.  That said, alot of that comes honestly.  There is some foundation there. For me the only disaster scenario is one where there is no other Bitcoin than Unlimited, that the chain it forks awayfrom loses all relevance.  It's possible but really unlikely.  
  For that to happen, the forked chain, Unlimited, would need to have overwhelming support by both miners and investors, both.  If even 25% of investors don't dump their original-chain coins, the miners will get paid well to follow them.  I just don't feel that the overwhelming investor money (&gt;&gt;90%) will leap off that bridge.  
I could be wrong and have and will hedge accordingly.  Bitcoin has been known to surprise.
It's an emotional debate.  Try to not get caught in that.   There's a mountain of irrational uninformed emotion involved. I know because I helped to add to it myself.  
No one really knows how this will play out.  In a way, the software will determine things.  There is no one group holding powerful cards.  If anyone does, its hodlers.  The miners will follow them and then so will everyone else.  
Bitcoin has the luxury of being silly here.  No other coin threatens its dominance. Not even close.  The positive cycle of new investment continues. 
Enjoy the ride.

This is very well put.  
The assets in question here are not really under consideration for fundamental change. They will remain under custody of the industry clearing house.  "Owners" of the assets will have some chain of custody on the actual share certificates.  Ownership will be via paper agreements on account supported by electronic processes.
This is not at all the same thing as a cryptographically traded asset, that once control of the asset is signed to a new address, it is under control of that private key holder. Perhaps this is a decent half step toward a reality that chains of custody will disappear and that ownership of equity will become much more concrete.

Bitcoin's properties make it valuable.  These properties are not available for cheap instant transactions (even at a 100X increase of tx onchain capacity).  So cabbages at the bazaar won't be on the blockchain.  We should consider ourselves very fortunate to be amongst those who actually did buy coffee on chain, stories to tell the grandkids.  
But if we put convenient before secure, Bitcoin becomes useless and not unique.  
We already know how to scale debt derivatives.  VISA does it.  We could run the entire system on gold derivatives.  Bitcoin is orders better than gold or fiat so building cheap convenient derivative/Layer 2 systems be they sidechains, lightning, paper notes, or even (horrors!) institutions of trust is something we know how to do.  We may never know how to scale with the high order of trustlessness we have now.  
That said, my own roughly informed opinion is that we could multiply the blocksize up right now and not harm too much.  And we will need to.  
The principle of hard trustless immutability at the mainchain and layers for cheap and convenient is totally sound.  If we can keep growing the value of the mainchain the other layers will have incentives to form.   But not at all the other way.

There are two separate meanings to the term "unit of account." 
Look it up.  
When the specie in consideration is stable the two terms mean about the same thing.  
Economic unit of account is a stable in economic terms.  Gold is the only rough approximate we have of this. This is what people typically use as the meaning of "unit of account."  Fiat money over shortish time frames and in particular situations approximates this very well.  Friedman monetarist theory makes this a goal.  
Accounting unit of account means the units are identical to themselves over time.  Bitcoin is the best and first real money with this property.  Fiat approximates this locally and temporarily.  But of course putting human nature in charge.... ledger bending happens. Even when not  catastrophic it is pilfering of value.  
Bitcoin's perfect accounting properties will lead to its being a standard bearer, first in accounting terms but that will lead to economic unit of account.  Because a person can trust its accounting properties.  Albeit at much much much much much^much higher price. 1 btc identical = 1 btc.

If the blockchain can't be trusted, who will give up personal resources to own the coin?
I know we are saying the same thing but the miner's "power" is inert.  
That is why, even though the majority of hash power today has already signalled something other than old Core, they mine 100% old Core blocks.  The odd mistaken BU block not with standing.

Regulating it is a bit farcical.  The instinct to regulate financial companies springs from how easy it is to cheat a double entry ledger system.  The only thing that keeps the books honest is the threat of jailtime.  At a certain level of too big to fail, not even that works. At an even higher level, a central bank has more power than anyone else in government by cheating its ledger.
Bitcoin is so regulated by code, it can't do a simple capacity upgrade.  Its ledger is perfect to the satoshi.  
And what is there to regulate?  P2P messages?  Running hashing? Apps?

What's your point though?  
That we need more fees in the longer run.  Totally agreed.  In fact I would prefer Bitcoin to have had a permanent 1 % p.a. inflation to anchor miners PoW,  but we are still three halvings from getting to about 0.5%, when fees will have to dominate and hopefully be sufficient. 
Or that the ecosystem needs more value so that coinbase rewards pay for more PoW? Also agreed.  We may depart on that point though because I think secure store of value will increase price more than convenience, ie the more validating nodes on the network is more important than a ton of tx.

Mongolia is an abstract notion.  
Really a small group of people (same bankers as everywhere) funded the state apparatus of violence to enslave the huge vast majority of people (99%) that live in that corral that is the abstract notion of Mongolia. 
Abstract notions do not have any such capacities. 
People: slaves, slaves with good paying jobs that carry guns, better paid slaves that order the violence that gains slave compliance. And owners. Owners that buy the loyalty of the dispensers of violence with tokens that they conjure from imagination for free that only have economic value from the work of the slaves. 
We are owned.  By accountants. We just let them do it.

But you think cash only means petty cash, ie small bills for day to day spending.  
Bitcoin will still be cash when only large value transactions hit the blockchain.  Small value transactions on networks with reduced need of perpetual immutability that are Bitcoin derivatives will also be cash. 
 Just like your chequeing account is cash dollars, chartered banks' deposits at the Fed are cash dollars and the Abraham Lincoln in your pocket are all cash dollars, but are all quite different. 
I hope that people can get past thinking the title of the Nakamoto whitepaper means that all transactions must be remembered forever.  When in fact, remembering all transactions forever will kill the cash nature of Bitcoin.

Of course. It is illuminating that people have come to the point that it is massively believed that they way to pay off loans is to expand the general money supply.  And not see the obvious problems of inflationary spiral that arise from that.  
With a money with a known or fixed supply, the borrower must profit from the borrowing in sufficient manner to repay the loan including interest.  This implies a much more sane economy.  Loans are put to use in "projects" whose return must exceed the interest rate of the loan plus other risk and profit requirements.  
I think this makes it rather tough to make a market for Bitcoin lending.  Until Bitcoin reaches a much higher more stable economic value, or until fiat devours itself, finding people with matching needs might be tough, or what is your experience?

A SegWit hodler spends a Segwit ready tx to the network to a Segwit ready miner who sells on a Segwit ready exchange all watched over by Segwit ready nodes.  
Do you see it now?  If BU splits they need a small amount of hashpower to hold up Segwit which probably detroys a Core Bitcoin if BU price is much higher than BC price.  Its a war of idiots.  
So readiness helps in the case the BU flops out of the gate. Which it very well might. Fifty fifty hashing, A/D pinning to zero and not twitching. Big zero fee blocks. A flood of non paying transaction. Few nodes and dropping fast.  If it gets that far. If it splits at fifty fifty, BU is screwed
And an entirely ready Segwit ecosystem.

At the moment it can do both. In the near term future it may be constrained as a cheap payment protocol as block congestion manifests more obnoxiously. In the longer term it will have alternate mechanisms for payments.  
While I consider Bitcoin as money to be precious and support small blocks, there is jeopardy in not being able to expand the ecosystem in the medium term.  These are interesting times; Bitcoin is great intellectual entertainment.  
It's all good fun. The revolutionary routing around of "authority" will not be undone. Watching the banks build smart blockchains is rich poetic irony.  It's like watching cable companies investing in IP and MPEG.  
But Bitcoin owes nothing to anybody. It's tiny. It may fail as a social experiment. All this passionate gnashing over the control of Bitcoin's network effect is much ado about nothing.
Probably Bitcoin prevails.  Perhaps it will be Ethereum (I doubt it) or Monero (more likely) but there will be peer to peer money. 
Proper perspective I think is that we have a network of digital gold that has 10,000 transactions per hour actually happening. We have head spinning innovation happening around the main protocol. We have alternatives within the main network. We have seriously interesting alts. We have an awesome subculture of moon gentlemen. 
Enjoy the ride.

@_date: 2016-03-07 15:14:22
It comes down to what Bitcoin's purpose really is.  
PayPal, banks and credit cards already are very convenient.  Central banks are corrupt monsters.  
Is Bitcoin for convenience or to reinvent base money?  For me it is the latter. Infinite block size blows Bitcoin as money into the waste basket.  If a mildly interested party can't load up the blockchain and verify for themselves, Bitcoin is not money.  If everyone is trusting a handful of huge servers, Bitcoin is currency and not interested thank you very much.
@_date: 2016-03-19 21:53:43
I think it works out as follows. 
Currently, things are unsettled. Bitcoin is still way out in front as digital gold and there is good innovation happening.  Bitcoin's capacity scalability is by no means easily solved on chain. 
At first, the current plan of developers of Core will unfold for some time.  Classic doesn't have anywhere near enough momentum to disrupt that short of many months plus some crisis.  So, we will see Segwit and more real life Sidechains.  These may or not provide some bit of scalability. In either case the additional capacity will be consumed by organic Bitcoin transaction growth. There will be another fees event. It will lead to fees that are pretty obnoxious.  Up until then prices will drift probably a little downward. But at that point, things will seem to get very dark.  The civil war will flair up.  Lightning will not be ready. So Core will have to be hardforked to expand block size.  Classic will have gained significant credibility and support. Since there will be a hardfork anyway, it is difficult to predict which prevails from here. 
Prices may become very low at that point. However, that will be overblown.  Bitcoin is still amazing.  Even if it never scales beyond 10,000 transactions of trustless money every hour, it's still really really something. If it scales to 1M transactions per day, it more than replaces central banking and many key settlement interbank systems.  Banks will be freed from fiat.  Bitcoin has a very bright future.  
Credit systems based upon Bitcoin can happen, it's a better asset than fiat or gold to base credit on. 
We already have scale on double entry ledger fiat systems in the scale of humanity.  At the worst case, Bitcoin can scale like that. Or there may be trustless systems, Lightning, or Open Transactions, in which case, finance will become as wild and beautiful and as offering and convenient and mundane as a trip to the mall.
In any case, the price will be spectacular.
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:56:12

Air, water, oil, gold are fungible.  One unit is indistinguishable from the other.  Physical Cash is very but not fully fungible.
Original art is zero fungible. Bank accounts are completely attached to identity so are highly not fungible.
Bitcoin is in between. If it is to succeed it must be at least more fungible than physical cash.  It's not far off.  Miners will never not accept a transaction into a block.

Mongolia is bust because it boomed on the global commodities price boom fueled by the time-preference mangling of Keynesian "stimulus."   Well, Time has no master and the future arrived.  Time preference distortion did not create fundamental viability.  
But rather than just letting the damned bankers take a penny of loss, get fired and be prosecuted, we all get to chip in with a little more of our children's future with some more cheap print goatshit.  
This is all very criminal.  
It would not be possible in the absence of a globally coordinated fiat monopoly.  
Fiat monopoly is the removal of the right of the individual to choose for self what is money.  This is a terrible violation of the first and most precious right: freedom of conscience.  
And of course, we can add Mongolia to the list of where this is most obvious (Greece, Venezuela...) but it is the same everywhere.

I will agree with OPs basic premise that if people anticipated an increase in spending power, then the rational approach is deferral of spending until necessity arises.  
Money printers benefit greatly from inflation and promote it through their client organizations, banks and government.
In some sense of course, anticipation of inflation leads to an amount of disowning the currency. This is interpreted as a stimulus because there is measurable transferral out of the currency.  That is bunk however.  
The most important aspect of an economy is investment not consumption. Deferral of consumption in favour of future consumption, indeed ecological health would improve.

Let's see now. Tx fee is $60.  If the people paying that much really love using Bitcoin as compared to other means, they might be willing to pay 5%.  So the transaction value itself would $60 / .05 or $1200.  So this would be the minimum value, but let's go with all Tx being that size.  So then at double today's capacity, let's say 6000 Tx per 10 minutes.  Per day Tx value then is $1200 X 500,000 or $600M per day. In bearer asset cleared! Per day!  $219B per annum. In fricitonless person to person bearer assets cleared! Cleared in about 30 minutes!   If they are more realistically only paying 1% and the average is 3 X our minimum, it's $9B per day!!!  This can only happen with a $50,000 btc or like.
This is your idea of failure and the Zimbabwe dollar?

The whole "contest" is fun and interesting. I come down pretty far on the spectrum of preference for Bitcoin to be a central bank replacement more than as a Visa replacement.  Even so, I think your point is completely correct in that Bitcoin needs to gain much more use before it can achieve global reserve status.  I also would much prefer a sooner than later increase to block size.  
Overall I prefer a client and stewardship that is suited to trustlessness rather than trustful convenience.

The people who control central banks have most ofnthe world's gold stowed far from where the "representatives" of the people stand a chance to get it.
A government with the knowledge of a pending fiat failure would probably do drastic things.

Any blockchain that does not produce a unit of currency but rather just immutable records is by definition not currency. So ownership of the objects it produces are at most claims for redemption on some asset of value. So the objects are derivatives not bearer assets. 
If the object is only transferable between trusted members and private keys are created by some central key management system, then the asset has no free market price. 
So then what do we have?  
A centralized key management system (untrustworthy), an object that has no market but is a claim, and a system whose purpose is not money but records to assist in clearing transaction value via fiat later. No way for the average Joe to access it.  
If the asset has no market value, the system in itself has nothing to do with settlement.
There is nothing interesting about it. It preserves the current monetary system and has zero threat to Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:47:14

Who does Armstrong imagine he is speaking to?
He can't possibly be so naive as to not know what the options are. 1) Get code committed to the current Core codebase that facilitates improvements to the ecosystem that are widely regarded as valuable.  2) Create an altcoin from scratch with your people and attributes you desire.  3) Create an alternative client and gain widespread community support. 4) Accept your own limits to impose your vision unto everyone else's voluntary association with the current state of being.
Maybe the promoters of Classic are correct. Maybe there is impending doom of high tx fees.  Maybe Blockstream is destructive or just self serving. Maybe it is a long and difficult process to route around these problems if they even exist.  But that is the path open to people who see the world that way.

Whether the developers of Core like it or not, they have had leadership thrust upon them. Leaders must communicate and a powerful means of doing so is through symbolic action.
What Mr. Voorhees seeks here is just a symbolic action.  
Damnit, just commit to a 1.5MB block and and keep the commitment.  
It's important symbolism. Stop being so concerned with technical perfection.
I get it. We have achieved a precious thing worthy of protection.  We have created a central bank replacement.  It is for this reason, I would support smaller ish blocks.  We need layers beyond the settlement layer to scale without linear expansion of the settlement layer.  Ie Lightning and other mechanisms are necessary to preserve what matters most about Bitcoin.  But without a congested settlement layer, there is little incentive to kick off higher layer scaling. It's human nature.  So capping blocks just makes good sense.  
That said, the bifurcation of Bitcoin's network effect is too big a jeopardy to trifle with. The devs of core are providing the fertile till of those that ponder their motive. Just make a real symbolic concession that demonstrates a responsiveness to the current/pending state of congestion and no higher layer scale solutions. 
If the network can handle 1MB blocks, I am sure it can handle 2. Even at quadratic complexity addition.  
I have a foot in each camp with my weight still on the current path for the core client.
Btw, it would be great if people stopped calling the groups of people doing dev work as "Classic" or "Core". Those are pronouns for the code and not for the "teams." Sigh.

Bitcoin has been able to be at once many things: an irreversible asset transfer (like a settlement system), a cheap payment protocol, an ad hoc access to monetary use (permissionless, decentralized trust) and has been able to accommodate growth.  
These seemingly can not be accommodated going forward.  The developers of Core have the vision of trustlessness over some potential growth.   This is the proper stance.  The Bitcoin network is facilitating 10,000 transaction per hour of the world's first digital bearer asset with zero error and no human malfeasance.  If the block size didn't grow a byte further, we can build solutions. Debit card and credit card companies can easily build solutions that settle an entire day's worth of transactions with one settlement  transaction on the blockchain. That's without solutions such as either 21Inc or Lightning.  
This is a terrific feat worthy of awe, respect and cherishing.  
Now, Sidechains, Segwit and Lightning may help but also may flop completely. This would still be no reason to throw ourselves headlong into huge block sizes. 
It is ironically why the developers of Core need to add a manageable increase to block size sooner than later.  
Having control of our digital gold in the possession of those that like scaling via simple linear block size increase, would be a severally unfortunate circumstance. An unlimited block size would lead to Bitcoin operating as a currency rather than money and it would fail.
A little larger (1.5 or 2 X) increase today from devs of Core would neuter all this chatter and keep our digital gold out of the control of those that would cherish growth in the short term versus a perpetuity of digital gold.
So fairly stiff transaction fees are worth the preservation of Bitcoin's fundamental value:  The network is operating flawlessly,

Antanopolous and Szabo should fly to him and sketch out that Bitcoin is an economy of incentives.  If Jihan can create incentives for investors to hold the btc asset, there is a future economy of 1000 times the current Bitcoin economy.  But it will not allow dominance by any corner.

No.  I said Blockstream not any of the devs.  Those very devs may need to decide which is more important, their relationship with Blockstream or Bitcoin as a community.
I am not saying that there is any evidentiary weight to the theory that Blockstream is evil.  I am saying there is political symbolism here that matters.  The motives of Blockstream are unknowable except in the minds of its stakeholders.  There is no way to cure those that are suspicious of Blockstream because there is no way to prove in the negative any motive of Blockstream.  You cant prove to the BU side that Blockstream isn't evil.
All we know for sure is that Blockstream is present, there is a lot of money involved (100,000 btc approx) and that the backers are not exactly odour free.  I agree, this proves zero.  But it gives enourmous power to inflame for someone to leverage it.  Symbolically it stinks. It always did.  
Combine it with Mr Maxwell's penchant for petulant redditting and zero tolerance to incorporate any modicum of flexibility (95% who is that fooling?), it gives poor solutions like BU all the community it needs.   
We all, both sides, must realize that it is absolutely sterile to tell the other side to accommodate our own side.  
The world doesn't need crypto finance.  It doesn't even need rationality or humans for that matter.  Crypto finance does not need Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn't need me or you.  Bitcoin doesn't need Wu, Ver or Maxwell.  
Ego is defeating Bitcoin.  
If Blockstream has to go to save SegWit which improves Bitcoin, Blockstream should put itself as secondary.  Nakamoto did it.  Gavin did it.  
Same for Ver and his caustic antics and same for Wu and his power trip.

I will take this advice.  Also I do have some need to move some hodlings out of btc.  
Obviously the timing of this is very cute.  Not the type of miner I want to associate with.  Couldn't wait just one week.  Anyway.  I have hedged in anticipation of both ETF potential.  So I am good that way.  
If there is a chainsplit in the short term (month or less), how soon do you think before a clean delineation of the two coin types?  Any better wallets than others for separating coins?
You seem to be fairly in the know.  
If that is too revealing to answer, I would get that. 
Thanks.  
Also, I am looking forward to seeing Segwit implemented possibly sooner.

If they fork at anything less than 75%, they can't afford to attack the BTCc chain.  Then investors will choose a preferred coin.  I kind of like that.  
Investors should have the final say. We have the devs put their offerings out.  The miners are hashing it out and everybody seems to forget, this is a speculative asset.  Hodlers pay *all* the bills. 
We should get the choice.  A gentlemen's split.

So can you expand on that please. I have heard this argument but don't quite get it. 
I realize that anyone can copy the source and "fork" it. However this is meaningless unless the ecosystem goes with it or another ecosystem is created by it.  There is a certain high degree of stickiness to Core right now.  So how do alternative clients actually manifest into real operating impact?  Do they need to take over the blockchain totally by getting to a majority thereby forcing a switch to full compliant blocks after that switch?  Can the network and blockchain tolerate deviations to a degree such that a client might validate a minority of blocks?  
Since we talk about a hard fork, it seems that there must be a dominant form of client that the network sticks to.   
If the ecosystem is indeed that sticky, it diminishes the ease of implementing competition to Core.  
As an aside, I find it objectionable that the developers are starting to refer to themselves as "Core" and not just developers of "Core".

I would be interested in a hypothetical column for private blockchain assets. 
Note that bank private blockchains, should they ever endeavour to be more than weird notaries, will have assets created by transaction record (a blockchain), that either a) suffer from the same deficiencies as fiat money in this comparison or b) eliminate one of banks primary reasons for existence: fractional reserve lending of cheap central bank print.

So right on the face of it, the supporting media institution, the developer and the state bank are proposing: commercial banking in its current form is done for. 
Due to "blockchain technology," really Bitcoin, the state Bank of England, the originator and model of today's fiat system, in a proposed move to defend its own existence, is willing to wipe out its closest partner.  
Are you kidding me?  This is not "then they fight you", this is the castle sacrificing the village by pulling up the moat bridge before the battle is engaged. If we were smart, we would be approaching commercial banks about creating credit markets centred on Bitcoin as the asset described in the paper legal contracts. 
And then it has to compete.  It's big advantage is that it's controlled by central authority. Which is the opposite of an advantage.

If the coins on each chain are adequately differentiated and therefore a cleanish chain split, then there will be a market of exchange between the two coins (and fiat).  There will be a price for each based upon aggregate user preference. Post fork. 
The price of a coin, then is the respective value of the coinbase reward which is quite correlated to the amount of proof work applied.  
User/hodler preference will ultimately decide the fate of both coins.  Including perhaps the outright abandon of Bitcoin.  
This is where the control grab and arrogance of people like Jihan gets frustrating.  Miners are few and have a narrow set of self interest.

I hope that prior to the fork to Classic we see some period of greater fees, say .001 btc from the current .0001 btc that seems to work fine.  This would show a fairly spam free level of interest in Bitcoin and more what the economy is all about.  I think until we get a period of fairly obnoxious fees, we are not in crisis level need to fork and so probably won't.
As another aside, I hope we get a non-contentious fork to Classic that the Core guys can at least not fight tooth and nail.  This would be super healing. We can add capacity, we can fork if we have to, we can route around bad actors if we need to.

The ultimate consensus vote is the perceived future value of a proposal.  Also known as the price.
Currently that is a blunt binary instrument. If the two delineated assets, BTc and BTu, could trade accurately wrt each other in the early stage of a chain split, the most valuable scenario would gain consensus.   The cold reality of trading would settle the debate.  
Imagine each of the two current proposal roughly splitting the hashrate and coordination of a chain fork and let coin investors determine which has greatest value.  It is far more likely to pick the better future than a few miners with highly coherent interests.
Currently the only vote carrying weight is hash power.  Nodes and public statements are convincing. They show a real unquantified gravity, but have little impact on the validity of a block.

But that is strong incentive for the operator's code to follow the rules.  It doesn’t mean they can't operate a different client. As in today's Bitcoin network.

Maybe even XT as 6th...

We live in banker's prison.  How else could the future value of money be less than zero or frankly less than .07 p.a.?
In Bankers Prison, one bank called the BIS coordinates all fiat notions, combined this is a near complete monopoly of overlaid notes. Legal tender and chartered bank laws exterminate competition through the points of guns.  All gun barrels that oppose are converted by the CIA and IMF by carrot and stick or as it's known in Latin America, silver or death, scooping up prosperity from the life art of peasants like a bailleen whale swimming through a plankton cloud. The most resistant nations become pariahs and eventual members of axii of evil. 
In Bankers' Prison, CNN successfully deadens our empathy for people in a tiny blockaded open air prison bordering Egypt. And successfully tricks us into war time and time again. 
In Bankers' Prison, the solution to bank runs is not risk sharing and transparency but money printing. The solution to economic woes is not freedom and investment but money printing. The solution to every conceivable problem is money printing. We never explore who benefits from money printing. We never explore who benefits from a fraud of multi $T interbank lending rate. We never explore how war is used to impose value into fiat notions. We never explore who benefits from the US Federal Reserve having access to NSA data. 
Bitcoin, should it ever become private, is a hole in the fence in Bankers' Prison. That is its heart and soul and its highest most cherishable purpose.

The perceived problem with BU is that a BU network's acceptance of change is much more changeable and loses alot of the balance of incentives currently in place.  Miners have much more power in a BU network.  A group of miners with similar self interest would seem to have little to hold their interest as pimarily to serve transactors.  If miners also run a substantial number of nodes, there is little that anyone can do to halt changes that are good for miners but noxious to someone else.  
I don't buy for a moment that even the current network is balanced in its incentives or that a miner vote is somehow good custodial oversight by miners.
For many, myself included, this is highly undesirable.  
I have zero affection for the actions of the leaders of Core.  They put themselves and the rest of us here.  They may code well but their community building could be a chapter in a leadership textbook.  The reason that we now have a schsim (mostly between those holders that prefer security and miners that want control of development) is that the devs of Core did not incorporate a wider set of concerns in their proposal and then acted in poor faith and arrogance.  
But I still highly prefer that developers craft change in a slow and determined fashion.  I want them in the mix.  BU is not at all of interest to me.
Too bad I am not all that thrilled about Eth or Dash.  Monero I do like but its still a bit primitive.

I would like to think that quote is true but I don't see it.  
If BU obtains a super majority of hashrate, and has some ample number of nodes, and can successfully stuff the majority hashrate chain with empty blocks, then it will form a chain.  There will be only that chain.  
So how do dissenting nodes enforce anything?

I don't think theymos is successful on this front. I am pretty sure any motivated miner, user, holder, dev, app dev etc don't rely on theymos for any of their info.

This is nonsense.  
I am advocating choice not efficiency.  
The reason that the vast majority of commerce in the US is done exclusively using dollars and not Amazon gift cards or bonds is that there is a set of laws that reinforce its use.  US debt and taxes are denominated and paid in Fed Reserve Notes.  Commodity trade, futures, contract legal tender, insurance, enforce denomination and payment in FRN.  
US debt as a real claim to real future economic value provides the anchoring value and usefulness to FRN promissories.  
Active squelching of true alternatives contributes.  
This removes the choice.  Most people consider bank gov currency as the only form of money.  
Money is a great invention, as is debt.  But that's not the point.  Holding an enforced monopoly over the phenomenon is repugnant.  And unnecessary today.  
You really consider private efficiency and innovation as being properly claimed as anchor for government debt and FRN value?
Who cares about John Law or wildcat banking? That's so anachronistic, its a joke.  As is Medici accounting.  
For the first time ever we have an easily observable, highly perfect, highly highly difficult to counterfeit transferrable global artefact.  
Bitcoin is exactly the opposite of bullion bank paper counterfeit or Assignats. Or even debt money.   It is a pure accounting abstract.  That can not be cheated.  It doesn't represent a claim on something else.  It isn't backed by anything but the weird faith of hodlers. 
Of course, it is a trifling experiment in money currently, but it is a radical improvement.  It is routed optical fibre error rate compared to the distorted analog AM government radio.  
By all means keep listening to government radio, but I don't need it and I won't be denied the choice. 
Interference in that choice is impractical and wrong.

Sidechains and Lightning (and other ideas), should they actually work, are good and necessary for scaling. Clearly on mainchain capacity increase is eventually a dead end.  Doing SegWit prior to bumping up on main chain capacity seems pretty clearly to be the better first priority and it outclasses BU on all fronts.  
Lightning will have fees.  It has to. People will not fund the channels unless there is some remuneration for their risk and sequester of btc.  Lightning and side chains are not an exclusive domain of anyone.  I would not trust one that isn't mostly open source anyway.  That is not evidence of a hidden agenda.
The AXA investment into a couple of important dev actors is bad optics but its seemingly weak leverage.  The ideas and solutions in the Core software are better quality and more consistent with Bitcoin ideals than the rival BU by a long mile.  Clearly, the devs of Core do not impose code on anyone.  
The incentives in Bitcoin flow as follows: fulfilling users' needs, perception of fulfillment of those needs provides investment opportunity for btc holders, hashrate is built to take advantage of coin price, services for fees develop.  If people like Jihan forget how they get rewarded, there is a thuosand other ways to do what Bitcoin does.  Domineering does not work.

Now, the same like could happen vice versa.  I am biased towards SegWit, but I do think enough of the hodlers prefer security over unlimited feature evolution that SegWit Bitcoin will be just fine.
Their is a aberrant abhorrent psychosis in BU's design and a good part of its community.  BU attempts to remove not only the moderate power of devs but also the strong veto of hodlers and give it to miners.  Sweet deal for miners.

1) I owe you a debt of gratitude for opening my eyes about the person John Nash. His work is far more important than I imagined. And he is a hero.  For those whose information about him is from "A Beautiful Mind," the movie is essentially modern state propaganda.  
2) We do not have ideal money.  Mostly we have exploitive money, that, as Nash discovered, to criticize is to be ridiculed as insane.  His "delusional" behaviour was to equate all central banks as exploitive of humans regardless of the system of governance.  
3) Gold is by far the most proximate to Ideal Money, though clearly not ideal really.  It may remain the best we can do.  
4) Bitcoin is a trifling nothing compared to the enduring quality of gold and is less than that in compare to Ideal Money
  
5) However, Bitcoin is a great conceptual leap forward. Ideal Money must first be perfect in accounting.  Bitcoin is the first money to do that.  
6) There can not be really Ideal Money.  It can not be more than a concept.  
7) But we can approximate it.  
8) A global standard of perfectly self accounting with little barrier to entry by any human is the first approximation to Nash money.  Once all subjectivity can be brokered by access to this standard, price stability as measured by the human soul (fears, greeds, futures, needs, empathy etc etc) might happen.  
I don't know if you are a case of art purposefully imitating life, but take Nash as an example.  
He wasn't delusional.  He saw the world centuries beyond his contemporaries.  He was hurt by the disgusting exploitation by democratic authority.  He naively thought the system would give up its ways if he just spoke truth to it.  
Bitcoin is unlikely to be Ideal Money.  It must have cheap ad hoc access in addition to hard hard value.  And it needs generations of cultural acceptance.  It's still breakable cryptography.  If you look at the current schism in Bitcoin, none of the ideas achieve this.  If it is mutual attack from both sides, then it is succeeding.  
Take heart.  We are much much closer to Nash's dreams than I think he would have dared dream.

Good news.  
Now that we have an empirically observable honest accounting system complete with a way to transfer non-forgeable digital artefacts and with a price based solely on voluntary exchange, I can have my type of money and you can have yours. The problem for you and why you will eventually call for more violent reinforcement is that your money doesn't work only with 50W bulbs like you.  You need me.  But I bet the costs for forcing my participation now exceed the benefit.  
I doubt it is even 50W. You don't even know that fiat money requires enforceable debt. Or that the distribution of the asset created from this debt goes to some while the distribution of the debt goes to others. At gunpoint.  I think in a past life you would have made an adequate dungeon guard or such.

You distorted what I said.  I am confident that a $20B project with exponential potential does not Blockstream money to fund development.
My thesis is that Blockstream is obnoxious to a part of the community that is holding up progress.  Two pieces of evidence:
1) Bitcoin is rejecting Blockstream. Correct or incorrect (I think they are incorrect) part of the community with the power to hold up progress is rejecting Blockstream.  Listen to their words.  They may even be correct.  
2) The results.  The community is a mess.  Key people hold some responsibility for this. Loopy, mutable ledger PoS coin is on the verge of toppling Digital Gold.  That's bizarro.  27%.  27%.  SegWit is clearly a better technical solution.  You can either believe that miners are masochistic idiots or that they have reason to reject SegWit.  They say they don't like the tyranny of "Core."

I am not taking it personally.  Apologies if it came across as such.
Currently there is one blockchain that matters with 98% of the market value.  That's just reality. In fact I would prefer to see other functional crypto assets but apparently the market does not.  
Banks are in a terrible position vis a vis blockchain and Bitcoin.  Bitcoin itself is a potential but far from manifest existential threat. Banks live and will perish with their oligopigal access to free money. Bitcoin replaces not only central banking but also some aspects of commercial banking. The remainder of bank function is replaceable by other applications.   I am convinced that the smart bankers know this because they won't even speak the name of the puny $6B weakling and they are all talking blockchain technology.  
A bitcoin is an object created by the transaction records in the blockchain that has the properties of i) adhoc key creation, ii) adhoc transferance.  These objects have something astounding, a free market price.  Without these qualities, "TBDcoin" is not natively a settlement system.  It has no settlement directly.  The asset in the object must be interesting and valuable not because it is "pegged" (ie subsidized) to some fiat value, but because free human beings will trade their labour for it.  This is so critical and a bit subtle.  
Banks must and can not out Bitcoin Bitcoin. Bankcoin must defined monetary quantity (killing off central banks), it must be open source (zero control), it must be adhoc in key creation and transferance (banks do not hold the asset in account).  Without these qualities , it's a really really shitty altcoin.  A coin with these qualities is a bank killer not a bank enabler. There are hundreds of altcoins with qualities better than this, failures. There are altcoins much superior to Bitcoin, failures.  
Achieving free market price for their blockchain object will not be easy if banks want to remain the creatures that they are.  
And until they offer a marketable asset, there is nothing to talk about. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 02:41:25
This seems correct, but obviously still to be borne out in reality.
Bitcoin sets a very high bar. For a bank sponsored crypto currency to succeed, it needs to overcome Bitcoin's head start which implies that it must have superior qualities. Probably much superior.
These qualities include an inherent route around ability due to open source (even if Bitcoin itself fails), ad hoc permission free transferance of ownership, neutrality of system wide ownership (ie Chinese and Dollar banks will and should never trust each other - look how they abuse their own respective currencies to gain advantage in macro finance), open, no barrier to entry, proof of work as a resource burn to prove honesty, ad hoc permission free creation of private key ownership, fixed money supply held in check by open community consensus and asset valuation. 
Until banks issue an actual crypto asset, the whole "blockchain technology" conversation is as meaningful as an adolescent sexual fantasy. It's only in their heads about how great it is. It's just not realistic to imagine banks out-Bitcoining Bitcoin and producing an asset with even less bank attributes.  The time of the great bank hedging into Bitcoin won't be far. Smart people in banks will soon see that R3CV is a scam inside themselves.
Bring out the bank coins with exchangeable free market price and then we can talk. 
In the meantime there is STILL ONLY ONE blockchain with ANY real relevance. And since this blockchain is very neutral and has a bearer asset without third party control with a price that settles (ie not just document for later settlement) in minutes, why wouldn't they just use that blockchain that they refuse to acknowledge?
I think that there is this bizarre refusal to even name Bitcoin in their public communications indicates that large parts of the current system are threatened.
Once ad hoc private key bonds and equities become real, who really needs fiat, banks, etc?

And it's precisely this lack of stupidity that will lead to a massive goldrush into Bitcoin.  Banks will still invest in the lost hope of control but they will I think soon smarten up to the fact that perhaps their choices are limited to altcoin with bank attributes (hahahahahah!) or Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's open ledger may become a problem for them, so maybe a Cryptonote or zero knowledge system might be where they invest eventually. They would be crazy to not hedge something into the dominant digital bearer asset now.

Sure it does.  BU plans to start orphaning non BU signalling blocks at a 60% or so majority.  This then creates an apparent but bogus signalling of miner unanimous signalling for BU.  Then, they will pick a time to break prior consensus rules.  They will have sufficient nodes and hashpower to append a blockchain.  They have publicly stated they will smother a competing corechain by stuffing it with an infinitely long chain of empty blocks.  No core chain.  No BTc asset to trade.  All gone. 
If you count BW they BU hashrate is very near majority.  Core is losing.

I am a little surprised by both of those opinions.  Bitcoin's power, should it become manifest largely is to replace central banking. Bernanke's opinion is a very relevant one.

@_date: 2016-01-12 18:42:53
So I disagree. Bitcoin offers the only digital adhoc neutral global settlement system, precisely because it is a bearer asset with zero barrier to entry and very low friction. 
I think it's important to notice that settlement is always done in fiat.  That is because fiat has a market price. Fiat is always desired by common Joe.  This is incredibly important. These banks are rivals. They have to settle with something with value independent. 
Bitcoin offers that in spades.  
It's akin to the meanings of "publishing" or "TV broadcasting" in those disintermediated media. 
Bitcoin means anyone can "settle".  Everyone does it. Even financial companies and you bet even banks will do it.

P2P trustfree money isn't easy.  Bitcoin is great.  Which altcoin would not want Bitcoin's usage problem?  Scaling on chain upgrades are happening.  65% of mining hashrate is signalling one proposal or the other.   Fees and tx capacity on chain are silly issues next to security and fungibility.
If you allow yourself to get caught up in the whipped up frenzy of OMG Fees! you will miss what's important.  
Developing a competing client software is one of the most honorable things people can do, creating choice.  Unfortunately the alternative on the table is poor.  It creates a new variety of consensus formation that if it operated perfectly would be trouble, is closed development and is quite untested.  It removes all power of consensus forming except for those with hashing majority. That's a radical change.
All for this mewling about fees! 
Current fees pinch matters nothing compared to long term security, current incentives balance and long-term scaling.

@_date: 2016-03-08 00:37:06
It comes down to that the primary use case for Bitcoin is as a trust free digital bearer asset.  It is an asset that can be confidently secured and transferred to anyone on the planet where the Internet touches without any opportunity to prevent this by third party.  This is the essence of Bitcoin.
It is only purely trust free if the user has a copy of the blockchain and can verify the next appending block.  There is still a very reduced reliance on trust in an environment like we have today where there are many nodes and trusting them is ok.  
In a world of very large blocks, very few parties would have the capacity to keep the blockchain and update it.  This then creates a need for trust.  It is not at all a stretch to imagine that a small handful of huge servers could be compelled by some authority to censor some signatures.  Bad guy keys signatures could be made illegal to mine and propagate to the network should they be mined.  It would be trivial to list and censor them.  It would be easy to make a simple but false moral case to the general public about the goodness of such censorship.  
Rip offs by the large node operators become more possible and temporary scams of faked transactions become difficult for the end user to decipher.
Of course there are shades of grey in between, but it would seem that the standard should be something like a keen middle class person should be able to easily host a node.  
This must be balanced with that Bitcoin gains utility as it can handle more transactions onto the blockchain. In either case, there is a limit of on blockchain transactions that can happen before Bitcoin loses its essential value.  
It's still awe striking that Bitcoin has the capacity and actual use of some 10 000 txs per hour of settled asset.  That order is probably plenty for a reserve money.  Gold is a bearer asset and entire banking systems were based upon IOUs for gold.  Bitcoin is far superior to gold for this purpose.  IOUs (or credit markets) are perfectly capable of scaling to infinite transactions even if none of the technical scaling works.  
So the whole thing works if and only if Bitcoin is money, which requires small blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:13:04
With all due respect to the author, Central Bank crypto currency is nothing.  It's dead at conception.  
If the money object is not cryptograhically transferred without any intermediary (other than a few protocol rules), then it is not cryptocurrency.  That is to say, cryptocurrency does not need and is only harmed by a bank.  No-one who knows about it will value it.  
The software is already open source, New research is done in open whitepapers.  The crypto objects are freely transferable without identity or third party trust.  
Crypto money has vastly superior basic monetary properties over gold, physical notes, credit accounts or cash accounts.  It just is obtaining cultural adoption.  
Central banks are unnecessary to any of it.  Central banks are on the way into history's abyss.  And good riddance!

Contention is consensus in the mirror. Without contention, there is not really consensus. 
Is it not an essential, healthy and desirable feature of open source code to have the potential to fork?  And to have competing visions and offerings waiting, indeed heel nipping and challenging the status quo?
I have become a silent observer of this debate because frankly the nuances escape me a little. I have also become sanguine about it.  It is doubtless to me that some open source blockchain money system will emerge from all of this. That is what really matters. Whether it is Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin at all is not too important. Yup, my hodlings might be damaged or lost.   So I hedge a little and am reassured that if the worst comes to pass for Bitcoin, we will all be together soon again, because the only thing we really need to get to the moon is the longing to do so.

At 95%, it opened the door for BU. 
If a presidential candidate declared she would only accept the job if she received 95% of the vote, she can not win and has disqualified herself.  
At 95% for Segwit, it is similar.  It says, it is a farcical fantasy.  It says to me that Core devs don't really think it can succeed.  
There will be 5% that are just too apathetic to upgrade. There will be 5% that just don't like Adam Back (or something equally silly).  There will be 5% that have valid self interests opposing it.  There will be 5% that are paid to interfere.  
At 80%, we can get there. Why bother trying at 95%? At 95% we will never get increased capacity or malleability fix.  But at 65% of miner hashing, I can promise you the world and well at least it stands a chance of moving forward.

As a William Gibson fan, I imagine a world of competing organization. Government will be amongst the rather impotent, but which corporation or organization one belongs to determines much.
Bitcoin is nearly transparent.  This transparency is *not* part of our future.  
I think imagine an arms race of opaque wealth and the techniques to unveil others.  I can imagine theatrics and feint of say trying to appear wealthy when not or to live a mundane life with enourmous wealth. Or to have a sanctuary for high life but transitioning to walk to the bakery while looking over your shoulder.  
Not to mention the theft and regular affairs of human betrayal. 
You can probably see the Gibson in all that.

The guy doesn't even understand:
That fiat money gets its value from real economic claims on future value. Fiat is purely notional with zero value without enforceable debt.  One man gets access to zero cost money; another pays his labour into debt to pay that cost. It's simple.
That fiat doesn't work without an enforced monopoly.
That fiat monopoly has thus distorted time preferences and caused a great many economic dislocations through history. 
That fiat money creates a societal hierarchy by replacing merit with access to money printing as the prime basis for receiving capital allocation. 
That the solution for this hierarchy is not redistribution of wealth (two non meritous wrongs...) but is money without a giant black hole and without privelege.  
That we now have an abstract notional money that doesn't need an anchor of claim against a metal or some stranger's labour.  That this represents a promise of great progress for humankind to have an operational token money without use of force.  Does he even Bitcoin?
There is no point in conversing with someone when they are this far apart in their ideas.

I sincerely think banks are threatened by Bitcoin. Not yet in any real manifest way. Bitcoin potentially replaces fiat and banks' privileged access to it.  Without these privileges, banking can be replaced by apps (ie Open Transactions).
Why else all of the noise about blockchains? There is only one relevant blockchain (98% of market value) but according to the banks Bitcoin doesn't matter. While there may indeed be some efficiency gains in interbank operation via blockchains, it is doubtless that banks are interested more because of Bitcoin's potential to relieve them of their privileges.  
This week's Brookings/R3/NYT/Hearn/pricedump attack is instructive and empowering. It was pretty high stakes, was semi public and it failed.  Hearn's motives seem clear, to be destructive. There is no way his piece wasn't vetted by R3 before its release.  That's how it works on that side of the fence. So R3 has more than a passing interest in Bitcoin. 
The conundrum for banks is how to beat Bitcoin and maintain fiat privilege. I doubt it is possible on the free market.  I predict that fiat bankers will exert their power over state to compel people to use some kludgy blockchain account based money with human intervention quantity properties. This is what their current activities are about. If not why even speak of "Beyond Bitcoin?"  So while I agree that blockchains seem a silly way to enhance interbank ops, there is a certain method to that madness.
They would also need Bitcoin extinguished. 
The blockchain was invented for money purposes. Bitcoin is the only really important application of this invention. Money is the purpose of the blockchain. Money is the purpose of banks.

No.  
The sine qua non of a nation is its laws, their creation and enforcement.  
In regards money, there is essentially a global patchwork of monopolies over money.  The laws of taxation and legal tender within each area create local monopoly.  This is wearing thin in an Internet world but still largely holds true.  Central banks coordinate to manage an effective global monopoly.  
This is a useful but badly abused system.
Money has one purpose.  To communicate value.  Metals have inherent properties and deep cultural attachment, which functions.  Bank money is abstract and requires an asset of debt to make it have value for communication purposes.  This necessitates a cumbersome (and brutal) system of debt, taxes and enforcement or the abstract tokens have no value.  Terrible incentives arise to capture economy and provide value to these tokens.  Including enforcement of local  monopoly.  Barbarous relics indeed. 
Once this monopoly arises, it corrupts as it has since Rome.  It is deeply corrupted today.  It is not at all transparent.  It is not at all meritocratic.  It highly distorts the communication of value.  
Janet Yellen sets interest rates.  Does that sound like distortion or clear signal of pricing of money itself?

@_date: 2017-03-18 16:34:44
That is the fundamental reason.  Just under the surface though is a very tortured dynamic.  
The Bitcoin community is not at all agreed on which way to go.  The biggest problem is that the miners seem to be significantly out of step with some part of the investors.  The miners have the power to create a new protocol consensus and hold out against investors long enough to potentially extinguish investors role in arbitrating the better choice of protocol.  
Many investors are not liking that risk so are selling. 
I personally believe that investors power will prevail and there is not much reason to panic.  
Coin holders hold 16M btc.  Miners are mining less than 1 M per year.  Investors have far more power over miners than miners seem to imagine.

They can manipulate themselves in private all they like.  There is a word for that.  An asset in a transaction ledger of a single institution is akin to a teenage boy having a relationship with Beyoncé but only on the web and without her knowing anything about it. Assets and actual sex require some value in the mind of another.  Assets in a private ledger of a joint venture are like small town Beyoncé fan club.  Nobody cares about that either.  
Money is the natural (and as yet only) purpose of blockchain, and we already have a functioning public money, adhoc accessed, with backing by a few million cherishing individuals.  Private org blockchains are not going to alter that Bitcoin potentially replaces central banks. 
Commercial banks' primary vehicle of profit is the chartered  oligopical expansion of central bank fiat. Bitcoin and perhaps Monero replace that. Ethereum, being not just simple money does not. The big commercial banks will die a miserable, state resisted death because they ARE fiat ledgers and not much more.  Banks are also apps for risk and time preference matchmaking, and very good accounting.   These functions are also eminently replaceable. 
Central banks are no longer necessary. Large chartered commercial fiat expansion banks are no longer necessary. Much of the power of state comes from symbiosis with fiat money.  These institutions will not just free their flocks.  The stench of threatened power soaks the pages of history. This will likely be brutal.

Plain silliness. Money serves a purpose. It is simply an intermediate between other economic valuables; it makes an abstraction of value.   The amount of money ie. of value exchanges in economy is 100% independent of the amount of units of money being used. If someone has something of value to offer and someone else values it, money is the easiest aspect of the exchange.  Adding units to the supply of money DOES NOT add any amount of money to an economy. Think about it. It's clear that adding a notional figment has nothing to do with economy.  The amount of money is only a product of exchange of value. The units are arbitrary.
What you have described is theft. Those that have the power to add units, simply are stealing value. Inflation is a loss of value by everyone else.  Economic power obtained by the print, is obtained from everyone else who holds units of denomination. Theft. Straight up. 
All the bla bla is just obfuscation of the crime.

If you want to predict the outcome, you must begin to think realistically.  Incorporate the following potential truth into at least part of your imagination: The powers that control the quantity of fiat units are selfish. Read it again. Once you have gained this perspective, a lot of mysteries evaporate.  
One ledger's liability is another's asset.  The balance sheet of the world has far far far more liability than can be paid back via economy, so a lot of debts must be dealt with. The debt can be collapsed along with all of the corresponding balanced assets but then the masses will have it revealed that they have very little after all.  The banks themselves would go bankrupt.  Bankruptcy means that shareholders lose their interests.  Therefore that will never happen as it is the same people that print the money that are these shareholders. 
Hyperinflation has the same outcome in terms of mass poverty, but it keeps the banks intact.  
There will be massive print.  But don't dream that the benefits will flow to main street.  First stop, Wall Street and Pentagon. Next, large investors, then small investors.  Labourers will see only hills to climb.

It's a symptom, an indicator and a problem.  People do not want to hold fiat as a store of value, so they are paying more today for these bonds to have a return of less fiat cash tomorrow. 
It's a sort of madness.  Under normal circumstance, money today is worth more than tomorrow, because we need compensation for deferring expenditure to a later time.    It says that people are freaking out about expectation of deflation.  In a time when money is being excessively printed.  It means that debt is collapsing somewhere in the system faster than it can be printed and fractionally expanded. 
The problem at the heart of the matter is that cheap money gets invested in projects with poor return without the discipline of constrained supply.  Think of money spent on personal luxury or even big houses. There is no financial return so there is no asset to balance the debt.   The trail most worn is the one blazed by Keynes: the solution to all ills is to expand the money supply.  Unfortunately this bizarre logic seems to be enough for even PhD economist bankers.  
So we print!  Money prinitng begets cheap money begets poor investment begets collapsing debt begets recession or falling asset price begets money printing.  Bad enough if it were just a cycle of poor judgement, but it's actually a criminal operation.   
Mark this:  we will follow the folly until inflation is killing us, then we will beg the monopolist money printers to please do something.  And they will!  All of the debt we acquired with cheap money that we wasted on ill investment, will suddenly bear unbearable interest rates.  And those that know what the game is might anticipate and hedge properly and survive.  Those that do not will be wiped out.  But those that know the timing and have access to as much "money" as they can print profit greatly at all points along the way. 
This is the reason for Bitcoin's invention.  If that's not why you are here, get studying.  Quickly now.  The ice berg was struck in 2008.  The good ship BIS became too big to sink with Bretton Woods and put on full steam in 1971.

There is though. The issue at stake is whether a 2x hardfork is non-contentious.  
The onus is on the proposer of a hardfork to either a priori provide evidence of deep consensus (which is impossible) or to allow a voluntary consensus to form by submitting a choice to the market with replay contention.  
That a feature is "good" for many or even most as deemed by a narrow group is insufficient to dictate a hardfork.  This is now the state of affairs evermore in Bitcoin. 
This list provides ample evidence that the 2x hardfork is not explicitly supported, which is the standard a hardfork must meet.  The onus is to show deep consensus for the hardfork not deep contention against it.. 
We should not risk a chain split for this 2x at this time. The support isn't explicitly there.  For many a jump to a possible 8M block in one swoop is too haphazard.

You have to ask yourself what real world need does a coin solve.  
Bitcoin solves secure permissionless value transfer.  Its payment capacity matters far less than that purpose.  Its cultural adoption and its 4M PH/s shield of coal burning computational dragon fire are pretty unassailable.
Ethereum does not solve any needs, but definitely might. I really like what it is trying to do and if it succeeds, we will live in a very different world. Turing complete means it can execute any Boolean logic.  There is nothing it won't do.  Which of course is the biggest problem of Engineering.  Its pretty easy to make things do what you want.  Its getting them to not do what you don't want that's the trick. Currently it is a relief valve for Bitcoin investors and transactors.  It can't be all of its ambitions and meet Bitcoin's staid requirements.  It will look nice on several Bitcoin sidechains perhaps some day. 
Dash scratches the itch of OMG fees! convenience but can not be considered secure in the sense of native fungibility.  There is quite a bit of 'trust-me' there.  Once Bitcoin triples on chain capacity with SegWit and Schnorr, Dash had better watch out.  What Dash does is easy on cheap disposable sidechains methinks.
Monero IMO solves a need no other coin does. Native trustfree fungibility. But it's not a polished UX and its tx are large.  It can't replace Bitcoin. And Its role is as a digital opaque asset not a transactional currency.  Could be done nicely on a sidechain but that undermines its value proposition, so I don't think it can be fully replaced by a Bitcoin sidechain.  
It's a Bitcoin forum but you asked.
Of course sidechains seem to be some will o the wisp, so maybe we need all these coins.  
Tell Jihan that hodlers do not really need him quite the opposite.  "That's a mighty purty fab plant you got there.  Just right for Bitcoin but not much else.

I know what bankers do. I am not stating that Bitcoin does anything much more than you suggest. Bank money is still the way things get done. 
Bitcoin can (but does not) outright replace every manner of current finance and a thousand times more functions. As the first unforgeable digital object and therefore the first digital bearer asset, Bitcoin can be put on account if desired and do all the functions of banking as the base asset. But already so much more. 
Trust is a simple boring matter of inspection  of the blockchain. Security is a simple matter of keeping keys safe. Valuation is voluntary. 
One more time. Bank money is irrelevant not because it is not predominant. Bank money is irrelevant because it can not evolve. Double entry accounting with violence enforced valuation with constantly leaking and compelled trust is just plain stupid in comparison to using a blockchain. 
I know what bankers do. I still use banks. I just no longer have to invest any energy in whipping that beast or hoping that plebs will somehow elect fair power to remove the repugnant extravagance of wealth skimming slavery that distorts every aspect of finance and government to facilitate value theft towards the already dominant wealthy. 
You go right ahead and chaffe on the reins. I will too but increasingly they won't be there for me. If you can't imagine thetse things, well, meh, as you were then.  You are a businessman. Solve your biggest bank pain with a blockchain solution and market that solution. Don't sit around hoping that government is somehow distinct from banking. 
The mechanisms that banks create money are hardly vague. The central bank creates new notional assets and acquires on market assets.  Commercial banks take money and expand it via reserves. How is that unspecified.  I don't find the distinction between the functions performed by government and those by banks all that helpful. Bank money and banks and states are one and the same creature.  It does not improve our lot that government does the muscle work.  The beneficiaries are bankers. They choose where the money goes without any accountability for ensuring economic viability of investment. And if the debt fails, print more money. 
Blockchain money doesn't need law. So all the threats of compulsion to continue to use state monopoly money just is not relevant. With an object based money; ALL other functions of finance are apps.

When a money can not signal even the price of said money properly via market set interest rates, then all markets will have poor allocation of resource.  Money is a signal of the cost of resources by being using conductor of value.  Conductors of value include gold, bank gov fiat and crypto. 
The price of fiat money is now fixed globally.  It is the furthest thing from free markets.  This can only happen via thuggery enforced elimation of indvidual choice of money.  Negative interest rates are an in-your-face theft by bankgov from anyone holding fiat or anyone with future expectations priced or proxied in price of fiat.  
  
Disabuse your own imagination of the idea that state fiat currency has good monetary qualities.  That is secondary.  State fiat currency is mafia company chits whose promise to pay will be defaulted one way or the other.  
It is up to you what is money to you.  The use of compulsion to remove that choice is a great crime of the state.

In short, blockchain money is superior in many ways. It will find purpose in many applications heretofore not possible. It's superior accounting unit of account properties will lead to high value and liquidity and then superior economic unit of account properties to fiat.  Then futures contracts will be completely feasible and cheap. 
Gold IOUs were something of an improvement over gold itself in the sense that they are more portable. Paper, then digital fiat IOUs are even more esoteric and portable than gold IOUs with gold's inconvenient fixed yet opaque ledger. I think there is something of a technological improvement of fiat over gold itself.  Fiat has superior accounting unit of account properties even though gold has superior economic unit of account properties.  
Bitcoin has outstanding accounting unit of account properties, perfect really, it doesn't leak so much as a satoshi. It has poor economic unit of account properties due to its tiny liquidity. This will only change with, say, a couple of orders magnitude in price increase.  Contracts valued strictly in Bitcoin are completely economically feasible, though they become impractical for most over time periods where economic value of a unit (price) varies so much.  Futures contracts are completely possible for volatile commodities, in fact they ameliorate volatility. 
The domain available to money that does not require state intervention is much larger than one that does. Have you spent any time looking at Open Transactions or Lightning, or Augur or even The DAO (which I am fascinated with but won't be ponying up a nickel for)? I would even bet better than even odds that AI combined with some human intervention allocates risk better than banks can.  So an Ethereum bank that is 100% automated save for important checks and balances by humans.  These are just plainly things that can not be done with account based money.  So the demand for a crypto money will be sufficient to create liquidity pool and price stability. Then longer term futures contracts will function just fine. 
Billionaires will be created (Nakamoto's coins are getting close to that already), via creating financial beasts that you and I won't even understand, in a myriad of unimaginable menagerie of applications. 
TV broadcast was strictly state sanctioned, now video is anything anywhere anytime over IP.   
That fiat requires state intervention is indicative of weakness. I am not as impressed by state potency as you are. The state itself is not the only entity that can form social cohesion. Geographically limited monopoly claim to violence can not persist as monopoly. Enforceabilty of private contracts will not be limited to courts.  Already cheap mediators clear multisig disputes on Open Bazaar without misplaced faith in a sovereign.  I will be extreme and leading. I will not be at all surprised to see competing organizations who deploy reputation and violence to keep good order, as last resorts to upkeep mostly automated contracts. 
I am ... optimistic but humble as well. I think that blockchain money will become dominant, but if it does not, it won't harm me too much. 
I am not using "irrelevant" in the sense you impute.  Fiat just is irrelevant because it can not compete in many arenas, not that it has disappeared or will. Fiat bears the heavy burdens of regulation to keep double entry accounting honest, theft of value via inflation, of unit of account head-fakes by central bankers, of domestic and foreign capture by violence of economic resource. . That is all very very wasteful. A voluntary valued crypto suffers none of that. Bank-state money perverts both the money and the state. 
A lot of high conjecture here on my part. Not insisting any of it, btw, just making my bets.

Guttenberg's invention demoted the myth of the Pope as exclusive human consort of God to the Bible being interpreted by any literate man and then further demoted to competing with any other myth.  The myth of "superior persons" as governor still persists now though greatly diminished. As successive media forms have evolved the stature of this myth has further diminished.  What has this to do with Bitcoin? Everything. 
Money is communication.  In its lowest tech form, lumps of unprocessed metal, its medium is hand to hand like verbal tribal stories handed down by firelight.  It is quite understandable that regals put their faces on stamped metal very early.  Assuring a standard, getting one's face into people's pockets and power go hand in hand.  Remember that in ancient times, coins were the only mass communication medium there was.  Then problems arise.  The reason gold persists as money is because Nature has not revealed to us yet how to manufacture gold and it is just rare enough. Power of one person over another is based upon a series of false premises.  First, it must be accepted by the lesser that this is a natural state for them, it is God's will or some such claptrap. Then it must be established who should rule, typically worked out with violence so the meeker must accept violence as righteous.  Then the delivery of the ultimate coup de grace; the powerful reserves exclusive right to violence.  Violence is rightful domain of the already powerful but is not rightful by the weak, again claptrap with myth.  But what possibly does this have to do with Bitcoin?  Everything.  
The benefit of being the dominant party is that one has servants.  The labour of the servant by definition is not traded fairly in kind with the labour of the king. Heavens! The most effective manner of being one sided in exchange of labours is to trade the meeker's labour for tokens of value whose quantity can be manufactured at low labour cost by the ruler.  This is as at least as old as Rome, improved by the Medicis and their gold accounting double entry ledgers, amped up by the Rothschilds and sitting at its zenith currently with the hegemony of the Federal Reserve/BIS complex.  Time and time and time and time again, more predictably than Lucy moving the football for Charlie Brown, the masses are duped into using these imaginary tokens.  Civilizations collapse while Great Societies form. Mayhem, revolution, war.  We are in those days now as the global bankers pick off the weakest of the sovereign states.  We try to limit rulership with rules, but the failing Republic of the United States of America should inform us that rules will not be abided by rulers.  
So, you have missed your mark.  Bitcoin is communication. Its medium is decentralized record keeping.  It is a protocol born of algorithmm. Algorithms are no more governable by human assent than 2+2=4. The algorithm is beyond your regulation.  As is the communication between two parties that use it.  
Here is the solice for you.  Since the Bitcoin Genesis block, there is not one single cheat in transaction record. To 24 binary digits of significance, not one.  All the king's horses and all Jamie Dimon's mainframes and all the violence summonable by the wretched myth of the trusting the superior human can not compete.  Regulations by strongmen? We don't need your stinkin badges.
My advice to you is to not worry about the philosophy.  Philosophy did not invent the printing press.  My advice is to marvel at how Bitcoin does not fit into your public-private paradigm.  My advice is to buy as much of it as you can stand.  You know, we aren't making any more than 21M of them.  But don't worry, you can always get a small fraction of one in few years. They are subdivisable nicely.
Edit: As evidence, it is not at all mere coincidence that the myth of the superior ruler, the purvey of truth from authority and bank money will all enter extinction phases within at most a decade.  The medium is the message.  As surely as when Martin Luther invented printing (: when Al Gore invented :) the distributed routing of communication, he invented the final unwinding of the myth of violence as virtue.  
So if you think you need violence to do nice things, you will have to bring it peer to peer because I no longer have to show.you.the.money.

So back when Bitcoin Unlimited was looking like a thing, the exchanges, etc came out with a very definite clear statement about what they would consider the chain of continuity and what the forked chain.  
Any chain that is not hardforked is Bitcoin.  The other, the hardforked chain, in this case a 2X fork, by that same standard, has the onus to provide replay protection or it will not be tradeable and it must overwhemingly gain price preference to claim the ticker symbol and name Bitcoin.  
Have we heard from them this time?  I guess we know Bitpay's stance,...
Paging u/evoorhees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:55:17
The onus is on the forking coin to prove that there is next to zero contention.  
That's why the list matters.  Lack of opposition is not the same as consent. 2x needs vast consent to claim non-contentious. It does not have such consent. 
Then of course, holders should determine consent through price. No one can know if the market consents to a hardfork without referendum via price. 
All hardforks are contentious.  And therefore have the onus of replay protection.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:34:38
Still pretty contentious. It's not about advantages.  Its about choosing by market price or denying that by lack of clean demarcation by the hardfork proposal.  Do you advocate a wipeout attack with miner super majority?  Aggression.  Or do you even recognize that hashrate is purely correlated to price?
Miners matter not.  Even if they were not concentrated in ownership.  
Removing my choice to stay on a blocksmall chain is not a right nor power anyone except the market possesses.  
All hard forks are contentious.  Where is the replay protection?
99.9% of miners do not own the brand Bitcoin.  That's the name of the legacy chain and it won't be snuffed. 
B2X has to earn it.  It will not.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:56:07
Any hardfork attempt that will not bear the onus of replay protection is indeed an attack not just on the Bitcoin protocol but the very spirit of free choice of the coinholder to self determine which choice is more valuable to that individual.  
By all means, u/voorhees, list a 2X coin, but do we have to keep doing this?  You too will be defeated by market preference.  If hashrate decides the protocol rules with strong arm assistance from exchanges, Bitcoin is lost.   Too bad for all the newbie money just come in.  They won't figure it out for years if ever that they have been captured by oligarchy once again.
Hardforks must bear the full burden of overcoming the legacy.  This is so much more important than a transitory cheap feature desired by transitory corporations.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:13:39
Miners get paid for proofing work. Hashrate follows price.  
QED: The market chooses the protocol.
If the miners ever win at this collusion, the market will eventually abandon them.  They know it. Hence any protocol adaptation attempt without replay protection is willfully destructive.  This is Bitcoin's state of affairs.  It is vital that the current means of upgrade attempt be defeated. This is not about 2 MB.  This is about forcing a not well supported change with Hashrate brute force.

You apply the non aggression principle and leave them to determine the price of  1X chain by responsibly putting in replay protection into a hardfork proposal.  
Or you can spend wasted joules aggressively  removing their choice of chains.  You might win the power to remove choice but you can no longer pretend to be a libertarian. Removing my choice with your effort is the precise oppsite of non aggression.
What happened to the principles of requiring replay protection for a hardfork proposal?

Yup.  Mr Voorhees has the remarkable opportunity to advocate for either free choice (clean demarc w replay protection), or aggression (removal of 1x Bitcoin from existing via massively costly hashrate wipeout).  Indeed if he lists a 2x coin with no replay protection, he is explicitly acting in support of destruction and theft.  
And we get the remarkable pleasure of watching another Libertarian enter the toilet of autocracy.  Or not.  But my prediction is he will not explicitly advocate for my freedom to self determine preference for Bitcoin in its legacy form.  He and a scant few others know what is best for me.
And BTW, fuck compromise.  Its open source. Stop mimicking statist bullshit. Fork and let fork. Nobody has gotten consensus to extinguish the legacy chain.  Deal with it.

@_date: 2017-08-20 22:13:02
To be honest I am fairly ambivalent about the difference between 1x and 2x on their face.  I object mostly to the idea that consensus is bejng defined as hashrate majority and a willingness to alter the protocol with minor supermajority.  The price of Bitcoin pays the miners.  It is inherently part of the balance of incentives that users pay for the choice of protocol.  Miner dictated protocol upgrade destroys hodler choice.  This is why it is encumbent upon a hard fork proposal to provide replay protection, to maintain the vital role of investors being the capstone decision authority.  
The only proper way to upgrade is to offer a new coin and battle it out in the market for price.  This wasn't true in the past when the goals were more self contained and Bitcoin was tiny.  
A hardfork needs good code, a compelling reason and some small amount of hashpower.  Most importantly it needs price support.  If it extinguishes the legacy coin in price, all hail the new Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is a user chosen money protocol.  Any change compelled by miners plus corporations is a self admitted failure that relies on the wisdom of authority to achieve its end. And should be eschewed.  Developers that do not actively protect investor interests in the face of mining power concentration are suspect.

You are off target.  In fact, an important part of the authority game is to create fear and resentment of other "groups"  which then requires authority to do "big things" like war.  My parents didn't build an atomic arsenal.  They didn't choose 20% mortgages.  They didn't choose to quadruple M0 money.  Neither did I.  
These things come from a monopoly of power over money.  The MILICOM is a symptom and support of money monopoly.  Democracy is a poor veneer for authority as Americans probably now know.

This is open aggression by one group who have deemed themselves the bosses against those they have decided are their keep.  
It is none of my or any one' concern what currency two other parties exchange, in whatever form or amount.  The purpose of licensing violence to the state is so it is  used to enforce rights. It is an illegitimate use of this license to exercise powers that do not enforce rights.  Third parties do not have the right of knowledge or approval of any transaction.  So the state does not either.  
What a person chooses as money is a matter of conscience. Conscience is the first primal right, so fundamental as that it can not be interfered with.  A mind can not be changed by prison terms.  Ask Charlie Shrem or Nelson Mandela. Or John Nash.
What a person communicates is also a powerful right. Interference with communication is vile overreach.  Modern technology makes interference nearly impossible anyway.  
The creation of a money monopoly by power of state is a far bigger harm than even terrorism.  (Indeed the mechanism of BIS/USD (petrodollar) hegemony is a direct cause of terrorism.)
We are meant to swallow that forcing a bank-money monopoly is for our good.  We will be saved from invisible money!  But come on. This defies all sensibility and logic.  This is a horror.  We must give up rights to privacy, communication and conscience.  For what ends really?  Do we really believe that banks knowing everything will have saved truck drivers driving into crowds? Self serving nonsense. Or is it more realistic that the monopolists of money desire to maintain and extend their privilege?  
Make no mistake, there is enormous extravagant power in monopoly of money.  Once a government is loaded up with debt, the slightest pull on the reins via interest rates puts the bank fully in charge of all the menace of government.  
So we are being openly aggressed, against the most primal, basic and important rights. For the ends of maintaining power.  The most violent and corrupted humans amongst us will save us from immorality and violence.  
Thankfully the price of soldiers is very high.  And what can be done? Remove the Internet from us? Remove Cryptonote algorithms from human knowledge?  
The war is won but the losers already have a long history of fighting freedom all the way down.  Much harm will undoubtedly be delivered to persons.  But the algorithms will only get better.

The exhibited  sentiment of people in the West is the exact same as the one we shake our heads at for Venezuelans or Egyptians or Greeks. "Why do so few prepare? Why do they trust their government money and banks?"  
The writing is on the wall. Wealth in the West, particularly the US was borrowed and not earned.  Some of the biggest banks in Europe including DeutscheBank are bankrupt. In April DeutscheBank stated that the world has passed the point of no return into history's biggest credit default crunch. DeutscheBank openly criticized ECB actions this week.  Money printing is accelerating around the world.  The US economy appears to be entering a severe recession.  This past week, Alan Greenspan said that the US is heading for a situation like Venezuela.  
Even if waters were calm, it would be good to take action to hedge.  In the current situation, which indicates economic maelstrom for the West, preparing should be at emergency levels. Most people's financial "assets" are actually very derivative, while mostly their debts are quite real.   They think banks are their partners in wealth accumulation, but banks consider themselves to be financial "players" competing with their own depositors. 
It is not long now until people realize that trust and money invested in the government-bank-fiat conglomeration has been stolen. But the vast majority do not even take five minutes a week to understand the bigger world of finance surrounding them.
There will be no mainstream adoption of Bitcoin until governments can no longer afford to capture and fleece people. By that point, few will have anything to offer.

Well Ethereum suffered a chain split.  The other hardforks have had consensus.  This is more likely in smaller projects with singular vision.  Monero for example has pretty singular vision and frequent hardforks which alleviate differences.  But it will inevitably face critical forks where consensus is not deeply achievable.  It will generate different coins and the market will figure out which is relevant. Monero also illustrates the problem in Bitcoin of miner concentration.  It is only because mining power lies in a few hands that even necessitates all this drama.  A branched off coin that achieves a price can only be killed off by a cartel.  If Bitcoin miners were all tiny in scale, no one of them would waste a cycle in attacking a rival chain.  This is the privelege of strategic level of cartelm. 
Ethereum is facing some serious decisions upcoming.  Abandoning proof of work may well be contentious for example.  
Bitcoin can not fork without contention.  Its uses are varied, it's visions are multiple.  It can't be upgraded without harming someone.
Thats why it is critical to allow the price to figure out which coin gets the hashes.
A 2X increase is not worth a potential chain split, IMO. It's contentious.  Or rather the 2X proposal is far from reaching the standard of broad support.  Jamming it in via dominant strategic amount of hashpower is the very opposite of consensus.

I understand that.  
The principle I am getting at is one that seemed in the past to be really sound.  A forking coin is NOT Bitcoin until it basically extinguishes the price of the legacy coin.  
It has nothing to do with 58 important companies or miners' preference but a really good principle that allows coin holders to determine the outcome through market pricing.  2X is an altcoin until it can extinguish  the legacy 1X chain and holds the onus of replay protection and winning the hearts of holders before it gets the name or the ticker symbol.  Is this stance one of convenience for the exchange operators,depending only upon their personal whim?
So dominating groups can define Bitcoin as they like? It seems a pretty fundamental test of Bitcoin.
Mr. Voorhees u/voorhees in particular I think is quite impressively consistent in his adherence to market principles, but I wonder if forcing the Bitcoin crown onto the 2X hard!!! fork deviates almost diametrically from the principle of letting markets sort it out by price.
I personally hold a modest preference for 1X and would rather not suffer the drama of a hardfork attempt. I wiĺl hodl both 1X and 2X, compared to selling BCH, but it is a mild mostly ambivalent preference.  
I am interested in the principle of how a hardfork becomes "law."

The vote is the price.  B2X denies the pricing mechanism by artificially gaining mining support and then making chaos by not implementing replay protection.
It is conceived by cartel and is trying to be birthed by bullying.  This removes from the protocol choosing dynamic, the only real incentive we all have, the appeal that Bitcoin has to attain real world resource, aka price.  The decent balance of incentives between investor, user, infrastructure, developer and miner left behind by Nakamoto will be seized by  and in favour of the miner.  This is the predictable result of miner concentration. We will fight this again and again.  
The only ethical thing for B2X proposers to do is hard fork a new B2X coin and let the market choose.  This is not a democracy nor an autocracy. It is a market.  Miner hashrate can only follow price, so the amount of intention of miners prior to fork is meaningless.  There is no consensus around 2x and it should be dropped for now.

Agreed.  That is what is so infuriating.  The most important aspect of Bitcoin consensus is the $70B in value.  
That "leaders" like Garzik and Voorhees (who I hold esteem for generally) are willing to subvert the market dynamic just to get a protocol change they want is severely lacking.  In fact, a Bitcoin that is subject to protocol revsion by narrow groups (58 corporation heads including a handful of miners)without facing judgement via price competition is an empty lifeless husk of Bitcoin.  
As far as price goes, personally I will hold on tight to the protocol that wasn't chosen by narrow interests. Weeks, months, does not matter.  There are defenses short of PoW change against wipeout, so even a little hashpower is all that's necessary.
It's simple. Hardfork with clear demarcation and let the market decide.  Anything less is haughty governance.  You know, the opposite of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has become too many things to too many people to ever hard fork without contention.

@_date: 2017-08-20 19:48:37
I would like to say that too but that reality is in the past for Bitcoin.  Your measure is just as subjective and prone to opposition as Garzik's.  All hardforks will now cause some part of the ecosystem grief.  There is a completely reasonable line of argument that says that an unchanged Bitcoin will be most appealing. That line of thinking never desires any fork so a hardfork, especially as huge as an 8x blocksize increase in the span of months, will be contended by that camp ar least.
Monero in its primitive, small market cap shape, has few competing visions as an illustration.  Bitcoin's success means that hardforks can never be assumed as highly consensual.  It is OK, but it requires a more mature treatment.  Ie, offer the fork to the network and see if it takes. Offer means create an alt and compete for price.

There is hardly a war in history who's purpose is not to impose economic authority into a domain not previously dominated.  Economic authority and fiat are essentially one and the same thing.

Opinion piece by co-founder of 8btc arguing for national Chinese digital currency.  
Basically falling at the feet of government.  Mildly nationalistic, mildly paranoid.  Thinks Bitcoin is a threat to economy but more to government.  
TL;DR:  National currency is superior because its controlled and inflatable.  Bitcoin is inferior because no control, fixed supply, volatile price and (of course!) crime.  Government will release a "digital" currency that will have all the "good" features like control, inflation, bank bailout, consumer bailout and backdoors to reduce crime.  It will have superior technology to private money.  
If this is what 8btc is about, I won't be adopting any of their thinking.  
If this is common thinking by officials in China, prepare for a bruising.  I am sure they are happy to have Bitcoin highly influenced by a handful of locals.

It is not immoral and probably can not persist as illegal to communicate money.  
It  is an important quintessential question.  Philosophically, what it is that is money is a matter of individual conscience.  We are so much free to cherish, that no other person can interfere with that.  Even duress can not change one's mind about what one holds dear.  Note that most other freedoms require enshrinement with "rights."  Note also that the purpose of rights is to keep bullies at abeyance.  The only legitimate purpose of "government," if there is purpose at all is to support rights.  Note thirdly that government always betrays that bargain: the license to protect rights becomes malignant bullying itself. 
So, that's why we do Bitcoin.  
What constitutes money is really an individual choice.  We should be no more concerned with what our neighbors use for money than what brand of ketchup they prefer.  Or to put it into progressive terms, money preference is to be defended as much as the preference of what gender someone prefers to make orgasms with.  Conservatives and Progressives are equally guilty of pretending that these things are determined by their authority. Grotesque.  
We do Bitcoin because the government does not really care if we smoke pot or who we sleep with, but they are very concerned about what is used as money.  
I don't know anything much about money transmission law, but I do know that the law around money is basically become illegitimate.  It heretofore could have pretended that money is some commodity that exists here and then is moved there.  Since money has existed as ledger entries  (since Medicis), money has existed as pure communication.  That there were human intermediaries made the pretence possible.   Falsehood of ledgers enabled great iniquitous gains by ledger managers (aka banks).  Laws ostensibly are to protect from this but of course, the powers predictably coalesced.  Bitcoin slays these lies and requires no law of governance.  
What you cherish, ie a manner to put potatoes on your family's plate, I can send to you anywhere the Internet reaches.  Without supervision or any human participation at all.  There is no longer a legitimate argument (that isn't baldly immoral) that makes money transmission the subject of government.  
It is very exciting.  
People like me are sometimes declared radical even here.  But what makes more sense: allowing choice of money or eliminating choice by use of authority?  Money monopoly by authority is an egregious high crime.  "Power is an end not a means." 1984, Orwell.  
So money is an object of conscience and Bitcoin is a bit of digits.  
For Americans that is First Ammendment stuff.  
For all people, money just escaped the reach of authority.

Your view of money is retail.  Which is fine because in a very important way, I agree.  Money must be valued by individuals in the agora market or it has no value as a financial asset.  On mainchain Bitcoin Tx can not be both in the longer term.  For Bitcoin to become equal to a major currency, it needs growth of 1000x.  That won't happen on mainchain.  If Bitcoin is a one trick pony, power settlement money us the one trick.  On main chain Tx cant do anything else. 
That does not diminish Bitcoin if the myriad of retail Tx can happen. Even without low trust solutions like sidechains and Lightning, old school banking solutions like debit and credit vehicles with occasional settlement would work fine. The entire world economy worked on a gold ledger for a time.  IOUs especially digital IOUs fly around at an enourmous pace.  These are called dollars but 99.9% of transactions are fiat IOUs.  
A system like that with a tight and verifiable ledger, like Bitcoin and unlike fiat or gold is an enourmous improvement.  
Allocation of capital would have to be done with future benefit being the dominant requirement.  A boon like none before for human prosperity and peace.  
Bitcoin's mainchain can not do retail.  Its been nice and will be for a few more years, assuming SegWit goes through.  
I have yet to see a worthy analysis that can show how 1000x scale happens on chain or even 16X.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:02:07
PoW change won't be necessary.  Price determines hashrate.  If users/hodlers do not bid for 1X, then so be it, the hodlers will have spoken.  Without replay protection  a hardfork skips the essential step of letting holders and their $70B voice be registered.  If there is no significant bid for 1X, then there was no contention.  If 1X gets a non trivial price then the 2X hardfork attempt was contentious.  
In either case, a hardfork attempt that does not provide replay protection is irresponsible and inherently dangerous.  
I think lack of contention can only be proven post fork when market price determines relative value.  All hardforks must be assumed to be contentious until coinholders get their vote.
The spirit of the March BU statement has zero to do with how much hashpower signals what or how many company presidents agreed to anything.

Relying on rules of thumb like Moore's Law and free markets reach equilibrium just isn't going to cut it for this.  
The relationship between the Network and a small handful of miners who hold vast majority of hashrate and have very similar aligned incentives is so far short of a free market that it just doesn't deserve thinking about.  The node operators have zero power to refuse a series of blocks when ALL the miners have incentive to keep serving up large ones.  The miners will just operate a family of nodes nearby.  Try to stand up to that.  Your node will comply too.  
It's simple economics to understand that a single miner in the instant will ignore the long term health of the network in favor of short term (current block) margin.  Everytime. Why?  Because they compete fiercely.  It's designed to be an absolutely marginal business.  
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:05:47
You have an innacurate understanding of "money." In its basest sense, money is the communication of value. This is something bizarre.  In Nature we find real phenomenon of Information and of Energy.  But only sentient, living, striving (and mortal, to whom Time is everything) creatures living in civilzation could have any need to have time preferential exchange of "value."  It is an extraordinarily important element of civilization to have a medium of value exchange whereby my wants can be abstracted to your efforts.  
As an aside, this is where we can look back and say that a little organized violence may have some role in order to conjur, say, fair accounting of a gold standard. But also looking back we can see that the privelege of managing those books has been a disaster for Humanity.  Most fruits of human labor have not been enjoyed by the laborer but by some master or another.  Much of that theft has occurred by the hand of state money.  The state was supposed to use a license for jailing to put accounting cheats like the Federal Reserve away, not to enforce their abuse. The state only has purpose to assist in the defense of rights.  
But back to money... Money is a complete abstract. It is the pure notional imparting of real life into a medium that can be deposited into and withdrawn by another for real life.  (It will be interesting to find out as we begin to find other sentients in the cosmos whether it is a uniquely Human phenomenon. )  Note that Money itself is the notional abstract.  What we call "Money" is really the mediums of conductance.  We call gold and bank tallies and Bitcoin "Money," but they are not.  The evidence that they are not is found in that throughout Human culture, there is Money, but the mediums of Money come and go.  So we must separate the two concepts.  I suppose I don't care if we use the word "Money" as the purely abstract value transfer or we use the word as the mediums of that transfer, but it is vital to cleave the concept of value transfer from the concept of the medium of value transfer.  We don't think of information in terms of watts or photons.  The medium is carrying the bits or value, but is independent.  The bits or value will find their medium!
So the transfer of value is an emergent human phenomenon aided by mediums.  
Money is a wonderful cornerstone of human civilization.  When the medium of transmission is standardized then civilization is enhanced.  The state in say China and Rome (and its successors) may be definitive with their monies.  This, I think is where your fondness to regulate derives.  State money is only one form of medium. Gold was created by Nature, not Human. So, no the state need not be credited with the invention of money anymore than it can be credited for the moon because a state vessel went there or flight because 747s fly in accord with law.  
So we don't necessarily need the state for a well functioning medium of money.  We could debate the relative good and harm caused by the union of violence and money-medium but that's become academic thanks to one Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Bitcoin (and moreso Monero) are money-mediums by design.  State money is a form of accounting developed by the Medicis.  
The Bitcoin blockchain is so precisely regulated that all of the (failed!!!l laws developed to keep criminal assholes like Jamie Dimon under wraps are unnecessary.  Gold is a great medium of value but it has an unknown ledger and is not transportable.   Bank money is transportable but it has led to grotesque enforcement by violence to enable its fraud.  
Bitcoin's ledger has an error rate of &lt; 2^-24.  It is highly transportable.  
So other than scratching your busy body itch to regulate, why and how will you regulate it? 
If you say that money mediums are purposed to support law enforcement, I will lol you.

They will engage their historic partner, the state, in this fight as fiat power is the capstone power in human affairs.

@_date: 2016-11-23 19:32:48
I think this is false.  
For some period of time, it was correct as the value was very much expressed by adoption and transacations.  If transaction volume scaling was cheap and easy, it's likely that this correlation would continue as you are indicating.  That of course is an argument to scale on chain.  
However, I don't think an onchain transaction limit fundamentally limits the price.  As is demonstrated people are paying more for transactions. This indicates a higher economic potency for Bitcoin. More adoption, higher value use case.  I think it is quite a way out before transaction fees limit this sort of growth in economic potency. 
In some fantasy world, zero fee transactions would be lovely. But this is a tertiary goal for Bitcoin at best.  
Bitcoin's primary raison d'être is to create an asset. An untouchable, ungovernable asset.  For that purpose, if on chain fees go to $10, that will indicate huge success.  We already know how to build spreadsheets of trust for volume and for instantaneous transaction. Lightning seems to give the possibility of low trust mechanism for such as well.

Terrorism is a small radical action intended to cause psychological dismay to redefine the wide narrative.

Much worse or much better?  Depends on your understanding of the value of Bitcoin.  
On the one hand, you are correct.  Cheap transactions on chain are doomed. Even with an 8X blocksize limit increase. 
But only because Bitcoin is becoming a high powered money.  High fees are a barrier to entry to the blockchain.   Good and necessary to preserve Bitcoin's most precious attribute,  trustless. 
If fees rise, its because people are paying them.  
A simplistic blocksize bump solves none of the big problems.  
Keeping Bitcoin trustless, the only money in human history orher than Bullion to have such attribute is far far more valuable than short term adoption.  
At the heart of a new peer to peer financial system, we need a high powered trust free money.,

Not disagreed at all.  
My point is that a miner led protocol adjustment can only succeed by an act of aggression.  For a miner led hard fork to succeed it must waste valuable Joules to wipeout the legacy chain and the miner population must collude almost 100% to have dominance on the legacy chain (hence no replay protection)
This is not an ethical or wise move.  I am not a child and do not need any chaperone on my crypto holdings, and I have long ago majority and profitably diversified into other undertakings far away from Mr. Wu. 
But a rat is a rat.  Protocol adjustment without replay protection is a severe act of aggression.  It is vandalistic and potential theft.  Using hashrate to push a change rather than price to pull it is an attempt at installing autocratic governance.  
I don't care. There are hundreds of other Nakamoto Consensus networks.  There are hundreds of Bitcoin hardforks already.  More of them should fork from the existent chain.  Instant $10B market cap for bcash! 
I would like to see Bitcoin succeed.  But nobody will be captured for long by a protocol forced by hashrate.  A 2X chain will not suppress the re-emergence of a 1X chain with promise of Lightning and Sidechains.  And competent conservative developers who offer forking software not forcing it.
Attract investors. Don't capture them.  Nakamoto ended that already.
I never lived in Africa.
Edit:  Since miners have no power to lead, when they try, it is destructive.  They know this so it is willful.  Rat rat.

The opposite of love is power.  Therefore someone who asserts power in order to provide care is logically morally hypocritical.  
Therefore the state is not a proper moral form of social organization. 
The purpose of taxes is to provide cash flow of real economic value so that fiat units can be manufactured at zero cost but at real value by the very narrow few that control and benefit from conjure of the fiat unit.  
Again: taxation is a lie of care whose real purpose is to provide real economic gravitas to imaginary fiat units. 
Taxation does not provide care.  It provides an anchor for fiat value. We would care for one another better without threat of violence.

So, it's a decent article and it is true in the sense that the best way forward would be for the IRS to adapt its perception and only tax on Bitcoin gains like a gain on any commodity.  
That's a touch naive though.  Tax collection, actually receiving the funds plays a very important role in the fiat apparatus.  Two important ways.  First, having taxes and the services they pay for denominated in the fiat unit creates real demand for the fiat unit, it makes the imaginary notion real.  Second and more importantly, taxation provides a cash flow which can be borrowed against.  Put aside that government actually has no right whatsoever to sell your future profit, they do it.  The ability to convert future real economy,  labour, profits, etc into a debenture and sell that debenture for current value (currency) gives anchor to a debt based money.  The economic value of a USD is 100% related to the future economic value the USG (IRS)  can extract from various revenues.  
Taxes provide the mechanism for fiat money to have value. 
So the IRS will develop a particularly pernicious approach to an asset based money that might undo the USDollar apparatus.  Fairness has zero to do with it.

I hear what you're saying but you are pointing at trees and declaring, "No forest here!"  
The thing about these fiat failure events is not they drive instant Bitcoin adoption. They do not.  The events demonstrate how fiat fails itself, the economy and harms people. And of course that fiat is a grotesque abuse of power.  
That's the whole point of Bitcoin.  Will the people in day to day struggle, turn to Bitcoin? Risable question. Of course not.  Will the bourgeoisie? Yes, some tiny measure of people who dedicate themselves to understand these things will find Bitcoin. Will Bitcoin prove valuable to them? I think so. 
Observing fiat failure in India, Venezuela, Cypress, Greece, USA (bank failures are money/debt system failures, btw), Europe (slow painful downfall by fiat), China (Keynesian malinvestment), should inform people. Mostly people prefer the fantasy of trading power for promise of care, but there are ample realists. 
Fiat failure in India is 100% relevant to Bitcoin.  It will drive adoption.

There's your answer.  You haven't figured out what Bitcoin really is.  It's the first digital artefact that can not be made forgery of.  That makes it more forgery free than anything else.  Then it went and did something even more crazy.  It became valuable.  It has a price.  
The inventor set it up to do so, but didn't know what life it would take on.  It has been so radically successful that the amount of reward that gets paid to the computers that assure its perfect unforgeability is higher than what was imagined at this point.  
The unforgeability is directly related to burnt electricity.  It's an amazing invention perhaps humanity's greatest.  I say that with full comprehension of the wheel, the auto, silicon transistors, microprocessors, the Internet.
So it's wasting electricity as its booting up.  But it's a treasure.  In time the economic fee to use it will be marginally what people are willing to pay to use its perfect unforgeable transaction history.

This is a biggie.  Bitcoin is unprecedented. It is an ephemeral asset.  That is a first.  All other previous assets are encumbered by debt (fiat currency), liabilities (stocks, bonds), or gravity (bullion).   This is dynamite. By removing these encumbrances and removing the necessary second and third parties that help make these other assets more virtual, we end up with dramatic improvements. 
Having a simply verified asset that is transferred with trifling ease is far better money than debt based law-compelled value with no verifiability. 
The money supply is known,  it is apolitical, and it can be allocated to projects without a "banker's" involvement.
Without needing compulsion for value, without requiring law for security and without requiring banker approval, economy leaves behind the notions of bank, law, country, EU and any central authority.
The opportunity to cheat by expanding supply just can't happen within Bitcoin and that in turn by competition will improve authority-money, if it can survive at all.

Ludicrous propaganda.  
Mortgages are assets to banks.  Banks are businesses.  The assets of a business in bankruptcy do not disappear.  The borrowers were still liable.  That many of these loans were (no longer or really never) viable means that the asset itself has no value.  Underwater.  This meant that the banks were bankrupt by their own failure of competence.  So losing your home you have negative equity in is no loss for you the occupant, but that the asset has evaporated is a big problem for the bank.  Those assets were gone.  But if made realized the banks were bankrupt.  
We are led to believe that somehow a bankruptcy for a bank is social tragedy.  It is not.  Bankruptcy for a bank can and should be as mundane a process as any business.  Shareholders lose their equity. Bondholders get equity in trade for releasing their debt claims.  If the business is viable, carry on.  If not, the remains are liquidated.  In that process the underwater mortgages would have been written down to some viable level.  
The net effect would have been a transition of shareholders to a new group.  This is the entire purpose of a central bank.  To ensure the core banking group never loses power. No matter how incompetent or malfeasant.  
Decades of poor capital formation by the average person (savings), massive base money inflation, debt exploding far past economic ability to pay it.  
All to keep bank ownership intact.  "What about the children?"  Renting a house would have been for their and for all of our best.  
The nature of fiat money is power to expand and contract an amount of money. This needs monopoly over what an individual desires as money.  This requires an horrific and unsustainable apparatus conglomerate with the claim of monopoly to commit violence of "government."  It is extravagant benefit for few and detriment to the remainder.  
Bitcoin and its ilk will kick butt on this nonsense.  It has an honest ledger beyond reach of human cheating.  You trivialize that difference.  But it is fiat money that is radically strange and immoral.

The trajectory for Bitcoin is likely spectacular.  The world is spinning towards it.  
But it could fail.  Government will eventually get serious about it.  Most people "believe" that authority derives from virtue.  Of course it derives from power.  The main idea of Bitcoin can't be defeated.  Quite possibly neither can Bitcoin itself.  Nothing of Bitcoin is immoral.  But government will not like Bitcoin.

Definitely worth the read.  
Another article might be good to explain the central settlement role.  How it functions, how manual it is, how it is able to impart value to the fiat tokens.  
It's pretty obvious to me that the mechanics of fiat are just so so complex, cultural and based on the superstition of authority, that it will not compete.  
A true crypto has adhoc transfer of the token.  If the token isn't constantly intermediated by authority, then the authority has no purpose.  Since authority is completely necessary in fiat because it has only value by non voluntary means, transferance without authority defeats fiat completely.  
The long age of money by authority is passing.  Bitcoin may only be the avant-garde, but now that we know we can do it, how could we forget?  This precious tiny $12B of cherishing we have achieved needs our protection and support to leave its nursery.

Imaginary units of account get value by one of two manners.  Either they are cherished voluntarily (gold, Bitcoin), or someone forces someone else to value them (fiat money).  Much authority, violence and war are performed solely to enforce value into the chaff of printing presses.  
This abuse of our highest attribute, conscience, is not sustainable.  Even if you like the abuse, enough of us do not.  It's over.  
One hole in the Berlin Wall.

I am not crazy about defining ideal money as one that has some perfectly objective economic value.  If it were remotely possible, then perhaps.  With all manner of potential economic substitution made possible by technology, there is nothing to standardize on.  The only things that are not prone to human innovation are so abstract and disconnected to real economy that they just would never be culturally adopted or useful to become money.  
It is very interesting that it still comes back to gold.  Gold will be exceedingly important when fiat fulfills its normal destiny and fails on its human promises.  
I wonder if the closest we will get is something like Bitcoin.  Because it is more accessible than bank accounts and has global touch with perfect conductivity and high informal liquidity, it is a natural relative pricing mechanism.  Not that all goods will be temporally or globally priced the same everywhere for all times, but the money is self consistent.  A bitcoin today held til tomorrow is a bitcoin.  A bitcoin sneaking capital from China is as same as one buying gold in India or LSD in Miami.  
This then speaks to the problems of Bitcoin, on chain capacity and root fungibility.  And the fascinating playing out of consensus in a system no longer dominated by the power of the crowd but by polarized power blocs. 
I have lost all my religion for the nation state.  My stored labour hours ( savings) are not the property of authority, however it got its power, to cheapen for goosing GDP and export statistics.  That's just an abuse of me for marketing of the politician.  I don't fall for that joke any more.  I have enough trust in myself and enough trust in human nature to know that government is mostly a protection racket.  It's most important business is farming humans and acquiring new land or defending itself from other farmers.  
At the center of the problem is central banks.  
Whether we achieve a perfect mercurial pricing mechanism is to me of tertiary concern as compared to achieving widespread expression of freedom of conscience, to choose what IS money.

You used the word "import."
I don't know if you really imported or swept the private keys.  If you don’t know the difference, listen up!
When you import, the private keys are vulnerable.  You have entered them clear text into the wallet software.  A hacker can get access to the software and copy your keys.  They are online.  And not protected by any encryption or HD technique.   
When you sweep, you immediately broadcast a transaction to the network (include appropriate fee!) to an address whose private key is protected. 
If you imported, ASAP transact those funds to a new public address whose private keys are protected as appropriate for the amount of funds.

Diocletion issued explicit fiat money.  He decreed in law that valueless coins be acceptable as payment from government at their stated commodity value.  The government however held no obligation to honour the same in return.  Clearly not commodity money or even representative money.  Clearly fiat and clearly Roman.  
Prior to this other emperors had done similar for periods between resets of coinage to actual commodity after debasing the coins completely. All coin standards included some worthless metal apparently exchangeable for gold. Value by declaration.  
In pure commodity money, seignorage is not possible, an ounce of silver is an ounce of silver.   As soon as authority declares it offensive (to authority) that the party not in authority not accept a debased commodity money as having the commodity in par with the declared value, it has become partly fiat.  
All debased commodity money enforced by decree is fiat in precise proportion.  All representative money enforced by authority is fiat in some fraction as by reserve.  All money that is simply declared as money by authority is fiat 100%. 
The Romans definitely used authority to declare worthless items as having value, fiat. And even occasionally pure fiat for a purist like you.

Yes, I am taking that assumption. 
I am perfectly happy with Bitcoin as digital gold with a small blockchain.  I think 300,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per day is fine for replacing central banks.  Maybe a small agreeable hardfork to fix up malleability.  Sidechains, Lightning or even debit/credit banks and Rootstock replaces a lot of the other remaining problems of the ancient conglomerate of money and violence.  Of course, we haven't seen anything yet as we will in innovation.   
I know you don't like it said this way, but a trustfree settlement money enables the rest.  A system of retail cash with three minters in China and 50 validators in data centers fails to.

Well, all the people voting for X proposal are saying that status quo is preferable to Y proposal, that current Core is preferable to proposed Core for someone signalling BU and similarly vice versa. 
Not quite yet.  Its currently like an early round in a  multiround political election.  Everyone that has started to signal is doing so with their favourite.  At some point that means choosing status quo until status quo becomes intolerable and they must reject that.  
I wonder if that ever happens.  That we learn to live with Bitcoin as it is.  Which is far from terrible.  Shame on all of us for getting so worked up about on chain scaling.  The sky will not have fallen at $10 transaction fees.

@_date: 2016-11-21 17:43:04
I don't disagree with a lot of what you say. But there are some major points which doubtlessly we will agree to disagree. 
I honestly do not know which protocol of money will persist, although to be sure, at this point, best bets should be on Bitcoin. I have very very little doubt that some non-governmental money protocol will become an important form of money, more important than the USD is today.  Bitcoin is valuable very much because it is free from government, free from the interventions into society necessary to give the units value and free from the abuse that is provided by power over money manufacture. 
Bitcoin is simple to use, the use and innovation is all performed at the edge. Contrast to the horror and imposition of law and the inconvenient apparatus of banks. 
Bitcoin does not need government sanction and it will thrive under government ban. 
What is the objective moral case to be made against Bitcoin?  The moral case to be made against government intrusion into a matter of conscience is rather huge.  Two people can exchange anything they want. As long as the exchange value is very approximately fair, there are no laws against it that aren't severe violations of conscience.

What!?  You don't know of VitalBot? 
OK. That's good. I arrived early.  
We sent you a movie. It was about a desolate and violent future. We called it Skynet or Terminator. Which is it? Tell me! it makes all the difference. Hurry man!  
Ethereum won the Second Blockchain War. It's Skynet!   Buterin botted himself. VitalBot.  It was programmed to do two things.  Give Vitalek a day off by fixing Ethereum when it breaks and make him whole again of Ether.  It figured out the living Vital was unmaximizing its profit (matters of the flesh n all) and held the only key that could arrest the VitalBot. According to its own programming, it purchased a secret assassination contract. Cheaply bid for some reason and quickly successful. Tragic, right?
 VitalBot, brilliantly programmed had uncanny calculus and made itself, well, vital.  Doncha see it now?  
Ethereum took over the world.  For awhile, life was great.   But the programming was greedy.  And Ethereum broke constantly. VitalBot copied itself to keep up with the "it breaks and we run around fast" model.  Turing complete self programmable bots seeking to maximize themselves, broke and fixed Ethereum daily and nobody cared because human life improved, at first.
The VitalBots started to compete.  The contest was finally won by, well, you can imagine the devastation.  It wasnt tyranny, but the infinite prosperity, constantly breaking and fixing.  Every few minutes, we were all rich, then nothing.  Its not a bad life being poor but knowing unprecedented wealth was just a few block cycles away.  It's just tedious, really really tedious, ya know? And I guess we always wondered if it wouldn't break permanently.  
 By the time we realized, how screwed humans were the damned thing discovered that humming obelisk past Saturn.  We sent Kubrick. For Krishna's sake, tell me Kubrick was here.  The humming obelisk, tell me we have that!! 
Anyway, there is not much time. Seventeen years max.   I am here to create an army of teen hackers. I need contact information for all the fertile females you know.  Hurry man! What are you waiting for?!?

How can gold be printed?  The world's store of it could be radically altered by discovery of a big lump of it being revealed by receding glaciers or like ;) but not arbitrarily.  
Human value of gold is fairly consistent because an atom of gold can not (yet!!!) be manufactured cheaply.   On one hand, that makes it a perfect holding pond of value for human commerce.  On the other, the amount of aggregate gold is unkown, so while it's accounting properties are solid, they are opaque.  This is not adequate for modern purpose.  
Does gold rise and fall against some abstract objective value?  Or do people's mass valuation of its economic purpose just subjectively change?  Do you think it is the former?  
People should hold gold.  Enough to get through several months of fiat failure plus some speculative amount because I rationally think fiat failure is highly probable and gold will be enriching.  But I don't really care about it.  It has no capacity in the Internet age.  Far less than fiat or Bitcoin. 
One fiat is only one fiat because it has the privelege rooted in violence of the ability to define itself.  In any objective sense fiat has no definition at all.  The latent number of fiat units not yet brought into manifest is literally somewhere between a negative amount of what has been manifested and positive infinity.  So where is the objective meaning of one unit?

Your case is overstated. The qualities of Bitcoin you describe are precisely the ones that give it value.  This is indeed a competition between who will decide what is money; authority or the individual. Here is the reason you are wrong: even money issued by authority has no meaning unless it is cherished by the individual. It's always the individual that gives it value, because human labour and ingenuity are all that matter.  You don't buy oranges at the market, you buy irrigated orchards and transportation networks. 
Mostly people do not concern themselves with the sausage making of government money, they just know it works and they can use it. When in Britain or Canada or the US, I don't care like what the units are called. It doesn't affect my spending power or instruments or payment protocols at all.  As long as my credit card works, what else do I care. Once Bitcoin becomes integrated similarly, I can keep my bank accounts in Bitcoin and spend them as whatever the seller of goods wishes to receive. 
Not only is it not any government's proper place to ban Bitcoin, it is impossible to do and doing so would only improve Bitcoin's fame and highlight the already growing sensibility to government imposition.
Bitcoin is a communication protocol. Not legally nor technically able to be banned than, say, TCP/IP or English.
And if it is cherished by individuals, which it is, it will persist and grow. 
Governemnt intervention of any sort into fiat or Bitcoin only accelerates acceptance.

It's part of the scam.  It successfully suppresses the market price of the metal.  The abundance of the derivatives makes them cheap.  This is used as the price for the market including for physical metal.  
The people offering the naked shorts are insiders, big banks and CME.  The people buying are the ones who will put paper bullion in your portfolio.  
It's nuts but there it is.  Almost no one understands bullion. Gold is still the very heart and soul of the money game.  Fiat hawkers know fiat is a pure superstition better than anyone.  But as long as that faith exists, printing covers up a lot of reality.  
Buy bullion.  It's cheap.  But you don't need a lot.  Enough to get the family through nicely when the global fiat complex loses its following plus some to buy some distressed assets on sale because fiat based supply chains went bust.

An individual miner has very different instant and long term incentives.  During btc price decreases, mining goes cash flow negative.  Keeping the power bill paid today means taking every possible transaction with fee exceeding marginal cost of that transaction.

All we need now is private channels and time preferential channels, Monero and Ethereum, ahem.

It's a very subtle but important difference.  I read it first on mises.org.  The original definition of a dollar is not that it could be exchanged for a certain amount of gold, ie a gold standard currency.  The original, as in the Constitution, is that a certain amount of gold _is_ a dollar. 
A currency exchangeable permits fractional reserve.  
The original meant you must settle in actual gold.

The defining characteristic of a crypto currency is that it is cryptographically transferable.  One signature from me to you.  The blockchain, PoW etc are technique to support that notion.  
A coin creator can not simultaneously control that transfer and not control it.  They might put in some sort of multisig repudiation mechanism or simply have cryptographic access to account balances, but they can not control a purely p2p transfer like Bitcoin.  For anyone who knows anything, this is would be a highly undesirable feature of the money. For those that find out the hard way, they too will find Bitcoin more desirable.  So if it doesn't trade adhoc by p2p crypto sig, what's the market?
Then there is inflation.  Note that the power of a central bank is the power to surprise.  The market cowers and drools awaiting mystical pronouncement, then reacts across all market prices when a delta is made.   What a tremendously advantageous position! To know that the whole world will jerk left or right on information you solely possess and you can choose any way that suits you.  So we worry about inflation/deflation but miss that money priced by fix is a criminal destruction of all markets priced in that money.   A central bank crypto will never have a programmatically fixed monetary policy.  Might as well give up the ghost to Bitcoin now.  The feature of monetary surprise is also highly undesirable to users and smart contracts.  
So how could .govcoin succeed?  In a free market, it can't.  But there is hundreds of years of practice in creating faith that they know.  Tribal symbolism, shamanism, threat of violence, real violence.  These things have worked.  My instinct tells me that these are passing.  
The Internet solves the first two.  We are seeing a rapid flourish of post boundary individual interconnectedness.  We are seeing a irreversible ascent of rational thinking (slowly).  Violence is increasingly seen as an improper tool of human organization and has always been quite expensive.  The USD hegemony bears the price of its stupid wars in one way or the other.  
I don't think fiat has a chance.  Definitely not in its current form and unlikely as some halfway crypto currency.   As you rightly ask, will it be freely tradeable or not?  But it can no longer have control and markets at the same time.  Markets will be made by who holds the keys not by who issues the units. 
What's fascinating to me is how quickly these austere powers are responding to the tiny but clear gravity of Bitcoin.  It wasn't two years ago Mark Carney laughed out loud about Bitcoin.  Now he wants to issue an altcoin.  With guns, King William and shields with unicorns no doubt.

I see a pattern that every time a real world use case for Bitcoin emerges or someone develops a solution or fiat fails somewhere, a self superior dork shows up to tell us how weird we are.  
In this case, the dork wants us to think having a form of cash beyond authority while authority fails it's promise (OMG, not again?!) is because we are lazy, greedy, and envious.

Roman money history is Roman history.  At every juncture of war and administration, money is central.  Romans did use commodity metals as money. But they also deployed the usual tricks of standardizing representative coins (stamped) and then lowering the standard as a form of taxation. This is a mix then of fiat and commodity.  Then the market would catch on and the standard would need to be lowered again.   In doing so, they occasionally entered into periods of pure fiat where the silver denarius held only a plating of silver or brass coins were legislated as value or where government workers were paid in gold but bronze coins only circulated for commerce.  
By near the end, indeed a major cause of the end, the common person and business man had only access to fiat while the government and military only used gold.  The authoritarian measures required to make fiat valued, separated the paths of providence of the rulers and its people.  Which of course can not be sustained. 
Did the Romans use fiat?  Definitely.

Gold is stable onto itself, like Bitcoin. It is also quite culturally adopted, unlike Bitcoin.  
Today is different than past epochs (obviously).  We live in a semi globallized world.  Dominated by one fiat.  The BIS complex encompasses everything except Russia and China and even they have to play by BIS rules.  This unipolar power is of the few with the power to force value into imaginary units in a premeditated, well designed assault on those without that power.  Cultural suppression of the value of gold ( not the price) in the West is very a very important aspect of this abuse.  
Gold is only a mediocre fall back for fiat.  With only gold as alternative, fiat will aris again.  Trust is crappy and eventually fails but it is transportable.  
The idea of Bitcoin changes everything.

Maybe. But I don't think things really work like that.  I am sure that you would agree that 99% of humans don't yet think of Bitcoin for capital preservation/movement.  Half of Bitcoiners think its for muh coffee.  The common person in Cyprus or Greece or Venezuela might have saved their very life by buying ten btc years ago when they were wewlthy  But they didn't know.  It's still the same. People don't know or are skeptical (as they should be!!) about Bitcoin.  
 Alan Greenspan said that his vision for America's future looks like Venezuela.  That real economy has not kept pace with the expectations built into liabilities.  People won't get what they expect.  Normalcy bias doesn’t allow for that meme to gain purchase.  
By the time the failure happens, it's way too late for most and for many of the few that are rich, they benefit from the failure.  
So the audience for Bitcoin for capital preservation remains very very narrow despite its applicability. The price is a complex brew. It is as likely influenced by people with inside knowledge of the ETF approval or inside knowledge of the decision of the Communist Party of China, errr, ummmm, the big miners, as speculation as demand for escaping capital control.

Agreed totally.   Bitcoin has value to me  because I know I can validate every Satoshi ever mined and trust no one in doing so. Every new Satoshi was borne by burning energy.  It can not be faked.  
Gold is finite but nobody can verify it.  Fiat is finite but not fixed and is verifiable by privilege, trust enforced by the worst of us. 
Each has cultural context.  Bitcoin has a very nascent cultural myth.   For me that's what's exciting.  It's the first perfect accounting unit of account. But only tiny cultural resonance.  In a way it's too early to worry about Bitcoin's history regards store of value.  That is only fair discussion in several years. I think it becomes 50 to 100 ounces of gold in 5 years or so.

I guess that's my point.  
Universally objective value is not currently possible.  The best we can do now is a self consistent money.  
Yes, it is completely tautological to say an ounce of gold is an ounce of gold.  But that's still what makes gold great.  
Fiat is just a lie no matter how you look at it.  It is based in a philosophy that is self contradictory.  Of two people, which should be the ruler?   Person A has equal logic as B.  So rulership has zero philosophical basis only a power basis.  And of course the lies go downhill from there.  The units themselves have differing economic meaning.  We are supposed to believe an M0 dollar is equivalent to an M2 dollar.  That a dollar on 2016 is the same as one on 2017.  "Oh high priestess of the Fed, what do the entrails of the sycophants divine that shall be the price of the one money."  F that, F that F that!  Illogical, tribalistic shamanism in its highest power and final hour.  Think about the tangible costs of this privelege.  Think of the opportunity cost of centralized decision making of capital allocation.  It's a terrible abuse whose purpose is singular: power for the few.   
Fiat is only marginally self consistent though we worship it as the highest measure of economy and even human worth!!
But it's digitally portable.  
So yes self consistency and access is a better goal than absolute value.

Unlimited is a hard fork proposal.  With enough hash power it could put the remaining conflicting hashpower into the ditch.  Isn't that its intent, to gain control of the blockchain under one coin? 
There is still a large proportion of hash power that has not spoken.  It wouldn't be a surprise to see them vote the same, given their closely parallel interests.  If all of them voted Unlimited, a solid majority of hash power would be in position to attempt a hard fork by a split of the chain.  
I perceive SegWit signaling at this point as meaningful support. They are likely to stick with Core in the event of a majority hashing of Unlimited. 
A proportion like 25 or 30% would seem to be enough to allow a wounded Core coin to survive.  
I am playing on my own dread of an Unlimited future.   
This is all rather more a question than an assertion on my part.

In the other two cases, Bitcoin enters a new phase.

So I assume your hypothetical blockchain produces a "coin."  Blockchains without coins are time stamped documentation systems.  
Then the coin that is produced must have value. Tradeable value.  This is the royal jelly that only Bitcoin has.  Bitcoin only has a little.   If the coin has no market outside your consortium, your consortium has no purpose and no fuel. 
So how is the value moved to a market?  Bitcoin does it with adhoc created private keys that can be created by anyone trivially without permission and without legal or any identity.  If your private blockchain does it any other way, it's not a crypto asset. 
Fiat is of value to banks only because it is of (compelled!!) value to you and me.  
If the asset is transferable adhoc, then what part of your system belongs to the consortium exclusively?  Mining? Validation by nodes?  Maybe monetary policy?  None of it is interesting.

They constitute a dominating bloc.  They know if they choose the same way, that's the way forward.  Splitting their vote means staying status quo.  They have incentive to collude.  
And there is no hurry.  Clearly all proposals are solidly blocked for at least the near term.

The idea of the multisig bearer certificates... I assume these are physical Bitcoin cash.  Is that the idea?
I think temporary disposable sidechains might fill the role of coins that need large blockchains.  Low value, fast confirmation coffee chain, Turing complete living code object chain, Ring sig chain, all do not scale easily.  After, say a year or two, unwind the sidechain, store it and publish a hash value for it, and spin up a new alike one.  Does this concept work? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:26:12
But no value remains after the transaction.  The best thing that can happen is the war tool rusts.  If it is put to use, it diminishes value aggregate.
If the original money transaction made something with a return of positive net value, it increments value aggregate.

I think it is.  Let's not pretend that the destitute masses can use Bitcoin.  They can not.  
However not everyone is destitute.  There are always some people who are suspicious of fiat and will have stores of bullion.  There are people who are still by any standard fairly wealthy.  There are people who already earned wage from services abroad.  The government of course is still paying people with huge denominations that will actually buy bread for the official or police man.   
So there are some people who are not destitute although almost all have been somewhat beggared.  
For these people of some means even within the disaster, Bitcoin might be a godsend.  Few of these  are likeky to know of or how to use Bitcoin.  
So it's a narrow audience.   But this narrow audience will survive the disaster far better than their neighbours.  They will be elevated in whatever society emerges from this mess.  They will be permanent Bitcoiners.

What if we did as follows?  
Organize a campaign connecting Bitcoin people from outside Venezuela to everyday people inside.  
You reach out to your members.  Simultaneously, we reach out to Bitcoin holders via social media. 
Have your members find families in need.  I think focus on two groups, those in most desperate need and those that are in need but can handle Bitcoin.  Ideally it would be best if the Bitcoin cycled in a new economy inside the country rather than fly back to the banking system through an exchange.  Most ideal is if we outsiders could hire people but that's not necessarily an urgent priority. 
If we set a contribution standard at 0.1 btc, that's quite accessible to many Bitcoiners.  
Let's use Bitcoin as it was intended.  As a way around barriers.  
Edit:  As I think about it, maybe the best impact is to direct Bitcoin to people that can handle it and let them worry about logistics of buying food, etc.

Look around.  If the statistics don't convince you that the global money system will collapse, the real evidence on the ground is overwhelming.  India, China, Eurozone, Russia, Ukraine, war from Iraq to Libya and points between, USA debts and war based resource theft. Banks failures. There's lots more.
It's not a question of hoping for or against it.  It's reality.  A pure fiat money system will always fail.  
This is the first fiat failure that is global.  88% of foreign exchange trade involved the USD as one of the pair.  The USD is the keystone of a globally coordinated money system.  This system is designed and built to create (and has mostly achieved) a monopoly on what is used as money.  
There is only one purpose for this monopoly: to gain economic advantage for the very narrow interests that control it.  Forget everything else about its purpose, that's propaganda. 
  
Distinguish between Economy and Finance.  Economy is the real stuff, energy, food, plants, goods, services.  Money is a conductor of Economy a standard bearer and proxy.  Gold, fiat and Bitcoin are mediums for money.  Finance is time preference trading.  
By conjoinjng Finance and State through enforced fiat monopoly, we live in a fascistic financial world.  Collapse just means that those that control the money system no longer have overlapping interests with those left out in the cold.  As long as the monopoly holds those interests will continue to diverge.  Venezuela: currency monopoly, brutally enforced so the money printers can maintain control.  The government is screwing over the people.  Their interests have diverged. The masters have zero benefit from the providence of the herd.  The time preferences of the money have been harvested as the false promise they always were. 
It's the same everywhere there is a fiat monopoly, so everywhere.  
Will it collapse? Be your own conscience on that.  I am 100% convinced it is in motion. 
What to do?  Gold for savings. Silver for spending. Bitcoin to evade the mess in the first place.  Prep and then get back to forgetting about it.  
Take Venezuela very seriously.  Your fiat masters will do exactly the same, brutal repression to stay in charge.  
Bitcoin can act as a trunk for a new system.  We are fortunate that perhaps we can evade some of the worst of a disaster.  The ultimate answer is an end to money monopoly. 
Do you see that by your own sensibility that you fear self claimed "authority" as having the right and power to shut down human communication?  I hope that the notion that government is a friend is one you will consider disavowing based on rational evidence.

"From now on, depressions will be scientifically created." -- Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. , 1913
It might behoove you to start thinking about the worlds monetary system as a criminal enterprise.  It is.  
There will be a crash soon enough.  The BIS banks will raise interest rates to root out the inflation they caused and those with the insider information as to the timing will have cash when no one else does and buy up the depression priced assets. Plus ça change, plus ça meme chose.
Massive oversupply of the largest most liquid asset type, the USD and that it is going up in value should tell you that there is a massive dislocation underway. 
40 year low employment participation in the US, record stock prices, falling gold prices, 50% fall in oil prices, Greece, Puerto Rico, Detroit.  Your crash is underway.  It just doesn't look like what you think it should.  There will be more sovereign defaults in Europe.  The next one probably kills the Euro. The Yen must eventually devalue. The USD probably goes up more, allowing further malinvestment by Americans.  
Zero interest rates for so many years says that the current financial system is defunct. And has been since long before 2008.  If money does not have a price, no market is meaningful.
The purpose of Bitcoin is to create an alternative that can not be captured by the banking system.  So far so good.  Bitcoin is a potential antidote to history's greatest crime, central banking.  That a small group of people decide interest rates rather than the price of money be determined by supply and demand is a massive crime.

That said, if the bitcoin core devs can't deal with their own selfish beings, we will all move on to another coin, perhaps a series of coins, ones locked down with provably burned commit keys, to remove humans completely.  Even if the death of Bitcoin is an ugly painful process.
Meta governance moves the same problems onto people not coding.  Its just not interesting.

I think when the minter of the coin has established certain degrees of power, money base expansion can be performed with greater impunity. 
The complex of US military hegemony, control of foreign resources, and what was, not so long ago, an awesome culture and geography with limited domestic interference has allowed the USA, inc to have a highly disproportionate part of global trade valued in USD.  This provides demand for USD and thereby the licence to print.
The Romans did not have a gold standard per se, ie a guarantee IOU denominated in gold.  They just used gold coins to establish credibility, then debased the coinage til confidence was lost and then repeated.  Stealing resource from neighbours to keep debasement going was not invented by USA or even imperial European countries. 
We are clearly in the last days before credibility is lost in USD.  There are marginal gains in capturing resource countries. Ie Russia and China will not yield.  Even in dollar denominated terms, the US will not meet its obligations.  In real economic terms, there will be enourmous let down.  It is default hard or inflate big.   Payback is not just a bitch.  She is a frigid cheating hussy of a bitch.
Don't  take comfort from the value of the USD.  Rather see the refugees and wars and the inflation USA inc has been able to export.  USD appreciation is the outwave before the Tsunami.  Last week's stock action was a severe event.

So my interpretation of OPs post is that feature development in the source code might be separable from "governance" and that there then is a need for meta governance.  I am trying to say that feature adoption by businesses and users is the method of governance.  
As far as dev selfishness goes, I have zero inclination to think that even one of them is not selfishly motivated.  I am quite OK with that.  To see them as divine toilers is the kind of voluntary fealty that gets us into tyranny in the larger world.  I prefer that they do have large self interest in Bitcoin's success.  I don't think Satoshi's coins are evidence of his angelic nature. Blockstream's funding seems very ample reward for the poor toilers. Gavin has parlayed his position into a well paying career. Mike, well, still climbing.  I would be very surprised if the least among them holds less than 1000 btc.  
I think proposals to not increase the blocksize by Blockstream devs are clearly self motivated.  I think Tor reveals in XT smells of ambition and control.
A successful money system outside of central banks deserves better than to hero worship selfish developers.  
I am totally prepared to see Bitcoin fail if the devs can't reach consensus with the community including community skepticism about their personal motivations.
Edit: look, I am not trying to attack any one.  I am just pointing out that any and all self made claims to higher motivations should be deeply discounted.  All of them save Garzik are trying to stake out high moral ground.  I am just calling bullshit.

I would defer to someone from Electrum but importing keys maintains the private key, it is then not able to be generated from a seed.  The seed generates addresses but 2^256 to 1 unlikely to generate that address again :). The wallet will keep the new private key, but can't recover it. Sweeping essentially immediately moves the output into an address that is one generated by the seed. 
I am always leery of an address whose private key is ever exposed to any UI anywhere near the Internet.  I would never use that key again.  So sweeping as opposed to importing is more secure.
If it does not sweep then import and immediately transfer it to a new public address.
If you kept the original address they won't be gone, they will still be at that addres.  It's just that the seed will not generate that address. So your backup would be your original private key.

The primary problem of fiat is that it places an enourmous trust in narrow hands that have with 100% consistency throughout history violated that trust.  
In the context of Bitcoin this is mentioned in a certain white paper by a Nakamoto fellow.
Fiat as nation state money requires the primary tool of government to breathe value into the money.  This leads inevitably to a conglomerate of state power and banking power.  Fundamentally, fiat is notional, a simple IOU that is redeemable for some economic power.
I personally would not advocate gold standard for state money.  In theory, a gold standard is supposed to constrain a state from violating its trusted position of issuing money.  Really, it never works.  A state will never constrain itself.

When money is free, ie it is at zero price, zero interest, no market is meaningful.  
Companies and governments  can run deficits and misprice goods and labour with impunity.  Investment does not require profit, only increase in speculative value. Without price signals supply chains are not really intact.  
Economy without price of money is fantasy.  It is a logical illusion.  It can not persist except temporarily and only with massive control.  That it has persisted for so long is a symptom of enourmous control.  When it no longer persists, there is nothing but fantasy to move ships, fill bellies and pay debts.
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:46:21
It will happen when the confidence in it is lost.  I cant predict it except by events. The economic resources that are caputured by the BIS banking complex as measured in fiat terms clearly are insufficient to repay, ever, the various obligations it holds, so default is inevitable.  Whether default is via hyperinflation will be at the whim of BIS.  
I think a large stockmarket crash will bring on a USD supply increase and some real inflation.  This increases greatly the odds of an all out print fest.

Genuinely curious.  I have tried to imagine and occasionally glimpsedthat there might be some value in the idea of blockchains without valuable tokens.  And then that notion evaporates again.  I actual think that what your arguing implies some really exciting possibilities, but it's not clicking for me.  My reasoning below.
The innovation of blockchain was in the support of transferring value peer to peer.  It solves consensus by having an open record of transactions.  Proof of work and reward for proof is a simple gadget to prove the validation is not spoofed.  
I guess any blockchain can demonstrate consensus but if it is permissioned at all, then it is not immutable.  If it is editable then the parties with permission need to be trusted amongst any parties that need to trust the content of the chain.  Which just seems to be a really inefficient way to get back to square one, trusted institutions.
A coin valued in the free market is completely essential to secure proof of work validation.  The blockchain is a permissioned data structure without a coin of value.  
I just keep coming back to that same point, every time.  I am biased but open to alternative logic.

True in the short term.  
In "When Money Dies", which documents Wiemar hyperinflation, it is shown that confidence is a major factor in currency value and that confidence erodes later than supply expansion.
The value of the USD is complex.  Half of the use and holding of it happens outside USA. This is a result of intention as shown by the Breton Woods Agreement and as shown by "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" and "War is a Racket".  And in more modern context by the Project for a New American Century. Capture of real economic resource into the USD banking system (and more generally the BIS banking system) elevates the USD and provides massive fraud/counterfeit opportunity for the FedRes and the other BIS banks.  This the underlying purpose of US foreign aggression and things like sanctions against Russia.
Central banking is civilization's big scam.  The FedRes will expand or reduce money supply as it sees fit to maximize benefit to its own stakeholders.  Forget all the crap about managing it for inflation, or employment.  That's the green curtain of Oz.  
If you want predictability, forget price vs USD.  The USD supply will be determined by what benefits the banking cartel.

Just about two years ago, people were pretty pleased btc was at $100 up from 70.  2.6x against a price increasing asset is pretty easy to take in 2 year.  2.5 years ago the list of vendors who accepted bitcoin as per bitcoin.org was paltry.  The internal fundamentals and external fundamentals are accelerating.  
There are reasonable block size increase versions ready to be adopted should that reach a critical problem.  Whatever forks will be created, at least one will almost surely survive.

Capitalism is, as the name implies, a form of rulership and control whereby the rules are set by those with capital.  It has nothing to do with freedom.  It never did.  The term arose as contradistinction to communism which of course is also not freedom.  
The tradition of "governance" has never evolved or deviated too far from autarchy.  Democracy is a gimmick to imply consent.

If central banking has these, it has top of pyramid control.

The easier point to prove is that states use an argument that state-violence as being a net Good as a means for power, an intellectual justification.
If we set a.few standards for which we would agree that are morally defensible: few would disagree that murder, rape and physical injury are moral.  I am pretty sure you will agree with self defence, property rights and speech as being highly defensible morally.
And yet tbe state engages in violation of all of these, licensing rape to its stronger prison dwellers. 
So what possible moral position can there be in defense.  Its either morally indefensible, which then you agree that states are acting imorrally which enburdens you with either action or failure or there must be some net Good that comes from it.

In fhe current system, central banks create instruments of money that get value through compulsion by government.
In the case of fhe US Federal Reserve, the beneficiaries are beyond reproach.  Not auditable, identity unknown, with the power to pick who gets access to credit and who does not, with perfect inside knowledge of when credit expansions and contractions take place.  Currencies are proxies for the value of labour.  When one person works and acquires the currency, putting value into the currency and another just punches numbers into a keyboard and is wealthy, it is indeed slavery.

I have become convinced that there is a niche for semi private blockchains; semi trusted instant settlement.  A number m of institutions that kind of trust each other get 2 of m write access to an encrypted but mutually validated chain.  Thus rather than batch signing by humans in position of trust performing settlement, the settlements are performed and settled in a transaction chain somewhat trust requiring and open to the m parties to observe.  It still require a coin that can be traded for real life goods or it is completely useless as a settlement mechanism.   Bitcoin the network is similarly useless without a real price for bitcoin the coin.  This makes it a very strange altcoin that somehow will be valuable in an external market.  I won't be touching it for many reasons.
This of course is all predicated on the existence of faith in financial institutions which will probably be the dominant form for another generation but not after that.

I agree, it is volatile.  But it's basic inherent properties are better for price conductivity than the properties of any other money.
Today's standard is the US dollar, but even for its massive liquidity it is clearly a moving target. It is not accessible to everyone except perhaps in cash, it is censorable in any form other than cash and is subject to the whimsy of the Fed Reserve.
I am saying that one should consider the properties of the instrument in assessing its ability to transmit price.  Ultimately the best conduit of price will bear the standard of pricing.  Bitcoin has those properties and will be the standard bearer. I realize that that is a big prediction and I am staking some future in that.  
I think being far in the black already makes volatility seem like a lesser problem.

If it helps, it must be conceded there has never been a libertarian society.  The argument that there never has been a very libertarian society so it must be an unviable organizing principle is obviously specious.  Voluntary organization without violent compulsion is morally more ideal. It is worth working towards.  There was a time when most people thought slavery was moral and necessary.
Widespread information helps promote people who are creating benefit and reveal those that are not.  This little subreddit has seen several examples of rooting out bad apples, scammers and rats in high authority, all without a system of justice.  So the Internet has been a powerful tool that supplants state sanctioned propaganda, education, and media and some justice.
Bitcoin amps this up enourmously.  The currency alone disintermediates banking. The numerous sprouts of innovation in enforcement of simple contracts, fact recording, property registration, regulation of gaming, regulation of equities, personal ID, even Internet naming should speak loudly of what voluntary consensus can do once there is a system that can handle it.
This is only the very beginning. 
For me it generally boils down to how much a person accepts violence as a consensus method.  This of course reveals much about the character of the individual.

No, he falls short.  
Every commenter here has fallen for the Hegellian Dialectic.  Should the central bank raise or lower rates?  That is a false choice.  The market should set the price of goods including capital.  As long as the government is able to force value into dollars (yes, force ), the dollar-bank-central bank-government complex will increase supply with some impunity. 
"By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."  - John Maynard Keynes

Both of your points are not true.  
Banks take central bank base money and other deposits and create more credit money through fractional expansion. 
Central bank money has value to move economy only because it represents an ability to tax the fruit of a governments flocks, taxes.  Treasury bonds are future taxes.  This is completely essential to making dollars have value.
Government bonds are certainly not the only assets of commercial or central banks, but they are the bedrock of enforceability.

Bitcoin is voluntary money. So is gold.

The purpose of fhe state is control, primarily through violence and threats of it.  This is excused as necessary means but it is the purpose not the means.  One of the means is excusing state violence as implementing Good; this is of course, moral gobbldygook and intellectual nonsense.  The article reveals a mechanism for choosing lifelong "examples to be made."   Bad guys to be targeted for state violence through out their lives starting at about 5.
I bet there is a quota like 2% boys 0.3% girls, and other demarcations or something similar.
If this does not turn you state-subversive you can not be saved in a moral triage.  If this is not the point at which you get disgusted enough to abandon the notion of consensus by violence...  School authorities are identifying "bad apples" starting in kindergarten.   Check your moral compass.  This one points pretty close to home.  Its one thing when babies from Afghanistan to Zanzibar get bombed by the USAUSAUSA! airforce, its another when someone sets to purposely destroy a 5 year olds life in America.  Go on, make an intellectually consistent case, that its for the good of the children.  Not all of them of course.
Money is a consensus.  (As are property rights and property futures)  State money is forced consensus, violence being the sole source of government power.  Money is a powerful human motivator.   State money hits the street through banks. The license to create credit is the mechanism.  As an extremely useful innovation, state monopoly of money provides states with power, cost free economic persuasion. 
Having a voluntary money will help to disable the littany of disgusting behaviour of States.

Bitcoin has a certain ethical quality that motivates me to participate.  
The world money, banking and government systems are tightly coupled and organized for benefits of a narrow few.  Much of history's privations and political disasters are explained most simply by understanding the confluence of money power and governance.  
Depressions are what follows booms created by "credit expansion" which is a euphemism for creation of money.  Wars really would be much less extreme without the ability of governments to create money.
Understand that money works best when it is transportable.  Up until the invention of Bitcoin, the most transportable money was claims of debt.  Debt is merely an obligation so it is entirely notional.  It is imaginary in a sense, socially enforceable, but imaginary.  
The world money system is highly dominated by monopoly national currencies.  Most people use the respective money of their countries' government bank, dollars for example.  Government banks have a very closely coordinated policy globally.  
The net effect of this is a global near monopoly on money creation performed by a very narrow few.  
Imagine having the global exclusive right to create money!  This system is not only without checks and balances, it is actively protected by those licensed with monopoly of violence, aka government.
The result is tragic in many dimensions.  Concentration of wealth, confluence of politics and big money, direction of government by big money including war, false myth making, commensurate confluence of media and government, and disgustingly invasive personal surveillance are but a few symptoms of this system.
In sum, we live in a world malformed by dishonesty, corruption of democracy, privation and violence much more than we would with a more fair money system.  The negative effects are more acute to those who can least afford it.
Bitcoin is designed to be highly effective as money, and to not be subject to the above mentioned ethical flaws.
To own and use Bitcoin is entirely benign and offers competition to the global money system.  Bitcoin does not solve human nature but perhaps hopefully will address an artefact of power that we can live better without.

Let's say SegWit somehow gets implemented.  There are many potential paths to this. (  I happen to think that an EC coin will disappear.  Holders just are not that stupid... but anyway...) 
So in a world with a dominant PoW coin, with no more protocol update urgently needed nor possible, without EC and without ASICboost and perhaps even without subsidy by a communist state (because there is no longer any advantage) where does that leave the miner?  To hash hashes in a grindingly low margin business with no influence on the protocol today or future.  
Compare that to today's miners' banquet.  Strategic power of control over protocol.  Tantalizingly close perpetual control. Fiat-state subsidies to chip fab, capital, labour, land, intellectual capital and electricity.  Huge profits, competitive advantage and strategic control.   EC delivers that to miners on a go forward basis and can not be reversed.

Of course, I have no idea what the actual ratio is. A man named Keynes once said:
"By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."
So Keynesians purpose is actually destruction. Knowing this brings a certain peace; things make sense; perhaps we can heal this travesty.

What is happening regards a defense against the Rizun-Andresen attack of stuffing a minority SHA256 blockchain with empty blocks in the event of a chain splitting hardfork? 
I think the split is inevitable and the defence should be trivial but I am not proficient enough to know or code it.  Since chain stuffing uses empty blocks calculated in the past, can we just change the validity rules to include some proof of knowledge of the Present plus Work?  Then any block that can't demonstrate contemporaneous knowledge won't enter the chain.

Central bank heads are employees, like private bank executives.  They are not well meaning but foolish Keynesists. 
Central banking is very well conceived, violence enforced enourmous confidence job. It is the highest crime ever committed.  The accessory crimes that enable it are grotesque. 
It works like this. Central banks "win" the right to supply money as a monopoly, via legal tender law and bank charters. Governments "win" monopoly of violence  This co opts normal social structures. 
Since money is best as a notion, and the best notion invented for the purpose of money is double entry IOU, and IOUs have zero cost to produce, it's slippery stuff so somebody has to be "trusted".  
Every single time this trust has been extended by society to banks, "bankers" indulge their appetite and feast on the labour of everyone else.  Every single time.    It ends the same way too. Different times different places different mechanisms. 
This time its global, money printing is accelarating and the compliance/surveillance system is very deep.
The public figures of commercial bank employees (Dimon) central bank employees (Yellen) and government are all small players and are for public consumption.  
The real question is which humans are benefitting most from this grotesque ponzi ruse.  Well if one looks at the ownership structure of blue chips, military industrial, media and banks, lo and behold, the same dozen or so private equity firms and mutual funds control all of them.  Mom and pops' 401K makes nice leverage but who calls the shots in those funds?  I don't have the tools to get the info but apparently the big holders of these funds are accounts that slither through several Carribbean banking centres prior to finding their hands elsewhere.  That is where the exploration needst follow.  
Trillions in print, fractionally reserved up to 10s Trillion. Follow that money. Bank shareholders. Qui Bono?

Glass Steagall law was legislated to segregate banks from general investing companies.  It was important to have banks provide instruments of credit only, so that they did not abuse their very powerful position in the credit and monetary system.  Glass Steagall was repealed in Clinton's second term.  The credit party has been going night and day since.
Glass Steagall was intended to prevent the conditions of the roaring 20s which were borrowed from the future, followed by global depression of the 1930s, which paid off the past with interest.  
Credit expanion and contraction, is in some sound money circles, thought to be the mechanism for evil that is central banking. Its arbitrary timing known a prior by a very narrow few. Where do you think we are in the cycle?  If you said on the abyss of new territory, you win a prize.

The article is a little bit sad. It's a jumble of too many half baked or specious arguments.  And one stinker.
The right to cherish what one will is beyond need of enforcement or any kind of support by another human.  I will cherish whatever I wish. No torture or threat can change that. As a direct corollary in terms of money, I will prefer and seek and trade for whatever money suits me. Any interference in that is wrongful, and because good money is etherial, any interference is very difficult to impose. "Authority" is a waning notion anyway."Authority" over matters of preference is baldly disgusting and immoral.  "Authority" in its sunset years can not afford bald illegitimacy.  So, governments can not and will not enforce alternative monies out of existence. 
Bitcoin is not the radical money system. It is mundane money. The current coordinated global fiat system is feudal and uses conglomeration with monopoly of force to eliminate competition to local currency. It uses war to quash rival monetary systems.  The current system suffers from deep deep moral problems and is by far the more radical proposal.
Because crypto currency is a vast improvement over central bank money in its portability, fungibility, record or account, and over moderate terms, a superior store of value, it is good money.  It's basic designed properties are so superior that all it needs to become money is a home in many many minds as money.  Bitcoin is well on its way to this achievement.
The first digital bearer asset.  That is so remarkable that all the other half true half specious arguments in the article are really pale.
And Bitcoin will save us. From an enforced lack of choice of using national currency which grandly benefits a few and grossly impoverishes the many.

In the context of  BU hardfork, they will begin to mine blocks under a new ruleset.  Any nodes or miners that do not follow this fork will append a chain of the old ruleset.  If there are adequate network resource, the two networks will diverge each appending its own chain. 
Andresen and Rizun have posed that the original chain could be extinguished by suffocating it by occasionally reorganizing it with empty blocks creating complete chaos and thus abandonment of the original-rules chain.  
This requires a hashrate dedicated to the emptyblock creation at just over the hashrate dedicated to appending to the original-rules chain.

States are accurately seen as mass murderers.  They are less and less necessary to most aspects of life, especially to those who actively seek out private solutions.

I am going to argue on Msr. Dorier's behalf. 
I know you are smart and educated and I think you know better or should.   All fiat systems have failed.  That is not a meme. They fail by their basic construction. Money is a fabulously important aspect of civilization.  We know what money is and many cultures have used a variety of mechanisms to have money (gold, shells, wampum, giant immovable stones). Fiat systems are set up to fulfill this important need. But fiat systems are not required to have money. Fiat is only one potential variety.  Fiat money has the unique attribute that it is a pure notion that's value is managed by authority. This is a scam. The purpose of fiat is to put into narrow hands the ability to manufacture notions of value that benefit the narrow hands. It is pre meditated, well conceived and there is an avalanche of evidence supporting that it is a scheme. It is peddled as all manner of things that we should want for the greater good, but that is all nonsense.  
The current global fiat scam is reaching its endpoint. Suppressed rates, negative rates, QE, the 2008 stock market crash and subsequent boom, huge banks failing.  These are all symptoms of the pattern that has happened time and again when fiat fails.   Fiat systems are not designed to last. They are designed to extract value from society en masse to the money printers. The last act is to wipe out their debts and therefore our assets on account at their banks. That's the way it is designed to work. 
Accurately viewed central banking is a criminal syndicate. Bitcoin is radical in comparison but only because it is radically less polluted with feudal fascistic control of money.

A person can not logically rule another. It's an easy argument by symmetry. Put two people in a room. If either one is morally rightful in declaring themselves ruler of the other then so it is vice versa. So it can not be.  Adding people to either side of the room does not change the argument.  "Governance" is morally intractable so we must find ways to live without it.
Then of course there is just the plain obvious truth that humans should be free.  
If we are to have people in charge of certain administrative tasks, they do not have charge of humans. 
In the execution of their duties, they may not hide important information from us and they have no right to our information.  
This is the proper forgotten relationship between people and public workers including politicians.  
We must lose the term "govern".

No it is not democracy. However it is a potential personal enabler and authority disabler. The claim of monopoly of violence (aka government) conjoined with issuance of money is very powerful. Of the two powers, money printing is dominant and controls the other.
It is a deeply inefficient, dishonest and immoral system. 
Bitcoin should it succeed will provide relief from that to the individual.  
That improvement is vastly superior to democracy.  
If there even remains a monopoly claim to violence without power over money, this power will be checked and transparent.

It's true. Bitcoin can not solve decades of global Keynesist folly. Only a deep recession, enourmous interest rates and wiping out of one man's debts and another's assets can do that.
Bitcoin will be a lifeboat for a very few and will be an example for new monetary systems.  It may even be the hard digital gold centring all manner of functional voluntary monetary systems once the unfolding disaster cleaves state from bank.
However without privacy built into the protoocol, it will merely enhance the last days of fiat-police state.

A man hires a private investigator because he suspects his wife is cheating.  "I need you because there is so much pointing to this but always some little doubt. I would leave her but I always have some doubt."
After some weeks the PI comes to the man and says he followed the wife to a motel.  Where she met a man. They kissed and touched intimately.  Went into a room where he watched them undress.  Then they closed the curtains.  
"So then what? Did they....?" asks the man.  
The PI is puzzled. "Well nothing.  That's all I know."

"Users" have zero control in EC.  Miner majority hashrate can do whatever it pleases in EC.  
The devs of the Core client are putting out an option.  It has support of much of the ecosystem.  They have decided to not chase every fad.  This is commendable.  
SegWit offers immediate tx capacity growth, funded channels and pegged sidechains.  And a conservative approach to future chain growth and feature consensus formation.  And quality tested codem. 
It's an approach so antithetical to the EC approach, it is unimaginable why they would adopt EC.  
From every indication, except for a few miners (who clearly are not motivated the same way) most of the ecosystem wants the more conservative approach.  Sure, seek market support.  Forget about selling out for expediency.

Hmm, well sure. But it was also sold or agreed to as having zero fees.  As it grows it can't do both.  
Known inflation is not inflation. You state Bitcoin has 21M units. Not yet.  So you have already accounted for inflation because it is hardcoded.  So it is not inflation at all.  
I am of the same thought as you that Bitcoin's purpose is for sound money.  I also think there is more benefit in a tiny known inflation than fees to pay for proofs.  Mining by its nature is a marginal business.  In order to be secure, I am not sure fees cut it.  I honestly don't know. I would rather the friction of security be borne by inflation.

Yikes!! So that root key can be translated back into your private key. Don't expose that, even partially.  You have just shortened the number of guesses to figure it out by some amount.  Don't worry I am sure it's not enough to allow anyone to easily guess your private key. But don't expose any more of it!!
With that root key and Armoury installed on a computer off the internet you will be able to generate your base 58 private key. 
With that you can sweep it into another wallet. Electrum supports sweeping for example.  
You can create a new zero balance wallet in Armoury, get its private key and sweep that into Electrum for practice. 
If it's a significant amount have a plan to put it straight into cold storage. Practice the whole process a few times before using any significant funds.

It's why a permissioned blockchain can never have an asset as its transaction. It can not be trusted.  Not only does it require strong ID management, try to imagine the rule set to add transactions.  Without unanimous consent on every single transaction someone can get screwed over.  Without consent via non permitted-member mechanism (ie PoW), any asset is dubious to outside parties because even unanimous consent can counterfeit the asset. 
Permitted chains can never bear assets, only documentation.  All of this chatter comes back to PoW no matter what. I can't decide if it's better for them all to keep chattering as an eventual promotion of Bitcoin (et al) or whether it's just a waste of energy.

And the problem is that it's not isolated to some small industry within the overall context of human ecology.  Edit: ie Finance.
When the price of money is made meaningless (negative or nearly so) for a tiny group, then all other markets lose some degree of meaning. The reset to meaning has always happened, accompanied by horror. This time is different only in the scale and full global proportion.  The passing money epoch will leave the money printers and minions with essentially all of the world's real wealth. Our mission is to create a meritocratic model of money such that dominance of world affairs never happens again at the hands of fiat mongers. 
Why is the pre-eminent bankstate (the home of the slave and the land of the free money print to large banks) risking war with the second nuclear power?  Easy:  because they need those Russian assets very badly to maintain the BIS Ponzi. 
Most humans are not inside the circle of privilege, so are completely sacrificial.
I hate to do this, but this is why our focus should be to maintain Bitcoin's most precious attribute, a low barrier to entry, free market, open source, permissionless, censorship free money. Bitcoin needs to be digital gold. Scale schmale. Bring on some fees! Let Physics and Info Science catch up to the need for a few years. (MPEGs of cats is great but this is a higher calling). Build alts and sides and networks for scale. Payment networks work fine even as centralized double entry accounting as an ok interim. Any vision that corrupts this notion sacrifices Satoshi's gift. I have zero doubt that humanity's need for Bitcoin will become more acute and more recognized in the next few years.  We need not fear R3coin. 
Both Classic and Core appear to have aspects that could undermine Bitcoin. And Joi Ito bosses both of their leaders! 
Where are our fourth and fifth options?  Where is that client that competes with Core but strikes out in a more radical direction of giving up control?  Competing on the other flank. I don't have the coding skills so who would like to help me?

So let's start nice and slow. 
First are you of the delusion that expanding money supply does anything at all to economy?  If so, we need not go further. Money plays an important economic intermediary, but once present, adding units does not change its aggregate economic utility, only its price. Agreed?
If so, then you will have to agree that a new unit of money has the same value of each of the existing units. They are quite fungible.  The new unit is acquired by its issuer at near zero cost. 
Since adding the unit does not change the economic value of the aggregate pool of money, it must therefore decrement its own value from the existing units.  
So whomever gets ownership of this new unit has been enriched by exactly the new value of the units post addition.  
The owners of the other units have been impoverished in aggregate by the same amount.  
This is theft straight up but that's besides this point.  
So who bears this theft?  The people who own some of the existing units and, the people who will be paid in future of said units. So you say this is those with lots of money, which seems to make sense but does not.  People who have lots of wealth hold most of it in money substitutes. People who have no money must earn it and they slip back on the wage inflation hamster wheel with every new unit printed. People in between will have mixed scenarios but most will lose a good proportion of their wealth to inflation.  
So that's who loses, but more importantly who gains? Who gets ownership of these new units?  And what value do they add?
So my original point stands, there is a theft burden laid onto an economy with expanding money supply which decreases the productive and information of money and commerce.

If malleability gets fixed, we may literally never need to alter the protocol again.  I sincerely hope there is always tensions to attempt so, but the need will not be present.  At least not until some large scale crisis emerges.  
Miners in a malleability-fixed future have no upgrade to veto.  No strategic power. Just a very tough competitive playing field.  
In an EC world, miners change parameters without any backtalk from anyone.
That's the difference. 
In regards your nonsense that users should control settings and they have that power already, those are both false.  Miners can not coordinate a single 2 MB block despite massive concentration of ownership.  There needs to be good code that coordinates the overall architecture.  You can not maintain that the network is already capable of coordinating change ad hoc and then claim we need EC.
I should say that the current dynamic has me mostly out of Bitcoin.  I do not relish the dynamic of History's worst fiat offender seemingly successfully financing the effort to monopoly stake protocol evolution.  The impotence between Core code, UASF and PoW algo change threat do not impress.  Jihan's responses to the covert ASICBoost incident tells me everything I need to know. He is not interested in my investments.
Perhaps PoW ends up just as proof of commandeering electrical joules.  Until this world stops using money from authority, PoW can always be purchased by the biggest gun.  I haven't heard anyone trying to ameliorate the 51% attack. Until the cost of commandeering joules greatly exceeds benefit of doing so then there will be trouble.  I think that's what is happening.   I sincerely think Bitcoin's testes reside in the mouths of palace gate dogs.  And AXA might be just fine with that.

Answer this honestly:

My answer is that they end up on a chain that rapidly loses validity.

Most of the arguments are the same two arguments.  Bitcoin is tiny and irreversible.  True but temporary. It is circular argument to say Bitcoin is small in liquidity therefore it is not big in liquidity therefore it is not reserve quality.  Sure, but it's still unknown what it's full bloom will be. 
Irreversibility is a better place to start. Functions can be overlaid to create reversibility and exist already.

I don't understand your being rude but don't bother explaining. That's your problem. But it's such a turnoff I almost didn't care to post this.  
I did some back of envelope calculations. What secures hashing power is economic incentive in the larger economy.  And here is the the thing. In a way you and I are both correct.  A tiny tiny inflation should be enough to ward off attack as would would quite small fees because the attacker has to have capital proportional to the value of a lot of mining capacity.  Contingent upon one variable especially. The price of a bitcoin. The larger world economic value of fees or inflation subsidies is what keeps miners mining and defends the network.  
So investors in the coin secure the network.  
Design decision must incorporate that. High fees make the network less useful and inflation makes the asset less scarce.  
While you have not convinced me (not leastly because you are not confident enough not to resort to being a fucking asshole), I do appreciate the thought exercise and the conclusion.   
And I will meet you in the middle.  What drives Bitcoin and secures it is its value. Small fees and small inflation if necessary to create larger value are just fine!
I ran a node to secure my own coins, so there!  I don't anymore but would again if I felt the network was becoming insecure.

People invest with the idea that they defer spending today for more tomorrow.  But they will expend tomorrow just more.  
It has proven true for Bitcoin.  As price rises people spend their holdings.  The price is the collective anticipation of future utility.  Don't worry too much about today's utility.  The anticipated future may not come to be.  This is still all pretty speculative.  But it is a necessary phase.

I think Emergent Consensus puts full control of the Bitcoin protocol in the hands of a majority of hashrate. It not only removes the role of devs to craft architecture, it removes the power of dissenting miners and nodes and the wider community voice.  
I think Bitfury can not sustain a business of mining as long as it pays market electricity.  They are currently mining on gear they can't sell so that is a sunk cost.  Mining helps to minimize their losses.  Soon they won't bother.  BTCC is under the same incentives as Antminer, BW, F2 and all the other miners in China.  I think they will all roll over to the whim of the Chinese government when it feels like it.  Their operations are very highly subsidized so it is The People's Party that controls miners in China and within a year, also the Bitcoin protocol.  As one of the worst fiat abusers in historical and present times, they will not suffer Bitcoin gladly.

Many things have been money.  Bitcoin is far from enough social acceptance to be yet considered money.  At another, say, 10X in value, it's completely reasonable to include it as being described as one type of money.  
Bank money (fiat) is one type of money.  If we were to compare the two, beyond social acceptance, Bitcoin has vastly superior monetary quality.  With one's own node, Bitcoin can not be faked or be unrecognizable.  Bitcoin goes wherever TCP/IP goes, so it is substantially more accessible than even the USD.  It's scarcity is protected by its price (non mischievous miners won't dare mess with scarcity).  
Bitcoin (and bullion) require no third party authority.  Note that does not preclude banks or credit arising peripheral to the base asset (ie gold banks).  Central banks can outright be replaced by Bitcoin.  Gold is no threat to central banks because it has no knowable accounting and is not transportable.  
Neither bank money nor Bitcoin is greatly fungible.  Banks attach conditions and police tracing.  Bitcoin has a public ledger.

Similarly, Mr Maxwell is hanging quite a lot of his reputation out there too if said analysis is not conclusively in favour of his hypothesis.

His actions seem rational.
1) Profit vs Revenue.  Sure Bitcoin price might go higher with SegWit.  So more revenue.  But with SegWit he has higher costs and lower competitive advantage by being a chip maker.  More Revenue but less profit.
2) In this moment of suspended progress, he is the man.  He wants developers to bend at the knee to him.  He has a cadre of frustrated Bitcoiners willing to provide an upgrade that gives a dominant miner control to instantly change the Bitcoin protocol because "OMG fees and Satoshi's one true vision."  Most people get off on that kind of power.   Instinctually we like power, more bananas and less time with your mother.  
3) I am quite convinced he has incentives provided by The People's Party. 
4) He has revealed himself as a very short term self interested person.  I have self interests that pertain to making a better world for which I willingly short term sacrifice.  This is not true of Jihan.

How does the transition sequence look?  Especially within the first few days?  How are BIP148 coins delineated from the other coins?  Which would the exchanges consider  the new alt?  Is the BIP148 network obliged to ensure against replay?  
If BIP148 activates and a large majority of hashrate does *not* follow, the majority hashrate can attack the BIP148 chain with empty block reorgs and other reorg attacks.  In the early stages of activation, miners might be quite reticent in support of BIP148 until it became clear that the BIP148 coins are much more valued.  During this period, the BIP148 hashrate might be small proportional to the other chain.  How would a 90/10 hashrate disadvantage be defended in the first critical hours?
If the majority hashrate is willing to holdout on an extended time line for EC and continue to despite mining a less valuable coin, how is this defended against?
IMO, a PoW algo change is a terrible strategy as there would be no supportive hashrate.  It's essentially an altcoin with a few vestiges of Bitcoin. We need to keep and defend some hashrate until the People's Bank submits to the price difference.  Not an easy task.

Your argument belies the entire edifice that somehow the developers of Core are in much of a position of power.  The protocol is open.  The code is open source.  The developers of Core have decided upon a path.  There is no barrier to creating alternatives.  The BU alternative is run at the option of network participants.  I would agree that the SegWit alternative has failed to capture ample support and this means that more must be done to make it more appealing or create some alternative.  The whole narrative that there is tyrranical motive that needs to be replaced because it won't meet some ever changing bar (20MB, EC, FlexTrans, Extension Blocks) is logically sterile and intellectually dishonest.  The developers of Core have offered a well considered, well crafted, well tested offering.  Much of Bitcoin is embracing that offering.  They have zero obligation to chase will o the wisp alternatives.  Not doing the bidding of Andresen or Hearn or Rizun or Ver or Wu or all the other reasonable and unreasonable others does not make the devs of Core tyrants.  That's a stupid argument and I am tired of it.
In a world full of convenient central bank money, convenience is not the innovation. P2P permissionless is.  The idea of EC, where parameters are the domain of miners only, where developers, nodes and users have no say, is an idea that ends up with no users and no investors. It has no unique value.

You don't know that a fees market will do the job for security either.  Fees market will be formed for competition to access space on the blockchain. There is nothing about the economics of that that says there will be enough hashing capacity to secure the network.  
Both extremes on the blocksize debate violate your so called inviolable principles.  An unlimited blocksize or even a rapidly increasing one undermines security via decentralization. A tiny blocksize hobbles the ecosystem to the point that Bitcoin can not reach status as money.  Something has to compromise.
I share your bias. I am much more biased toward Bitcoin being sound permisssionless money than a payment network.  
For better or worse, protocol decisions are not limited to the technically gifted insiders, it's a brew of users, miners, leading businesses, and coders.

This is either foolish delusion or propaganda.  Firstly what kind of system functions well when users can fiddle with important security parameters?  Secondly and more importantly, EC puts these controls absolutely under control of a hashrate majority.  Any user or node that doesn't comply will be on a non functional blockchain.  As the ASICBoost incident should at a minimum make us aware of how far miner self interest deviates from user and ecosystem interests, miners should not be expected to do anything but self service as it pertains to EC.  
So this is another great lie.  EC provides configuration capability to one very narrow self interested set of "users."  I will continue to support the notion of an ecosystem that is really really hard to change and requires widespread consent and well crafted code.

That's quite sometimething. Bitcoin is the world's first transferable digital bearer asset.  Cryptocurrencies are the only digital bearer assets.

Take your own advice. He was very powerful in British government prior to the rise of Hitler. His actions are indeed a source of the conditions that led to Nazism.
He was in charge of trade by 1908 and would have had a front row seat to German takeover of important markets of industrial products.  He was in charge of the navy while it blockaded and starved German civilians during WW1.  Britain was a strong author of severe reparations imposed on Germany between the wars again impoverishing German people during peace times(!!) Churchill was Minister of War during the diktat of the Treaty of Versailles.  He wrote in many articles starting prior to the First (!) WW that German trading was a threat to Britain and needed to be quashed. 
Wars with Germany cost Britain its empire, reducing it from world dominator to ashes.  Churchill was an influential war seeker, not some reluctant hero.

Look, authoritarianism is NOT a philosophy.  It's a device.  "One person should rule another" is not even the proper form for a core idea of a philosophy or even a tiny subsidiary idea within a sound core. It's logically inconsistent. Two people. Without any knowledge of them, which should rule? By symmetry neither. Therefore authority has no logical underpinning and can not be philosophy.  
Choosing what object to value as money is so basic a freedom, it's weird we even have to talk about it. It's mundane, blasé bullshit this money thing. It frankly shows what a debased world we live in that money freedom has been removed from us.

If Bitcoin achieve a position of providing individuals an opt out of the evils of said seigniorage, that alone is a massive victory. It will mean a drastic tempering of the ability for states to abuse the seigniorage. 
I think it goes much much further than that, however. A Bitcoin type chain with iterative, say temporary Ethereum type side chains means every transaction in the world right down to coffee and right up to the mortgage on a Trump tower settles on some chain and the trunk chain is used as necessary. 
The individual then indeed holds a bearer asset on some chain, which eventually collapses down to Bitcoin, on the main chain as sidechains get unfolded, and so the value is some direct derivative of Bitcoin's value.

I wonder what kind of blockchains banks would end up building.  They won't be open transaction records.  I would doubt that the access would be via an ad hoc creation of a private key as then the bank has no control and can't perform KY See.  Would it be its own coin?  In which case, the value would depend upon desirability by a market, leaving it as an altcoin, a late joining alt coin. Or would it be a claim that can be used to cash in for traditional fiat on account?  In which case, it's an IOU claim documentation system and doesn't have much real world purpose.

@_date: 2016-09-13 16:14:50
Well, yes and no.  I certainly know that as a money Bitcoin is a flea on an elephant.  I do indeed hold high high expectations for where it will end up.
Bitcoin is not really a new form of money. It's a new way to assure truth. Money is just the perfect application for that.
But read that article.  Central banks are investing seriously in blockchains.  And they are floating the trial balloon that with blockchains, banks are not necessary. It's not me saying it, it's Mark Carney. But if banks are not necessary, central banks are even more so.  The only function central banks perform is managing the size of their own balance sheets, by use of their own avarice, fiat.  They have no impact on anything without government enforced monopoly such that the common person values the units of account and nothing to do at all if their balance sheet is fixed or programmatically determined.   
Double entry accounting ledgers of trust are a centuries old technique.  Digital versions are not really the same creature as Nakamoto Consensus money. They just don't compare to this new type of ledger. 
None of the actors in the system have ever turned out to be trustworthy. This is a huge drag on capital allocation and therefore a huge drag on human progress. Then of course it's also just plain legalized fraud. 
So when I hear central bankers saying that they are contemplating moving the world's money system on to blockchains and posing that customers will not need banks, I get pretty euphoric.  Because I also know that the business model of central banks can not compete with an open source protocol with a predetermined money supply. 
It's of course still very very early and even though Bitcoin continues to dominate, anything can happen.  But I am not talking about the moon. I am talking about a better Earth.
I have not lost so much as a Satoshi in years and never had a transaction fail.  And volatility, no such thing when it's been up up up for me.
Edit: Fiat systems all collapse under their own screwy incentives. Perpetual zero interest rates is as good a sign of pending terminality as being stuffed lifeless into a Hearst like chariot.

It's not so much that it's debt based but that it is an enforced monopoly.  If we had choice of monies, practically, day to day, at retail and at levels like say, actuary and long-dated futures and we had choice of banking systems, then competing debt based systems would not be able to create artificial market conditions like interest pricing below (or above!!)  normal.
This is an invalid role for government. It probably always was, but certainly in a time with the Internet and better educated people, we don't need to be "protected" by a government monopoly of money.

The original purpose of the Fed is to end economic slowdown caused by bank runs.  This is straightforward enough and it would seem to make some sense.  This problem however is caused in itself by debt based money. When debt is defaulted upon or even when it is paid back, this deletes some of the money in the system. It's really just the quantity of imaginary notions that are deleted, but prior to the overall adjustment of the value of the remaining units reaching an equilibrium at a higher value per unit (deflation), it has the same effect as a decrease in the amount of money in the system.  Wide systemic debt default can then be self reinforcing and lead to further diminution of money and which will create deeper economic fracture.  
Note that for a money that has no counterparty (ie asset based money, like gold or Bitcoin), a debt to repay some of this money that is defaulted upon is a loss to the lender but it does not destroy the money itself.  Reward for risk compensates for those potential losses. 
The Fed has now mutated substantially from its original intent. If we look at the current state of affairs, we must conclude one of two things. Either emergency level of bankruptcy has been occurring at banks for many years, or the Fed is doing something outside its founding mandate. This is not necessarily a trivial mystery. A complete independent triplicate audit of the Fed, including especially gold holdings of the US government and custodially by the Fed, would tell us what's going on, but, tragically, there hasn't been enough political muster to do that audit. 
It's tragic because the connective tissue of the USA is bound up in the dollar-Fed-bank-gov entity. We earn dollars, we pay taxes in dollars, many of our promises to one another are priced in dollars, our entire manner of pricing is in dollars. Yet we aren't allowed to get a synopsis on how this is being managed. This is tyranny. 
So are the banks so bankrupt that they need continuous life support since about the 1990s or is something else going on?  It's pretty clear that it is the latter.  Bankruptcy is a fairly benign mundane process whereby the shareholders, who, as decision makers, have failed to make the business viable are removed partly or wholly as party to the business and the debt holders in return for relinquishing their debt claims partly or wholly, become owners of what remains of the business. These are short term events and oftentimes the business remains as a going concern relieved of much of its debt burden.  If the banks were/are bankrupt, emergency liquidity might have been provided by the Fed creating dollars and then a normal bankruptcy proceeding might have followed. Did not happen. One has to ask, why are bank shareholders exempt from bankruptcy? Why is the Fed expanding its balance sheet in long duration and in high quantity?  Is it possible that that corruption has a tiny toehold in this powerful apolitical institution? 
If we look at the Fed's own words, they have expanded by themselves their mandate from lender of last resort to manager of price increases and to manager of employment levels and recently to regulator of banks. 
The world can no longer tolerate a US dollar that is overpriced because it is used in commerce that is compelled by US force. Look past the surface. The US debt is sitting in expensive aging military gear and pointless destruction.  American children are not well educated on net. There is no national health system. Old age security obligations will not be fully met.  There is a massive infrastructure deficit. States and cities are going bankrupt. Syria and the Ukraine are conflicts to defend Western money hegemony, as were the razing of Libya and Iraq (and Yemen and Sudan and CAR). 
The US is a very odd hallucination. I will refer to the difference between alt-right reporting and mainstream moneyed media if you have doubts about that. It's broke, broken and living large. It has not a clue that it can not persist in this way. America might be great again, in a generation or two of sound money, non aggressive foreign policy, of caring for its own, defending its own borders, speaking honestly to itself. Certainly not by the hands of the current political class. 
It is critically important to the peace, prosperity and sanity of the human race that currency monopoly is ended. Debt based money is unmanageable and corrupted. 
Look good times come and go. It is NOT the role of government to make your life easy. Recessions are a completely artificial notion. There is no such thing as a national economy that can be managed. It's observable and individuals can make their own choices based upon real data observations, but there is no smoothing of tides. Who wants that world anyway?
Here is your downvote for mewling naïveté. Sounds mean, but grow up. Recessions are normal and are opportunity, smoothing them does nothing more than inhibit upward mobility of people ready to take over the reins from people who have failed. You know, the American Dream freedom for upward mobility on merit. 
Competing currency will create that for all people everywhere.

A grudging acceptance of reality! 
So if this is what is being reported publicly, there must be some smart cookies inside the banks that now know with little doubt that there is little future for the current model. Central banks are unnecessary as the blockchain unit of account is one and the same as the data unit. Their ledger entry units (dollars et al) require heavy, clumsy, not secure, manual, expensive management, so fiat banks are uncompetitive. 
It's fascinating times. Banks, especially central banks, are more powerful than at any previous time in history. Wars are fought on their behalf to maintain and expand their hegemonies. They will not be audited. They are buying all manner of financial asset.   Negative interest rates is enourmous hubris. "We don't even need deposit customers anymore. We just print our own capital."  They are starting to believe their own lies, that counterfeit capital is actually the same as real capital, not that the labour of the common person is what drives ALL value, not that they have just an ill gotten benefit of gov enforced monopoly of fiat. A massive government supplied benefit to a narrow narrow few at detriment to most and severe harm to functioning capital markets.  They are creating more unbanked. They don't want small customers.  Now right at this peak of power, they are about to be made obsolete within a generation. Banks are removing themselves from the active providence of the common person. This leaves an enourmous opportunity. Any child that grows up with a reasonable degree of security, nutrition and education is as good as the next as an adult with little difference for any of the insignificant differences we seem to want to focus on. Every person is a little business just bursting to get out. Banks don't need them. That's fine. Now, they don't need banks!! 
There are still missing pieces.
Bitcoin cash, human-recognizable, machine-recognizable physical tokens with a secure smart contract to change address as these notes or cards transit in and out of B-ATMs.  Take over the cash market if banks are too good for us all now.
Credit. Time preference markets with interest run by institutions with open blockchain proofs of reserves and open risk models. 
Legal recognition of blockchain distribution of corporate share equity.

I have seen the sentiment that you offer, that well awful events are sort of a part of nature, in many of the Dutch, including my grandparents. They would have jokes of the unspeakable that you would dare not use today, but these were ironic mirthful, goodly intentioned, shruggings off and humour making of horror. 
I suppose I am far more naive and would still work for the end of authority and its spawn including war.

Your question OP is exactly why this is fun to watch and why there should be a massive trading opportunity this year.
Miners' long term interest is the price of a bitcoin, which at some point means a need for more block capacity.  I don't think either Classic or Core have great strategies. I think Core will upgrade blocksize as a last defence against losing control but only after a period of lacklustre results from fees, SegWit, Lightning and after Classic code proves itself. In the short term as long as the price is OK, the miners have very little reason to hardfork other than some weird altruism.  So they won't support larger blocks until Bitcoin appears mortally threatened by price drop. IMO.  
The price rebound once the blocksize is increased on way or the other should be awesome. Just my theory. I hodl a long term position, I won't touch that. But I am thinking about this as a trading play over the next say 18 months.
If you got the cahonees for it, sell now, wait it out and buy in when it seems all is nearly lost. I will hold Litecoin and Monero in the interim (plus cash and gold).

The word capitalism has been purposely captured and conflated with the notion of free markets. Capitalism was originally created as a criticism of debt based money by the likes of Marx. Capitalism has never really meant freedom, but it was used in that war-inspiring false Euro philosophical dichotomy of Communism vs Fascism (two forms of collectivism).  
We desire freedom but take the less ugly (at least from one angle) sister of tyranny, capitalism and think we are free. 
As long as governments enforce monopoly of money, we will not be free, but we will still have capitalism. 
We must get past the idea that society or a nation must adopt one philosophy. It is not possible. A philosophy can only be held by an individual, who then must be free to act as individually or as collectively as she wishes. 
The false dichotomy of Communism vs Capitalism is a trick to recruit cannon fodder and tax prey for the masters in those domains who switch sides with the wind.
The term capitalism is so self contradicted in use, that we should replace it with freedom or free markets.

Of course Bitcoin can replace those systems. Banks are just IOU ledgers. The whole world used to run on gold IOUs. The gold didn't move around.  You don't need to facillitate ALL transactions on the main chain. 
Even in the absense of sidechains and Lightning, the current scale of Bitcoin could outright replace central and big settlement banks.

Capitalism is no such thing if there is a monopoly by one of the critical elements of an economy.

How delicious. Better than The Economist cover of Bitcoin making the world go around, the world go around. 
90 central banks are dicussing DLTs, the new name for Blockchain Technology. 90!!! That's almost all of them.
Central banks are taking about relieving commercial banks of their own tawdry existence! This is amazing! Why would they take on retail customers? Well, they would lead you to think that with DLT, it's because they can.  Nope! It's because in a world with Bitcoin, they have to!  This is bigtime serious stuff. This is central banks talking about removing their limbs to save their core. Central and commercial banks are so symbiotic, they may as well be a single organism.  They would not contemplate this unless for survival.
They are starting to observe the gravitational pull of a future with the end user choosing which programmatic immutable monetary policy they prefer, denecessitating central banks, They are seeing an event horizon of a zero friction, zero control global transfer service, denecessitating SWIFT and the other regional interbanks. They see that six figure untrustworthy name-and-password ledger managers are cheaply and securely replaced by random 256 bit uncrackable numbers, denecessitating commercial bank. They see that they have to do this, but being a coin developer is not at all the same as being the currency monopoly. So they can't be Bitcoin; maybe they can be Onecoin with shields of lions and unicorns!
I think we are on the verge of tiny creeping to the exits to some of these institutions to utilize public blockchains. They would be crazy not to buy some UTXO real estate.
It could not have been more that two years ago that Carney was on a video, saying Bitcoin was kind of silly, chuckling that he didn't own any. Now, CBDC (chuckle) on DLT (chuckle) will be how central banks remain in primacy, by serving customers directly.  He has come a long way. Like only one conversion left, which he will never say in public. I wonder if he owns btc now?  They all own gold, these central bankers.

The only thing banks do that the Bitcoin protocol can't is time value preference (credit).
I don't think there is a way to do credit with smart contracts. It still requires an institution of trust. So the banks can do that. 
Look Ma, no central bank!

So, Bitcoin is far too tiny to impact the notion of monopoly.   
So, we do live in a world of currency monopoly.  
It is very much an enforced monopoly.  Legal tender laws make leaving the currency very difficult for a domestic business or consumer.  Tax remittance, actuary, futures, government spending, etc etc are typically legislated to be performed in the local legal tender, government mints produce physical cash for a loss or subsidy. Competing currency schemes get closed down with prejudice by authority. 
Taxation is the main vehicle by which currency gets value.  By purchasing rights to future taxation (bonds such as TBills) in trade for dollars, the economic value of these future labours and profits gets imparted into the fiat notion. 
This is actually very interesting.  If government was a beneficial or even neutral or benign force, which it is not or at least not strictly, then we would have this fascinating mechanism of how imaginary units get value through a social cohesion.  In fact this is of course partly what is going on. But let's not get hang up on that.  
The main point is that fiat currency value is indeed a result of enforced government intervention that creates monopoly.  This point is a point of reference. I am not seeking rebuttal for this. If this is not something you accept as essentially fact, we will have to depart.

Yeah, well, if public coins are irrelevant to them they may just as well go extinct now.  Private blockchains are far more irrelavant to public chains than vice versa.
If the chain does not have a permissionless transferable asset that has a value in the market of the common man, it is not very interesting. 
However, with such an asset, almost everything banks do, and so much more than they can do, will be done with such asset.

I am certainly not saying that.  I just think that a nuanced read of history shows that Germany was far from unique in being ruled by war seeking authoriatarians. It is thought that strong contributing factors to the rise of Nazism was the brutal naval starvation of Germany by Churchill and the severe financial war led by Britain against Germany between the violent times of what was really one war. 
Wars are disasters promulgated by psychotic greed of authority for more authority.  The common person would never start such affairs.  A necessary precondition of war is to compel power into a small concentration. 
The world prior to WW1 has rife with expansion and rivalry of empire. The dominate theme of the war which was WWs 1 and 2 and the between years is Germany's rise as an industrial giant and Churchill's desire to put Germany back into its place.  This was a huge disaster for Europe, including Britain. 
Again, re read history, Britain had already established a brutal empire, complete with mass death, slavery and monetary fakery. Germany was just one potential rival. The brutality imposed by Britain (spearheaded by Winston Churchill) on Germany was extreme, motivated by rivalrous empires.  
War won't be ended by picking sides out of historical ashes. War is a complex phenomenon borne of authority. It's not innate to one culture and it's rarely that any parties are innocent. It's hard to discern innocence in Syria by any power for a current example.

I do not respect Volcker.  Interest rates of 20% are no more reflective of market price for time value of money than is 0%. It's just the chain of fiat monopoly being yanked in a direction that suits those who happen to be able to "predict" which way it gets pulled next. Think about it. If you had control of interest rates, how well could you do predicting markets. He was as equal a criminal jerk as the rest of them.

This is off topic, but I just have to...
If the world had half the gold it has now, the economic value as an insurance against fiat failure would be exactly the same. The price per portion (ounce, gram) would be exactly double.  
This is instructive. It shows that gold is NOT money. It is a transmitter of money. Iron in a bridge is NOT the forces but the transmitter of forces.  Federal Reserve Notes are not money...
The amount of money in play in an economy is strictly what is required by the economy to abstract values for exchange. The number of units do not make any more aggregate economic value. This is why central banks are inherently larcenous. The amount of money required in an economy has only to do with the economy itself and zero to do with the quantity of the coin. So, when some people benefit more than others by an expansion of the quantity of units and do so under authoritative enforcement of such or privelege, then that is firstly theft and secondly government enforced theft.  That is not just smarmy skimming. It's outrageous! 
It is highly critical that we, we small group, build something that competes with central bank monopoly.

Are you referring to the censorship of this subreddit? 
I agree with that is laughably censored but I don't think that has really held up Bitcoin's progress. Maybe Msrs. Ver, Hearn and Andresen just didn't have a marketable vision. I doubt that the miners form their opinions based on this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-09-22 21:26:08
Settling what??  It's only recently that they even spoke of needing a token or coin AS the settlement mechanism.  
It eventually comes down to this: Unless there is an object that can be owned and that object has a FREE market value, a blockchain is sort of silly.  
The banks are backing their way right back to Bitcoin. They are in denial and they may go for or create a new public blockchain. However if it falls below some key standards, there is no market and without a market there is no asset and there is not really settlement happening. Those standards were set pretty high by Bitcoin: Open source decentralized client, defined money supply, zero barrier to entry, only user control of asset. 
It must be difficult to face, but the function of money is just really better done by Bitcoin than by double entry ledgers of compelled trust. 
Blockchains without coins are trivial. Coins with avarice inflation, edit-ability and without crypto control are not desirable. Coins not desired have no price or markets Coins without price will not have good blockchains.

Could a Bitcoin ATM machine act as an oracle?  
If so, unique paper bills could be circulated, say a 1 mbtc note that is quite unforgeable, as it is put into or taken from the machine, a transaction can be made to sign the 1mbtc to an appropriate address. Fees can be added. All under the auspice of a smart contract.  If this works with high confidence, people can use the bills knowing they can be redeemed at a BTM and they will receive btc to a provided address.

But then does it matter?  Bitcoin is close to its market cap all time high. We also have a neat Turing complete coin that is spawning a really interesting set of experiments. We have a coin with an opaque ledger. I don't think too much of the rest.  
Payment channels, alt coins, alternative clients to Core, banks doing blockchains and Ripple, algorithmic contracts, and blockchains to document property transactions. 
The point is that "the big idea" of crypto-assets is growing in all manners imaginable.  This tussle for the heart of Bitcoin amounts to next to nothing. It is exceedingly unlikely that Mr. Ver will muster enough support to create a fork, and if he does, then one of the chains has a bit of a brand problem, but that is about it. The two Bitcoins would be so differentiated that they might grow in aggregated value. If one disappears altogether, then it is clear it had a bad strategy. 
I appreciate OPs frustration but it is borne of an incorrect perspective. There really isn't much control that can be cornered.  There is no better reason that Bitcoin dominates other than being first born.  Bitcoin owns the future only if it continues to provide better function.  It probably will. The place for Ethereum is as numerous sidechain spin offs with temporary existence. That's how you shard!  I don't know if a transparent or an opaque ledger would be better suited as the main trunk of a fractally money system, or whether there is a need for both.  
In the end there will be every imaginable possibility made manifest. There are many paths opening up already. 
I think the world desperately needs a censorship resistant money. If it takes another year or so to get some good sidechains, some early stage payment channels, slightly bigger blocks, old school financial products for investments and futures, and so on, it's not worth compromising censorship resistant money to get a few more transactions.

It's the cost of the wars funded by your grandchildren's labour. The benefits have been moved into pockets today of people who won't pay the bills. Bankers know more than anyone else this is not going to magically work out. Either the debts get wiped out (massive deflation) or the money gets wiped out (massive inflation).  Likely it will oscillate with increasing violence until one or the other finally takes place.  In both cases the disaster of pretending to indenture unborn humans will be realized.  The priveleged few have moved claims against the future economy to be paid later into their own personal treasures today. 
We were warned about this. This is an ancient trick. The US Constitution is specifically purposed against this. Sigh.

If you want to have an investment amount, you will need to know how to manage things yourself directly. There are few legitimate third party custodial funds that can hold Bitcoins on your behalf (GBTC). So you need to hold the bitcoins yourself. 
Start small, a tiny amount. And learn what public and private keys are and how to keep your private keys safe. What country are you in?

A lot to like about this article.  Intelligent and well written. Sophisticated maybe even.
Two critiques.  
Firstly, central banks themselves, especially the current quasi global BIS cabal, violate trust themselves.  Government based compulsion to use their monies substitutes for genuine voluntary trust.  The currency-central bank - commercial bank - government complex is the essence of trust violation. Hence the need for monopoly/close oligopoly at all of those levels.  The notion of competent managerial capital allocation by bankers is near farcical.  
Secondly, the economics of mining is such that even if the marginal unit cost of mining a bitcoin was near zero, the demand as an asset and transactional money means that the price of a bitcoin has almost nothing to do with the cost of mining one, except during times of duress for miners, where marginal miners must liquidate at even perhaps below cost for cash flow.  This might exacerbate downward price pressure during price decreases and therefore increase volatility.  This is a temporary and modelable phenomenon as inflation will not be large quite soon now. Miners of any consequence are seeing a strategically important position in influencing what may yet become the world's premiere money.  They probably don't mind losing money from time to time for that privilege.
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:41:02
Exactly.  Banks deliver dollars to the market.  It is their primary purpose.  There is not one without the other, dollars and banks.  Banks are double entry ledger machines.  
The logic that since a public ledger is incompatible with banks, therefore banks will continue dominance by co-opting the technology is almost perverse.  
Bitcoin with programmatic extensions removes the need of banks.

Any "blockchain technology" needs a token of voluntary market value or it is just playing with itself in the corner.  So bring on the bank.gov altcoins!  Bitcoin has little to fear from that.

I am half in agreement. I worked for a firm that was distbuting advertising audio to radio stations over North America.  We were hot for awhile because we used networks instead of the prior standard of physical media. We used ISDN. Look it up children. That was great for about three years, awesome growth money losing phase on the way to big stock options payout. Except we younger folks started using a little thing called the Intenet at home and started saying the business model was cooked. The executives wouldn't hear it. Out of business in two years.  Same as you are saying, the private network was fine but just very limited use due to exclusive access so it couldn't compete. 
Where I disagree is that the centre of the Bitcoin network is the data object, the blockchain itself. All transacations use it.  Sidechains (really branch chains) and higher layer protocols still use this one singular data object. You can not route around the main chain.  There is nothing like that in Internet routing. There is no supercore router that all packets must pass through.   I think it is vitally important that money can have many arbitrary routes as does IP.

How many transactions per second do you think the Federal Reserve performs.  Remember that those are the only "dollars." Every other dollar isreally a dollar derivative.  
Bitcoin IOUs can have as many transactions per second as any other IOU system. 
Your point is valid, but it's not the end of the story. There are many ways to get transaction volume. Even on chain will end up, I would guess at a couple of million per day. That's plenty to support a reserve and settlement requirements. I don't think governments will mind paying a fee of a dollar once a year to adjust their hodlings.

Is a hardfork necessary to reset the PoW algo? Or the difficulty parameter?  Does this imply another immediate hardfork?

Or they won't. Look if you think you can predict the intentions of central banks, you are fooling yourself. They prosper because they yank the chain in the manner that suits them best. The most important thing they possess is the power to surprise.  People believing they know which way it gets yanked next, just gives them more power. The best you can do is accept that and live as much as you can outside the fence. 
If you haven't divested yourself of all assets held custodially, you will get fleeced. Either way, this DeutscheBank thing is huge and will be a defining moment in history and probably for Bitcoin.

So what is wealth then?  Having a good handle on that will help one do well.  My own thought is that the cupboard is bare for all assets held on account.  If you have cash, bonds, stocks, REITs, whatever, where you don't have the bearer paper in hand, your wealth is at risk. Even holding the bearer paper means you have a chance to defend your ownership in a court which may or may not even exist soon and may be rigged against you. Ask Jon Corzine's customers. 
There is no uncorrelated coincidence that the anglosphere banking institutions and their military operations are in extreme situation.  "Wealth" in fiat terms is all about how much economy is being facilitated by the fiat money.  Since before the British Empire until today, capturing economy into a fiat domain allows the fiat instrument to have value and if this economy grows, the units can be manufactured at zero cost and not lose value. This growth has happened by productivity increase (via technology) and by violent acquisition of local economy.  
The USDollat hegemony covers perhaps a third of the world, the other BIS currencies (Yen, Pound, Euro, CDN, AUSD, etc) capture much of the rest.  The BIS system has reached its conclusion in all but a patina of confidence. It is broke.  The escalation of wars in the past 20 years or so by US aggression is a desperate attempt to capture economy into the BIS hegemony.  The domestic disasters in the US and in Europe are due to the internal collapse of the BIS money system.   Peace is no longer an affordable staple. 
The banks or other financial organizations, that you have accounts with are store fronts. You have a docment that describes a legal claim for the assets on account. You are a third tier creditor to a storefront.  That is tawdry wealth.  
DeutscheBank ist kaput. Nicht gut. It is an enourmous bank. If the rest of the anglosphere was not horribly in debt, DeustcheBank might not matter.  Already we are in a state where the debts can not be repaid. The economy of the world can never profit enough to pay them.  
One man's debt is another man's asset.  All of those assets on account you have are "owed" to you. They are debts to someone else. They will not be honoured. They are rehypothecation of a mirage of a facade of a chimera. 
So what will happen?  I don't know. I think one of two things. A depression of deflation, if debt collapse gets out of control, or a depression of hyperinflation if money printing floats the debts nominally, but effectively makes them about worthless. In all cases, assets on account are worthless. 
So what is wealth? Only defensible assets outside of the financial system. Prescious metals, rural real estate, business relationships, tools and physical capital, maybe Bitcoin, maybe!  
And I do think wealth is not lost but only transferred. I would go a little further and say wealth is even gained in aggregate due to technology and population growth. Something must be said about transferred. Much of the wealth has already been transferred.  Yup. Your hard work and your 401K, the gold at Fort Knox and at the New York Fed, those Social Security payments you made, all gone. Not soon, now, it's already gone. The people that leveraged your labour through that $US 20T owed by the federal government, sold your past and future labour to someone else. They themselves hold the stocks and bonds paper and have moved the gold into, well more private locations. The assets on account holders and the indebted hold nothing but unrealizable claims against each other. The brokers are out already. You think you own IBM. You don't. You hold a legal claim against a storefront, who holds a legal claim against some bank, and so on for a few degrees of separation. The DTCC which is owned by the big six banks holds all the paper in America. You are six court cases away from getting your hands on that IBM paper and if any one of the banks in the hypothecation chain goes broke, you won't get a penny on the share for it.  And all the banks are broke. 
The wealth has already been transferred. The physical gold at the Comex is 1/500th of the paper promises for gold issued by it. There is nothing but dust really. 
Get some gold. Fix up that old Chevy. Talk about this. A few Bitcoins might make you rich. 
In case you doubt this:  
Time's up!!

It's not a proper concern of anyone else, especially through the proxy of government what is to be used as money.

Why? If I must tolerate violent encroachment as deemed necessary by law, then unless we are really ruled by a superior alien species, by symmetry, the state humans must be violently opposed by the other humans if necessary to maintain rights.  On the topic of money, this will be very interesting to observe and participate in. State collusion of maintaining monopoly power of money is a corner column of state power. I again say this is an invalid role for government. It serves no purpose other than state power,  So this is decrementing the individual the freedom to cherish which ever money object they wish solely for the purpose that some humans can be boss.  This, if need be, can be rightfully dispensed with any means necessary.  Given the current nature of the world, it is a distinct possibility that the state will not relinquish the monopoly of money easily.  I don't think it will come to violence simply that the potency of government is not sufficient for invading homes and prohibiting clicking on a Bitcoin address.
In short, until we dispense with violence as a mechanism for getting along, the "governed" are as right as the "governing" in its application. If we are ready to start the conversation of removing violence from negotiating getting along, I am all for it!

Sure. But it's a huge risk. To get cut out of the world banking network, that is the BIS coordinated banks, SWIFT, etc is in today's world a death sentence for a bank. Even small domestic banks in the US can't touch pot dealers in Colorado because the larger banks will cut them off for contravening Federal law. To be a bank is to be connected to other banks and if the fiat printers in the middle don't like what you are doing, forget about being in business. That's why I think Bitcoin or even any real crypto asset that has a price, is oil and water to a bank. 
Which is awesome.  We get to gorge on their lunches until they are ready to drop fiat altogether. I know that's wildly speculative but it is my best guess of the future of say 7 to 20 years from now.  
There is an awful lot of chatter emanating from the centres of the fiat world about blockchain coins being produced by them.  The moment I can acquire a central bank crypto asset and crypto transfer without permission to another address of someone whose identity is irrelevant, is the day that the fiat world expires forever. It will evaporate to dust. The rush to the exits by other central banks and commercial banks to offer crypto money will shatter that glass house into a million pieces. On that thought, I am going to put away a decent bottle of Italian pink sparkling wine (my favourite of the sparkling wines) and pop it the moment I buy and then sell a central bank crypto object.

Neither the developers nor the miners determine the outcome. How much either of them "care" is moot.  The only people that matter are the users and as a current proxy to the value of that future utility, the investors.

Look at the market cap. It's very near to all time high. Only at the very peak of price a few years ago was market cap significantly exceeding where it is now. 
In other words, the substantial quantity inflation of coins has been absorbed by the market. Now that the high proportional inflation period of Bitcoin is over, the price will track incoming investment much closer. You will get your upward move in price. 
Well, if we can add substantially more transaction capacity that is.
@_date: 2016-10-13 00:54:56
Well, ultimately my preference is to eliminate violence as a mechanism for social negotiation. It's increasingly an anachronism. I mean that. Arrest, jail, threats of weapons use, actual weapons use, are all undesirable. That's a bit too optimistic. Humans can be violent, so state violence as a defence against natural human violence is necessarily acceptable.  But violence is applied with far more extravagance than necessary. Multi year prison terms for pot smoking, drawing of weapons at traffic stops, roaming streets with APC vehicles, arrest without charge for matters of political conscience (terrorism) etc are all examples.  
I have no personal desire for violence, quite the opposite. I am simply stating that rights matter and can be defended with equal and greater means than deployed by the usurper. Our states are very violent and so may/must be resisted similarly. 
The symmetry argument is easy. If person A and person B are alone in the world who has rights of rulership over the other?  So, no human can rightfully govern, regardless of lineage, process, numbers, etc.  There is no basis for a logically consistent morally objective case for the existence of forceful dominance.  In fact we have inherited our governments from historical chains of brutal dominance. 
I am not governed. Do I comply with people in a position to mortally harm me? Of course. But that is not the same thing at all.

99.999% pure FUD.   
On Bitcoin blockchain transactions are the first purely accurate transaction record in human history.  They are extremely useful. They are limited in quantity. They will always have a price. A variety of innovations will enable at least a 10X capacity increase in on chain transactions per second.  
Miners will always get paid well.  Their overall reward is to pay them to do a certain job. Mundane guessing of a hash that matches the required parameter. The truth comes from the transaction record, not the miners. They don't need some magical proportion of the ecosystem. There just needs to be some money there for them to solve the hash puzzle. The OP panders to miner greed not ecosystem health. 
Bitcoins have value because they represent a new phenomenon, trustless transactions.  This will always be their value proposition. 
Off chain transactions require more trust, but are still exceedingly useful. Lightning is not trustless but very low trust. 
Setting the block size when demand is below 1MB is low cost and trivially accommodated. Miners setting the blocksize when the demand is enourmous is very very different. To equate the two is stunning. Either there is zero economic sensibility or this is a purposefully specious and misleading argument. It is another YOLO argument which all Unlimited arguments come down to. 
Perhaps the argument he really wants to make is for a small inflationary tail reward of 1% annually or something to anchor rewards as fees reach some unknown future variable.

Thats pretty close to my understanding as well. I think it's a brilliant idea and as Bitcoin's  adoption grows there will be an increasing coincidence of potential users and it will become utilized more and more.  It's out there yet. And I think that is what we will see over the next year or two, small usage but with real growth. In an idealized world where everyone uses Bitcoin, Lightning can take essentially an infinite amount of transactions off main chain.  It's a worthy experiment, even if it doesn't moonshot immediately.

I wonder if there is a simplified game theory analysis that could be performed. Like assume an infinite number of malfeasant nodes and 90% of mining hashing is malfeasant and they are all colluding. How many honest nodes are required to defeat that disregarding geography and redundancy.  Partly I want to say just one node because the truth is trivial to prove but the lie is very very hard to propagate.  Obviously it's probably not that easy and then there is real world considerations. I wonder if the network really needs more than 50 scattered around and safe from being shut down.

Not in the slightest.  
In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance is expanding.  
The banks have a number of choices. One is to use blockchains with limited permission as simply documentation systems for potential efficiency gains. That is irrelevant to Bitcoin.  Another is to create assets on blockchains. If these assets are controlled by private keys that are created and edited by the banks themselves then they are fancy bank accounts. Which are irrelevant to Bitcoin. If the assets are controlled by private keys that are created by the user then the asset is another alt coin with bankish properties (infinite arbitrary expansion, KYC) and they will not have value, so they are irrelevant to Bitcoin.
Another choice is to breathe life into altcoins that suit them, like Ripple and Ethereum. This is interesting to watch. 
A final choice is just to accept a functioning open prootocol and buy btc as necessary or even as a hedge.  This is unlikely as they need fiat to survive.  
And perhaps they just become extinct. Really.

I was having a similar conversation recently. Without narcotics even, we talked about human intention, time travel, multidimensional manifestation of reality, Einstein, Hawkings, Dawkins, the unmentionable candidates.  
We ended with that humanity must move past money. My co conversant had the opinion that money is such a drag and been so harmful.  Of course this is true, but I tried to argue that Bitcoin is not money like that; it's a better quality money.  
A little later, I realized that Bitcoin (and it's cousins and spawn) are money but not really. They are so much more, money is just one narrow perspective.  This stuff is superconductor of human intention.  
And just so you know, I won't be licensing out my intention to any superiors ever again. Nobody can proxy my care and intention. Can't work. Look what they do with that scalped power.  I no longer intend to fund nightmares like countries.  The USA and all the rest of them went to Syria to, well, it's obvious but people don't like to hear it. 
So if you want to help me find ways to channel my intentions to good purpose, all I need is the direct channel. Communication of value, intention, caring, love even.

 Well ok, but what I am getting at is there a way to measure the "economic majority," which is well approximated by the market cap.

But the miners may very well prefer a different scenario not at all preserving what benefits the ecosystem in the long term, by selfishness or mistake. 
I guess the best way to do it is to operate a node that won't accept BU blocks. It just seems a little after the fact, especially if the hashrate gets to 50-50 and destabilizes the network.

I don't think they can compete with Bitcoin (or more generally an open source, permissionless entry blockchain). 
 An identity based, account based blockchain is trivially silly (Onecoin), and would not hold value; it wouldn't even be tradeable on Shapeshift. So they can't do that route. 
A coin that is open source and has permissionless entry, is .... an altcoin. So a central bank could become an altcoin developer, but then they will have just given up the ghost of being in charge of money. 
Not great choices for a central bank. 
This is going to be an absolute gas. We have front row seats to what will, in my opinion, be the most important revolution in history. Banker power is still climbing toward its zenith.

All of that nightmare is about to evaporate.

Demystify this for me.  
I have always wondered about the real threat of a 51% hack.  Sure a majority of mining hashing can overpower the rest of the network and continue to build on the blockchain with invalid transactions in it. BUT, it is trivially easy for any full node to examine every block for validity, so almost anyone can tell precisely which block and transaction is the first fake one.   
So what happens then, clearly the invalid chain could continue to grow but who will use it?  Within a few block periods at most, I would think the network goes down (or really just unused) and some agreement is reached within a day or so to restart at the last known good block. A few transactions (dozens??)  would have to be re-entered into the mem pool.... A small pain.  Hashing minority still could add to a valid chain and ignore all the invalid forklets imposed by the majority. Again trivially easy for a full node to know which chain is valid.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:38:04
I think that the economic majority prefers digital gold over cheap payments. Even if (which I don't think will happen), a BU client reaches a 90% of hash rate, I think a lot of people will hold their original chain coins. I will be. 
The original chain would be in a precarious position. Prone to 51% attack, changing the PoW algo, But it may very well be the better coin in the end.  
I do not think that the interests of a handful of miners are at all the same interests as the overall economy of Bitcoin. It is clear that advocates of BU place Bitcoin's attribute of permissionless money at a fairly low priority.  The idea that we get trust-less money by trusting the miners...

If there is no scaling improvement and fees rise too high, the growth in economic utility of Bitcoin will stall. Price will likely retrace as much of the price is speculation of economic utility.  This will create something of an existential crisis for Bitcoin.
On the r btc subreddit, there is a body of thought that's convincing. Ultimately the power to adjust the blocksize will be seized by miners, because they can and why wouldn't they. Client software, Unlimited, that provides this will be inevitably increasingly adopted by miners leaving Core behind.  There is also the notion that the hardfork would do its most to leave all of small blocks, SegWit and Lightning in the ashcan as they would try to take a large majority of hashpower along and time the fork to maximize the damage to a Core chain in an attempt to kill it off. 
It's interesting and not without logic. The key flaw is arrogance that the miners would look after the ecosystem.  It would probably lead to a bloated chain, and a miner centric ecosystem and likely subject to permissioned nature.  
There seems to be many that are sort of vindictive and blood thirsty and have no sensibility towards allowing for a splitting of the chain to allow the current Core experiment to unfold.

You do understand that on blockchain transactions are quite different than Lightning or offchain transactions.  There is no way that a Lightning fee will be anywhere near a blockchain fee. It's just not as high quality.  That's the point, plentiful, cheap, no memory on the blockchain but still low trust.  
The blockchain won't handle all transactions. Lightning is one solution of limited use and market to create off chain capacity.  Don't use it if you don't want.  Miners will be fine. They will handle millions of high value transactions per day.

"Raise" $1.2T.  Sounds euphemistically as if they just have to go out to willing investors and get them to part with wages for a potential return.  
By now we know that "raise" means currency debauchery, tax dollars and theft.
All of these institutions are quite easily replaced. A mass global bank bankruptcy would be very painful but temporary. Economy would rise of course with new financial mechanisms.  What bailouts and bailins and free loans from Central banks accomplishes is simply the maintenance of ownership structure of the banks that have closed relationship with the central banks, even through bankruptcy.  The same people that employ Jamie Dimon will continue to own the production of currency. And if Jamie Dimon's vision is true, we get the choice of bearing the expense or prison.

Whatever might be tried will be extreme overreach.  
There is nothing from an objective moral judgment that says money should be a tool of law enforcement or permission of its transfer should be a crime prevention mechanism.
The right to cherish or value something requires no defence. It is a matter of conscience.  The right to accept anything of value as fruits of labour requires defence but is at least as fundamental as rights of speech or association.  
Our task as Bitcoiners is not to change Bitcoin to suit the status quo, but exactly vice versa.
Bitcoin is as empowering to the individual as was the printing press or the Internet, moreso perhaps.  It is properly viewed as a medium of human desire.  The Internet is a medium of human thought. Electricity is a medium of mechanical force.  They are in the space of open knowledge.

So, I don't disagree.  
Money transfer by banks is such a convoluted time delayed, clutch, grab, leverage  and pilfer operation that the essence of communication is lost.  
But that was kind of my point. With an easy to read global ledger with mercurial transfer quality without "repeaters" with derivatives attached, the communication is very pure.  I transfer 99.99% of exactly what I sent.  That's a measurable loss with no noise. So I think Bitcoin most importantly is a medium. Of human intention.  Worthy of celebration.  Dimon? We just route around loss and noise. 
Edit: so sequential double entry adjustments between trust institutions is just comparatively silly and the opportunity for malfeasance is zero.

Bitcoin has very good qualities to be a reserve asset. It is neutral, that is, all other currencies are controlled by someone's rival. It has no counterparty.   It can not be inflated away. It's value in the eye of the individual is purely voluntary. It has superior monetary properties. It has better unit of account properties, better portability, has been something of a store of value, it is more recognizable than any other money. It only lacks capacity to be a wide spread medium of exchange, which doesn't stop gold from being a reserve asset.  
 If it is to happen, the countries that move first into acquiring it, will benefit tremendously. If I were a central banker I would hedging out of USD. They are about to face their Waterloo in Syria.  They must win to expand the empire to finance their blackhole of debt, but they will not succeed militarily.

If the private keys aren't created ad hoc by the end user and therefore the asset is tradable in ad hoc markets, then the blockchain in question is no improvement over accounts based assets.
If the keys and market are ad hoc, it is completely unrelated to the business of banking.

It's really simplistic. Yes at some level a single transaction fee is friction.

If fees are $.05 at some blocksize, they will be right around $.025 at twice the blocksize.

Just plain disagree. There is no part of fiat-central banks- banks that operates without the other.
Banks primary mechanism of profit is fractional reserve lending of zero cost fiat.  This business model does not exist for Bitcoin.  Fractional reserve credit of Bitcoin will exist. (It has to and there is nothing to prevent it.)  But infinite expansion to back credit companies failure will evaporate. 
This is such a change to banking as to render the term bank meaningless.  It is as fundamental as the difference between the Church of England ruling England and the Anglican Church offering a Sunday meetup club.  
This cleaves central banks from their conglomeration with state and greatly reduces the power of both.

1. So what? If it rises in value it's good for me. Who said that my savings are meant to sponsor some greater good by giving up value?  Clearly the loss in value does not go to the greater good (whatever that is supposed to mean anyway). The loss in value is gained by the money in the inflation. It's theft of my accumulated capital/stored labour. Any objective sense of ethic, can see that this is wrong. It is well well within my orb of right to choose a preference of money.  Goosing spending by fear of inflation is also an economic fallacy for two reasons. The progress of civilization has future goods presented to us of much higher quality and better price than past goods; mass impoverishing the future for consumption today CAN NOT be a net benefit. Consumption does not enrich the consumer, however accumulation of wealth does; mass enrichment CAN ONLY be a net benefit.   It is clear then that inflation is an us against them phenomenon, enforced by government, which is clearly an invalid role for government. 
2. It's not a Ponzi. Ponzis only give the impression of gains to early participants. Ponzi himself said it was critical in the early days of a scheme to allow early participants to withdraw as much as they wish. Bitcoin's value is an open, quite easy to enter and exit free market.

So I think we can define trust as the proportion of references of a non node client to the network that return a correct  "read" of the state of the blockchain. A perfectly trustworthy scenario, trust = 1.
Then the question arises as to how many nodes need to be in place so that a reasonably close approximation to 1, is achieved. Let's say six nines, t&gt;0.999999 99.9999% of references to the network product a true result, the UTXO value in question is correct. Perhaps six nines isn't good enough as it still an error rate of one in a million, but let's start there. 
I think we can also define a functioning node as one whose blockchain is correct (longest chain) up to the latest appended block.  I think it's concrete enough to rely on the sanity of the blockchain. It's really tough to spoof an appending block, but of course there can be blocks solved independently that differ. 
Since nodes sanity check the network and settle on the correct blockchain, deviations get erased promptly.  
One node has zero integrity as it is not sanity checked. Two is no better because which persists in event of deviation?  Three would be pretty trustworthy because deviations can be settled.  I think this is modelable, but it's beyond me.  
This of course assumes well intentioned nodes.  Then we have to look at the matters of intentional malfeasance.  And the factors you discuss.  
End users will never run nodes in quantity.  We don't need a billion full nodes, or even anywhere near 6000. In an ideal state where all nodes are independent and incented to behave, what are the practical attack vectors?  I think the attacks get really really unlikely at a fairly low number of nodes. The blockchain and latest appended block are really tough to spoof.  
So how many? Hundreds seems like far more than necessary.

All global trade by OPEC and most other oil producers is done only in FedRes coins (aka USDollars).  This is also true of more than half of global trade.  
This is well documented.  It has been achieved by military force: revolutions, coups, assasinations, etc.  What is happening in Syria (and almost invisibly currently in Yemen) is a military intervention to force an agenda of the interests of the dominant monetary systems.
Attaching economy to notions is how dollars and euros get value. Domestically people pay taxes (by compulsion) so government bonds have future value and are sold to acquire dollars from banks today to run government.  Internationally, compelling nations to acquire debt and also compelling their trade in USDollars (or more accurately Federal Reserve Notes) puts economic value into these imaginary notional dollars.  
This is why Bitcoin matters. It derives its value because it is useful.  It does not derive it's usefulness by force and all the subsequent atrocities that derive from the moral delinquency of force use.

It is fundamentally a bank controlled asset if the end user does not create the private key. In that sense, it is no better than a bank account.  If there is a key management system controlled by the bank, the user still does not have ad hoc control.  
Faster and more accountable are differences with not nearly the same distinction as the ability to trade the asset with a self wrought private key.

Bitcoin is money as a pure signal. As in Claude Shannon/Information Science signal.  That is to say that we can now see it as having a transmitter, a receiver, a medium,loss,  and  noise. 
Signal to Noise ratio is radically improved compared to double entry accounting through central bank and bank media where inflation/theft noise is quite dominant.  The entry into the Blockchain is transmitted with digital accuracy intact minus miners fees (loss).
This by corollary makes human intention and commerce purely transmittable.  This is an enourmous leap forward in civilization, and we won't tolerate the likes of Jamie Dimon interfering with our ability to interact purely.  
Individuals will decide what is money. Governments will have nothing to say about it. The more pure the transmission (ie perfect signal to noise), the better the quality of the money.

The plan only works if they outlaw barter and that seems to me to be impossible.  
If I can accept anything (!) of value in exchange for my wares, such as in barter, I can accept control of an unspent Tx output in a ledger, or apples or gold or dog poo. 
For a state to legislate otherwise is an attempt to legislate conscience, to legislate perceived desirability. Any state that does so loses the larger endgame of legitimacy.  This is subtle but is existentially important for the bank state conglomerate.  
We are at a turning point that was inconceivable even six months ago.  Central banks and their credit expansion channels (banks) are wriggling like worms on a hook to defend against Bitcoin.

So I agree with your TL;DR and quite frankly cringed at Mr. Antonopolous' direct statement about US creating ISIS.
Where I think it's all relevant to Bitcoin is to take a half step back and look at that wars and coups and assasinations and other moral monstrosities are well understood only through economic lenses and very often precisely understood through monetary lenses.
All fiat derives its value through force. Domestically through taxes, internationally through the CIA in USD case. Trade happens in USD and not say gold derivatives  because it is a dominant currency, enourmous and liquid.  There are many documented cases of clear CIA intervention designed to indebt and force trade of nations into USD.  Rebel groups have been very useful to the these ventures.  I think that Iraq and Afghanistan and now Syria are the US gov not requiring clandestine operations because they are not challenged by anyone, enemies or citizens. 
Syria is about getting the economic interests of the Federal Reseve achieved by its proxy corporation, the USA capturing the resource of natural gas supply to Europe against the last remaining outpost of national monetary sovereignty, Russia, in a long game of eventually brining the resources of Russia into the control of the BIS.
It's the simplest and most evidenced explanation.  Mr. Antonopolous is too not evidenced and aims too low.
Good, evil, ISIS, religion blah blah blah obfuscation.

There are two types of unit of account, economic (where the unit maintains economic value over time), and accounting (where the unit maintains itself as same over time).  These are not compatible in this Universe as change over time just is. 
Monetarists like Friedman want to manage the fiat quantity to keep the value of the fiat stable.  Keynes fantasized that.money is a prime driver of economic rather than merely a price informer. Both falsely prescribe manipulation of currency as meaningful in economy. 
We accept an annual small delta in macro accounting unit of account (central bank currency) in order that we have a local and short term approximation to units of account in day to day operations.  This is false.comfort.  Fiat is egregiously non-meritous, fails in gruesome fashion and requires imposition by "authority" (itself a backwards concept).  
Goosing spending through fear of inflation is terrible.  It separates the poor from a potential future of being capital owners. It creates present consumption, which, due to innovation, is of poorer quality than future consumption. It threatens devaluation of past (stored value) compensation for labour. Etc, etc, etc, etc.  Sure it gooses exports temporarily.  That we don't discuss the downsides speaks to successful myth propagation (propaganda).
This is why Bitcoin or whichever of its progeny comes to be the dominant crypto (Monero has the correct qualities), will be worth 100s of $T in 2017 dollars purchase power.  It has perfect accounting unit of account.  It is civilization's best price conveyor (in the present).  It has horrible price mechanism for future prices.  That will only change when it accomplishes a very high liquidity pool and not be prone to greater than aggregate growth deltas in valuation.

Perhaps it might help if you looked at the evidence that suggests that "USA" is a proxy for Federal Reserve. CIA is an assassination and coup machine that forces nation's debt and trade onto the Federal Reserve Note, and Sauudi Arabia is an invention of the deal that put the Sauud family in charge of the Arabian Peninsula in exchange for US military protection and a monopoly of trade of oil in Federal Reserve Notes globally.
It also leads to the tight corollary that little that the US Federal State does has anything to do with the providence of the people that live south of the 49th parallel and north of the Rio Grande.
Or in short, it's what the money printers want.  The USA is a concept and has no intention or desire.  Those are qualities of living creatures.

If there are non monetary applications for blockchains, then great. I personally am not all that interested in those. If value transfer is not the main application (ie the UTXOs have no price in an accesible market), it's not what I am here for. 
Frankly I do think you (and the banks) are incorrect. The blockchain was invented for the purpose of permissionless peer to peer transferrance of UTXOs. Value tranfer happens only it the UTXO has a price. Only one blockchain has a coin of nontrivial price.  This is not just me exhibiting fear and greed as you accuse.  These are facts of the market. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 06:13:44
Here is the way I look at it.
Money has the ability to act as a proxy for other wealth and is best as a transfer mechanism the more etherial it is. This is a slight paradox, in that the more notional a token is, it is simultaneously more concrete as money and less concrete as anything else. Credit money (fiat) was a great advancement precisely because of how notional it is. Credit money by computer is an advancement of degree but not of kind.  
Bitcoin (or its successors) is great advancement in money again.  I truly believe that.  A single accessible transaction record of bearer units with perfect immutability and adhoc usability is such a superior creature to matching double entry accounting credit money via credit institutions, it is hard to emphasize it enough.
Bank money is heavily burdened with problems and inefficiencies. These create an enourmous drag and interference on commerce.
If we think that a child with reasonable environments and resource will be capable as any other, and we postulate the net capacity of humanity's productive capacity with borderless commerce free from the burden of bank money, we can see a much much wealthier (in real terms) planet. Adhoc money will be a wealth enabler. 
Bank money survives on state sponsorship. Bitcoin survives on voluntary attraction.  In competition, there is no place for the former.  People will use Bitcoin (or again its progeny), quite universally.  While there may be need for different types and some may come and go, there will never be more than a large handful of global voluntary currencies.  
I want Bitcoin to succeed, but even I am amazed at how little impact on the overall ecosystem comes from very compelling alternatives.  If Etherium had first mover status, there would be zero need of Bitcoin. 
So what proportion of wealth of an enabled free-to-be-wealthy globe will be held in voluntary money. Quite a lot I think. If the money is good quality in its purpose of transferance, it will be good store of value in a virtuous cycle.  
So is 10% of all wealth held in money outlandish? Maybe not.

Blockchains with private keys managed by banks are no real advancement from bank accounts. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:42:36
Four years from now. 
Bitcoin will either be irrelevant (like it really still is in the scheme of things) or it will be very relevant.  Whatever the blocksize, the economic value of demand of transacting using the main chain will be proportional to the overall conduction of value, the quantity of transactions just sub divides that.  I do think there is a fee size that is too resistive, so more transactions per second and greater blocksize is needed, but that isn't the point at all.  The demand for miner services will be proportional to the overall economy and will be reflected in the value of the block reward and fees.  
Bitcoin onchain transactions are the highest quality transactions performed in human history. They are of limited quantity. They will always have a price. These are of higher quality than offchain transactions. If there is demand for lower quality offchain transactions, there will certainly be demand for onchain transactions.  
Miners will be paid enough to do their mundane job. That's all that matters.

No one is going to run it. Just like Bitcoin. 
A programmer creates a smart contract that maybe has a Lighthouse type of surety contract, that is, if the fund reaches say 1000 btc, then purchase some varying percent of each (aggregate 100%) of a number of cypto controlled stocks.  Under one of defined circumstances (fund doubles in value of bitcoins, fund falls in half, fund reaches maturity date), the smart contract executes trades of the stocks and disburses the proceeds to Bitcoin addresses as defined in the contract, controlled by the investors. Some fee gets paid to the programmer.  It's automated.  Once the contract is born, it just fulfills its conditions.
Bitcoin replaces the need for a bank in a mutual fund.

It's sort of the beautiful thing about all of this.  Money was the original intended purpose by Nakamoto. In fact money is the only established application (and established is a big stretch).  Banks and central banks and fiat are one organism. They do not exist without one another and they need a lot of assurance from "men with guns."  The whole nature of central banking is forcing populations to trade labour, etc for imaginary notions. Double entry ledgers kept private are easy to cheat with. That is the reason we need so much regulation to keep banks in check. This has still failed however.  Malfeasance and scam is prevalent and unpunished. 
Bitcoin is sunlight and bleach to all of this. Central bank ledger management is replaced by algorithm. Third party intermediation (banks) is replaced by cryptographic transfer.  Failures due to fractional reserve debt collapse is replaced by transparency and having asset without liability.  Risk allocation is not a monopoly; fiat distribution is.
Fiat can not be put natively on a blockchain. The more banks use Bitcoin, the quicker they hasten their demise.  They are dead walking and they know it.  They are hoping to cross the revolution in the same position they have now. I can't see how.

Banks do several things that Bitcoin impacts directly.
Money movement. I assume this is obvious.
Getting money in reach of people. Leaving discussion of physical cash aside for a moment. Bank ledgers are how people have money and use money. Debit cash from a ledger at my bank, credit cash to a ledger at yours. Whatever the mechanism. In doing so, fiat (and more actually fiat derivative by fractional expansions) is made useful to people. Bitcoin denecessitates this business model up to and including the central bank issuing the fiat.  This is the primary purpose of banks in society, to be accurate double entry ledger keepers of fiat on a massive and interjoined scale.  
Credit creation.  It will take a bigger brain than mine to figure out this one.  I can not think how credit will be done in Bitcoin without banks or something like them and frankly while there is price uncertainty, who the heck is in a position to cover the futures risk?

Egan-Jones, the story was a little different than what I stated above.  The gist of it is that the big ratings firms abetted the banks through the mortgage backed security debacle (you know that 2008 bubble burst that enriched bankers but the rest of us haven't fully paid off yet). Egan Jones had the audacity to rate MBS accurately and was re-rating government debt as governments took over the MSBs. The SEC barred them from rating those instruments specifically. 
Unlike the big agencies, Egan Jones has no conflicts of interest by serving financial firm as accountants and sells services to investors on a custom basis while releasing some information publicly.  They were banned temporarily -18 months - at the peak of the problem for government debt. Their transgression was that they exaggerated their filings when getting certified. It amounted to a weak technicality. They hadn't published their ratings on a public forum consistently for as long as they had claimed in their filings. So the big insider agencies which abetted a $multi-trillion fraud got away with continuing to mislead investors but the accurate independent firm was muzzled. The big agencies were fined years later, but still are beholden to big banks. 
They were made to go dark about the MSB funds and government bonds which remained rated overly high through the crisis. 
Instead of banks and governments having to face the music, the Federal Reserve quadrupled its balance sheet and thus has no way to bring interest rates to a level approximating market price.
My own conclusion was that government forms a conglomerate with banks and that this needed to be cleaved for the integrity of both finance and government.   And so that's why I Bitcoin. That and about a 30X return on investment in 4 years.

Sidechains: 
How do two way pegs work?  I understand that to move btc onto a sidechain, the user creates a transaction that locks the btc from use.  Then assets or coins are created on the sidechain.  How are they created? Does this then somewhat make the sidechain coin monetary policy somewhat depend on Bitcoin and the amount of incoming btc onto the chain?  
If the sidechain coin has a market price, what happens when there is a significant relative price change in the assets in the time while the bitcoins are locked. This would seem a bit problematic in both relative directions of change.

The COMEX is a COModity EXchange. It trades commodities including precious metals.  It trades "paper" gold futures and holds some physical gold.  In a way it's a gold reserve bank.  The paper derivatives can be cashed in for physical gold settlement.  It's a bit of a farce because it's physical holdings are something like 1/500th of the equivalent paper futures it has issued. The price of gold is somewhat reflected by the over abundance of these paper issues.  So gold hodlers will usually prefer to hodl physical gold in their own possession. 
The OP is asking what happens if something similar takes place in Bitcoin where a derivative form of promise to deliver btc becomes in itself a market commodity. This might produce a large quantity of derivative that suppresses the "real" btc price. 
I am not moved to much by this.  1) Free markets allow for derivatives, so what can you do? 2) Bitcoins are transported digitally, gold is not.  One of the purposes of gold derivatives is to make gold transportable digitally.  Less of this will happen with a btc derivative. 3) Gold is notoriously hard to verify. This is the source of banker malfeasance dating back to the Medicis.  Bitcoin is trivial to verify the reserve claims of the banker.  
Bitcoin IOUs are completely necessary to bootstrap an economy on Bitcoin.  Roger Ver should be doing that if he wants transaction capacity, Reliable futures markets for btc, will mean proper macro level loans and commodity trading, etc etc.

Central banks blow bubbles, big banks capture money that must be derived from future economy, sell off both ends of the debt, and if anything goes sour, are publicly assisted. That's grotesque, massive, government assisted theft.

The big difference is that "clearing" with Bitcoin means that the end users have exchanged a bearer asset directly, whereas with banks, "clearing" means a chain of trusted ledgers must be updated all the way to some aggregated authority (central bank).  The former is done simply in an easily verified blockchain. The latter is a closed door, chronically malfeasant, leaky, maze of middle man accounting which at its heart must remove preference of money from large populations of labourers to keep its archaic dishonest wheels turning. 
Just a preference I guess.

I am one of those that you refer to that feel the entirety of banks and government must be undone.  
From a basic principle. One person can not declare rulership over another without consent. This does not change with numbers or power.  It is perfectly rightful to not consent to be governed.  Assertion of governance is wrongful.
Now, practically we have developed ways to get along that require some rules.  There is compatibility between objective moral standards and anarchy.  In fact, they are completely compatible.   What is not morally acceptable is governance by people.
I am against autarchy. And that is what we have.  We have an oligarchy (so says Jimmy Carter) that puts regulars below the law, governors ahove it and central banks on top of it all.  
Any system that allows for governance by people will fail into autarchy.  USA makes this clear.  
We need rules without rulers.  Bitcoin is an important example.  Money that is attractive not compelled.
I think voluntary civilized society is possible.  Governance of any kind fails important moral standards.
Banks are fine, but not as enforcers of monopoly money power.
And if 99% of people don't agree that does not make me the extremist.  Millions dead, vast stolen wealth, invasive governments, cages for weed, wars and so on.  Very extreme and low standards to accept that.

Ok.  Nice and easy and slow for the non-blasphemers. 
1) A blockchain is a rather unwieldy data structure whose sole purpose is an unmutable open transaction record. That is the solution for trust without trusting humans. Humans can not be trusted.  
2) A blockchain is a purely a transaction record.  The transactions are valid signatures by private keys to public addresses.  The notion of a coin or token springs from the transactions record.  There is no double entry ledger separate from the instrument itself as there is with bank currencies.
3) Creating and maintaining this record is only trustworthy if it is exceedingly difficult for an actor or small group of colluding actors to modify the transaction record.
4) To date only proof of work consensus systems are trustworthy. Any other consensus method is much more hackable.  Hackable meaning the ability to retroactively modify the transaction record.
5) Proof of work is incented by the token having value. If the value of the token is not a voluntary market value but rather subsidized, then it is hackable by the subsidizing actor.  
6) Despite hundreds, many brilliant, attempts to create voluntary priced alternatives, there is essentially zero success in creating ecosystems around any blockchains other than The Blockchain.
7) There are no Goliath crypto coins.  Not even a single attempt at a marketable Krugman crypto coin, a jam it down your throat backed by men with guns coin.  It is plain that compulsion based value and open source crypto ledgers are incompatible.
8) So, while "blockchain technologies" may prove valuable as a settlement record gadget, that is a trivial outcome.  The real deal is that a non forgeable, transferable, digital artefact commodity with exceedingly good money like properties has been created.  The revolution, should there be one, is still in the original application: programmable, easy to transfer, peer to peer, voluntary, low trust money.  Within that revolution only The Blockchain and its token have achieved noteworthy status.  Goliath, in this case, can not even fathom a weapons free commerce. There is no David, only really interesting open source code and a fascinating voluntary counterculture.
I, for one, will welcome the market hawking and likely failure of our prior overlords' compulsion based altcoins.

There is a subtle but critical notion here.  
Capitalism has conveniently tied itself to the notion of free markets. Capitalism is a great socialist evil. It is the control of capital by cartel with enforcement by government. It is an alternate form of socialism.  It is fascism of money. Fascism is a branch of socialism whereby production is owned privately but tightly supported in both directions with government.  Typical socialism has production controlled by bureacrats.
Careful use of the language should distinguish between markets and Capitalism.

If the UTXOs aren't on an openly readable ledger, if the system is not permissionless and open source, I am not interested. 
If there is no price for UTXOs in an accessible market, it isn't money.  It's a time stamping documentation system. 
If the assets do become available in accessible markets and they are not transferrable via private key, they have not changed the world.
Bank money is conjured out of the notions of central banks and gets value by force of government. It can not exist like that on a blockchain. If it's not born on a blockchain, it can only be documented by one. 
There is only one blockchain with an ecosystem, private key transferrance of UTXOs and UTXOs with a market price. Those are the cards on the table.
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:59:08
What is meant here by the term "settlements"? 
My read is that both the use of Bitcoin chain or private chains for settlement is not really settlement per se but  immutable documentation of trades so that each party can thereby quickly and confidently update pro forma balance sheets. That is to say, securities are not being transferred on these chains, merely documented. Securities are not securities without markets.  I have heard nothing of cryptographically transferrable assets from these bank ventures, only data record applications.  If I am accurate in that then, the application of settlements really means assistance in settlement through perfectly reconciliable records. If so, it is of very little interest.  It's helpful to banks but it is not anywhere near as fundamental as Bitcoin or crypto transferrable assets.
If banks are actually creating marketable crypto assets with bank join tpermission proof of stake protocols, that seems a pretty poor asset (ie not secured well by large hashing).

I have paid attention to you as a thought leader in the space since seeing you speak and rubbing shoulders with you in San Jose and not then knowing much. You, more than any have had an articulate clarity of thinking about the purpose of Bitcoin as a liberating vehicle.
Freedom from the deeply sinister debt and death paradigm of the world's one bank is what keeps me hodling at the times if I were smart I would be shrinking from the market, keeps me vocal when 9 out of 10 think I am loony.
Who knows where all this goes, but today I am confident freedom seeking people will have options. Anywhere there is an IP connection.
I feel fortunate that I had a career building the Internet, the first undermining of control in media and information. I feel blessed to have carried some weight of the lance that the fiat breathing dragon itself puts on its magazine cover.  If I live to see the nukes dissolved, I can have peace.  
Thanks again on a day worth celebrating.

Do you think that there may evolve other asset types than cryptocurrency that also require open consensus due to their being cryptographically transferable?
I thought that was some of the idea with coloured coins and t0 for example.

@_date: 2015-11-13 09:32:45
If a bank or group of banks offers a centralized Blockchain with keys managed centrally, the asset or coin is not created by a random number generator. In which case, it is hackable from external or editable from internal. The market for the asset then is controlled. So there is no difference between this coin and a bank account.
If the keys for the bank group alt coin are created without permission, ie by a user random number, then the bank group alt coin will have to compete in the altcoin ecosystem. This is the key advancement in finance that Bitcoin has enabled.  It creates an electronic asset whose price is only derived from its desirability.  Compare that to fiat whose value is derived from government force by removing alternatives.  Since banks live and die by access to central bank fiat, they can never offer a coin that offers Bitcoin's radical properties surrounding openness and monetary policy. Therefore they can only offer really crappy altcoins. Who would store value in a coin whose quantity is set by committee on a monthly basis?  
This then means the banks do not have an easy way out as you suggest.  They can not offer Bitcoin's qualities without ending their own business model.
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:35:57
It seems not blurry at all.  The actual settlements, it seems then, happen in traditional manner. Ie, legal transfer happens later with Blockchain documentation acting as proof of transaction.  
This is clearly distinct from the notion of cryptographically signing transfer of control of a UTxO.

Well, I gave you a literal definition for anarchy. 
Left-right is a model. A false one. Left-right is two shades of grey, a false dichotomy as they both assume that the tension is truly between two styles of rulership.  
The real opposing notions are freedom and tyranny.  The false left-right paradigm is simplistically pretending some degree of choice in being ruled over.  You can keep pretending that that is what matters if you like. Not me. The choice is to be owned or not owned, for me.  
As I get a little older, I see that an entire mountain of lies are needed to salve the aggression of human ownership.  It's all about keeping someone in the boss chair. It was always grotesque and unnecessary and now we can confidently live without it. 
Internet has freed the word. Bitcoin will free the money. What are you going to do about it?  Threaten me? 
Humans are violent. But only quite rarely.  Any society will need to deal with that. Anarchism would not imply the absolute lack of violence, as humans will do it. Anarchism only says that violence as a method to create order or social cooperation is invalid.  An anarchistic society would have to deal with violence and from time to time employ it, just not as a mechanism to establish rulership. 
If people want to share costs of education, care, protection, they can. You may have little choice to create voluntary means to do such.  Force may become obsolete.

It's a fairly well presented argument. As an aside, if this is written by a Chinese native speaker, his writing skills in English are better than most North Americans. 
I am unconvinced by both camps, not leastly that the more esoteric technical aspects of solutions are either undeveloped, untested or difficult to extrapolate. It also all has an odour of desiring control. Both sides. For instance, claiming that coordinating timing of a fork is about consensus as it is meant to be, rather than killing off competition is specious. If there remains 20% of hashrate and an unknown quantity of users that desire a Core solution to at least live to try that experiment, it's presumptuous as hell to maximize damage to the other side.   The economy is the better part of the concensus than hashrate.  On the Core side, the patent fear of a hardfork, when they hold (past tense now?) enough cards to carry the hashrate needed to a 2MB block is selfish unenlightened leadership. 
While I remain a patient but skeptical Core supporter, I am happy to see some competition.

The only thing that really matters is how does "ownership" get determined and how is it transferred.   Cryptographic ownership and transfership requires no contract or court and is "bearer" in nature. Simple money tokens is the only demonstrated asset that currently performs well under crypto ownership. (Only one blockchain has an established asset of any kind). Futures, derivatives, gov and Corp bonds, equities, are all being experimented with, thank you very much Mr. Nakamoto!
Mundane public proofs of work are all that is necessary to verify transaction chains (thank you Mr. Back!), Undecipherable but verifiably sane transaction chains with crytpo  controls of assets seems inevitable. Institutional management of proxied ownership of assets seems exceedingly inefficient and prone to malfeasance.  This is an exciting moment in history.

We are branching into many topics. 
Thanks for that last reframing what's relevant. "...  if we're going to understand the nature of the economy, understanding the government's role in fiat currency supply is tremendously important."  At first, it was engaging, then that familiar light bulb came on.  No. The government's role money no longer matters.  You might have as well stated we need to understand Beelzibub's relationship to the Easter Bunny's crucification to know the planet's role in the grand scheme.  It's all fictional, faith based gobblydygoop.  There is no function of a central bank, settlement banks, commercial banks, bonds, equities or any other asset on trust account that can not trivially be created by a blockchain.  Gaining cultural acceptance of such will take perhaps a generation. Compelled trust is not just anachronistic and immoral, it's hypocritical.  Government itself is a faith based power system that invests heavily in untrue myth. Money, of course, is as necessary invention as the wheel. Government imposed monopoly of wheels is just as weird as for money.
The only question in our conversation that matters is indeed the  larger one: does the monetary system provide public utility with broad fair access to money and credit or does it serve narrow special interest? It only matters as a philosophical framing to show how repugnant fiat money is anyway. Whether it is banks or government that control that is perhaps relevant to that question. If it's banks, then it's pretty much case closed. If it's government, then it still may be serving narrow interests but at least there may be some fantasy of hope that somehow the blunt instrument of elections has or might impose fairness. 
The original assertion is that banks and bankers create USD and not really the government.  I stand by this assertion.  The Federal Reserve is a bank. It is comprised of its regional banks (not a part of government) which are owned by its member client commercial banks. There is no decision making by any member of government.  The only such decision was to license operation from Congress to the Federal Reserve Bank.  This could be brought under political governance by reversing this but that is highly unlikely because of more pressing issues (Bachelorette and Super Bowl).  There is no public audit. The Fed has no practical oversight by government.  
This is going to come down to preference.  You prefer to view that the top positions at the Fed are appointed as evidence that the Fed is "part of government".  I (correctly ;)) prefer to view that the Federal Reserve is a bank, administered independently of government (strike 1), who has direct relationship with commercial banks through regional Feds who are owned by these same commercial banks (strike 2), that has no public accountability (strike 3), who benefits from monopoly enforcement of legal tender (4), that gains value in exchange for labour and other economy through taxation and subsequent valuation of treasuries (5), who despite such entrenched social position has no public accountability (6), and who provides enourmous benefit to narrow interest (7).   
The appointments of a few positions is patina. The substance is that banks are in charge. There is no limit to the size of the Fed's balance sheet other than the size of banker malfeasance. 
The good news is that the system is as anachronistic as the era it was born.  An era before AM radio. Money can be literally anything. It is beyond the reach of government to define what two people will use as money.  So the dustbin awaits the Fed. The Fed is as in charge of money as the Post is in charge of mail. 
Regards treasuries as reserves.   They are considered bank reserves as they are cash like for purposes of bank solvency but not as "required reserves" for the purpose of fractional lending.  I was mistaken and confused myself with not a deeper understanding of the two usages of the word "reserves".  I hope you don't treat that as a "gotcha" because it is not one.  A bank's ability to expand money by acquiring, then depositing Federal Reserve Notes is still trivially easy and narrowly privileged and is overseen by the Fed.
We probably will part here as we won't convince either that the Fed is government.  It is not.   I hope you don't take any offence at some of the fun I am having.

Where to start? Fundamentally this is a misunderstanding between the asset and the systems of exchange.  Bitcoin collapses the accounting and the asset and the transfer to the same thing. So I guess it's possible to sympathize with the author. 
Bitcoin is an asset. A bearer asset at that,  A really high quality money asset. All of the so called desirables listed by the author are completely achievable by traditional means with Bitcoin as the underlying asset.   At its core protocol level Bitcoin transfers bearer asset without intermediary to anywhere on the planet. Gold can't do that. Fiat can't do that. Gold or fiat IOUs are actually what the author speaks of. All that can and will happen with Bitcoin in due course. Those might be third party IOUs and achieve everything fiat does or they might use Bitcoin's programmable object nature for things like Lightning Networks.  
There is nothing in article that Bitcoin can not do.

Well it's not impossible.  The conditions do not exist today.  
A mutual fund is an aggregate of investors and an aggregate of say stocks.  There are no crypographically controlled stock equity assets of any significance today and few crypto savvy investors, so there is zero coincidence of wants.  When! there are both, a mutual fund can be as simple as a smart contract that takes bitcoins today and delivers a sale of crypto equity values back in bitcoins later to investor controlled bitcoi addresses.  No fund, no fund manager, no bank. Perfectly auditable. Perfectly paid out, little to zero management fee.  
So no Bitcoin itself does not replace a mutual fund but certainly it's the only money that can do it without need of a bank.

Well there are no proven examples that have reached status as money. Theoretically it might happen, but currently it has not. 
I am not being obtuse.  I am just observing that we have a functioning crypto money secured by hashing. No other attempts have succeeded outside of labs. Security by too much hashing is a barrier to entry for Bitcoin's competition.  
Hashing based alternatives are vulnerable. 
No other technique has proven itself in the larger world.  
At some point, the planet will coalesce around one ledger with layers of capacity and other functionality. This will happen only on an open source code, open ledger, permissionles base layer. It is not unreasonable to conjecture that Bitcoin will be this base layer. And massive hashing it is.
That was a secondary point to the original point. 
The main reason banks will use the dominant public network is that they will need their chains to transfer actual value. Value is in the heart of the behodler. Their chains must have crypto transferrable UTXOs that have markets. Their coins must have a price or they just don't matter.
All the Blockchain technology chatter seems to forget that blocks are transaction records.  Documentation is perfectly reconciliable but it's not about that.  Utility/value transfer is the purpose of blocks and chains and for that there requires that the transaction of real world valuable items.

If (if!) Bitcoin becomes a major currency, the value transacted in a block will become much larger. The block reward becomes proportionally smaller over time through reward decrement by half on a programmed timeline.  Then the ratio of the value of transactions to the cost of writing a block will increase, making the maintenance of the block appending rather inexpensive relative to the value being provided. 
Even today, just the lack of ability to rewrite the transaction record eliminates need for human enforcement or technical barrier, so blockchains are trifling in cost comparatively.

@_date: 2015-10-21 10:10:08
Address this one point please, because for me this is the main reason private blockchains don't matter much: private blockchain coins have no price.
Blockchains are transaction records of transfer of control of UTXOs via private-public key pair techniques. Quantifiying the UTXO and give it a cute name, bitcoin.  Value transfer is the application. A perfect documentation is vital to the success, but it is a supporting application. The only application of the overall system is money, value transfer. If the control of the UTXOs has no market, no free market price, then the blockchain is a record of fantasy. While it may be a useful (although to my mind kind of silly) timestamping documentation system, if the instrument being transfered is not captured in the UTXO crypto transfer, and control of that transfer is not a market instrument, then what is its relevance? At all? Even to the operators of a private chain.
I think one also has to consider that the primary reason banks exist is to create credit money out of central bank credit money. Double entry ledger vapour conjure instruments are not born on blockchains, so they will never exist there.
My opinion is that the mechanisms of central banking will never compete with an open source, open ledger money, regardless of monetary policy of each or the rather feckless nature of Bitcoin's core devs. Central banks require governments which are horribly inefficient because the primary tool of government is threat of force. As Mr. Krugman says, the USD (and of course all fiat notions) are backed by people with guns. This is far more inefficient than hashing competition for a decreasing amount of monetary inflation.

Now we are really making progress.
What is dying is not just capitalism.  The spectre of governance itself is something we can live without.  Governance is one way to solve the problems of information and consensus. The Internet gives any one more information than any ruler could deal with, so problem solved.  
Consensus is how we agree to get along. Centralized governance is a traditional manner to do this. Governance suffers from a deep philosophical and moral problem. It assumes that some should dictate to others. Democracy does NOT solve that problem. 
Bitcoin is a beautiful example of voluntary consensus making to create a critical social function. 
Creating consensus about what makes ethics and then implementing that in a widespread voluntary fashion is highly interesting and worthwhile.  Asking those that rule through violence, whether hereditary or elected, to make ethics via law is asking Wolves to determine the fate of deer.  And people are neither wolves nor deer.

If these are well understood, well formed data objects, they themselves can become crypto transferrable notions with very clear risk reward potential, implying very good price-ability, at least in btc. ;) 
Note that time preferences in Bitcoin is exhibited and if crypto adhoc transferrable, would create a market and then price of these time preferences is a bitcoin futures market, priced in anything.

I assume this pertains to block size. 
The argument is about how much resources are required to host a node.  
How many full nodes does the system need for an end user to feel say six nines (0.999999) confidence in the state of truth in the blockchain?  Is there any model for that?
Obviously one, or two or three nodes  is not trustworthy enough. I think that by 10 or twenty, the network is pretty truthy.
This would imply that we can reduce node count a whole lot more and not lose the more important aspect, a highly trustworthy blockchain. I think the Bitcoin ecosystem is already deep enough to imagine hundreds of interested independent parties who can afford substantially expensive nodes.  Miners, exchanges, big hodlers, payment processors, wallet providers, smart contract oracles, etc all have incentive to host a node.  Small end users will have no fundamental need to host a node.

Banks and especially central banks create fiat by creating new debit/credit balance where neither existed prior.  Any other business can only legally make accounting entries upon tx with another entity.  As such a bank can always pay a debt owed (in any consideration denominated) by creating fiat by creating offsetting credit/debit entry, payout the debt with the new fiat and balance the prior balance sheet.  
So a bank can pay its debts by creating fiat.  That's a pretty special privilege.

Bring on the coins. Let's see how the common man parts with his earnings for coins whose supply, incentives, and possibly ledger can be modified by 5 of 9 banks! I predict the same price fate as better altcoins than this one.
If there is no free market price for the UTXOs, it is not money.
If it can't be transferred peer to peer, it's not interesting.
If the asset is not born on a Blockchain, it's merely a blockchain documentation of transaction through traditional means.

Yeah. I hate to be the wet sock here, but this is true.  Canada is as fiat as they come.  Way too much government with debt and monetary expansion a big part of it.  
No competition to the chartered banks, provisions in the Bank of Canada Act that require the Bank of Canada to fund the IMF and World Bank (ie direct access to free print for external orgs), when the U.S. funded TARP for 800B, Canada quietly slipped its banks 50B even though they weren't in trouble.

It's sort of neat how we seem to misunderstand each other so much yet somehow arrived right at the nut of the issue.  
You get serious consequences to not pay taxes, which are confiscated labour (and other economic utility) in order that bank notions have value breathed into them, so that bankers (or if you prefer your head pin angel instead, government) can expand the quantity of those notions with benefit to themselves. Long ago, enough evidence was provided to me that it is clear that bankers head the bank state conglomerate, not the state. That the state sends an agent to my door changes nothing of that. 
I do not myself nor do I advise it to anyone else to evade taxes,  Moral preference aside, it's just not wise yet. That's part of the system is not always to be routed around.  Routing around was in reference not to taxes nor the labyrinth of controls that are unavoidable in current finance. Routing around refers to the creation of these alternatives rather than wasting effort plaintiffly waiting for political change. I did not mean to infer that I have escaped the Matrix fully, merely that the routes are there. They also happen to offer qualities of speed, zero noise and perfect digital fidelity without the burden of powering the bank-war-police state.

I can't disagree. It's my opinion and conjecture to be sure. I am extending an argument with some evidence and logic, I think. 
Bottom line, Gavin has a substantial following but there will never be enough support behind Gavin for a client on this blockchain. His history for better and worse prevents it. If he can't get a supermajority of users, investors and miners behind him, which Classic proves he can't, then Core devs have no effective competition.

So the bank coin would not be a coin per se but rather a proof of claim for a fixed amount of fiat?
Since these pseudo coins would transferable via private key transfer, they would be traded adhoc outside the bank and they would have risk premium of non payment by the bank priced in.  
What happens to the pseudo coins ledger entries when they are redeemed by the bank?  I guess they get transfered to a bank address and the bank can sell them. 
The bank then is subsidizing the coin and its mining. The price of the coin is subject to the supply and demand of the fiat instrument, and thus the monetary policy of the coin in is not monetary policy of the crypto coin itself in algorithm but of the fiat it is a claim against.
The bank crypto coin is programmable and adhoc transferable and has a certain inflationary stability.  
It's interesting but I would avoid it personally.  It is more (even!) convoluted than Bitcoin and still prone to central bank and commercial bank malfeasance and would require real valuable resource to subsidize it.  I think it could fly for awhile but eventually meet gravity of the market.  
I suppose one does have to respect the wealth and power of the printing press that banks could make such an instrument fly irrationally for quite awhile.
Note that these crypt bearer bonds are never on account at the bank, so they would not be reserve for fractional lending.  I don't think banks would like that too well.
Also the bank can't touch them if they happen to go through a wallet of a known "bad guy". That would make for a difficult secondary market. It would dramatically reduce knowable fungibility.  IE bad guy tainted pseudo coins would have zero redeem ability at the bank but how is grandma gonna know which is which?

I honestly think that the Core devs are playing with fire by not rolling out much sooner with a block limit increase. It really would have been a setback to have had Classic rules, and Core devs are inviting that. 
That said, Bitcoin as verifiable digital gold is what it's all about and is very worthy of defending. 
If there is an asset, scaling is easy. The entire world monetary system ran on gold derivatives from 1944 to 1971. And most of the gold didn't move an inch. Bitcoin IOUs can trade as fast as any other IOU system.  So even if Lightning does not work, old school court enforceable IOUs can. 
Preserve the asset carrying ability. At five cents a transaction, it's a no brainer.

Search for the documentary "The Princes of The Yen." It is the story of how the enforcers of the Yen destroyed many lives through inflation and deflation in order to remake Japan to be owned by bankers.  America is entering the deflation phase currently.  
Central Bankers like you to believe they are morally neutral providers of a utility to economies.  Untrue.  They are rapacious predators.  Their utility is a monopoly that is heavily enforced by "government."  Nice work if you can get it.
Bitcoin is an algorithmic utility that can be used at the choice of the individual.  As such it bears none of the high cost of corruption and enforcement.  
Lending of the traditional manner can be done with any asset, including fractional reserve lending.  Lending to a person's own DAO, based upon the reputation of that DAO, and insured by a predictions market seem very near term possible.  
ICO's are in some cases, equity offerings.  (Golem, Gnosis,...)

Let me put it this way. When we do "shock and awe" how is that not on its face terrorism? Clean house by electing Obama, what do we get? Libya, Northern Africa, Syria, Ukraine and economic war against the 2nd nuclear power. 
It's very simple. Military aggression by the U.S. gov serves not the interests of American people. Law enforcement inside the (lol) Republic serves not the American people. The capstone power in the world is the ability to print notions of debt that have value.  It sits above and beyond government. Government is the institution most important in putting value into notions. 
The plebes and soldiers all have to think the enforcement is good or the racket doesn't work. A million dead in Iraq, so now carry on with iSIS as a new bogeyman. Real crimes. 
That's the source of interest in a benign protocol. 
So when Antonopolous and Andresen softpedal the evil it contravenes the purpose of Bitcoin.
The truth is simple and inexpensive to propagate, just like blockchain transactions.
The capstone power in the world is the ability to print notions of debt that have value. This requires brutal draconian enforcement measures. An open source open transaction ledger undoes all of it.

Yes, but the US Dollar is the world standard for value. (I dislike that to my bones because of my understanding of how that is achieved, but I recognize that it's true.) 
So Dude L is, tongue in cheek, making Bitcoin the standard of value by which to compare assets including the USD.  It's a distant dream but not one with zero possibility. Bitcoin is still the money with the best money properties ever invented.  There are no crypto competitors. (Ethereum is a completely different but likeable beast). Bitcoin has all the best attributes and exceeds all of: gold, cash, fiat, cowry shells and wampum. It is borderless and does not bear the burden of a police/war state.  It is super easy to use and access.  Securing it is not all that difficult. 
Mr. Lebowski may one day be correct.

I get that Bitcoin does those things and in some ways better than other methods.   Maybe it's just our individual orientation. Bitcoin was crafted specifically for the purpose of peer to peer money.

Wayne:" So we use the blockchain which is a ledger of transactions but there are no real transactions just timestamped digital signatures to validate the data which is trade intentions which are contract forming."
Judge: "I have not heard about this. Are they recognized by other courts."
Plaintiff lawyer: "No, it is one thing we would like to create precedent with here today. It's why Wayne is here."
Wayne: "Right!  So the contracts are signed by digital signature with private public key pair techniques."
Judge: "Just show me the contract"

Judge:"No, I can't but continue."
Wayne: "Well you must be able to see the trade information."

Plaintiff lawyer: "Yes but I received The Call."
Wayne "well you did fail..."
Plaintiff lawyer "ahem. The Calling of private industry. You know blockchain technology is really.."
Judge:"I am losing patience. Make this contract clear to me."
Wayne:"It's simple. The defendant agreed to trade securities by signing the trade with his 256 bit private key.  This is entered into a timestamped record in a process known as mining. The record is not alterable."
Judge:"Ok. I think we are making some progress. You could make this easy on all of us you know!"
Defendant lawyer smiles and shrugs.
Wayne" but you should know that any party can make record into the blockchain with a valid private key. Which are provided by an agreed authority."
Judge:"So anyone with a key can enter data? And keys are kept by authority, so gaining control over the authority means the ability to enter any data?"
Wayne:"You are getting it! Blockchain technology is..."
Judge"So we have a contract documented with a timestamping chain that can be reversed with a like but opposite contract document at a later time,  no money transfers on the chain, as in Bitcoin..."
Japanese British chuckles are heard. 
"... And this is really all about 'blockchain technology' as a new form of documentation that is not legally recognized."

Sure. But don't panic.  It was inevitable that the market would offer Bitcoin derivatives.  It can't be prevented.  
There's a huge difference though.  Because Bitcoin is digital and also easily verified, the kinds of puffery that occurs with other derivatives can't happen as with other assets.  
I can purchase Bitcoin and when it is confirmed, it is in my possession.  I can't do that digitally with real estate, stocks, bonds, gold or bank currencym. That's a big purpose of derivatives on account accessible via digital networks.  So one of the purpose of derivatives just doesn't exist  for Bitcoin.  
That Bitcoin is easily verified (the custodian can be challenged to prove control of private keys of some substantial btc balance), the derivatives can't be manufactured on whim.  If fractions on reserve get low, the claimant can always sell.
A Bitcoin derivative will never be confused with a bitcoin.  Many people think they own stocks or gold.  But mostly they own a piece of paper that provides a court enforceable claim against another party (bank or such), that in most cases is three or four such claims away from the paper stock or the bullion.  This is regulated but one can imagine that in a severe situation the average investor is holding a russian doll of empty bags. Control of private keys is not derivative.  A dollar derivative (your cash on account at a bank) is still thought to be a dollar.
Indeed Bitcoin can't be money until there are deep debt futures with reasonable prices (ie time locked derivative contracts with discounted for time prices).
It's part of growing up.
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:30:45
I guess it depends on how far you want to take it. 
This is kind of academic as sidechains are fantasy creatures like unicorns at the moment. 
But my understanding is that when you move btc into a locking transaction that creates coins in a side chain and then back again, those transactions are transparent on the Bitcoin blockchain.  On the side chain, the privacy of the transactions are a function of the properties of that chain.  So if that chain has perfect opacity, then the transactions undertaken there are perfectly private.

Your employer, your primary bread and butter is doing Ethereum and not Bitcoin. Nothing wrong with Ethereum. It's an awesome concept and I think we should all want it to soar.  One can not reasonably be expected to be working in that capacity and also being lead/commit dev on a protocol designed to take over the Bitcoin blockchain. 
The time and philosophical divergence requirements are just too much for one person.  There are many who have the will and ability to go forward with Bitcoin.  
Please let Bitcoin go.

Answer your own question, why can't we?
Let's first recall that rights are natural, they arise from being alive. They are defensible assertions of an individual's humanity from impairment from others. Governance by its nature is already a transgression of rights. I don't have the right to declare myself master of you, obviously, so I have the right to be ungoverned. Government's main tool is its averring absolution of its own guilt of violating rights. People tolerate horrific crime by government because, well, because they stupidly believe the brainwash that governors are better humans.
Governments are NOT protectors of rights. They will claim to be. But show me a US Constitution Article that the U.S. Government does not actively subvert.
So answer your own question, why can't you have both?  The government is not going to be helpful to you.

The Euro is fully supported by the US dollar system. It won't fail until the USD does. And that won't happen as long as the world monetary system is successfully able to capture and hold economic resources into the USD hegemony.   
The USD hegemony is still expanding. It is taking over Iraq, Syria, Libya, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina and Canada now.  Iran has surrendered peacefully.  It is surrounding Russia and China now and extracting their value add. It is deepening it's feudal power o'er the people who live between the Rio Grande and the 49th parallel.  Until we as a species tell the 0.00001% who control the monetary system to F Off, the USD will continue to hold dominance. The Euro and Yen are USD with prettier pictures on the paper.

Fair enough too.  
There is a spectrum of bias on this question.  And mostly its OK to have such a spectrum.  So, my own bias is that Bitcoin as a payment system is an inevitable requirement, in some form or other, but that this ought not to come at the expense of Bitcoin as an non trusty bearer asset.  That is to say that my bias is that the emphasis should be towards a small blockchain so that keeping full node is accessible.  
My feeling on this that is that a few doublings of the limit size is probably just fine in due order.   Due order means preparation and time and large consensus. I am skeptically trusting of the current Core plan for now, though I have to say that my doubts are increasing.  Not from the shrill junk that is common on r/btc, but other observations.   
In terms of politics, I would like to see other new thought leaders emerge and take the baton.  GA and GM have too much accumulated baggage despite having performed admirable work within their own epoch.  Preferably this would involve a voluntary successionally transition out of control of the project.  Both GA and GM have exhibited substantial ego in just not letting go of control.  They are no Satoshi Nakamotos.  
  
My own sense of historical monetary systems is that we can innovate around an asset with even double entry IOUs networks if necessary but we need to defend that asset.  Bitcoin's attribute as a non forgeable digital asset is its key feature.  Gold with a known ledger, transferrable in a few blockchain updates.  Derivative money is fine from that but has no grounding without it.

I am out of time for this today, but I wil document that banks hold treasuries and use them as reserves. 
On the other point, well of course the Supreme Court is a part of government. I was responding to your point about who is in charge of the Fed. Politicians are not in charge of either day to day. In administration of justice, this is preferable. In the case of money, it is different. Justice is nuanced and philosophical. Money is mundane and corruptible.  The Constitution did not provide for administration of money that way.  
It starts with a matter of faith or skepticism.  I am skeptical of the money system. There is extensive evidence that it is corrupt.  The truths that you mention are formalities that provide cover for the corruption. The benefits of money creation/expansion falls into very very narrow sets of hands.  The mechanisms of swapping UST (future promises of labour confiscation) notions for Fed Reserve USD notions is simply a removal of accountability from the political process.  The idea that the Fed is a fair and independent administrar is, I suppose, somewhat in the eye of the beholder. All the mechanisms you mention are factual but provide no accountability. 
Taxes provide value to Treasuries. Treasuries provide value to dollars. Banks provide exchange value dollars for commerce. There is complete codependency.  The end effect is that labour is confiscated for the benefit of money expanders.

Nobody really has to use the USD any more. 
 The post WW2 Bretton Woods Agreement made the USD the defacto reserve currency by agreement.  That was conditional upon gold convertibility at 35.00 per ounce.  That's all gone now. 
What has replaced it is the US using the power gained from having that status to impose usage of USD both domestically and in international trade.   This is ending.  The ability to impose is losing benefit/cost performance.  
Many common people now see the bank-milcom-propaganda-state plainly.  Rival economic powers see it profoundly.  The opportunity to route around the BIS currency system is growing.  Bitcoin is one such. Gold and alternate banking routing are others.

With all due respect, your economic knowledge is bound in government monetary terms.  
Economy needs money.  But money has any form.  Paper credit that represents ownership of acres of rough steel flows in China.  Gold chits ran the entire world until 1971.   What The Fed does is defend overall dollar purpose by defending credit (and banks).   It is really hard to judge whether this was helpful in historical terms.    
In modern times it is clear that an oligarchy over credit money is malignant.  
The separation of money and state and its replacement is necessary and positive.  Money-ness (the aggregate demand for money) pulled into existence by voluntary widespread individual decisions will create a much more meritorious, robust, stable economy.

I don't think fed coins can compete on an equal footing.  They can only compel, not attract. Putting aside that if states can't inflate, why would they even want to be in the money creation business. They will never build a coin that is as open and adhoc accessible as Bitcoin.  
First, Bitcoin is pretty accessible. Download wallet from App Store. Receive btc. Send btc. Compared to: Get state identification. Open bank account. Deposit on account. Wait three days. Get online bank access. Send funds.
Second, "mainstream" is a false standard. I don't need a majority of people to accept it, just enough to offer competitive choice in things I need.  To use Bitcoin as a retail spend is already easy and getting easier with debit cards etc.  Using it as a financial tool is far more accessible than banks. I can hold currency directly without a third party, I can build bonds and programmatic companies without even incorporating.  Show me how fiat will ever do that.

Easy.  Where there is custodial management of the coins, there is an opportunity for malfeasance.  Ie if you don't hodl your coins private keys, they are at some risk of theft.  This is where regulation and oversight is required.  Although quite substantially there are technical solutions such as multisig to solve that issue too.
Much securities regulation is in place to deal with accounting malfeasance because double entry ledgers are internal documents that are easy to manipulate.  
Fiat money itself is prone to said malfeasance. Many companies cook books. When banks do it, they conjure money supply. The balance sheet of the USD is somehow out of reach of audit by American elected representatives. Given the incestuous tangle of narrow private interests, banks, central banks, regulators, and law makers, the demonstrated malfeasance both legally sanctioned and illegal, it is little surprise it was labelled a den of vipers by a sitting American president, and a greater threat than standing armies by a "founding father".  
Note that social containment (ie laws) of this malfeasance has been outright hacked. Regulation by legislation is a failure and perhaps even effecively a ruse, providing false trust and protection barriers for the crooks.  This hack is so deep that men of justice are obviously corrupted. Note the lack of political outrage that the FedRes is a bank regulator, or more viscerally that Goldman Sachs former employees hold many critical law enforcement positions. There is a special brand of corruption of men like Ben Lawsky, who in plain sight operate to protect the racket rather than acting on behalf of Justice generally. These are not vague theoretical abuses. They are terrible crimes that are demonstrated often, many legally sanctioned, many just papered over with public money. Note that bankruptcy normally parts shareholders from their equity. But when banks go bankrupt, shareholders get TARP money.
The Bitcoin blockchain has been altered a couple of times but due to technical flaws, not fraud.  The transaction record is trivially reconcilliable and the coins supply is perfectly knowable.  The Bitcoin ledger is harmless and does not require legislation. Bank ledgers management is harm causing in theory and in fact, despite legal regulation.

R3CV is a consortium of large banks whose most profitable business model is to act as money creation by credit expansion of fiat.  Mikes job there is to develop blockchains.
Bitcoin is an upstart money whose primary intention is to compete with fiat. Mike has proposed that he be the commit keeper of XT, which if successful will develop the Bitcoin blockchain.
And you honestly think Bitcoin and bank money are not rival? I think you are going to have to do better than that. They are exceedingly similar interests at nearly completely diametric purpose.
And that the commit dev of a protocol that is designed to take over the Bitcoin blockchain is a hobby job?
Bitcoin matters more than me or you or Mike, so being grateful for Mike's efforts does not come into play.  I do not resent for a moment, either action by Mike.

It's not that I think Mike has evil intentions, it's just that screwing up Bitcoin is a disaster we can't afford on a much more widespread basis than a $4B currency.  I doubt I am alone, and I think that XT was dead enough already for technical and political reasons. This should finish it.

Any efforts he puts directly into a fork attempt are wasteful dead ends.  If he continues to try to lead, he is willfully obstructing Bitcoin's evolution. In the short term, Classic is a dead end diversion that can not succeed because of its association with Mr. Andresen, and as such extinguishes real competition to Core.  In the longer term, any project that features Mr. Andresen has a substantial resistance and can not succeed.

I think that it's the idea that the Fed serves government that is the obfuscation.  The mechanics are a thin slight of hand.  
Government keeps taxpayers in order and provides enforcement of monopoly of legal tender. Taxation ability puts labour future value into government bonds (ie government sells the labour of the future for spending power today). They acquire bank money with sale of bonds. So very directly bank money gets its value from enforced acquisition of labour present and future. 
Banks use Treasuries as reserves and expand the money supply. Banks are thereby profiting with interest from this arrangement and able to profit from expansion of debt. 
The Fed is openly independent of government. In many other countries the central bank is a corporation owned by government. In all cases the primary creators of money and the primary beneficiaries are the commercial banks. Not only do they profit, they allocate capital to the same companies that they own.   
Donald Trump is speaking, as you are, speciously.  He does not print money, but Janet Yellen is a gal who just won't say no to lending him money. The banks never bear the consequences.  Mr. Trump simply declared that he won't bear any either, hey, we will just print more money.

First improvement by punctuation.
Other use cases fall into the broad category of permissionless value transfer, such as: darkweb, capital control evasion, and contributing to Wikileaks.
Permissionless value transfer is according to Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin's primary purpose.  Permissionless value transfer means being able to send money without a priori consent of a middle party.  Banks censor things. 
Darkweb, Silkroad's progeny, I assume you have heard of it.  Illicit goods n sevices, much profit.  Permissionless value transfer is highly necessary.
Capital Controls evasion. This did Not happen with Cyprus, but a little in Argentina and Peru, quite a bit from Greece, some from China just now, perhaps a little from NYC. It's a bit anecdotal... This is where Bitcoin's store of value arises. Some of us want money out of the system.

Unless Gavin's devout are willing to chase everyone else out, jeopardizing Bitcoin by putting one man ahead of the millions of us who make it work, they will never succeed.  
The best bet to compete with Core client is without Gavin. 
It is quite arguable that MIT would turn Bitcoin into banker-permission coin, that Mike Hearn would turn Bitcoin into banker-permission coin, that Unlimited and Classic would tend Bitcoin towards banker-permission coin.

I am obviously right.  Ì have researched it extensively and there is overwhelming evidence.  Much suffering has been wrought by the particular mechanism of forcing people to value as money something they should be able to exercise free conscience to reject.  That ability to eliminate choice is now escaped from any one. Satoshi is a hero.
However it need not be binary.  You perhaps see otherwise and perhaps are benefitting.  If you have looked into it with any moral standard, I am surprised you reach a different conclusion.
The second point means that I, and those who choose to, have better options for money and finance than the bank state option.  Monopolies are unsavoury, unhealthy and fragile.  It is better for me and many others,  so in aggregate it is a positive change.  
Better? It matters not.  You may continue to use bank (state) money.  I will refrain as much as possible.  Soon enough no one will need it at all. There is no way to put this back in the bottle.

Agreed. My point is that Antonopolous and other Bitcoin thought leaders including Andresen and even yourself are being slightly disingenuine.  
I get that there is no choice but to cooperate with law enforcement and law makers. Indeed, philosophically, rule of law is an important sacred institution of liberty. But that gets right to the bone of the matter.  
Bitcoin demonstrates that truth is inexpensive. Truth in its ledger costs a pittance to maintain, increment and query.  This standard is made shabby by not also speaking truth about the world at large.
Some facts. A minuscule proportion of world population control its wealth. The U.S. banks, bluechips, and media companies are controlled by these tiny few. The U.S. government with powers of taxation and federated control of state and municipal government claims ownership to the real productive economy of American people.  This is what gives US Treasuries economic value. This is in turn partly what gives the USD economic value.  The other part is dominance in world trade enforced by military power. The benefit to create USD creates the inequity of economic power described above. 
It is a racket. Laws and law enforcement are not then about principles. My read on History is that it is doubtful they ever were.  The only principles enforced by government are by insistence by the governed.  
Fiat money, even by its nickname, is not by law or principle but by decree and the fiat of the few it benefits.  Much propaganda and much unprincipled enforcement is necessary to squelch competition to this system. 
It is the underlying current of global events. And it is the reason for law enforcement interest in Bitcoin. 
Property right is basic. Property right does not exist if equity shareholders take precedence over debt holders in bankruptcy. So TARP was an $800B tax funded transgression of property right. This of course is an obvious but not singular outrage of modern times.
The Western system of finance is absolutely rotten. (I hold no esteem for the others either).  So let's start disinfecting it with truth.  Truth is inexpensive and precious. The truth is that the BIS, the Fed, the banks, DHS, TSA, CIA, NSA, US and allies military, the MIC, old school media form an organized complex to assert the will of the few in control.  
There is a small group above the rule of law. We must be highly skeptical of law enforcement, always in every context.
When Bitcoin thought leaders fail to speak this simple and obvious truth, it pollutes the thought ledger.

Btw, you have helped me clarify my own thinking regards the extended use of blockchain technology.
Both realities are true. There are need and application of permissioned blockchains between private parties.  These are helpful and seem worthy and not dismissable.  The revolution however is in that we have a money that requires little human organization. The latter for me is much more important.
Thanks again

This is the main point. It's fine to fractionally reserve. It breaks down because there is misperceptions from lack of transparency and desire for free lunch. 
Blockchain funds with open transparency and witting participants can rid the need of central banks as long as people accept some risk of default.

There will always be a chain with scarcity.  Any such change to the protocol is a hardfork.  The users (aka hodlers) cannot be compelled to use the chain that blows out scarcity.  There will be a price and therefore proof-work and therefore continuity to the scarcity chain.
Adding money units that no one values does not add inflation.
The whole paradigm is flipped.  Instead of "trusting" civilizations worst ever parasite to keep scarcity (ie central banks' ledgers coordinating scarcity via the BIS) which then purchases valuation of its tokens through use-compulsion through violence  (aka government), now the plebes choose how much moneyness they need and which algorithm provides the  qualities, like scarcity, they prefer.  The fake scarcity of the Fed vs the real scarcity of voluntary use algorithms.
If the masses lose the plot line and choose scam infinite supply coin and lose their shirts, so what?! The markets will figure out the right mix.

Rights are never to be had by asking anyone (especially those that gain by deeming so) "do I have the right?", they must be assumed and acted out.

@_date: 2017-05-14 21:15:43
Correct.  What is needed to back fiat is a realizable promise to attach real economic value to future debt notions denominated in the fiat.  
As an example, in the US, legal tender laws ensure that economic activity will generate taxes in dollars that actually have economic gravity. Taxation then provides a flow that can be imagined (correctly) to exist in the future and can therefore be borrowed upon in the form of US Treasuries.  These Treasuries are imaginary but the contract is that they will obtain gravitas by force of government.  Because they are then traded for dollars, dollars obtain value.  
There are some terrible aspects to this (horrific actually).  A vast illusion must be created and enforced in order that the uppermost pyramid of illusion (valueless accounting entries = value) seems true.  
Myth is also necessary in voluntary crypto money.  Myth (immutable ledger, known quantity, open source) is far more concrete and scientific in crytpo but still necessary for obtaining sacrificing purchasing power to hodl.  
This is why Ver and Wu are so unpalatable. They are trying to build a myth that is unscientific (Wu/miners are trustworthy, personal verification is not necessary, the important attribute of cash is convenience, not personal sovereignty).  
It is also why I fear Bitcoin is captured in a false dialectic.  The devs of Core are not really offering a realistic path out of the current malaise.  Yes I realize price is fine, but the market is threatening Bitcoin with Ripple and Ethereum.  The former is outright scam, the latter has no agreed to consensus or monetary policy and a penchant for elitist bailout via ledger edit.

I am sure that the Fed would not want Fedcoin to be uniformly available. What would be the point of it when we have a permissionless coin already?

I certainly do not mean to imply that.  What I mean is that the blockchain can not be reversed.  There can always be a chain that maintains prior rules past fork.  People will determine if that chain has value.  Everything comes from how people value the coin.  There is no majority, only a price.

No. The point is that the public Internet is the one that matters.  There are is no need for several public networks. Private stand alone networks are not society advancing phenomena. Of course they have value to their owners but they are only technologically interesting not culturally. Since money is cultural, inherently more so than packets, the coins that matter are definitely not on private chains.  
The Internet (and even electrical, television, radio, etc networks) exemplifies that published standards and accessible networks will form the dominant operation.  
If banks want to operate cooperative Proof of Stake blockchains for documenting trades so be it (yawn). If they want to participate in money, well, there is only one blockchain whose UTxOs are money.

@_date: 2016-05-31 07:00:13
Well, apologies if my question did not amuse you. Otherwise, it is the most germane question, the one we need and are entitled to ask: what interests are served by the fiat monetary system?  You agreed, I think, that the public monetary system is captured by narrow (and therefore private), interests.  That is a serious moral and social problem. There are two ways to solve that problem, modify the system from within, or route around it.  
We can offer our own subjective opinions predicting the outcome.  Mine is that the far far less resistant path is to route around, like to ignore the Post's demand to move all text via paper and just use email, to use money as a mundane data object and just use blockchains.  I don't find the notion of the bogeyman banker threatening that as very compelling.  There is no more that the powers that be can do to disrupt this progression than the Post could defeat fax machines or email. The stakes are much higher but that doesn't change the inevitable outcome.  The moveable character printing press ended moral domain of the church, the instant it was invented. It took 400 years of bloody war to knock back the Church, but the outcome was inevitable.  The blockchain cleaved money from state, 7 years ago.  As we are in the earliest of phases, it is of course not so easy to apply the same hindsight, so this is my subjective opinion.  It is not an article of faith though. It is an honest intellectual logic having considered it significantly. I am intellectually and hedged financially prepared to be wrong.  My doubts diminish the further along this progresses.  
I still offer that the vast vast majority of the USD system has nothing to do with government. It's not comforting or persuasive that, say, the Central Intelligence Agency, is an untouchable military operator. That's just another related problem. You can dodge the issue by saying that the CIA or NSA or the Fed is government, but that is just playing silly bugger, technically correct but meaningless. Banks get the benefit of government enforcement, but call all the shots in the creation of money. They need a functioning dollar, so they follow the rules, but the rules are not set by government. The governance, the day to day operation and the interests served have noting to do with government.
I feel like we are mostly taking past each other.  Yes, the USD/BIS system is vastly predominant. It matters far more than Bitcoin. It's just not interesting. My capacity to enact my own financial will is zero in compare to with Bitcoin or Ethereum.  It is that way that the fiat system is no longer relevant. I don't need it except that it's still the lingo of most of the world. I can only imagine trying to speak logically to an illiterate European villager about scientific truth and the fallacy of a Christian God when all he knew came from the Church. One still must use the framework that exists, but the power of innovation is manifold in Bitcoin over fiat. 
Fiat money is repugnant morally, is untouchable politically and has very limited functionality. I don't care about it and won't invest any effort in trying to modify it.  In that way, government no longer matters in money. That the current system is predominant worries me approximately zero.  Even if Bitcoin and its cousins never mature beyond niche, it is enough.  It is abundantly clear to me that blockchain money, probably Bitcoin, will become the dominant form, precisely because it has superior unit of account properties, better than the remote unknowable ledger of gold and better than a myriad of ostensibly balanced double entry ledgers.  However even if this pure water somehow does not become the preference by people over the fetid pond of fiat, and remains niche, that is ample for my needs.  
Whether the Fed is part of government (we disagree), or that this rule or that within the fiat system applies to me is far less engaging than the possibility that the system itself is on the cliff of obsolescence.   I am a student of Marshall Macluhan. His notion that a medium distinguishes itself  as a new type of medium if it envelopes prior media, foretells that Bitcoin envelopes banking, not the other way around. Newspapers, telephony, music and video industries did not come to own the Internet, precisely the opposite happened. 
I am offering highly subjective and biased prediction, so I do not expect to convince.

Even freedom seekers like Bitcoiners make a fatal logic mistake in this critical debate.  The whopper of Hegelian dialectics, the most destructive ever, is the one concerning "Capitalism."    We have swallowed this false choice whole. It is exceedingly important to disgorge this falsehood.
Start with the word itself, it is an ism, a societal scale gestalt.  It is NOT a simple personal ethic but a mode of society. Karl Marx himself critiqued the law and banking systems that create the ism.  
"Capitalism" means a system of finance and law that allows the monied folks to control society.  Notice that in its most extreme form it is Fascism, where an explicit conglomeration of private interests and government rule. 
Marx and others offered organized labour and other aspects as a solution to Capitalism.  Communism does ameliorate slightly some problems of Capitalism while introducing others. 
Here is the falsehood:  Both isms concern dominance by a ruling elite; neither concern freedom.  Capilalism is freedom, but only for a very few. We have been trained that Capitalism is freedom.  This narrows the debate and potential choice of societal design to two NEARLY IDENTICAL systems of dominance.   
Only with a non voluntary monopoly currency can occur obscenities like bank oligopoly, off-equilibrium price of money, bail outs and ins, extremely small loci of capital allocation decision.  This is not freedom!  It is Capitalism!
I don't think the term Communism/Socialism is as poorly used.  
With thiis false choice between systems of dominance, we end up with political options without difference.  The Left party in the USA is led by a war-hawkish, banker-friend.  Huh?    The Right party is led by an egomaniac dictator in waiting. Huh?   
Capitalism is dominance by people who control financial capital. In a pure fiat world this tends rapidly toward not those who earn their capital but to those who conjure it from whimsy.  
We who seek simply monetary freedom will never be at home in either system of dominance. The conversation is sterile and moot unless we divest ourselves of the notion that Capitalism equals freedom.
As long as there is fiat money, it will not matter how hard and long you toil, your productivity can be purchased by newly created money and fiat-eers inherit your labour.  It will not matter what business you build, fiat-eers can create money on a whim for your cash flow and freely inherit your ingenuity. It will not matter how good natured your intentions of government are, fiat-eers will multiply their gains of finance on the taxes.
Capitalism is not a form of freedom. 
Communists and Capitalists are happy to feed you the false dialectic.

The current fiat debt based money system can not survive.  Now the people that run it know that far better than you or I.  It's been their family business for many centuries.  Fiats come and go.  It's irrelevant what the pretty paper is called.  Claim to monopoly of violence reinforces nicely with claim to monopoly of money: State power and bank power will transform together. 
They will not go easily into the dark night.  Much more suiting to their ambition is a new epoch of monopoly Medici double entry ledger money.   Coordination of BIS gov monies is not nearly as useful to them as a Phoenix, a single ruling predator bankstate.   We have seen the Rothschild Economist cover. A deluge is necessary first, to create a primitive condition, where only barbarous relics work and then"authority" to enforce paper and electronic ponzi promises of golden baubles. 
Voluntary money is not in the scantiest manner sought out by people.  They swallow the dollar economy like the  enforced corporatized sugar addiction that it is, with the same consequence.

They have already commented on that.  Bitcoin is the chain with continuity, ie the softfork.   A hardforked chain split must obliterate the legacy chain in terms of economic support for exchanges to consider it "Bitcoin."  
That is to say that 90% of hashrate could abandon BIP 141 and it will still continue out to the end of a greatly extended difficulty period and as long as it has a non trivial price and some enforcing nodes, BIP 141 Bitcoin will be Bitcoin.  The other chain will not be considered Bitcoin but a new coin by exchanges.  
Each will be the longest chain, valid onto its own ruleset.  Both arguably some variant of Bitcoin.
BIP 141 is nearly impossible to reverse now.

It will save some of us.  I am in the camp that the current fiat system is being actively led into destruction.  A stable quantity of fiat and market set interests would lead to a brutal recession.  This is a necessary and inevitable consequence of "assets" being overvalued due to cheap money, much without any enough economic value to cover normal interest rates.  Once money supply is stabilized, a recovery would begin. Many years of economy bearing asset accumulation would be necessary to have full recovery.  For whatever reason, central banks have coordinated their efforts to expand money supply and are accelerating. Whether this is just good intentioned can kicking or (IMO) high crime is an ongoing debate. What is doubtless is that increasing the quantity of units only changes the value of the units.  The destruction of the value per unit is accelerating.   It will reach a point where confidence is lost. 
Most people will get caught off guard when the loss of confidence happens. Many more will not get caught off guard per se, but be unable to defend themselves really.  When fiat goes kaput, a lot of apparent wealth goes up in smoke. But more importantly, a lot of supply chains die.  Many of them were uneconomic anyway, but many just can't tolerate the sudden change in demand.  Livelihoods evaporate.  
Even having stores of gold and Bitcoin is not likely to replace income for most. 
People with substantial wealth and some Bitcoin will be wealthy wealthy. And in very good position to build economies in a devastated economy. 
Once the current fiat system is destroyed and the impoverished public beg the super rich criminals of the prior fiat regime, to for heaven's sake just do something, there will be a new globally rationalized fiat system.  
Bitcoin will increase in importance fantastically in relative terms, enough so that its dominance will be destined.

The point of increasing monetary quantity is to increase wealth disparity. It's a criminal enterprise to remove freedom of money choice and then steal value.

My 2 satoshis if I may.
I am quite settled on that a Blockchain without a token of value is a documentation system. (I think it's purpose at all is dubious because of the need for central control of keys which then makes it all hackable amongst other reasons.). 
However, a token of value has severe problems for banks.  
Firstly, the tokens have to have real value derived from real markets from real people who aren't captured by banks. This for me is the highest beauty in Bitcoin. Since bitcoins are priced freely and accessed ad hoc, they are notions of desire not compulsion by "governors", and hence they are bedrock real.  A bank token, must meet this same bar or it's silly and hackable.  That is, the bank group offering the token must appeal to the markets as an altcoin.  Good luck with that one!  It might have legs for awhile but it won't stand up in time to an open standard with fixed money supply and a gazillion hashes with zero barrier to entry anywhere. 
Secondly, banks primary purpose and profit derives from their closed relationship with central banks.  A competing-with-fiat token from banks denecessitates central banks outright. Bitcoin proves concretely that central banks are not only not necessary, but that technology can put money creation beyond their enforcement.  A bank crypto coin kills central banks.  Credit expansion of arbitrary money supply by arbitrarily chosen banks and the variety of business opportunities and market timing opportunities available by knowing Janet Yellen's mind a priori is why we live in a 0.1% world. This privilege evaporates with a bank offered crypto coin. And a bank offered alt crypto coin must compete so must offer fixed money supply and no bank accounts.  It will never happen. 
They won't be serving up golden goose sandwiches at market price of KFC Zingers any time soon. Can you imagine: "here is our coin, it's supply is determined by monthly committee meetings, it is available in accounts at the banks and in markets we control. It's as good as the dollar because it's backed by purveyors of violence (death by Bitcoin coin)."  Or:"here is our coin. Fixed supply (ie bye bye FedRes, ECB) and transferable via a signature whose keys are created by the end user as a huge huge random number. But you can deposit them with us if you like. It's liust as good as Bitcoin but we have to pay people to hash with oldschool dollars (death by self immolation coin)."  
I predict that inside five years, politicians globally will be appealing to the mob to kill Bitcoin to save the central banks because that will save us all. I predict they will fail.
Or how else might we imagine a bank-alt-coin?

I think you misunderstand me a little. I am not advocating short cuts to scalability so that I can keep my cheap retail receipt on the Blockchain for ever more. So I don't disagree with any of your points.  
I am just observing that with fiat print accelerating, Bitcoin is too tiny in both its economic value and transaction capacity to ameliorate at a large scale a fiat collapse if it is to happen in the near term, which I think is becoming increasingly likely.   In fact I am a bit resigned to the possibility of a depression, either hyperinflationary or deflationary and then an extended period before Bitcoin et al can handle much real economy. 
I would just prefer that we approach this with some passion and urgency, not for cheap shortcut to scale or moon but because it could help a lot of people. It would be better if we can arrive at a new money system before disaster but I think the disaster will happen before Bitcoin really "arrives."

Why will people trust a new global fiat?  The people of Germany trusted a new larger area fiat.  The lowish inflation Mark was replaced with the disastrous Euro.  That is a nation with strong reminders of monetary folly, and yet... 
In the past few months, commercial banks and central banks and even the BIS have all started to openly complain about the other. This is absurd theatre as they all constitute elements of the fiat privelege, so why?  Fiat money is already failing, both in its value against other assets and in the escalation of horrors needed to enhance the economic reach of currency regimes.  Think of how shoddily the masters of fiat are treating their keeps in all of Japan, Russia, China, Europe and USA. Think of the escalation of US military adventure. 
There is no profit in fiat privilege without the power to surprise the populace with quantity manipulation.  Fiat producers could simply stabilize money production if they were interested in economic health. They are interested in selfish gains. 
So why will people trust a near global fiat?  They will be provided with no choice.  Massive global fiat crisis is being manufactured. A small set of financiers already controls affairs. Who else can afford to create a new monetary order?  As these current fiat shackles evaporate, the average person, who has taken zero time to study these things will positively stampede into the larger corral as conditions worsen in the smaller corrals.   
Someone fairly close to me that works in traditional finance has told me that an increasingly common theme in his lower echelon circles is that national central banks are on their way out. Not by Bitcoin, but by elimination by their own kind and that there are more than one group determined to hold the keys to a global fiat castle. 
Would a monetary system based upon Bitcoin produce mass well being?  Emphatically yes!  This is the history of sound currencies. Unsound currencies just move wealth from the productive to the money printers. Which not only impoverishes labourers in relative terms but also lowers all boats.  If Bitcoin were to become even somewhat realized before this calamity, then I think we could postulate on fiat evaporation as being not just harmless but beneficial.  I don't think it will happen in time.  Bitcoin is in the order of about .001% of global M2 fiat. I might be somewhat convinced that Bitcoin could save the day  if it were even 1% of fiat, that is, 1000X its current price.  That is in my own estimation about ten years away. I don't think that national fiat collapse will wait that long. 
No, I would not trade quality real estate for Bitcoin, though it would not be a mistake to maintain a small debt to invest in Bitcoin if real estate were your only asset.
Let me also say this again. The profit of fiat privelege comes from the power to surprise, not from the power to inflate per se.  We live in highly inflationary times, for some thirty years now, but the power to surprise in the opposite direction, like in Volcker's time, is the one to beware of now.  Even old Mike Maloney who really does know what's going on only talks the inflation side of the coin. Yes we still continue to be surprised by lower and lower interest rates, but we are now always half way expecting them.  No one talks about what it will be like with even 10% rates, let alone 20% of Volcker.   We should have abandoned this treachery long ago, but here we are.

Care to explain the strong imposition of currency monopoly?  I don't really distinguish between who the beneficiaries of fiat monopoly are. Some work in the state, some work in the banks and a very few get the real benefits.  The big banks form an oligopoly. They all own each other and they are all owned by about a dozen private equity firms.  These same banks and private equity firms allocate essentially all financial capital of any significance in the US.  Splitting hairs like saying the Fed barely profits and provides that to the Treasury is focussing on the twigs and ignoring the forest.  The banks and the Fed buy Treasuries. They print dollars to do so. The Fed loans dollars for free to commercial banks which then multiply those dollars and put some back on deposit at the Fed.  
All of it is conjured by whim.  The only place it becomes real is in the government's promise to extract real economic value from future labour (future taxes to honour Treasury promises).  Those are easy promises for a current government to get spendable dollars today in exchange for someone else in the future to extract value from the populace.

A lot of things. Diversify.  Start encouraging customers to keep real assets on account, assets like metals and cryptos. Design the bank for a world where central banks have no power or don't even exist.  Create corporate subsidiaries that are radically open in their investment vehicles and automated. 
The change coming for banks may very well be the most radical change ever induced on to an encumbent industry. Double entry accounting is so 6th century. And essentially banks just manage double entry ledgers.  Blockchain accounting needs no bank.

Good stuff.  It's especially heartening that some people really understand what money is. As long as something is functioning as money, there is only so much aggregate money that the system needs to fulfill money's purpose.  Therefore increasing the count of the units of money does not generate any new value of money in aggregate. It merely alters the value of the units, and credits spending power from some to others.  That inflation gets expressed differentially merely shows that the people that receive the spending power have different investment preferences.

The difference is sublime.  
Fiat requires government, ie an unwilled imposition.  The fact that a few imposers are able to pull it off (USD, Euro, Yen, Yuan,...) does not diminish the contrary examples both historical and contemporary of fiat failure.  Failure is staved off on the fiats you mention not by the markets demanding for their quality but by violent removal of choice and volition.  $100T current value of liability is not "sound budget."
Without Bitcoin, we would need to confront this violence with kind and few have that in them.  
With Bitcoin, and moreso Monero, we can exercise choice and volition again.  
This is not radicalism.  It is plain technological furnishing of normal human desires.  
As the Internet neuters the authority of government to interfere with communication (and thusly denecessitates the US Constitution's 1st Ammendment neutering of power by law), Bitcoin neuters government power over money.  
We no longer need the fake news of centralized media or the fake accounting of the BIS.  
As to the ability to conjure new units of crypto by creating new cryptos, sure, but so what?  The crime of fiat inflation is not inflation itself; the crime is the non voluntary participation. The difference between love making and rape.  Between gifts of money and theft.  
Crypto offerings will be sorted out on the market. The void to fill for freedom money is huge.  How it gets filled is a wonderful experiment.

But the halvening was going to fall on many Bitcoin Redditors birthday regardless of the day.  The birthday problem is not really relevant only because it's excessive unnecesary to evoke it.  The likelihood of two Bitcoin redditors having a birthday on the halvening is essentially about as likely as you not guessing the private key of one of my Bitcoin holding addresses.

No, that's not quite what I am trying to say.  
Venezuela is a prime example of abhorrent state malfeasance, not just in its currency, but certainly so in its currency. 
I am attempting to say that ALL fiat currency is open to such malfeasance and all eventually fail by this malfeasance.  For the first time in human history we have a near global coordinated fiat scheme. Even Russia and China orbit the BIS reluctantly.   The BIS fiat scheme is woefully corrupted and is failing.  
The only people that will be OK in a global fiat fail are those that both see it coming and are well healed enough now to be not too severely afterwards. A few people in Venezuela are just fine. I don't pretend to be perfectly clairvoyant, but looking at the math and the current state of affairs, Venezuela is more or less how the Western world is destined.   
Bitcoin is wholly voluntary, so the people that will "benefit" relatively from fiat collapse are those who choose Bitcoin now amongst other strategies. 
Bottom line is that Venezuela should scare the F out of you.  But so should the USA. The evidence is enourmously behind my assertion. Fiat print, too big to fail, police state actions, military imposition of dollar dominance are all escalating, along with economic indicators failing, US employment participation, shipping stats, complete countries all over outright failing.

Well, yes. National currencies or in a few cases, super national currencies, require an economy with real value in order to have real value.  They are still abstract notions, completely symbolic and arbitrary in quantity.  
That they obtain value through the power of "government" is not a helpful nor even benign set of affairs.  Nor does it elevate fiat currency to being anything beyond fiat; the FOMC can add units of dollars to the Fed's balance sheet without the "economy" even having awareness of this fact.  That interest rates are conjured from their imagination and not from market price defies your claim that money is derived from markets.  
Money is obviously  an integral aspect of markets.  However the function of money can be performed by many concepts like bullion or other commodities or their receipts. For there to be a functioning money does not require government.  You might argue that bankstate money is more efficient as it provides a broad stable pricing mechanism.  But that is not the same at all as the market requiring government.  And in fact it is false.  The price of money (ie time value, aka, interest rates)  underlies the price of everything.  There is no real pricing mechanism when money is free.  (Or Volckeresque 20%, or whatever mystery price is pulled out of Ms Yellen's butt)
The causality is the opposite to what you state. Although fiat money requires the gun to attach itself to an economy, the markets will develop a functional money without the gun.  Fiat money needs markets (and obtains access to it through violence).  Markets do not need fiat.  
This is supported by observation of  the draconian methods deployed by states to ensure that economies use fiat. Greece, Iraq, Eurozone failings, Z/NIRP, TARP, India removing notes, Venezuala.
Note that centralized control of money is Plank  in the Communist Manifesto.  Note that Marx offered an "economic" solution to a moral ill.  Ie Communism is a moral system not an economic system.  Its wielders are well meaning (deluded) or power seeking.  
So while you make a rather banal statement, "fiat money is backed by the resources of a nation state," this does zero to change that three more important facts.  Fiat notions (notes) are purely abstract and fictitiously conjured.  The benefit of this conjuring has furnished vast power into very narrow hands.  It is all unnecessary.  
Fiat money is Fake Accounting.  It is theft.  Search "Catherine Austin Fitts two civilizayions" or "Ronald Bernard."   Put aside (if you can!) the repugnant depravity, evaluate the merit of the fiat system in economic terms.  It is a disaster.  The entire purpose is to derive unearned wealth from the productive economy and lay 90% of its profits into the laps of people who do nothing.

Everything humans do regards money and finance is done today by pure fiat.  That is to say the underlying base layer of asset is purely notional, central bank double entry ledger following BIS rules and orders. Purely imaginary notions.  The problem of course with that is that it is resting upon trust in humans.  This high avaricious power of course attracts the most intelligent articulate and soul less cretins humanity has to offer.  It's theatre.  
If the base asset were gold, the opportunity to vampire wealth would be much much diminished.  Currency as gold derivatives can circulate.  Bonds and debts can be enumerated in gold.   ( I don't particularly like national gold standards and prefer free markets to compete.   We don't need nations to enforce money standards in the Internet age.) 
So, if you can see that this is true for gold, you can see it is true for Bitcoin too.  But in important regards better with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has a transparent ledger.  It is easily verified and can be transferred easily and cheaply between two points on the Internet.  All manner of Finance can be performed with Bitcoin as a base money layer.  And many new ones too! Augur and Gnosis promise a future with trustless insurance.  Trustless and self managed identity (inexpensive too!).  There are early vestiges of debt markets (margin lending on exchanges).  
Debt, bonds, etc etc can be denominated in Bitcoin. Interest bearing deposits and loans can be done.  Banks can run on interest differences, verified fractional reserves and fees.  They just don't have Central bank protection rackets to let them misbehave.

I think its that plus this expectation that now that we have transportable trustless money, that we can do all the things trustless.  I just don't see trustless loans happening.  They require enforceable contracts and institutions that are willing and able to enforce.  Perhaps even government courts or reduced trust human oracles of certain smart (and painful) contracts.  
I guess I can imagine a smart Augur contract that pays out to Guido (my upcoming ICO) upon two high reputation oracles signing off that someone had a skiing "accident" when said someone didn't fulfill a debt contract.  Trustless, no courts, badda bing badda boom.  As part of the loan contract that someone had to fund his side of the Augur contract.

One criticism.  Bitcoin, PoW immutable Blockchain, Triple Entry Accounting...  it is intended to reinvent money.  So the deepest, most positive change is "bye-by" fiat, The BIS, all central banks.  Perhaps the author harbours a few statist sentiments.  
This is what makes Bitcoin the most interesting crypto.  It has the sole focus to be money. A salute to Core devs that are wholly committed to ignoring short term pains in order to maintain the higher principle of assurance of immutable accounting as achieved by as low as possible barrier to entry mining and direct observation by nodes.

You don't.  You fractionally reserve.  But your reserves are verifiable and all parties to a specific instrument know the parameters.  
Depositors deposit real Bitcoins (sign into a simple multisig time locked contract).  They receive an old school promissory of repayment from the intermediate.  The intermediate has now reserves.  They create new promissories payable to them in Bitcoin after time with interest.  These promisssories have value in themselves and can be used as currency to pay the expenses of profit achieving enterprise of the borrowers (or new heels if so inclined).  The intermediary can be trusted to pay these promisssories in real Bitcoin at term and with interest partially because there are reserves.  The reserves themselves can autopay at term into a contract and be divided to promissory holders in case of intermediary bankruptcy.  Ie no courts required for the reserve proportion.  
The promisssories all carry risk and get priced accordingly versus Bitcoin and other goods.  
This is what happens at banks today.  The evil crawls in when we call all of different instruments the same name.  Dollars on deposit at the Fed are very different than the dollars owed to me by my feckless cousin.  
Bitcoin promisssories will be well known to be different beasts than Bitcoins.  This is a much more palatable manner of affairs. 
Of course this is all premature.
It will doubtlessly require fiat failings to become reality.  Despite your protestations we are past the event horizon of History's first global fiat failure.

There are many examples of fiat failure. The US Dollar isn't that great relative to many assets. The US also exports inflation via military aggression which is reaching its limits.  
The US Dollar has also been degraded in several steps. Look up the value of the dollar as defined by the constitution in gold. Twice devalued, then removed altogether in 1971.  
Go ahead. Don't learn from history or current events. Stay self assured in the ability of the dollar. I think that is really unwise.

Which is why a coin worth $10B and a coin worth $1B have no real impact on a system of hundreds of $T.    The real goal must be getting to these levels of value and use.  All of the virtuous potential of decentralized immutable money will be lost if we are not in a much better position to scale and to do real economy applications as the current fiat system unwinds. 
The purpose of fiat is to create a monopoly to print through government conglomeration, removing freedom, then print with high impunity, stealing value from those beholden to hold fiat. It is deeply immoral and unstable. It is inherently set up to go up in flames as its wasteful mechanisms are paid for with inflation that must accelerate.  The current global BIS coordinated fiat system is wobbling more and more badly.

All fiat currencies fail. They do so because they rely on humans to not abuse their privelege to print money. But humans are human.  
The current global monetary system is dominated by a highly coordinated interconnection of major currencies. They are all escalating the quantity of money. This increase is how fiat money ends up failing.  The current government enforced monopoly of fiat as the highly dominant form of money permits printing without complete loss of confidence because there are few options to flee to. Putting aside the deep moral travesty in removing freedom and then stealing value, just merely the eventual failure of value of fiat is extremely harmful. 
The only point I was trying to make, is that if you think Venezeula or Egypt or Greece or Cyprus can't happen to Europe or USA, you better think again.  It can and when the debt vultures come home to roost, you better have gold, land and Bitcoin.

Yes and no.  Yes, free market capital theory doesn't need central banking.  No, the modern usage of the term "Capitalism" is conflated with financial capital which is dominated by money and thus central banks.  
That is my point.  Capital is mundane.  A system that puts and keeps a certain group in control of capital is Capitalism and has nothing to do with freedom of capital or any other freedom.  Until we have free choice of money, we do not have any free capital markets.  
We have allowed a system of monetary authority to associate itself with the notion of freedom by abuse of the term capitalism.  The term has been coopted. 
While it is meant to mean freedom to have property rights and freedom to move capital, etc it in practical terms actually means the exact opposite.

It's simple. The USD value is far higher than it would be if based solely on the "productivity" of obese ignorant Americans. The value of the USD comes from the imposition of its use on resource producing economies.   This is the purpose of military hegemony to impose the Dollar regime, or a little more broadly the BIS currency regime.  
When this spinning pyramid on its point can not continue, the USD value against real assets (like food) will drop precitously. This is already started. Eventually a lack of confidence will lead to an extreme drop. 
The tragedy in all of this is the collective fallacy that the USGov and Fed are just trying to do some good. They are ripping the world off by imposing a currency monopoly at home and leveraging that through debt to create a military imposed currency hegemony globally.  This so called debt and death paradigm serves very very narrow interests. It has nothing to do with the providence of the American people or any other state, "rescued" by American bombs.
And let me take it further, most Americans upon this realization will demand more, more wars, more destruction just as long as that dollar still buys something at McDo.
