The cost of production of a good affects its price. If mining was “cheap”, bitcoin wouldn’t be be worth much as anyone could do it. So does cost drive price, or demand drive price? Probably both. My point is if there are more people trying to mine, for it to be a profitable venture, eventually they will need to sell the new bitcoin at a higher price. Obviously if market demand is lower then the cost of mining, some people will stop mining, thus lowering the cost and possibly the price as well. Again it’s not a black or white scenario.

I think there is something called EDA that effectively does this. Although I’m not certain if BTC has it.

This is only partially correct. Regardless of the amount of total hashpower, you will still mine the same amount of Bitcoin transactions per block over an extended period of time. It does not make transaction times any shorter over an extended  period of time (as bitcoin automatically adjusts the mining difficulty).
For example,lets say we have total of 1000 hash per second at first. Bitcoin is chugging along, and 1 block is mined every 10 minutes on average(each block being about 1 Megabyte of transactions). All of a sudden, the hash power is cut to 500 hash per second. Now, it will take on average of 20 minutes for every block to be mined as the difficulty has not adjusted (as adjustment happens every 2016 bocks). However, if this continues, after about 2016 new blocks, bitcoin will adjust such that 500 hash per second will result in 1 block being mined in about every 10 minutes. If the opposite happens (1000 hash/sec becomes 2000 hash/sec), blocks will be generated on average of about every 5 minutes for a short period, but again the network will adjust, such that in about 2016 blocks, each block again will take 10 minutes to mine. 
In this way, bitcoin is self-correcting.  Every 2 weeks, 2016 blocks (each worth about 1 Megabyte of transactions) should be mined. Adding more/reducing hash power only affects the transaction times for the current 2016 block interval.
Of course in the short term period, if you lose say 99% of the mining power all of a sudden, it will take about 100x longer to mine blocks and there will be massive delays in transactions due to difficulty not being adjusted and blocks taking 100x longer to mine. Thus, 2 weeks becomes about 200 weeks (assuming the hash power stayed at the 1% it was before), effectively killing the network.
What more miners/mining does is 
1) Make it more expensive to mine bitcoin as a whole, as the same amount of approximate reward is shared amongst all the miners, and thus, increase the cost of minting new bitcoins. Miners will be expected to be compensated by selling their bitcoin for more money, and thus the price of bitcoin would increase (idealized scenario).
2) Secure the network, as reversing transactions becomes computationally much more difficult since you need much more hashpower now to create an equally valid chain with the same proof-of-work difficulty. Thus, more miners = more security over the long term.
This is from my understanding. Please comment if I made any mistakes anywhere.

Not necessarily.
It all depends on what the seller does with money they receive.
If they invest it in another venture with higher return, it was the right decision, even if the price of bitcoin went up. Right decision for both parties.
Similarly, if the price of bitcoin drops, and if the seller takes their money and invests in a worse venture, it was the wrong decision to sell. It was also the wrong decision of the buyer to buy.

It was an SMS hijacking problem that Authy may also suffer from it as well as your account can be taken over via SMS. I think Authy has addressed some of these issues but it may still exist with other sites that you are using Authy with.

I wouldn't recommend using Authy unless you know how to protect from other attack vectors:
