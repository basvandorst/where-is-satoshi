Some questions regarding this topic.  
Right now, the state can reach so far into your pocket that it can take money that isnt even in there yet as in wage garnishment for deadbeat dads.  So aren't there legitimate reasons to keep some of this state power?  That would mean anonymity at the application level is better than at the protocol level right?  And what about the view that keeping the code as is will contribute to the transparency of government and the establishment?  Thanks in advance for sharing yout views.

Pretty arrogant to think wall street is the arbiter of bitcoin's financial future.  It is a failure of imagination at its core.

The original post said they were starting Feb. 1 but I don't know if that was their target date or actual first day.  I had never heard of the place despite growing up nearby and my grandfather being Iberian so my visit was purely of the novelty of paying in bitcoin.  I would say there is no harm in setting them up because eventually someone will want to spend some down there.

The dollar doesn't need to collapse (or elderly people to commit suicide) for bitcoin to become a better store of value.  Diversification is important and the fact bitcoin is a better product should help it claim a significant chunk of the market.  The dollar's diminishing purchasing power should help move it along as well.

Well, I can't tell you one way or the other what to do, but I can at least offer some perspective and tell you the right things to think about.
First of all, it's earlier than you think.  Yes, I mean bitcoin and how it's in early stages, bla bla bla, but more importantly, it's earlier in your life than you can imagine.  You are so young and there is plenty of time and opportunity to recover from losses that may seem tragic right now.  That's not an invitation to be reckless with your decisions going forward, but to understand that it's not too late with respect to, well, anything.  You have a lifetime of decisions to make and appear to be learning some hard lessons early, which will hopefully only inform and improve you going forward.
Henry Ford himself said that you must invest in yourself while young, invest in your education and preparing yourself by mastering your tools, and that he didn't start saving until he was forty years old.  What that means is that you are right to be taking risks, but the problem is you are taking the wrong kinds of risks.  Gambling your family's money for a quick buck is not improving yourself and certainly not preparing for anything.  Keep in mind investment also includes dedicating your time and energy, not just your money.  In other words, don't chase money --- chase knowledge, understanding, and your passions.  That should be your focus.
With respect to your investment into bitcoin, the best thing you can do is approach your family about it.  If it's everyone's money, and not just yours, you have an obligation to inform them what's happening.  Regardless of their reaction, you'll feel alot better about it.  It'll be a family problem, and you won't have to carry the weight yourself.  Then, after they yell at you, you can explain the benefits and risks of bitcoin, and you can all decide together what to do.  
I personally believe in bitcoin, but not because it has the potential to make me money.  It's the reverse -- I believe in the value of the technology and its ability to make some positive changes in our world, and I want to support that system with my investment -- putting my money where my mouth is.  Yes, it has the potential to give me a nice return, which is definitely part of it, but that's the effect, not the purpose.  If you are only looking for high returns without a deeper appreciation for the technology and what it can do, maybe bitcoin is not the right investment for you. 
tl;dr -- Fess up, learn something, get some sleep

To clarify this point because it confused me at first.  You can save the bit address page and then open it up on a computer that is disconnected from the internet because the key pairs can be generated from the page code itself.  I would also use Ubuntu from a usb drive (no need to install) as the OS to open the page and generate the new addresses to be extra safe.

It was a memento for the very early adopters.  The really exciting documentaries are still to come.

I answered below.  Generating on an OS that will never be online again obviates the need to throw away your computer.

The deterioration of the old model and the emergence of the new one, especially when we are talking about society wide implementation, does probably take at least one human lifetime to overcome the inertia of people entrenched in the old system.  There is also something to  be said about change being slow until it is not, that is until it manifests and is visible seemingly overnight.  You make a good point that it requires work, but just because the vision hasnt been realized doesnt mean it wont be evetually.  It is the same drum all skeptics of the new beat incessantly.  Also interestingly, Bucky himself talked about these gestation periods.  And he also said ultimately what matters is the integrity of the system.  It would be unfortunate if his ideas and bitcoin took so long that only our great grandchildren will see them realizer, but I hope and think the timeline is much shorter.

Tldl:  societal bonds are stronger than governments so banning wont work when people gotta eat.  so the only effective way for gov to defeat bitcoin is to improve monetary policies that make bitcoin useless, i.e. go back to gold and use its superior liquidity and familiarity. But obviously gov isn't about to give up its credit based monetary monopoly so it wont happen and bitcoin will win.

Don't be misled.  He's on record saying Bitcoin needs to be backed by something.  He wants to use stocks and have it pegged, whatever that means.  He doesn't really understand it.

This sounds like an episode of Black Mirror.  I certainly think microtransactions could make it so every human action comes with a tip jar.  But everyday gestures will be so common that the monetary value will become negligible.  It will instead become a social currency.  Maybe some people will want to keep accumulating points but others will rebel and the pendulum will swing back.  If it becomes rude to expect a satoshi for a smile then maybe it swings all the way back and we demonitize many more aspects of our social interactions like cooking for one another (restauranst) or giving each other rides (taxis or uber) or babysitting kids.  The seepage of corporate influence into our everyday lives and the accompanying culture of monetizing everyyhing I believe can be stopped and reversed more easily once we transfer value to a decentralized system.  People's desire for community is strong and a less hierarchical system could create the cultural environment where that building takes place.  It's definitely an interesting question but I have hope in people's humanness.

This debate is so off the mark.  They both treat Bitcoin as a digital version of currency based on the centralized debt-based financial system currently in place.

Everyone is so concerned with bitcoin's feasibilty as a currency, that is ease of use, reducing friction, and pushing for merchant adoption.  But imho it will ultimately succeed because of its ability to store wealth better than fiat.

The most encouraging aspect of this is Matt Miller's tone and how it was completely transformed over less than two weeks.  In the first video he likens buying bitcoin to a drug deal and refers to the Forbes reporter that tried to also live off Bitcoin as a "bicycle-riding vegan type of San Francisco person."  By the end, he is being accused by the other talking heads as being "a believer" and defends himself and bitcoin by pointing out the quantitative easing policies of the Fed.    I think it shows that if you look closely and stay intellectually honest, the merits of bitcoin become obvious. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:08:53
Many knowledgeable people believe that if quantitative easing isn't tapered in time or if the Saudis start trading oil in other currrencies, we could see double digit inflation of the dollar.  I'm not sure why you are so closed to the possibilty of that happening. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:50:28
I don't think it's a matter of age or early exposure to information age technology so much as not having enough faith in the system.   Like you said, value is in consensus and we are not there yet.  There are many reasonable people not sold on the future of bitcoin.  That of course does not excuse the lack of imagination and intellectually-dishonest approach many skeptics take in their evaluation.
