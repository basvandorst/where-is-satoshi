Nick, this is the average APR AFTER defaults. your investments pay more than 19%, and if you diversify well you, a few defaults won't hurt you too much and you will still have a very positive APR. We couldn't be doing 1M in loans if we didn't have great returns for a large portion of our investors.

hi there
yes we are legit :)
It is true that we've had scammers in the past, but we are working everyday to make their lives harder. It shows in the repayment rates which have recently increased to 87%. 
More important than the repayment rates are the Returns which you can achieve if you diversify well:
Today we just released our stats page where you can follow the ROIs that are possible on btcjam.

We've hired an amazing support person Alexis and she usually responds quite fast. Also the credit scoring has improved a lot with the 23,000 BTC we've loaned out and our current repayment rate right now is around 90%. For A borrowers the default rate is around 2% - so as long as you diversify well and invest in A and B borrowers you can make fantastic returns.

Elan, sorry to hear this. Can you provide me your btcjam username, I'd love to see what happened and how we can fix that in the future.
And thanks for being a user!

Havelock is very different - they are a stock exchange for companies. We are a market place for loans and we do extensive credit check on all of our borrowers - hence our 90% repayment rates and positive ROI for investors.

 has provided over 4M in loans so far. As you correctly found out, you can tie loans to USD, so you are not exposed to the price volatility.
On BTCJam you can define your own terms - length of repayment, interest, etc.
So there is a good chance you can get a good rate there.
The other nice thing about BTCJam is that everything happens online, and you never have to talk to someone or fill out longer paper forms.
Of course we always recommend taking the loan with the lowest interest rate you can find, so if you couldn't get funded on BTCJam with a competitive rate, it's probably better for you to go to your bank. Nobody should pay more interest than they absolutely have to.
Thanks for considering us!

Our repayment rates right now are around 90%. 
Returns around 15-25% are definitely possible with BTCJam (some are even better, some definitely worse too). We have a very strict identity verification process that leverages Facebook, LinkedIn, Identity Documents, Address Verification and more. On top we have an arbitration process in place that is legally binding in over 140 countries that enables people to do collections on their defaulted loans.
We highly recommend that you diversify in 50 or more listings, in order to mitigate losses from any one investment.

that is absolutely correct. just make sure you select BitstampUSD in your loan application (which is the default). The repayment happens exactly as you described it.
As long as you sell your BTC for USD right after your loan got funded and have income in USD, you should have no problem in buying back the needed bitcoin and paying back the loan whenever it's due.
good luck with it!

Hi Cryptonaut420 - agreed that we had a lot of scammers in the beginning (heck, we had anonynmous loans!). But the recent numbers are much better. Repayment rates are around 90%. Volume is increasing rapidly, with a 50% month growth in may vs april, june growing even more. That is only possible if investors are making good returns, so I think the numbers speak for themselves. Also, we are very thankful for everybody who took a chance on us early and may have lost bitcoin - I think we've been able to improve a lot and now the platform is giving great returns for everybody who's willing to give us a shot, invests in A and B borrowers and diversifies well.

which is basically what we are doing at btcjam :)

can somebody please link to the statement made by FINMA?
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:26:46
we are definitely not a scam. Of course we've had scammers in the past - but we are improving the scammer detection on a daily basis and it shows in our repayment rates which are now between 85% and 90%. We're also doing around 1M a month in loan volume and I don't think investors would keep re-investing if it was all a scam.
You can see the returns you could make if you diversify well here:

Guys. MAC has repaid over 2000 bitcoins on the site so far. He is having difficulties right now, but has communicated that he is committed to paying back (and has already done so on one of the loans that he was being late on). At this time, we have no reason to believe that he won't be paying back.
On top of that, MAC does not 'single-handedly' keep BTCJam going. We have thousands of borrowers, most of them (90%) which pay back their loans on time.
P2P Lending will ALWAYS have defaults. Investors MUST diversify in different loans in order to guarantee positive returns. Positive returns also make it easier for investors to be psychologically less attached to the failure of a few individual loans.

It is a lot for the 1st world. But not at all compared to interest rates for example in Brazil, where you can pay 120 to 200% APR on your outstanding credit card debt (see   Or take Payday loans, which can quickly be 3000% APR (just go to wonga.com if you don't believe me). We help people who otherwise can't get affordable credit at a much, much better rate than they otherwise could.

Loans can be linked to a local exchange rate, so you are really taking a loan denominated in USD. We strongly encourage all of our borrowers to take loans in whatever currency their income is in.

Hi Grafs50:
Here is a blog post explaining expected APR:
The excpected loss is an ESTIMATION based on historical performance of loans similar to the one listed.
