the taproot BIP enables schnorr, once it has received sufficient review and the implementation has received sufficient testing, you'll probably see a soft-fork proposal that bundles taproot and maybe something like ANYPREVOUT/CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. sipa would probably be the one propose an a schedule for the soft-fork. if you look at bitcoin-dev you can see the recent discussion about ANYPREVOUT. given that ANYPREVOUT would be bundled with taproot, and people don't wanna do too many soft-forks, the ANYPREVOUT discussion might delay schnorr a bit.

because when you make a given state, you'd want it to spend from any of the previous states, if you're doing eltoo. you can't do that with SIGHASH_ALL.
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:34:24
eltoo uses NOINPUT to make sure you an always replace a state with a later state. a counterparty would publish an old state with more balance, and you'd wanna prevent that. lightning, as it currently is, has a punishment scheme in place, which is pretty complicated to what eltoo does using noinput.
did you read the eltoo paper?


everybody is already trying to do the simplest thing. lightning is not really about sharing secret keys, since that would put you an equal footing. lightning is about agreeing on a state and being able to make old states overridable. i think it would be easier to explain to you why the "simplest thing" does not suffice if you lay it out in more detail.


i don't know what you mean by this. currently, in lightning, the commitment transactions spend from the funding transaction. you need a funding transaction. the inputs are fixed. eltoo makes it possible to put in the "trigger tx" or a previous commitment tx as input. while with lightning as it currently is, you can spend from your counterparties commitment tx if it is old and has been revoked, because he gave you the revocation key (as a prerequisite for you agreeing to a new state).

I didn't realize that you don't want an article written about you. But I also respectfully disagree, and I think that it is worth a try. Having nothing on you is not necessarily the best way to combat fake news, do you really think that? People noticing the disagreement should be prompted to engage in the discussion. I know that you gave up on Wikipedia, but I don't think it is as black/white as you suggest. Fake news is a problem, but Wikipedia is not a lost cause, it is still an informational source, and this article doesn't need to be more than links to your papers. There are more than enough Bitcoiners that will remove slander. We had the same issue with the articles on SegWit2x and SegWit conflating them, I think the situation has improved.

Here's an idea: Every time you buy something with bitcoin, you could save the ID of the store in the transaction if you wanted. That way, everyone would be able to check where the brick-and-mortar transactions are being made. It would be like EasyBitz, but decentralized. It would require a standard protocol for saving it in the blockchain, of course.

Mark used be just another schizophrenic (with split personality) role playing nerd with an interest in Japan. Looking for the recognition he never got in real-life, he uses his Japanese alter-ego, which lives at night, after his parents sleep: *Satoshi Nakamoto*. His desire for recognition makes Bitcoin a masterpiece.
Mark gets annoyed how much credit the alter-ego is getting, but he has to keep Satoshi's identity secret to remain in the stage light; he knows society would never accept the real him.
He chooses PHP as the implementation language for MtGox, Satoshi would never had done that: nobody will discover his secret like this. But daytime Mark embraced the PHP coder mentality to an extreme extent: he now also ignores facts (like a true PHP coder) and repress his own knowledge of Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, Satoshi notices the MtGox exchange has gotten very big. He applies the transaction malleability issue to attack this repulsive amateur exchange, Bitcoin is too good for this, he's doing the world a favor. Who is this Mark Karpales and why does he seem so familiar? Satoshi feels déjà vu each time he seems him... Anyway, if the world can't even decide to use a proper exchange, clearly they are not ready.
Satoshi destroys all the coins: "Fuck the system". It's no fun being rich if you can't tell anyone.

in Electrum you either have a segwit seed, or a legacy seed. If you use a segwit seed, Electrum uses bech32 addresses, which means it won't start with a 3. You can't receive on both types of addresses in the same wallet, with Electrum.

Lightning has its own transport layer encryption layer which sits on top of TCP. This method simply connects over TCP, sets up the transport encryption, so that you send the messages specified in BOLT-02 of the Lightning RFC standard.
This includes the routing advertisements, but also all other messages. Even if there was no routing, you would of course need to connect before being able to open a channel.
Routing money over an LN channel means: Updating commitment transactions for parties to reflect a change of balance.
To route money like this, all the peers along the route need to update commitment transactions. They do this by sending messages such as update_fulfill_htlc and commitment_signed and revoke_and_ack. These messages are wrapped in the transport encryption layer and then in TCP. TCP is wrapped in ethernet or WiFi or GPRS or UMTS or Docsis.
One route on one layer doesn't necessarily correspond to a route on another layer. For example, a LN node can have multiple channels open, and could be present on a LN path multiple times.

Because the real signatures are not in the actual block anymore, segwit inputs look like "anyone can spend" to old clients. This makes them verify to old clients, thereby being backwards compatible.

the bitcoin backbone protocol extracts basic properties of bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure, such as "common prefix" and "chain quality", and shows how fundamental applications including consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them. the underlying assumptions are "proofs of work" (POWs), adversarial hashing power strictly less than 1/2 *and* no adversarial pre-computation -- or alternatively, the existence of an unpredictable "genesis" block.
in this paper it is shown how to remove the latter assumption, presenting a "bootstrapped" bitcoin-like blockchain protocol relying on POWs that builds genesis blocks "from scratch" in the presense of adversarial pre-computation. the only known previous result in the same setting (unauthenticated parties, no trusted setup) is indirect in the sense of creating a PKI first and then employing conventional PKI-based authenticated communication.
with the construction shown, it is established that consensus can be solved directly by a blockchain protocol *without* trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power). *miner unlinkability* is also formalized, a privacy property for blockchain protocols, and the protocol from the paper is demonstrated to retain the same level of miner unlinkability as bitcoin itself.

How do the different transaction scripts look like? I see you are leveraging MuSig, Eltoo (e.g. with ANYPREVOUT) and Schnorr. Could you provide example scripts for the Lightning channel factory use case?
For example, it is unclear to me what "multi atomic swap" means. A Lightning channel needs an opening transaction (in the original eltoo paper, it needs a trigger tx too, but I think that was shown to be unnecessary). I am curious to know how many transactions would be needed to make a Lightning channel with factories and statechains, and which transactions are posted to which "chains" (I guess you consider a statechain a chain even if members are not linked...). And which transactions are modified once the funding transaction needs changing?

You cannot use the BIP 173 (Bech32 / bc1) format in older Electrum versions, because it cannot decode those addresses. You CAN send to p2wpkh-in-p2sh addresses that start with 3, but you will have to pay more to spend them compared to funds sent to native segwit addresses.

If you want to fix it, it is probably related to Pyinstaller. Previously Python was bundled in a different way.

Qt was upgraded to a different release with millions of lines of code changes.
17.10 is also very new, and added Wayland which wouldn't have played a role before.
Another thing you can try is to use `Xephyr` to run a X server in a window, and then launch a window manager and applications in there. That would be a good way for you to learn how the X architecture works.

It is a subjective statement, of course. I am also not disagreeing with them. Consider the fact that BIP 173 is dated March 2016. Should it really take 1,5 years to establish consensus on a BIP so simple? We have to ask ourselves this question. Note how I am NOT arguing for "firing Core". :)

"MuSig is effectively a key aggregation scheme for Schnorr signatures." (quoted from [blog post](
So signature aggregation requires Schnorr, but it is an independent protocol that Bitcoin Core doesn't need to implement, and probably won't. Bitcoin Core will still happily verify aggregated signatures, since they cannot be distinguished from other signatures.
Schnorr is implemented in [PR 558]( for libsecp256k1.

Mimblewimble as explained in this talk is a method for doing transactions. Bitcoin certainly doesn't support mimblewimble yet. It would require a soft fork (but it is so pervasive I am not sure it makes sense to do it as a soft fork).
Lightning uses the transactions of the underlying coin (e.g. Grin, Bitcoin) to function. The current implementations of Lightning follow the Lightning-RFC repo, which mandates using Bitcoin script.
The swaps you mention can be done using HTLC's outside of Lightning already. But doing swaps on Schnorr is better since they are indistinguishable from other outputs. Using mimblewimble implies using Schnorr.
If BOLT-02/03 from the Lightning-RFC were remade using Schnorr, it would offer improved privacy. But it would definitely require the support of the underlying chain.
The essence of Lightning is the combination of a dedicated protocol and the swaps of the underlying chain (be it multi-hop locks or HTLCs).
Even if Bitcoin adds Schnorr via Musig, it won't be Mimblewimble.

If you use a weird desktop environment, maybe you need to launch Xwayland yourself. After launching Xwayland, launch Electrum with `DISPLAY=:0 ./electrum` or similar.
On X, the environment variable DISPLAY tells applications how to connect to the X server. This is not specific to Ubuntu.
In Ubuntu 17.10, Wayland is the native graphics environment and Xwayland is used a compatiblity layer. You can launch the desktop session with everything running on X instead of using Wayland, if you change the desktop session in GDM before logging in. This is something else you can try.
But all of this is not specific to Electrum, so try asking on askubuntu.com or similar sites. If you get xclock working, you can launch Electrum in the same environment, and it should be able to connect to X.
There might also be an option to have Qt use Wayland directly using an environment variable, possibly using the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` environment variable.
xclock is just an example of a minimal X application that you can use to test if your X server is working.

Delete that file (`/usr/bin/electrum`), since it wasn't deleted by the package managers. Now you should have a system completely cleaned. Verify that by searching: `find /usr -name '*electrum*'`.

No, "correct usage" can not be enforced by consensus rules. NOINPUT is a problem if you spend to something that was e.g. already spent from using NOINPUT. How can any Bitcoin node if the tx it is spending to can be spent from with NOINPUT? It can't.

I figured out how to use pinocchio ([paper]( on Ubuntu 15.10 on amd64:
    wget -O vc.zip "
    unzip vc.zip
    cd pinocchio/ccompiler/external-code
    make
    cd ../input
If you are on a 64-bit system, edit `make.in` and put `-m32` after gcc.
Do the same in `../src/build-test-matrix.py` on the first occurence.
Now adjust `../../common/App.py` to make it use a file that actually exists (`eqtest` doesn't). You can try `two-matrix`. Just comment it out, and comment `eqtest`.
Now launch:
    python ../src/build-test-matrix.py
If you get no error, build:
    make -f make.matrix
You can generate a diagram of the result:
    python ../src/drawcirc.py --arith build/two-matrix-p0-b32.arith --out output.pdf
View it:
    evince output.pdf
This is what it looks like for `two-matrix`: 
`two-matrix.c` itself looks like this:
     "two-matrix-ifc.h"
    
    void outsource(struct Input *input, struct Output *output)
    {
    	int i, j, k;
    	int t;
    	for (i=0; i&lt;SIZE; i+=1)
    	{
    		for (j=0; j&lt;SIZE; j+=1)
    		{
    			t = 0;
    			for (k=0; k&lt;SIZE; k+=1)
    			{
    				t = t + MAT(input-&gt;a, i, k) * MAT(input-&gt;b, k, j);
    			}
    			MAT(output-&gt;r, i, j) = t;
    		}
    	}
    }
With `two-matrix-ifc.h`:

I wouldn't categorize this just as a privacy improvement. It is similar to the improvements offered by Schnorr in that transactions have the same size regardless of the amount of signers. And consider the fact that this might be [patented](
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:11:32
The graph can only include what is known, of course. Your client will show a boolean, because it might also know about some private channels. Public graph websites will show only the private channels that were communicated to them.
It is possible to prove that a channel exists using the channel_announcement message, this is what is done for public channels.

Lightning can't fail (because it is already working on testnet. Just like TCP/IP isn't failing, even though you might have a buggy implementation currently), it just needs some polishing before its mainnet ready. Because 2X doesn't have replay protection, lots of users will probably lose funds. Imagine if Roger Ver gets a full-page NYT ad directing users to download a 2X wallet. Addresses look the same. It's would be a disaster. Hard forks (especially without mandatory replay protection) should be disapproved of, or people will regularly lose money because of it.

You forgot the timestamp in the URL. I also posted this, with a timestamp at the start of the Lightning panel discussion

Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized. John Doe can't really run a Bitcoin node on his phone and have a 100 GB blockchain. He could use SPV but bloom filters leak his privacy and pseudoanonymity makes it way to easy to reveal himself otherwise. The Electrum servers could be attacked, would leave users vulnerable. Lightning is good but WatchTower isn't ready which makes it way too dangerous to use right now.
Mimblewimble doesn't have a monotonically growing blockchain, I think that is a really important improvement. A better chance of creating a really decentralized network.
Imagine if GNU had time to develop before MS-DOS became the norm. Then it wouldn't have been a 20 year struggle to get hardware supported on Linux.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:08:46
Centralization will be because it is convenient, not because it is mandatory. And how is it an existential risk to Lightning?
Regarding point 2, it all depends on your channel timeout. That is one of these things you can tweak. If you only put your day-to-day use in Lightning channels, you would most likely be able to afford a long lock time, since amounts will be low.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:18:51

I would argue that lightning will be less decentralized than Bitcoin, where you have only thousands of full nodes. Lightning may get more nodes cause it is easier/cheaper to run one .

Quoting Omer from their Telegram:


This implementation has the potential to be much faster than Lindell 2017 in the setup phase because communication rounds are reduced significantly. However class groups operations are much more slower than the Paillier operations used in L17 so currently I would estimate they are equal (to be tested). Any help with improving the efficiency of class-groups library ( would be much appreciated (see long list of issues there).

No, signatures are not really compressable, they look random. But MimbleWimble solves the issue by only having to store outputs that can currently be spent. On Bitcoin you need the whole chain to verify. In MimbleWimble you don't, you just need the currently spendable outputs.

You are just being lucky. If echo was a bit slower, the line would not have been written yet. Try:

The cat succeeds, but reads the file when it is still empty. Now imagine that the file already existed, in that case, the old content could still be there upon execution of command two because the file wouldn't have been truncated yet.

You can reduce the memory usage further by using a light-weight browser:
    while true; do links2 -g " sleep 10; killall links2; done
(since I don't think it does auto-reloading)
Or, if you only need the graph, you could just pull it and use ImageMagick (or even lighter: xloadimage) to display it (and you wouldn't need a browser at all).

Features like fault tolerance, strong typing, pre/post-conditions are either not supported or not commonly used in JavaScript. Those features are useful for certain use cases, a financial exchange could be one of them.
As an example take something like [the fault tolerance of Erlang]( For something as inherently "message oriented" as an exchange, I think Erlangs model fits very well.
Now consider weak typing. Lets say the user inputs the amount he wants to transfer. In some obscure rarely used code path, we have forgotten to "cast" the string input as Number. If you don't see where I'm going, tell me what should happen if I execute `Math.sqrt("5" + 2)`. I'd prefer the error for something like an exchange, for my personal website it's not so critical. Right tool for the job.  Try executing that in a JavaScript console and tell me the result makes sense. In fact, I think strong typing is not enough, I'd prefer static typing too.
In short: JavaScript was not designed for financial software.

I am convinced that proper mining is automated. The system discovers a Brain Wallet and wants to make real money, it should automatically poll until the wallet contains enough money.
If this hypothesis is correct, giving hints makes no difference at all, since the bots isn't reading them. Human time is so much more expensive than everything else, why would anyone invest time in reading and thinking about your posts, when they can just make a bot?
Also, just because some bots are stupid and take even the smallest amounts, doesn't mean that all bots do.

When are the money converted then? If I buy 1 BTC for 50$, where are the bitcoins stored? In Bitstamp or in my own wallet? If they are instantly converted to dollars, it would mean that you'd need to withdraw them as Bitcoins right after the transfer if you think the Bitcoin exchange rate is going to rise.

I don't get your Windows arguments. If you made it about browsers, it would make more sense, but still not really. Do you think Chrome or Firefox for Windows is more insecure than it is for Linux? The only good reason to make your argument is, that there is no ancient versions of IE for Linux, which probably makes the percentage of "unsafe browser users per platform" high for Windows.

I'm pretty sure it's not possible to open a Java local file browser without having the permission already ([a privileged applet](
The HTML file input element makes it possible to submit automatically when the file dialog is closed without canceling (that is, a file was chosen). Which is interesting, cause you don't need confirmation and I imagine there is a pretty high probability that people choose the wrong file and push "OK". With old-school HTML forms they'd see the wrong file name and correct, but if it submits right away, they won't.
