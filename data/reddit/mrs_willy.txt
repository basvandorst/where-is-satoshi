5200 if you are lucky on BTC. Possible, but gtfo on 28k ffs lol.
And RSI support my arse.
At least you eth trade ill give you that.
And lift off date is about now if at all. Not April 11th. If things go right to the end of the triangle, much more likely to be bearish.

Why would you want to pay for bills if its going to go up so much?

So was downvoted to oblivion here every time I suggested a bear.
But not looking too good is it? I called setting stop losses at 5.6k as if that broke, it is a shiftiest.
Anyways, see what you will Btc weekly. Just trying to help.

Yup. playing out nice. :)

no, it was a test of previous 5.7 and it smashed through it and now struggling to touch it as resistance. Think 5k gets tested this weekend. Whatever it is, it 100% confirms a continuing bear market and looking left on a chart, there is not a lot to fall back on now that its at 5.5k.
