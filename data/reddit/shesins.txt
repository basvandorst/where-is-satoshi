Thank you for doing this for the rest of us.  Im sorry the results were not what you, me or any of us would have wanted.  Youve made and influenced the future and history.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:22:44
You are pretty awesome/savvy/intelligent but your drawing skills could use some work, jeeze.
@_date: 2012-12-12 07:46:29
My family really loves mmorgs so they usually have great graphic cards so thats good to know.
@_date: 2012-12-12 07:42:55
:)  Thanks!  Thats a very good analogy.  I ask because my mom and brother have some very good computers, they play a lot of online games.
While id love to actually make a bit of money with this (currently unemployed therefore it seemed like the ideal proposition) I imagine ill just use the bitcoins to tip people on reddit, or donate  :)
@_date: 2012-12-12 07:45:03
Very very good to know, many thanks.
@_date: 2012-12-12 07:44:44
I havent downloaded any software (well asides from the test software that didnt actually have me accumulating any yet).  Im still wanting to learn a little bit more before decided on software... some seem more reliable than others.
I wish I was new to BC though, I could use a trip to Vancouver.
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:11:49
:D   
@_date: 2012-12-13 15:15:28
I completely agree.  Bitcoins are fairly new in concept so it would not be too hard to switch universal terminology at this point.  The more it catches on the harder it will be.   As someone fairly new to it, but had previously read about it, I was so puzzled as how someone could mine for something that did not exist and I was turned off of it right away.  Plus it reminded me of minecraft.    ....I don't know why that was bad but it was.
@_date: 2012-12-17 15:36:51
@_date: 2012-12-18 04:25:55
Aren't I great, you give me the gift of knowledge about bitcoins and then I go ahead and say, I'd like some more, please, sir.
@_date: 2012-12-17 15:34:56
I guess i'll attempt this!  You prompted me awhile ago to look into bitcoins more so, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:38:18
Its up now.
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:01:53
I love you reddit detectives :)
@_date: 2013-09-06 02:35:07
Sadly, this makes me want to say Well, looks like bitcoin was shit all along.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:37:19
Yeah... it is addictive. I'm back to reading/trading.  At least most of the bubble/speculative posts are gone!
@_date: 2013-03-16 22:02:32
Just the person they were stolen from instead.
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:07:01
I'd like to congratulate everyone on understanding sarcasm.  Especially you.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:47:55
I think we could do a quick and dirty job but it would be a horrible cockup.
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:33:46
I actually became quite minimal with my spending due to job loss and not being able to get one for a couple months.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:33:40
Yeah, it seems like it is, I made a transfer and after that it started herping and derping. .... I guess I broke it :(
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:20:51
Oh, I suppose I have an amazon.com credit of about $170 through mTurking which I don't mind to part with considering i'm Canadian and I swear their shipping has changed for the worse.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:53:40

You = not left out, nor forgotten about.
Sorry I didn't say thanks the other day- As a Canadian it had been eating away at my brain :)
Have a good day at work!
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:49:04
I bought!
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:20:25
No, no, no.  Kid, you're doing it all wrong.  You have to either mention BFLabs or Simcity.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:33:09
I also send my sympathy, my empathy.
I briefly went over the comments and didn't quite see my suggestion.
Settle on a btc price before you meet, transfer that amount to an instawallet before hand, you bring your computer and show him that amount (while having something over the address bar).  Get the merchandise and then give him the computer to transfer it to their account.
This way you'll still be "in control" of the wallet if they refuse to give up the item at the time of purchase.  
I can see this being hit and miss but a little more secure.
And escrow has of course come up which is a good idea, maybe be recording on your laptop cam the transaction so the escrow company will have evidence on your side.
Sadly it seems like trading in person requires to be unanonymous.
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:01:33
Why thanks (and yes!  it is-I had to unsubscribe to this sub because all I was thinking about all the time was BTC.  Still haven't signed back up.)
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:24:22
I'd love to go but from Canada, as someone who has not "made" any money off BTC I don't think I can afford to.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:11:06
Avoid taxes all together?
No I want to pay taxes.   Taxes pay so that my brother with a terminal illness was able to live this long, and will continue to do so-for awhile.
I want to pay taxes for the rest of my life so others have the same opportunity.
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:57:25
That is seriously awesome.   It looks amazing.  I would 100% buy it if I had a shop.  I will consider buying it anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:12:18
Awesome.  Thanks. I'm always wary of poorly designed websites.
Maybe I will use CBTC.com, i'm considering a couple other options at the moment.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:14:16
You have more money than us.  Congratulations, you are clearly the better human being.
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:26:27
~.^   Yes it was.  Fox news is just that horrible.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:43
Just jumped to 225.  WTF
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:02:58
I did have some but, it was more of "what is this?" not "Oh, hello bitcoins"
I remember hearing about it a year ago or so but I very briefly looked into it and found it incomprehensible.  Now, more people like you are talking about it and helping others understand it.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:50:50
I want to write something other than thanks but I never thought you'd go back on your word, so i'm not surprised.  People in this subreddit are solid.
So.. uh...  thank you again :)  And don't worry about the transaction fee!  None of us even mind.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:33:47
It's usually pretty great when bitcoin rises, but at the cost of the Euro crashing?  No.  I don't want that.  I don't want that at all.
@_date: 2013-03-29 09:04:51
Love this.  I feel like they need to put this a bit more prominently because I was searching for whether they'd be scummy and charge you extra for going on sprint minutes.
Do I need to buy minutes from Sprint or anyone else? 
No. We're the first-ever wireless provider to bundle Wi-Fi calling with access to cellular whenever you need it. Your Republic Wireless membership includes unlimited data, calling and text over Wi-Fi and Sprint's cellular network
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:43:10
As much as I want to say yes! We'd be volunteering a person who may really not want to and s/he already stated that they might not have a lot of time in the near future.
Also, anonymity is central to bitcoin and perhaps they'd like to stay that way (for whatever reason)
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:51:49
Oh, I know, but I can't even imagine the world's populations that are stuck with nothing.  This seems like the rich will get richer because the poor have nothing to invest and quite often will be the last to hear about bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:59:15
grok?  Where are you from?
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:18:45
Well, this seems like a good point and I imagine now that it's been said, someone will adopt this policy and maybe even send out an email to the user's address to alert them of this fact, if they elected to use one.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:28:16
Yes.  Economics is frustrating to learn.
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:00:05
Alright, I got you a downvote.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:33:05
I honestly don't think its dipping back down for very long.  And I am in your EXACT position.  Wanted to buy at 30, and 45 but had no money.  Now I have a bit for a couple bitcoins.  I'd love it if it did dip but I really think its settling much higher.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:52:52
Maybe there is some legal/tax reason behind this.  
Or, maybe reddit is just not sure about bitcoins/transaction fees and reddit gold essentially costs them nothing so why not accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:57:40
I agree!
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:58:02
Well, good!  Its a future, location conditional date.
@_date: 2013-03-07 05:09:09
Perhaps the most appropriate gif for your comment.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:34:37
Some women DO give a crap about BTC, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:40:24
I guess I can't handle that.... it seems absolutely devastating.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:45:05
Hm yeah, I would effectively be buying at 69/BTC.
Thanks :)
Also, all the texts they sent were in spanish..... again with the spanish.  hmf.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:47:50
Hm, i'd disagree, I would think that reddit does not have that many advertisers so anyone wanting to buy ad space would be in demand- or at least their money.
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:42:44
Um, can I pm you it?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:42:24
But..... but... you're putting this on!
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:41:44
I asked a couple ladies in GGB and they haven't made that much, which was my feeling.
Hmm about me.  I'm a very part-time server currently.  My skills... well, i'm decent at quite a lot of things, which is really vague but sums me up rather well.
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:18:58
Its really because they just wouldn't have a desk, isn't it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 09:05:38
Naw, but someone better start this soon.
@_date: 2013-03-16 21:43:17
For sure!
@_date: 2013-03-16 21:31:55
tipbot reject!!!
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:59:00
I briefly read that, so are they investing in "real world" markets, because investing in a bitcoin only market through someone else.... just doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:43:00
Well, if you come down to Winnipeg I shall take you out for a drink!  
Where in Texas*?  When I was in NY I met some people from Farmers Branch and they were most lovely!
*Actually, you may not want to say which is just fine!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:14:01
Is everyone happy now?
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:29:47
If it is indeed possible to do that then this will be left up to our/the users implicit and overt consensus.  
I imagine we'd run into snags with time: It would take quite a while for someone to notice the fraudulent transaction (goods not being sent?) and by then the coins could be off to MtGox and fiat weeks before being able to label them as black coins/addresses.
Addresses of course, are so easy to generate that there would never be the need to use that one again.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:09:40
I was going through tipbots history and I saw this; you're still tipping in this sub!  Thats...  cool man.  
That is all. No reply necessary :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:32
I happen to think that was bitcoinbillionaire, but maybe not.  Coincidental perhaps.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:20:37
I approve.  I should do the same, about the ass part.

@_date: 2013-04-11 12:58:38
Can confirm, 1.5 days waiting time from bank transfer to wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:39
I also really like cavirtex,just began my first experience with them and I like them.  Also, it almost seems like their customer service is open 27/4 through the phone?   I called them really early this morning in fact.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:52:56
Will the price always shoot up by that much or (until we hit bit capacity) will the amount it goes up by fluctuate?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:48:27
We don't know.   I really hope Mt.Gox would cancel all orders.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:35:04
That much!  Did you deposit a lot of money?  Two thirds could either be a little or a lot depending on the amount you said to charge.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:38:52
Really, its a compliment.  :P
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:58:03
No prob!
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:41:14
I wonder what reddit analytics are looking like for this post.
Also I will be taking that 1BTC for myself!  No sharing.  No BTC for you.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:27:28
If we survive what we're doing to our own environment, i'll have to agree though, it's probably pretty distant.  While we could potentially do such a thing in a couple hundred years I think the cost would be so prohibitive that we'd have to wait much longer.
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:38:20
Hah!  Hi!
Thanks again to you.   I hope your day has been better than the last we spoke on.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:21:58
And if anyone uses bitstamp to check the "value" of the bitcoins, they just might freak out and sell if they have others elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:27:20
I don't know if that city in particular would have places available but I love airbnb.com   (doesn't accept bitcoins, or I guess thats up to the individuals discretion but not many people do)
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:17:09
Which is not too ridiculous a thought given the* capabilities of this community.
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:37:54
Assets, not really.  Either I have things with sentimental value, or necessities pretty much.  Over the past year i've been following the r/minimalism subreddit and one day a couple months ago it felt right so I donated the majority of things that I could have sold but I thought it would help someone in need more than the small amount I could have got for it.
I would love a second job.  Its what i'm working for right now!  (Or you know, a third if somehow a second was to come along)
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:49:50
I just bought now because thats when my fiat wallet would allow it (and the transfer was accepted).  Thats an unfair and untrue statement.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:46:28
I'd be slightly more inclined to believe you if you didn't have him as tips everybody- but me :(
But I can see how that could be a joke too.... So... I'm watching you.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:41:10
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:37:13
Oh also, i'd monitor craigslist, get a friend to go for it (saying he'll pay in cash but bring NOTHING), be hiding in the washroom, have him text you/signal you when he sees/checks the headphones, come out grab those fucking head phones and tell the asshole to get the hell out of there.  
But....  most people are not going to beat up a girl and i'm "kind of crazy" to do things like that i've been told.  Never had to, but would.
@_date: 2013-09-06 19:02:37
Sarcasm works on other subs, just not this one.  Whether kidding or not, anyone who is to say anything bad about bitcoin is automatically downvoted.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:38:11
