I’m well under $37,950 total income for the year. What does that mean for me?

Where can I see these?

Yeah, the network fee is really that high. If you get them to make a coinbase account, you can send it between coinbase accounts (using their email address) for free

Coincidence?

One way I see bitcoin being successfully used in a situation like this is for businesses to convert bitcoin to a physical coupon to use only within the business, then back to bitcoin when they leave. This way, those local coupons can be used in this hectic environment just like cash would, but bring along all of the advantages bitcoin offers.

"Buy and don't think about selling" was the best advice I was given. I waited and waited and it screwed me. I've been following bitcoin since it was &lt;$100 and decided to buy in as much as I possibly could during the $3000 all time high run a bit ago (my average buy-in is about $2750). I'm holding until we hit the moon like I should have done years ago.

I took Reddit’s advice to hodl and it’s worked very well so far

Yay! I have .12!

Enjoy your $500k

Crazy that when the BCH fiasco was happening, $10,000 by the end of the year felt a pipe dream

Even if you don’t think this will happen, it’s important to mentally prepare yourself. A significant crash is possible at any time. Know what you will do if the price drops 10% or 30% or 50%. Don’t wait until it happens, you’re a lot more likely to decide on emotion.

If you had bought at any all time high before this one, you'd still be up. Don't wait for dips that might not come.

The only altcoin I’m holding right now is Litecoin and it’s been spiking about the same as bitcoin. Lucky me!

$100 is like a 1% drop. Nothing abnormal.

This is exactly what I plan to do, but with my student loans. If the price hit $180k today, I’d have enough to cash out, pay them off, and be debt free.
That number keeps getting lower as I invest more and pay off my loans with fiat.

I just bought more at $9950 to sneak one last buy in under $10k. Might be my last chance.

Well in congress they keep themselves in check by sabotaging each other so often that nothing ever gets passed. Does that count?

He said "like". Netflix does this with your credit card and coinbase can do the same types of transactions. 
Most people understand how Netflix bills so he was just using an analogy.
