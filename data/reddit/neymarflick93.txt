I think the only reason the price is going up is because a bunch of bank account withdraws just came in on GDAX. Source: just received money from bank account and price coincidentally skyrocketed.
Bought in around 12200. Where do you guys have stop buy orders placed?

Because btc will likely go down more. But I'm not sure

Sold 40% of my btc at 7500, considering selling more. Looking for advice.

I don't think my original buy price matters assuming I'm confident the price of btc will go down. Even if i bought at $6800/btc for example (I bought much lower than that for the record), selling at $6400 and buying at $5500 would still net me a profit.

Thanks for the info, really appreciate it. You think I should wait until my bank account is verified + wait until money is deposited to coin base and risk the price going up, or should I just use a CC and get charged a higher fee but not risk it going up anymore?

source? for what reason exactly?

Fair enough. I'll probably just suck it up and wait.
To invest in alt coins, should I transfer bitcoins from GDAX to bittrex and buy from there? Also mind if I ask which alt coins you're invested in / currently looking at?

Hard fork won't affect any coin except btc right?
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:23:02
Good point. I was actually wondering about the other hard forks and how much of a price drop they caused. Has there ever been any significant price drop with a hard fork?

Coinbase is probably your best bet.

I was wondering if someone could fill me in on the likely effects of the hard fork in November.
I presume the value of btc will go down before the fork occurs, so does that mean we should wait until then to buy more btc?

So deposit USD from bank account to USD wallet on coinbase, then transfer to GDAX? What about just going from bank account to GDAX? What's the difference? Basically I'm asking which one is cheaper/quicker.
Also what's the difference between limit buy orders and market buy orders?

I looked it up. The first fork was irrelevant because so few people owned btc. Second fork caused a huge drop. Third fork caused a small drop but almost unnoticeable. Fourth drop didn't do anything except maybe caused people to buy more.
I suppose not much will happen this time around.

I thought about that. As a casual crypto investor it's hard to anticipate the level of FUD and quantify it. You could also say many investors wouldn't care about china trying to ban cryptocurrencies but look what happened there.
