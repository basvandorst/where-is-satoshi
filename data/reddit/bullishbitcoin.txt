I can see where you are coming from, but think about the YMCA for example, they are a "charity" that receives millions each year but yet I still have to pay a fee to use their services (Pool, weight room, etc). I'm only asking for donations because of the nature of this project. This is helping real people in SW Missouri and eventually the whole USA and by supporting this project you can be sure that the BTC that is donated will go towards just that, the necessities to get this project going.

Each balloon only costs around $30 usd plus what it costs to fill it with a hydrogen generator running from a car with jumper cables (FREE). Also the balloon will have a parachute system that's protects the equipment that is suspended in the air and the monitoring server will text my phone if a node goes down so I just truck roll to the site and relaunch a new balloon.

Fiber (which is lightning immune) will provide the balloons wireless ap with bandwidth from the ground where the batteries, router, solar panels are located.
