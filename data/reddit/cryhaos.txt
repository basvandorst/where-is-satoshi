Nothing in that article about Bitcoin

A crash, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, if I had to put a date on it I would say 23rd May 2013. People are literally throwing thousands of dollars at a concept they do not understand because "it looks like a good investment" or "look at the high returns". 
Bitcoin is, in it's current form, almost useless. Just as it looked like there were some signs that it was starting to be used as an alternative currency the speculators jumped on board and people have been trying to ride the wave with no thought to limited government or decentralized finance. 
Bitcoin at the moment is lost, and it needs a crash to scare away speculators so it can take the time and slowly grow as a useful alternative currency and not a (sloppy and short lived) investment vehicle for the USD.

"Oh, look, now I'm able to buy something I wanted but couldn't afford a week ago! Because of that, I won't buy it!...or What if I wait another week, maybe I can afford more things....."

But currently it is the same "wealth" which created the mess we are in now, people speculating on the relative value of complex mathematical products tied only notionally to anything in the real world. Bitcoin is even one step removed from this, where all the "wealth" people seem to be seeing it is tied to the USD!
Use it as an investment if you like. That is the nature of capitalism after all. I personally would like to see a future where a cryptocurrency is used to bring people together, separate the barriers of rich and poor, where the currencies value is tied to real work in the real world once again, and when people stop chasing the ghost of money making money.

You are being down voted but are absolutely correct. I have the popcorn out...maybe once the bubble bursts we can finally get this crytpocurrency back on track.

Just spend the Bitcoins rather than converting it to another currency :)

That shows me that someone used that address to send 1000BTC, where is the proof you have control over that address??

*sigh* Isolation, digital fortresses, backroom deals, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer - this is not the cryptocurrency that I signed up for.

I agree with you, the influx of new users are not doing so because they wish to revolutionize the way finance works, to move away from centralized institutions, they want to make money of the same old model of speculation and gambling on risk, converting imaginary gains into traditional fiat currency before the other parties can....that is the excitement that you see here.

This is the kind of comment I hoped I would find in the forums, rather than "OMG $113!!!!"
Thank you for trying to change the world in a positive way.

| The price is FAR ahead of bitcoin's actual worth.
Hit the nail on the head.

The problem of course being that Bitcoin's structure as it currently stands leads to a centralized system. 
Control of the process of mining tends towards to a small number of large pools of first world middle class individuals who can afford the specialized hardware necessary. 
As the value is driven up by first world speculators who can afford either the time and electricity (in the early adopter case) or the higher and higher price of entry (in the later cases) the actual ability to use bitcoins for transactions for the 3.5 billion people in the world who don't have access to the time, money, hardware or electricity needed becomes harder and harder.
As time goes on I am more and more convinced that cryptocurrencies are the future, in fact I think that multiple cryptocurrencies will break through and start to replace traditional fiat. But I do not see how Bitcoin can break the non-western computer geek barrier, using it is almost completely impossible in parts India and Africa without always on internet and reliance on a central service to hold the complete blockchain.

Nobody in a bubble ever thinks they are in a bubble.
1. Tulips, Houses
2. This is certainly a great benefit, but the same properties apply to many things. Including wire money transfers.
3. Again, a good benefit. Cash is as anonymous, if even more so (granted Cash does not have the other benefits of bitcoin)
4. Tulips, Houses....
5. Tulips, Houses....
Bitcoin need to take on their own value, that value needs to be stable and change slowly over time. The current instability is great if you like some risk and are lucky enough to get out early, but it does not make for a stable currency.

A topic not about how rich everyone thinks they are going to be! Can it be! You also get my upvote. I am afraid I don't know though!

Hey, You were the one that used the term Revolution to describe your subreddit...you clearly have no issues with changing the world we live in- so I am sorry that attitude doesn't cut it...

But surely you would have had to have done it to join the group? Why would you need to "work on it"? Or are you not playing by your own rules?
