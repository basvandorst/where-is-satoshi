He OVERPAID... They owe him 50 cents and wouldn't let him close the account because he'd overpaid.

I'm in San Diego right now for a wedding. Part of me wants to hit that dude and go check out his setup. That would mean taking my wife and two kids, though. Not sure they'd be as interested to see it as I am.... Not to mention taking my whole family to meet an internet stranger is kind of sketch.
Edit: Was definitely supposed to say "hit that that dude *up*"

Because your nodes aren't yet signaling the scapulamancy upgrade.  Step up your game, bro.

My bad on the typo. Definitely intended to say "hit that dude *up*".
As much as I'd love to see and document your setup (I've actually pondered the feasibility of doing a "micro" solar-powered mining rig.... I'm talking one motherboard with some GPUs and a couple panels), this cannot be that trip for me. We're in Escondido at Stone brewery right now... Two whiny toddlers who need to get back to the hotel for a nap.... And we're heading back north first thing tomorrow morning. I appreciate the invite, though. Glad to hear you're keen on law abidance. It's a good way to be.
