What dapps do you use? I don’t use any nor do I know of anyone who uses any. I’m seriously asking

Oh, that's a cool idea actually

Take the price of the last sale of bitcoin and multiply it by the number of coins. Theoretically, that's the total value of Bitcoin, but it's not because I have bitcoin I'm not selling until 250k+ and some I'm not selling until 1mil+ (if we ever see the day). Market cap doesn't really mean anything other than eliminating the dependency of # of coins/tokens between currencies so you can compare them to /some/ meaningful degree, extra emphasis on some (bordering on none).

It's an ERC-20, shits doomed. When Ethereum inevitably fails to scale, products and services that use ERC-20 tokens will have to decide to try another shit token network, build their own token, or switch to Bitcoin. This cycle will seriously act as a sieve until the only things left use Bitcoin.
Companies/products/services will add bitcoin as an additional option so that they can just watch their token/coin bleed out while still claiming they never dropped support for the coin (they will have sold weeks before Bitcoin integration)
This all assumes zero competition which obviously isn't the case. Bitcoin integration in another similar product would kill the token whose only purpose is a placeholder for the inevitable transfer to bitcoin.
PS: all of this obviously relies on Bitcoin scaling which isn't a sure thing at all, though my full node and lightning node are very optimistic.

Converting to monero would give it all up because you'd have to go through an exchange obviously. coinjoin does "taint" other peoples coins but that's literally the point and everyone participating is aware of that.  Eventually so many coins will have experienced a coinjoin that it will be meaningless in terms of fungiblity.

That's not why Bitcoin is important, it's the fixed monetary policy.

Hodling bitcoin is using bitcoin. You need to understand this. Just because it's not moving around the blockchain doesn't mean shit. The only good thing that comes from using bitcoin is each tx holds a chance of increasing adoption as the receiver may become enticed. Holding decreases the supply and holds your value which is THE MAIN FUNCTION OF MONEY.

I use BTCPay because I don’t rely on the profit of my business to survive. BitPay is good for people who don’t have any money and unfortunately need to convert right into USD lol

You can’t really screw that up. An address must validate over a checksum which prevents mistyping your address. Very basic feature of Bitcoin addresses.

Selling bitcoins anonymously is easy as fuck you pleb.
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:13:18
I never disagreed with that. You’re sacrificing all the benefits of anonymity and privacy Bitcoin provides because it’s not valuable to you and you prefer to instantly exchange for USD. That’s why you’re a pleb.

Holy shit bro, you’re an idiot.

No, it is a certainty that there will be coins lost now and in the future. It’s not a possibility at all. If even 1 satoshi is lost once the block reward is gone then that is deflation.

Bro, he could make a new account please start using your brain.
