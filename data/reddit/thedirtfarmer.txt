How can that be legal in anyway. I get that the account balance is just a representation of money that you no longer own.

So I keep seeing people talk about the price going parabolic. Back when the price was $1 and the movement was in $5-10 increments what was the mindset of the average hodler?

so is BTC going up or is just USD just crashing?

I've learned that fear limits you and your vision. It serves as blinders to what may be just a few steps down the road for you. The journey is valuable, but believing in your talents, your abilities, and your self-worth can empower you to walk down an even brighter path. Transforming fear into freedom - some person said that

If the price goes below $75cnd I will be upset. I am happy to have all go away and live with a great story. If I sold now and we make it to the moon in a few months I would be really bummed

I keep telling people at work that "I'm rich bitch" 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:35:52
At what point is it rude to keep telling folks how well you have with BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:09:50
Yes please. All this working is getting lame.

I don't see why it can't be both. I started with a insignificant amount in 2013 for fun and now it has a very significant value.

Invest a small portion of your savings for shits and giggles and to be part of the action. If it takes off a $100 investment could help you out down the line.

Saying bitcoin is the problem is like saying hammers are a problem. I can use BTC to buy drugs or a truckload of hammers to buy drugs. The intent to commit a crime is the problem not how you pay for it.

I hear that. I got in late 2013 with what was just extra cash for just under 5 coins. I can't have any regrets not buying more. If people are excited about having just 1 coin I am too the moon.

So your telling us we might have a chance to buy BTC at a reduced price for a while?

hodl until you can't. If you have to sell because u are afraid of that money disappearing and you need it you shouldn't be in the game really. I have been in since 2013 and I could care less about my initial investment. I am on the gravy train even right now.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:01:24
No you give me yours!

When I got in the game in 2013 they all told me I was stupid for wasting my money. I kept talking about it and they kept on laughing. Now they ask my about it everyday and I tell them "I'm rich bitch!"

Could we not keep medical data/records stored on a blockchain? Rather then keeping them stored on paper or a single system we have them on a dedicated blockchain?

So do most people here hold less the 1 BTC?
