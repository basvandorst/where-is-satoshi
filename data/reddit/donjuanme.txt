pretty piss poor argument you bit coiners are falling back on these days.  there wasn't an established, world wide accepted, alternate to the internet when it first started.  "you couldn't watch 4k video when the internet first started", yea you could've if that shit had existed, there was no 4k video, and no 4k displays, guess what there was already, and there still is, and had always been?  yea currency.  you dumb fucks are trying to reinvent the wheel with a god damned triangle on a garden hose.  have fun "hodling"with your fucking memes while the rest of the world slowly drains you of your money, or just laughs at your expense

hahaha, no, this is "salty":
I'm just a proud lifetime member of buttcoin.  and I'm thankful I only know one person who has any money "invested" (stolen from him) from "crypto", and he just happens to be a very good friend of mine that I know solely through work.
luckily I work with a bunch of very smart people so he wasn't able to convince anyone to join him, and he only put about a hundred dollars in.
he asked me if I wanted to invest, I told him I'd loan him twenty bucks, and if he made profit on it he could keep it, otherwise he could just repay me the twenty when he was ready.  he pinned that date on his calender and so far he's just glad he doesn't owe me twenty bucks.
salty is starting a witch hunt, I'm truly ambivalent

John was right, you shouldn't have an opinion of yourself that is so high that you're immune to criticism, after all you're only as qualified as the purple you work with, otherwise why do you with there?  have fun thinking you're better than John and Becky, and alienating yourself from the people who don't mind selling their lives right along side you.but you're better than they are, so it's all good, right?

1)  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH. Don't give your money to people on the internet.  EVEN IF THEY PROMISE YOU CAN MAKE 1000x FOR DOING NOTHING, IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.
I consider everyone apart of this subreddit to be apart of a ponzi scheme, and no, you're not the ones on top.

the circlejerk is so strong in this bubble.... it will definitely reinflate itself again if you guys keep your head in the sand.
wtf good is an unregulated currency if you just tie all your money to a central distributor???  THIS IS A BANK!! ONLY THERE ARE NO REPERCUSSIONS IF THEY FUCK YOU!!

Sounds like a self replicating inflation. ... a bubble? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:10:05
yup. plug that hole with more money.  Surely giving more money to strangers on the internet will make those strangers behave in a regulated civil manner.
I need to gtfo of this fucking circlejerk subreddit.

if the long term investment strategy revolves around the idea of: "since you can't take it with you why bother having it in the first place"  I agree with you.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:18:31
that sounds like a healthy bubble you have there, would be a shame if
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:51:57
if that's the future outlook then how will a having a ton of completely intangible units of currency help more than, you know, completely tangible not tied to any currency resources?  the future you're talking about cd keys will be with as much as digital currencies, and probably a little more useful.

My, that's a nice bubble you're building there.  Wouldn't it be a shame if someone
Wait, nobody needs to do anything, bubbles pop on their own.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:23:40
bubbles tend to inflate.
