Hold your horses, Bithumb is back up again. Round 2: FIGHT!

It went down (probably because of the overload of transactions) and since they had over 50% of the market trade of BCH it went on a hold so might see another pump now when its up.

Hi, just found out this gem of a tracker and i love it, the only thing i miss is being able to choose which exchange to take the information from and being able to then click for example on bitcoin and it would link me to the exchange that i choosed to check price with, like its in blockfolio.
For example, my bitcoin i want tracked through Bittrex, my OMG through binance etc and if i click on them in the program i get redirected to OMG on binance or Bitcoin on Bittrex. (Or maybe if possible just open a window from/in the program where it shows the candle chart from chosen exchange
Otherwise great work on this one!
Also i think you should repost it, can't understand how it can only be 1 post on something good like this?!
EDIT: Yea and also being able to increase/decrease the size of the value text and the % increase/decrease text for each crypto. (and also small small note, shouldnt the $ sign be the same size and directly beside the numbers, right now its abit above the text)
