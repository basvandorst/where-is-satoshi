This is so bang on. I just had to big-up my cell phone from the Galaxy S4 to the Galaxy Note just to fit the new bitcoins I recently acquired. I fear that I may have to get a 10" tablet soon.

Is this a serious question?
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:26:42
Here you go:
64gb, $25 and they accept bitcoin. You're welcome.

They can replace their own previous transaction with a new transaction, but do not possess the private keys necessary to spend anyone else's coins so they cannot 'reverse' them. They can however refuse to include others transactions in their blocks.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:44:05
txid absolutely does identify a transaction, once it is committed to the blockchain. Nothing in the mempool is valid until it is included in the blockchain.

If this cabal of 47 accumulated their coins through the low-cost effort of early mining, where did they get the resources to push the price up? Their supply of bitcoin and not cash would really only enable them to suppress the price.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:31:41
Why don't you post the address they came from, the community here is pretty resourceful and could figure out if their provenance is sketchy.

There is no such thing as a 'dummy' wallet. If you move bitcoins from one wallet to another, nothing happens with respect to the 'dollar value' of those bitcoins. If you create 'dummy' profiles on an exchange, your $1000 buy order will execute at the lowest ask price, not at $1000, and you will quickly lose all your funds via trading fees. The only way to 'run up the price' is to buy out the order book with fiat, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:16:30
I never mentioned price now did I?
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:45:41
Welcome! You are not late at all.

Bitcoin is similarly much faster and better than the existing methods of sending money across borders and around the world. It allows the storage and transfer of value without the counterparty risk associated with any other form of electronic payment.
The 'superiority' of e-mail to regular mail is also not as obvious as we tend to take for granted now. It is not physical and it is impersonal, in the early days you could only send text, no option to send a photo or a drawing or other such 'value added' inclusion. The vast majority of people were very dismissive of the mere idea of e-mail in the early days, but these facts did nothing to stop the swell of innovation that followed. Such is the same with bitcoin.

It would appear that Gox is attempting to create the future conditions under which they may continue to refuse withdrawal while displacing the blame from them to the devs for 'failing to address the protocol flaw'. This issue has many well-known work arounds and several developers who have now offered to help them. The more alarming question is why?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:58:46
How could an electronic form of "mail" that requires an expensive (ie. thousands of dollars) computer appliance and specialized technical knowledge that no normal person has, as well as a phone line and dedicated telecommunications hardware, possibly ever succeed? Seems unlikely, except that's exactly what happened. It is myopic to judge bitcoins future success based on the current infrastructure.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:04:16
The bigger problem is not in generating addresses, but in storing all the generated results and comparing them to entries in the blockchain on a continuing basis.
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:02:29
I hear you, I would love a reliable, secure pre-configured hardware solution for small hot wallets.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:29:37
Link bait
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:29:07
BTC-e would have to be even more incompetent than Gox to have this issue at this point. I hope that they are not that inept.
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:58:18
Most people will tend to use light wallets or third party services, but us hardcore full-blockchainers should be able to keep up for a while yet. :)
FYI, you should try to keep your wallets air-gapped if you have any serious money involved.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:00:40
I think this is possible. Either way the fallout of this was going to mean their inevitable end, but this way they do as much damage as possible and create profit opportunities for insiders. They should probably be in jail.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:38:55
Haha! It IS my fault. I'm sorry everybody. :(
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:39:15
Sorry, I don't have the tools, but either way, I wouldn't worry too much about it. I have not really heard of anyone having issues with spending coins with notorious histories. It's certainly not worth taking a hit to mitigate the possibility.

By being the first really big retailer to accept bitcoin, there is no extra incentive for them to offer a discount, but as other large retailers jump on board, the BTC margins will thin out as they compete for bitcoin customers.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:16:05
This statement is even more evidence of their negligence. Anyone CAN be a developer of bitcoin, so should it not stand to reason that the (formerly) largest and most influential business in the industry should have its own in-house developers dedicated to developing the protocol and helping to ensure that their code is airtight?
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:40:43
I think that this is what you will find most interesting as you investigate Bitcoin. Perhaps the only real lesson we can take away at the moment, is that most of the economic theories and tenets that we take for granted, regardless of which school you come from, are either flawed or incomplete, since none of them can fully account for something such as Bitcoin. For example, there are a lot of interesting thoughts on Mises regression theorem as it pertains to Bitcoin floating around out there. It has really forced many economists to rethink some of their most basic assumptions about money and value.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:12:33
Yeah, I just mean 'blacklist' in a colloquial sense, as in, by the people within the community.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:25:22
It is literally their job to be experts on everything related to the Bitcoin protocol. The issue was already well publicized and known within the developer community. This public statement is nothing more than an attempt to pass the blame from themselves to the Bitcoin protocol and community at large, when it is obvious that they are responsible for the problem they are experiencing. Nowhere in any technical discussion or documentation is it suggested that transactions be tracked in the manner in which they were tracking them. That was a faulty decision that they made, and thus only they should bear the responsibility. The only position they should be taking is one of sincere apologies and determination to fix their platform.

Their statement is a clear attempt to pass the buck on their own incompetence. There is no way in which this situation is not the result of their own internal problems and inability to create an appropriate platform for their business. The exploit is well documented and discussed.

I am not advocating government regulation, I'm just pointing out that in any other market this sort of behavior would be considered criminal. I would not benefit in any way, I do not use Mt. Gox.

I don't know anything about American tax law either, but I don't think it matters. By the look of it he is looking at bitcoin through a very narrow lens, and making broad assumptions about what it is and what it is meant to be used for. I don't think that bitcoin is what he thinks it is.

Remember that in the traditional world of finance, the richest people get the first access to newly issued money (debt) and they are allowed to spend it before it has a chance to devalue via inflation mechanisms. The further down the ladder the money travels the less it is actually worth. This allows them to purchase other assets that will maintain their value or increase in value without taking any risk, and as a result the wealth accumulates at the top. In the bitcoin world, the richest holders will tend to lose bitcoin as they spend it, and unlike the fiat world, their spending cannot siphon off value from the larger economy. Quite the opposite, they would have to invest in something that creates value beyond the returns of simply holding.

The concept of ID's in programming are not that they are immutable, there are many instances where ID's can be changed for various reasons. Assuming that an ID of any sort cannot be changed would be a grossly incompetent assumption by any programmer.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:53:08
This is the appropriate way to issue a public statement.

Haha! Well the web didn't look like anything in the late 80's because it hadn't been invented yet, but I take your point. The internet in the late 80's didn't even have the web! :)

Spending bitcoin on consumer goods will obviously just result in fewer bitcoins being held by them and will not generate a profit. Bitcoins invested in businesses will, over the long term, not result in the acquisition of more bitcoins since their supply is limited. Instead, the investment will help to create new value in the overall economy and increase the worth of their remaining bitcoin holdings far more than simply holding on to them.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:29:11
Yes, but his tone has become much more vitriolic since then I think. I find his analysis shallow and not compelling. His failure to recognize the underlying importance of what is happening in this space has undermined him greatly in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:49:20
To paraphrase: "We published a record of all our problematic transactions and no one solved the problem for us, therefore it is all your fault for not fixing our platform."
