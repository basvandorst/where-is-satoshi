Not selling when they were worth 48 million is the same as buying 48 million worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:37:47
That isn't a factor that matters when deciding what to do with them once you already have them. All that matters is they had the coins and at the time they were worth 48 million dollars. Whether someone gave you the 48 million in coins for free or whether you took 48 million out of your bank account and paid for them yourself, it makes no difference. Because you can immediately sell back those coins for ~48 million it's the exact same thing as far as your position is concerned. 
If you personally currently have X dollars worth of bitcoin, but if you'd also agree that someone in the same overall net position as you taking that same X amount of dollars from their own savings account and spending it all on bitcoin at the current value is crazy, then you have some thinking to do.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:30:07
To not sell something at market value is kind of the same as buying it at that price as well, considering you are free at any time to sell it at that price. At that moment in time it's the same difference. Any bitcoin you have now, you could sell it all right now for it's market value and you would have that cash in your pocket. You could then buy back the same amount of bitcoin with that cash. The difference between you selling your bitcoin and you rebuying that same amount of bitcoin is the same, ignoring the fees and wait times of course. But choosing not to sell is equivalent to choosing to buy in terms of your own position.

What if China gets so sick of being blamed for this that they do just ban the bitcoin in the hope of killing it sooner.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:14:10
Smart. Government shouldn't be making high risk gambles with public money.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:23:16
Regardless, the government was holding 48 million dollars worth of bitcoin when time to auction came around. It would be absolutely scandalous if the government took 48 million from the reserves and spent it all on bitcoin as an investment.

It has to reach it's highest possible value at some point, a value that it will never reach again. But when. Someone tell me so I can get rich pls.

But what about merely letting users convert BTC to dollars in their Apple Wallet?

Now that I think about it, I think if Apple created their own cryptocurrency, the Apple Coin, I probably would drop a few hundred on it. Apple will outlast us all.

But the catch is you can't do anything with the coins until the payment clears days later? Wouldn't Coinbase have a very strong incentive to sell the coins and then rebuy them at a high point after the payment has cleared.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:46
It'll easily be 1 BTC = a trillion dollars by the time we die.

What is the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin you can buy or sell, or is there even one? I just read r/all and r/popular but in the last week literally most of the stuff on the first few pages are all bitcoin.

You could have bought a mansion if you waited another year, and a mansion for everyone in your extended family I you waited five years. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:10:04


Which is actually a pretty sweet deal. The money you would have paid on taxes on the increased value of your coin you can instead use on buying more investments, like more coin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:04:45
Really though, won't all those people be billionaires one day if they hold the faith and keep every coin?

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:37
It'd be even fun to tell grandchildren I bought bitcoin at it's peak value, even give the them the worthless coins, just as cool a story for them I mean. Where's the safest place to just buy $20 worth and forgetting about it, without needing to constantly check if it's been hacked or stolen.

What happens to the passengers when that train runs out of track but it's still going full speed?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:16
Nice. I guess when it bursts for good someone is going to end up with a heck of a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:21
So 0.000000001 of a bitcoin is the smallest fraction of a bitcoin you can buy, sell, or spend? Or can you buy and sell 0.0000000000000000001 of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:45:38
So are there any way to know the lowest the dip will be so you can know when to start buying as many as you can?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:02
Shouldn't you sell everything right now while it's still worth 20k, then use all that money to buy it back and more when the 7k dip occurs?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:04:49
Can someone come up with a better name for the divisions of a bitcoin? It's going to be kind of stupid to buy a pack of gum for "0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 BTC."

If the IRS operated on trust with every single person and organisation they dealt with, then the country would be broke, would have been invaded by Soviets decades ago, and we would instead be talking about paying taxes on our coin gains in rubles to the Federal Tax Service of Russia.

My grandpa just bought $50 in bitcoin, because he kept hearing about it in the news. My uncle did it for him, but I mean at some point aren't we going to run out of people wanting to invest in bitcoin? After my uncle buys his dog some bitcoins then I think our family is basically tapped out for new investors.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:39:31
I know that others have tried and failed, but what's to stop another coin from just replacing Bitcoin as the new global crypto currency, and Bitcoin and it's value becoming a footnote in history?

Someone cashing out 80BTC raises the total value of BTC? I thought it’d lower it if anything?

Wow. Have you thought about sharing your story and getting it confirmed through the media? There are a lot of people in your brother's situation and there's people who have a lot of coin now who will be in your brother's situation one day. It might help other's to know that getting involved in bitcoin to get rich quick can have terrible outcomes that go way beyond coins and dollars. I hope your family is doing okay.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:32
So it is more likely to go up from here instead of down, at least in the medium/long term?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:55:10
Because who cares what public servants in general think about money cults. It's the relevant authorities interpreting the relevant laws that matter at the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:12:48
Speaking of which, what does happen to your coins if you died? Have you written down the passwords and necessary steps on how to sell in a secret will or something? It'd be a terrible shame if you slipped and cracked your head in the shower and all that value you carefully gathered in the coins couldn't benefit you, your family, or anyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:24:35
If the price goes to a trillion then we'll need more divisions. Can it be upgraded to support selling 0.0000000000000000001 of a bitcoin in the future? I'm trying to understand and I think I got the general idea. It just seems too good to be true when mom and pop are starting to get in on it. There's only a finite amount of real life resources in the world, we can't all be living like billionaires do today in 20 years time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:51:53
People's money is at stake though. I think bitcoin will keep going up over the next few years at least anyway so maybe it's not that bad of a problem right now to mislead people like this. But things like this are really irresponsible when trying to convince others into putting their money into something. Money is really important. You need money provide a healthy and happy life for yourself and your family, you shouldn't gamble your valuable money based on logic like this. 
Bitcoin shouldn't need to be sold like a scam imo.

I want to say the tulip thing because that's the only thing really listed in the wikipedia article on the history economic bubbles.

@_date: 2017-12-09 10:51:08
Doesn't this uncertainty drive anyone else crazy? Or is it more thrilling? 
The only thing anyone seems certain about with bitcoin is that they wish they bought bitcoin when they were practically free.

Building the value in your wallet for nothing, until 2085 when technology finally lets some random hack it and just take all your coin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:07:40
If you're reporting the value of your coin investment, same as you do for all your other investments, to the IRS already anyway then even if they did hand over the it's not like it's going to affect you negatively. It's invasive but everything Coinbase has on you will perfectly match what you've already reported to the IRS so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:25:51
What happens in the future when the current smallest division of a bitcoin becomes worth more in fiat than a pack of gum? Does that mean people have to stop accepting bitcoin for small items like packs of gum?

Nobody knows. The only value bitcoin have is the collective agreement in people's minds. What happens when most people's minds tell them the bitcoin ride is over for good is anyone's guess.

So really bitcoin doesn't need splitting like shares do and probably won't reach the point where it needs to be or where there needs to be smaller divisions? Still have to wonder how high it can go. Why shouldn't other cryptocurrencies replace it in seven years time or whatever? What's so special about bitcoin in particular.

@_date: 2017-11-30 05:17:54
How much longer does bitcoin have? I don't understand the tech and my gut feeling is that sometime, maybe next year or seven years from now, bitcoin will irreversibly crash or be made irrelevant and valueless by other technologies. But does bitcoin actually have a long term plan, is it sustainable for 40 years in the future, are there adequate plans to let it adjust to a growing population and plans for when it hits peak new investor rate?
