Why does it have to be a mailing list? Why can't you list it on a web site?

If I can only figure out what the fuck an IRQ is then maybe I can get Doom to start.

Yes, using bitcoin to build nukes. Did this "news" get forwarded to you as a chain email from your grandma?

I just bought Civ 5 with bitcoin last week, but I'm still going to use Steam and purchase games, bitcoin or not.

The text says Pizza Republica at 12, but the graphic says Blue Sashi (which I assume is a typo) at 12. Which one is it?

Go back to playing your video games, squirt.

Oh, jeebus...the comments for that blog are talking about Al Gore and Ponzi schemes.
Leave those old fogeys in the dust.

The government does a good job perpetuating that image all by themselves.

What is a "long bitcoin position"?
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:11:17
People paying me to poop on dollars. 
Hopefully it gets picked up by Facebook.
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:04:55
Yeah! The one in Denver just takes dollar bills and a QR code. Badda bing, badda boom.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:26:36
Per share.

I hadn't, but thanks for the news flash, Bitcoin!

Slashdot? What is this, 1998?
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:32:48
Did you even read the article, OP?
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:02:43
Very easy. Check out  and  Also, depending on where you live, you can use a Bitcoin ATM.

Judging from your first post in where you say you will


your situation doesn't sound as dire as you make it out to be here. The crimes with which you're charged and their codified sentences are always more than they turn out to be. My friend who got charged with 2^nd degree felony assault and faced a minimum mandatory four years in jail, and who considered suicide or fleeing, eventually got sentenced with probation. Another friend with seven felonies from a long time ago lives peacefully in the mountains with his wife and child making furniture. 
You never know what's going to happen. And suicide over a month of jail just doesn't make sense.

Stopped reading right there.

Definitely some typos that bugged me in this article.

I've been doing 21 satoshi/byte transactions the last couple weeks. Comes out to about 17¢ per transaction.

You can manually enter any fee in Electrum, yes.

This reads like a commercial where there's a frustrated actor in black and white trying to lick a stamp and the narrator is saying, "Tired of trying to write checks only to have them returned because you just can't get enough saliva on the stamp? Stop wasting saliva and start saving money!" 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:59:39
1. Find the size of your transaction in bytes.
2. Check [here]( to see what the lowest fee being confirmed is. At the time of this writing it takes 31-60/satoshis per byte to get confirmed within 45-1140 minutes.
3. Multiply lowest fee by size of transaction. For example, 31 x 226 = 7006. Add 7006 satoshis to your transaction amount (about 29 cents).
4. ???
5. Get confirmed. It cost you 29 cents.

Bitcoin ATMs are another cash option. There's XBTeller ATMs in and around Denver that don't use biometrics.
@_date: 2015-07-02 04:25:29
All they require is cash. I've done it. Just walk up and slip in a twenty and hold up your phone. In and out in thirty seconds.

I believe the post is sarcastic.

Thanks for the heads-up. In the reviews "David Reeves" &amp; "Leonard Sova" have the same profile picture.

I think he means the article struggles with basic sentence composition and grammar.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:10:30
That's hilarious.
