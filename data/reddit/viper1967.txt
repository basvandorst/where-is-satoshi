Appreciate the info.  But this has been well publicized and discussed for several months now (since November).

Now this is damn funny!

That’s possible.

That’s true belief in the technology.  Undeterred.

????  Yea, it’s open source code but BTC developers are clearly recognized as some of the best in world.  I could less if some Joe Shmoe wants to tinker with the code.  I don’t own BCH mainly because their development team is not even in the same stratosphere as BTC, IMO.  As far as brand please don’t be so naive as to think coins/tokens don’t have brand name appeal.   I am fiends with a couple of pro football players and all they speak of is bitcoin (not bitcoin cash).  They told me that the talk these days in nose lockers is about BTC.  Will concede on community.

BCH has maybe two developers which pales in comparison to BTC.  You are confusing ownership with centralization.  I hold BTC therefore I own a small piece of it.  Just because it is decentralized does not mean that I don’t own it.

Understand.  BCH maybe has two top developers which pales in comparison to BTC.  You are confusion ownership with centralization.  I hold BTC there I own a small piece of BTC.  Just because it’s decentralized does not mean I don’t own BTC.  Just so know, I am contemplating purchasing BCH as a hedge against BTC.  That said, do I think BCH will overtake / unseat king BTC in the near or medium term?  No.  Could it in the long-term.  Possibly.  Always hedge your bets.

Man would I love to be a fly on the wall at a Bilderberg conference.

The code is still bitcoin but bitcoin is more than just code.  Think developers, brand, community.

Fuck you!

Understand.  BCH has maybe two top developers which pales in comparison BTC.  IMO, you are confusion ownership with centralization.  I hold BTC therefore I own a small piece of it.  Just because something is decentralized does not mean one cannot own it.  Just so you know, I continually watch BCH and will likely in the future acquire some as a hedge.  Do I think BCH will be successful?  Yes.  Do I think it will overtake BTC in the near or medium term?  Absolutely not.  That said, you should always hedge as there are never guarantees.

Simply, it’s called adoption to mass adoption.  This is transformational software which takes much less time for adoption to take place than hardware.  See cell phones, computers, etc.  The beginning of mass adoption will likely start around 2020.
