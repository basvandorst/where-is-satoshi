You keep calling us naive, but give us no explanation as to why your way is better. Why don't you educate us?

How would they privately contact Romney? Also more media frenzy this way. ALSO, people who want them released can also pay for the release of the tax forms. 
Their way of ransom is unique, but not retarded. Their lack of evidence, on the other hand, is retarded.

Or for the lazy, a quote:

This is true, a google employee in the bitcoin IRC had the accounts in the list PW reset
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:13:50
I've seen far more incompetence. We still don't know how the SQLi happened, so I'm reserving judgement.  It's not like they fell for a skiddie, clearly this had to be done by someone who knew what they were doing.
@_date: 2011-06-26 05:29:02
Bleh, still waiting for my email  as to whether I need more proof :(
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:50:29
Indeed, you got me
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:21:24


Err, no, not *meaningless*.  Although I agree that using a mmore trusted hashing algorithm would be best, having a secret hash makes things MUCH harder to crack. Inevitably with infinite time, you will crack the salted hash, but cracing a 8-16 char password is exponentially easier than cracking an 8-16 char pw + 128 chars of salt.
Anywho, now they're using triple salted SHA 512, which should be plenty secure.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:19:23
Ohhh yeah. Got me.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:55:36
Hell, and as a coldfusion dev your position is probably pretty secure lol. Cause who the hell devs in coldfusion?
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:04:45
**Indeed, I got suspicious activity** as well, my password isn't the same, but it is similar. Unfortunately it looks as though there has been a lot of pop3 activity on my account recently... thankfully it's one of my smaller email accounts that doesn't have a lot I care about on it.
I'm not sure if the pop3 activity is me or a hacker, stay tuned while I investigate I guess...
Edit: doesn't appear to be an IP address I know and I'm pretty confident I don't you pop3 anywhere. My password in the DB was salted, and was about 20 chars long alphanumeric.
Edit2: using an IP locator, I have determined that all the IPs I as worried about are owned by google. Still not sure why google is accessing me via pop3 though.
Edit3: Derp. I have my master acct accessing it via pop3. I don't know why, all my other accounts jsut do email forwarding...  **MYSTERY SOLVED**.

In a perfect world, ALL software should be written this world.
Unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world. Few if any people are being paid to work full time to work on bitcoin software, and I *assure* you that formal methods verification takes far more time than writing code. Unfortunately, I 'd wager half the people making bitcoin websites and the like wouldnt know where to start on verifying their code formally.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:19:57


From my understanding, this is irrellevant, they fell for an SQLi, they didn't get their server rooted.

Nice, I thought of doing something similar although not just limited to GAs.  I have no spare time though :(
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:24:59
Nobody can say anything about the security of any site until it is tested.
Mt Gox did something like 95% of the transactions of bitcoin exchange, so it was the biggest target, and it fell. If trade hill becomes as big of a target, you better bet people will try. Will they fall as easily? Nobody knows until it happens.
As of yet, no site has a 2 step verification process. THAT would beat the security of any exchange out there.
@_date: 2011-06-30 18:52:10
Perhaps. I somehow doubt they had heuristic detection/alerts in place.  Not so sure about the class part though, sounds like you're aiming for an ad hominem attack.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:33:17
A google employee had all accounts on the list auto reset the password, for your protection. it is unlkely that someone actually was trying to get into your account.

yeah, 19.5 now
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:40:52
Someone else sent (unsolicited) emails to every email on the list warning of what happened (and then plugging their referral code to trade hill) but yeah, redundancy could not hurt.

well,  in a sense, yes, but I need collect my money back so I can pay for my housing when I move back to school in the fall. In the mean time, I'm treating Bitcoins like forex. FWIW, I have and will use bitcoins as currency where applicable though. I do not beleive it to be a get rich quick scheme.

Ask the guy who said he devs in cold fusion, he would obviously know the truth more than I do (I would not assert my statement is absolutely true personally)
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:27:45
this was set off by a bitcoin user who worked at google. Any gmail account in the list was set to reset.
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:31:09
Just thinking aloud here,
Say we have this network of smaller exchanges that share orders now, or they all put their orders in the same pool, etc, however you want to implement that.
My first thought is now we are making a bigger Single Point Of Failure.
If one of the small exchanges gets hacked similar to the *speculated* story of mMt. Gox, and utilizes a SQL injection to create an account with bitcoins out of thin air, now they can fuck the entire market across every exchange. You no longer have that compartmentalized security of having multiple competing exchanges.
I could easily be missing something though and I encourage further discussion and any information that shows my thoughts wrong.

Hold.  Panic selling would be a oolish choice, bu inevitably people will panic sell...
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:46:27


lol brute forcing MD5's without a salt is incredibly commonplace.
Perhaps you meant to say thankfully brute forcing the *salted* pws?
Edit: Ok, so I didn't get the joke, no need to downvote me, cause what I said is fucking true, aka I contributed to the discussion.
@_date: 2011-06-11 13:37:58
Yeah, I have the chrome mtgox extension, I watch that shit explode downwards. Talk about a bursting bubble!
@_date: 2011-06-22 12:49:07
Agreed. Lulzsec would honestly LOVE to have this be them.  Just the kind of attention they want.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:13:01
OH.  Duh. I get it.  Thank you!
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:15:18
I will personally still be using both mtgox and trade hill. I'm pleased with how mtgox has handled the situation, and I somehow doubt any other exchange is more secure; mtgox is the limelight of exchanges to attack.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:45:15
And who do you suggest is more competent? I'm pretty confident no other exchange is particularly more competent at security since none are yet backed by a serious amount of money needed to hire security professionals with years of experience.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:26:58
An employee at google himself set an automatic password reset on any GMAIL accounts in the list.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:17:29
disclaimer: I am no security professional, I do not do anything in computer programming that involves user info, and I am not super informed on hashing other than the basics.
But doesn't storing the salt with each account lose the purpose of having the salt if that salt can be pulled along with all the other user info? (or do you use a separate table in hopes of some sort of security by obscurity?)
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:15:09
Didn't happen every week before, I don't expect it to be a pattern.

I never said I approve of it, I'm just giving insight as to why.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:31:20
How can you tell? Isn't the salt added before hashing?
Also, if you're cracking in order of the CSV, you'd be doing earliest accounts first, which are potentially the least likely to be updated to the salted versiona (and least likely to have money) but yeah if that's true that could be dangerous.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:55:12
Toast? No.....they didn't get caught storing plaintext passwords. THEN they'd be toast.

Blah, the keyboard on my mac is fucked so I miss keys all the time :(
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:15:34
proof? It's hashed with a salt, right now I don't believe you.
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:24:55
Overkill that takes little effort to implement though. It's a matter of using a library, and changing  your password code to do triple salted hashing....maybe like15 mins of work.
working on CSRF and SQLi will take much more time, and there's no telling when you're "done"
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:15:59
Not to mention LulzSec was joking about fucking with bitcoins, so if they really did this, it would be ALL over their twitter. They'd love the attention for it, I assure you.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:41:14
I'd agree :)  when I finally cash out I won't be doing it on mtgox, gonna try and support a smaller exchange.
@_date: 2011-09-11 13:28:36
bitcoin forum is not an exchange.

Here's some (public) whois info

Lmao.  That's an impressive number, but especially after like 20 apps, it's probably easy as fuck for him to crap out iphone code, and has nothing to do with website or DB security...
@_date: 2011-06-11 19:32:51
No problem :P  I actually bought USD from my btc at $19 and then used that USD to buy from mtgox at a lower price lol.
just playing around :P
Enjoy your commisions!
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:28:19
cause it's still unfortunately a de facto standard for most common websites using PHP :(

If it isn't a real person to contact then it goes against ICANN rules....not that everyone follows them though
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:02:56
Nah, they're trolling
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:59:19
because many of the users have weak passwords which would allow them to be decrypted. (and I'm pretty sure many have been decrypted).  The point is to prove the account is YOURS and not someone who decrypted your password.
...first we complain about mtgox having not enough security, now people complain there's too much.... sheesh
@_date: 2011-05-23 14:47:34
This isn't entirely unlikely, I've heard of plenty of homegrown marijuana busts based on an oddly high change in power consumption (because the lamps take up so much power)
And yes, bitcoin mining, with multipl rigs with multiple gfx cards per rid can increase your power bill by an extra 60-100%
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:16:55
Yup :) We do!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:28:02
same exact thing happened around this time in 2011. just a smaller scale.
