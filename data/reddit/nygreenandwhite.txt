Crony capitalist is just a word used to describe any owner of productive capital advocating their interests in the most profitable way (which more often than not involves corrupting the legislative process). 
Capitalism requires government, because without it there is no way to enforce private property rights. And where there is government creating legislation, there is potential for cronyism. Therefore there is no capitalism without cronyism.
So let's drop the term "crony capitalism." This is capitalism, pure and simple.

You are seriously comparing social media with the ability to create legislation and force people to follow it at gunpoint?

Cryptocurrencies are such a new concept that you have absolutely *no* idea where it is going six months from now, let alone years from now.

Let's assume a capitalist system without a government: laws are enforced by private courts, private police, private jails, etc.
Eventually someone (or even a consortium) gets rich enough all the private courts and private police and private jails in a large area. Let's say someone owns all the land in a wide area, and rents this land out on a condition that the rent people pay is relative to certain activity occurring on that land. Let's say this person then uses their monopoly on some or all of these things to make themselves dictator. You now have capitalism with a government.
This is not just likely, it is probable, because wealth concentrates itself in a capitalist system and there are always power-hungry sociopaths or people who rationally find this to be profit-maximizing behavior^1 .
Capitalism without government in the long term is impossible.
^1 Yeah, about that profit incentive thing, anyone who has studied past Econ 101 will have heard of market failures - when the free market provides incentives perverse to the public good/consumers and/or leads to inefficient outcomes, and natural monopolies - industries whose most efficient outcome is through monopoly. They absolutely do exist, and private property rights protection is one *very* important example of both of these ideas. On the other hand, many of the ideas which back up laiseez-faire capitalist^2 economy as the most beneficial to society are based on 
^2 Capitalism, meaning any arrangement where the ownership of capital used as inputs in production (and the rewards associated with it, which we call profits) is delegated to any party separate from the workers. And yes, I just did a footnote within a footnote and I'm keeping it that way.
Edited for clarification

Well, yeah, because those in power have all the guns.
Basically, rights don't exist without the backing of violence. There is nothing natural about rights or law. Even if there was, that has little to do with currency.

Fuck the banks, people should be using credit unions wherever possible instead.

Because throwing money at the problem comes before throwing the military at it (see: every conflict the US has ever been involved in).
