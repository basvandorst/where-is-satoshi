very interesting 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:17:14
lol. Where did you hear this?
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:26:52
wow this is very interesting.
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:19:09
Wow that's pretty interesting
@_date: 2015-12-10 00:00:32
agreed 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:26:35
I will buy all MT.GOX accounds with USD still in them and active!!! PM me for details!! Will pay in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:25:28
Ok go on...
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:38:47
how is the Narciso Group Limited connected to btc-e?
@_date: 2017-02-20 17:09:11
I would be very interested in seeing this. Never heard of this white paper before. Interesting.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:22:13
What if they (nsa) created bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:50:46
This is awesome!! Nice work! 
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:10:01
Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:52:11
Canadian pot stocks. 
Only look at the top 3. I recommend WEED if you are in the US it's TWMJF. Legislation will be tabled this spring, with full on legalization coming in 2018 or 2019. 
Lots of money to made here over the next 3 years.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:33:13
this is fucked up
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:05:17
I am convinced bitcoin was created by the U.S. government 
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:48:01
do it. or wait until after the 11th but that could be a bad move as well. 
At this point I don't see bitcoin dumping lower than $700 but time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:06:22
yes, but the ETF could not be implemented without this change...
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:10:51
thought this was pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:24:52
AKA Afrikoin
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:55:25
I hope this is the pre bubble right now. It feels like Feb 2013...
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:58:57
But what if the rise is due to people actually wanting the underlying btc before the etf decision?
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:43:27
Yup. Literally got one 5 min ago. Thought that was super strange.
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:32:52
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:27:43
Have you looked into Stephen Hawking being replaced? It's an interesting rabbit hole  
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:57:00
It could take longer. But I think by 2017 we'll be over 10k 
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:59:59
Thats the only thing I could think of. I've worried about this in the past regarding 2FA iMessage and coinbase.
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:47:01
I love this man
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:31:20
Someone posted a screenshot on a bitcointalk thread. I'll see if I can find it. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:12:15
No it broke 1000 cad within the last 24 hours already 
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:33:54
Have you read the Wiki Leak emails from her server? If you did you would know this isn't a conspiracy 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:28:55
Oh it will. Even without failure of the current system. Which will and is failing. 21 million coins is a very finite supply 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:21:19
good! 
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:29:35
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:05:33
stupid question, are your text messages synced with your computer? 
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:47:12
Amazing! Fantastic work!
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:35:02
As long as $580 holds I think we're good. I would love to buy some more coins between $580 and $650. I wonder if we will go that low. I'm a buyer again at $720
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:11:10
Completely agree. Just make sure this has found a bottom. I don't think we have yet...  
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:27:39
Interesting theory 
@_date: 2016-06-02 12:56:23
Yeah figured as much. Just wanted to call him out on it. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:22:32
Let's see where it's at in an hour
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:12:08
Bitcoin graph looks amazing! We'll be back at $750 within the hour. We needed this correction. Now we can go higher. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:46:00
Really? How So? 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:30:33
Gotta give him credit though. Fontas knows his shit.
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:05:06
A one world currency has been the goal of elites for a while. What if bitcoin was it? 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:53:17
Hope you didn't buy yet 
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:17:09
What does this even mean!? Do they think each Bitcoin is worth 65M!!?
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:10:27
same here 
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:12:30
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:45:50
What can we do to search these transactions?
@_date: 2017-01-15 13:13:24
but what if that was the only way to get the masses to accept it?
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:40:53
If this happens I'm going all in. I don't trust Coinbase with a 6 figure investment and I really don't trust myself and a ledger. Was thinking of just investing in gbtc as an easy alternative.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:13:29
She shared it on her personal Facebook before she deleted it
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:37:25
Interestingly enough she posted this on March 31st 
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:55:41
Also that Satoshi was an old man who did not bring that upon himself, that dumbass reporter from Newsweek did. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:54:00
Oh wow thanks for those pics had not seen them before. Yeah that's definitely Uyen. 
Do you think BitcoinBelle is on all of this? 
@_date: 2016-05-11 12:32:56
How is he a redditor for 8 days now? When he originally posted this it said he was a redditor for an hour....
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:01:50
Exactly 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:29:12
Where are you getting this from? 
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:28:57
Yeah I know that. But how did he connect her name with her fake facebook name? They only way he could have done this is if he knew what she looked like? Right? Unless her FB name was he actual name at some point...
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:25:36
Found him while doing research on CSW and the tulip trust trustee...
Does Jessen's value-distribution theory of zeta-functions have anything to do with bitcoin? 
Can someone more knowledgable answer this? 
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:54:23
Wow she deleted her account 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:20:29
There was on her Facebook before she deleted it. Maybe some screen capped it? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:17:07
Yes this is a positive. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:53:42
That is pretty interesting. I think Uyen plays a bigger role in this. I hope more people look into this lead. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:56:38
This is what I think too. Kleiman fit the profile better than Craig. We need to do more research on Kleiman. 
Dave always interested me:
Take a look at the comments on this Tech Crunch Article:
David's 90 year old father asking about his son and his relationship to bitcoin in Feb of 2014....
@_date: 2016-05-27 10:41:00
You think whoever has the gox coins is trying to suppress the price?
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:34:21
Very interesting. Her friends are quite curious. She's even friends with a few other Nguyen's. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:51:56
I still wanna know how ummjackson made that connection...
How the fuck did he find her? Her FB name was Horigoshi Takanobu how did he connect her to Uyen? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:21:00
Hmmm that is very interesting. Will look into this 
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:39:31
gotcha 
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:32:58
So you are going to find the true nature of the current issue without doing research...
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:30:15
True I don't believe either are Satoshi. But I am more intrigued by Dave than Craig...
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:05:01
I'm thinking Uyen T Nguyen is the Trustee. 
JVP even refers to the trustee as SHE
@_date: 2016-05-11 10:21:19
exactly 
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:03:39
Do you think Overlyqualified is Uyen Nguyen. Their ages are very close. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:35:10
There are too many people leveraged long. We need fresh money to push us higher. We need to flush some people out. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:47:49
Why are you looking to get out of it?
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:15:22
Futures are way too high on okcoin. We need them to go down before we can moon. The faster we get to $480 the faster we get to $1000
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:55:30
Good Post! Thanks 
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:30:11
Once rappers start rapping about Bitcoin... This is it 
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:23:31
After reading that article I am little more convinced that Craig could have been Statoshi. There is definitely more to this story.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:09:07
Anyone else think Karpeles looks like martin shkreli now? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:09:34
Honestly it's complete bullshit. They're trying to raise over a billion dollars for investors. They have have hundreds of millions already and can't keep the site up.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:42:22
Lol no way going to $400 I wish. Low $500 might not even happen. We do need to drop to moon though...
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:39:33
Ok. There is no way we're going to $800 without touching the 500's or high 400's. I'd love to be proven wrong but doubt it. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:48:10
I second that! Just used it today!
