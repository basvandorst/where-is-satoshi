Smart thing to do, unfortunately lots of people don't understand that in this market, and think it is better to invest into speculative crap like Cardano and EOS.

Dont worry once ETH peaks, money will flow into bitcoin and bitcoin is gonna pump like mad again. FOMO gonna be all around the market again. Altcoin cycle is almost over, Ethereum is the only one left from the big boys to peak.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:14
Will end when it is gonna be 6 ETH each
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:10:12
Gonna buy shitload of bitcoin when ethereum reaches the peak.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:12:07
Its a scam, way to promote this shit in here, you pathetic scammer. Until Pavel Durov himself confirms the launch of TON ico, every site related to TON is a scam.

When ETH peaks bear market should end, money will flow into BTC, give it a week or 2.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:51:03
Pretty easy. When it reaches 0.15-0.17 range in ETHBTC chart.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:12:50
Well soon it is gonna be the size of a manhole cover.

It's people like you who ruin this market. Without Bitcoin this market won't move. And instead of putting your money into it, you probably put it into shit like Cardano and EOS, who don't even have a working product, or some other overvalued shit. The time will come when all altcoins have pumped and become overvalued and money will flow into Bitcoin. And this will most likely happen after Ethereum peaks, which will happen in the duration of 1-2 weeks.

Thanks for breaking my neck

I guess the whales had the time to buy in.

Omg im dying, help me
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:10:11
Really? So why does the whole market go down when BTC goes down? BTC and ETH are father and mother of this whole market, get that through your head. Overvalued? Why? Cause of transaction speed and fees? That's all? Look at the adoption, security, exposure to the world and durability. Most of other altcoins are just a bunch of speculative crap built on Ethereum, most of them have no working product or anything and they raise billions, promising gazillion transactions per second etc and people fall for that. People invest in them simply for a quick buck. Bitcoin most overvalued at 33% market domination? Hmm wasn't it at 65% just a month ago? Makes sense.

Once ETH peaks at 0,15-0,17 range on ETHBTC chart, which according to my sources should happen by February 10th. Most altcoins are completely overvalued at this point and once ETH peaks it will start huge flow of money into BTC and the money from other altcoins will slowly follow, thats when the new BTC rise cycle will start.

Weren't they like anti-bitcoin like a week ago? Seriously this market is so manipulated. Were did all the bad news gone all of the sudden?
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:16:38
Omg how many of you idiots gonna post this article here again? This news are from yesterday and are absolutely irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:16:58
Let me hop into my time machine. I'll let you know in a second.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:04:01
Adoption, regulations, higher market cap and more people involved. There is no other way.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:52:11
Start an account on coinbase and move to GDAX, which belongs to coinbase, you can buy there for free. I bought my first crypto on GDAX. Only problem I had with CB is their stupid identity verification, which took some time.

Bottom is near, look at the volume on the charts, last time we had this kind of daily volume was 20th of December.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:11:37
It needs a higher market cap, adoption and regulations, it is a baby so far. Just imagine a currency that is accepted by governments and can be used on every corner. It needs to be accepted as everyday currency. That's what needs to happen to make it stable.

Yeah boy, future is bright. China will hop in eventually too.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:26:14
This time it is different. Crypto is entering the world right now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:02:30
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:02
People don't even know the difference between credit and debit.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:09:45
You are a true friend
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:22:13
It doesn't work like that
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:07:24
I saw this posted like 10 times since yesterday
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:27:00
I just don't like people who invest into speculative shitcoins and icos, who have no working product, just a whitepaper and lots of promises. That is the problem. That money should be in actual coins that have value like BTC and ETH. Then they go around and ask "Why is the market crashing?", bunch of idiots. That's what creates hate for certain coins.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:32:46
Its credit cards, not debit, relax. Makes sense for them.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:50:44
What exactly?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:21:21
No, Bitcoin is closer to 10k than it is to 0
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:06:00
Chill. It's a market cycle give it a couple of weeks. Money flows into ETH right now, then it will flow into BTC.
