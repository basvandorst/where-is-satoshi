But you ain't got the balls to throw away your id and all your credit history and all your resume items do you? you wouldn't even consider applying for a job with nothing. Without considering this problem (which you clearly haven't) you don't understand the value of identity, which btw is ALWAYS voluntary. You can throw all your ids away today. You just won't.

"MY APPROACH TO LEARNING" by jimmajamma
1. Don't read nothing.
2. Don't listen to anyone.
3. Just attack and troll mofos until they tell me what im tryin to learn.

idchains appears to be precisely you are looking for. It's opt in. You control the level of anonymity. And it doesn't require you to remember or keep something that can be lost or stolen. Better still, it likely doesn't even apply to you (American?), but really helps folks who NEED this. Refugees, disenfranchised, victims of rebel governments or dictators, etc. etc. etc.

Do you have a license, bank account, college degree, resume or a passport? Anyone who hates identity is likely already so spoiled by the idea that they don't even know what it means. If you've ever applied for a job, you've needed identity.

Nice work James, this is a vital area for crypto development. I hadn't even seen your original video on this, it is a novel idea and much needed in the space.

Folks have the whole world backwards. Privacy proponents have no idea of history, they have no idea of how identity has come to be established, and their bitterness based on pure ignorance is pathetic. Imagine building a highway system and letting folks drive around without IDs. Imagine a world where you could murder someone and move to the next state and just willy nilly change your name. Fraud. Murder. Road deaths. All this would increase. And these are the reasons we have ids. We wouldn't be able to vote, we'd just have kings. They're absolutely delusional about history.

The answers are in the video. And the reality is you're too wasted/stupid/agro to understand them.

But you ain't got the balls to throw away your id and all your credit history and all your resume items do you? you wouldn't even consider applying for a job with nothing. Without considering this problem (which you clearly haven't) you don't understand the value of identity for those who suffer from a LACK of these services you are spitting on. Identity btw is ALWAYS voluntary. You can throw all your ids away today. You just won't.

If only you understood what you were trying to argue instead of developing conspiracy theories. You somehow have peed on yourself so much trying to attack folks that you don't follow the argument at all.  Or perhaps in your rabid froth you can explain this?
@_date: 2016-04-20 01:11:28
I can only imagine they are both "possession" forms of identity, which means you need to hold a private key or other information which makes them all but useless for true identity systems. ID should not be able to be lost, stolen, coerced, etc. And James' system allows you to use your face without putting the your image online. Pretty nifty.

tell me your use case if this matters to you, and i'll explain if it makes any sense.

Get your priorities straight.
Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized. That's the first and most important design criterion. Trustless is just something we've hoped for and have lost entirely already with 70% of all mining now taking place by a handful of guys who all know eachother in China.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:12:15
James is thinking out the box. Only way we going to create a solution to current problems.
Reputation sounds like a good way to determine a prospect for higher responisibility in the decision making. Reputation can be tracked through bitcoin performance or influence, and a mathematically elected high stake candidate can be nominated, in theory, of course.
Same way torrent sights determine the reputation od uploaders. The higher the reputation, the more stake an individual has.
Any thoughts?﻿

I'm with Charlie on this one. Larger blocks are akin to parking your kerosene truck closer to your furnace because it makes the process work better. There is only so far you can go before you wreck everything. And if you don't think it really means wrecking everything, then watch [this]( Centralization = BTC as a currency is over.

Our only goal is to push ALL GOVERNMENT SPENDING ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN. Full, 100% transparency.
Our sites, ontheblockchain.org and nakedgov.org will be launching soon, pushing ALL government spending into the sunshine.
We love our anonymity, and we use Bitcoin to ensure that. But government should not have that option.

Bitcoin development may or may not serve those holding bitcoin. But in general yes. But there are some old economic studies on this type of thing and they are not as clear as we like to think.

So you are saying we should all ignore the fact that the sex ratio was 20-1 male to female? Even with presenters the odds were extremely low. I'm glad someone said something.

What he said if you actually listened was "Americans think the Chinese are stupid." And he said that was stupid of Americans. He said that the Chinese are likely making back room deals, which it appears possible. Now it would be uncool of James to say that IF those deals were actually illegal, but they are not. They are dangerous however. But, I don't see how that's anything but respectful of the Chinese. And inside of that he is making a powerful warning. It is foolish to assume that smart people aren't negotiating to get wealthier. We have always assumed that they are not doing this. That's the stupid part.
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:48:39
Good with me. But I'm not one who likes ignoring problems, and I think that was the spirit of James' talk on a number of fronts.

Perhaps in response to this id system launched by James ([idchains]( which is open source by design and can't be lost or stolen. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:17:54
Hmmm. This is actually pretty original. James reaches to the old school (face as identity) and the new (blockchain confirmation) to produce something that is simple and pretty darn difficult to crack or forge. I'm thinking...
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:24:05
Wow. This is actually really well researched and a very fresh perspective that I hadn't considered at all.
