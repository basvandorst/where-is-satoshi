1) it was not a scam the start of the blockchain was announced beforehand. noboby knew if it would suceed.
2) mostly the miners, they dont want their btc to be worth less.
3) he wouldn't destroy the market, because then his investment wouldn’t be paying off.
4) everthing that is there grew 1000%. think of google 20 years ago.  the price of bitcoin resembles the trust in its use. nobody knows its future.

before the block size limit is lifted, the transaction fees must be done better to avoid bloating and spamming.
lets do the math:
bandwidth should not be an issue, a 8Mbit/s connection(weak adsl) could handle 600MB blocks in theory. Lets say 100MB to be on the safe side. That would be 700tx/s. And that would only be the limit for nodes on average joes computers.
A mining pool would need to get a new block in, lets say, 5secs to avoid orphans. 1Gbit/s is a bandwidth that's already cheaply available. This would result in ~600MB max block size or 4.2ktx/s. At the current centralization on mining getting a 10 GBit/s line would be already no problem, resulting in 6GB blocks or 42ktx/s. Thats bigger than all CC companies peaks together.
A node on 1Gbit/s could handle 12GB blocks or 87ktx/s.

if you make a long lasting paymeny channel for every publisher it wouldn't need that much blockchain space. 
on the contrary if 1% of people used bitcoin once a month everything would clog up nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:05:20
thats not cramming bitcoin in every aspect, it would be one of the best suited usecases for it.
a payment channel would not need a ever lasting tcp connection, it would connect, send a signed transaction with a few cents more than the last one and youre good to go. once a month the last transaction would be submitted to the blockchain.
i would be happy to pay the few cents that they would make with ads with btc and not being a leecher with adblock. journalism needs money and i dont want to see ads/ be tracked.

Segwit has a few distinctive disadvantages, that aren't discussed here:
*  All unupgraded nodes don't check the signatures. They have to trust the miners and are only good for pushing data around.
* All segwit uxtos are free to spend from a non-segwit perspective. This creates a huge financial incentive for miners to fork and just claim them. 
* Witness data gets a 75% size discount at standard miner configuration. This means that signature-rich transactions(such as lightning transactions) will get a discount on the layer 1 network.

A fork is not another chain, it is a chain split. So every hard fork has to use old bitcoin rules until the fork happened. It would be ridiculous not to change the rules as little as possible.
