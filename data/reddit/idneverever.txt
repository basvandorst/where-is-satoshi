The wrongdoing comes much much later on. When there's a decision to be made, standing between whoever gave me hundreds of thousands of dollars or the ones who gave me nothing. We've seen nothing yet lmao. Imagine when mafia type ppl and secret service type niggas gonna start influencing people. Yikes. And people think bitcoin is safe.

There's a point to be made about how bitcoin is mostly used for illegal activities (today) whereas the dollar is not. Bitcoin wouldn't even be close to where it's at today without silkroad etc. If bitcoin saw actual usage outside of the most hardcore enthusiasts, the whole network would collapse and fee's would be hundreds of $. There's been very little development/results in terms of actually using bitcoin for anything but 'store of value'. People mostly care about the price going up and being able to cash out vs $$. And maybe that's ok.

This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:58:36
feels like 90% of the got-rich stories are fake, including this one.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:53:21
What is it and why?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:03:05
cool story bro. how about you post your address where you received 98 btc in 2011?
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:56:22
so you saw bitcoin at 18k and had your mind blown, but didn't remember that you had some?
why do people write these fake bitcoin stories? day dreaming? if you want some bitcoin, buy some.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:16:16
idk, wait and see?
