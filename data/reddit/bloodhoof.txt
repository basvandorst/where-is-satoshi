This is AWESOME! I'm going to get $500 worth of stuff for plunking $350 into Coinbase-&gt;Newegg :)

This is what frustrated me the most about this 'bitcoindeal' promo. The particular item I wanted included a 'free gift' which prevented me from using the promo.
No, I don't want a free copy of Borderlands 2. I just want this $500 video card with the bitcoin deal.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it unlawful to "bundle" items together without giving the buyer the option to purchase the item by itself?
After contacting customer support I was informed that the 'free gift' was compulsory and that there was no way to remove it from my cart.
My ass.

My thoughts exactly.

This is an opinion-based question, but what are your predictions for BTC / LTC over a 365 day period?
Also, what's the easiest way to get into LTC mining?

What did they say about Litecoin?

Yeh. I bought some yesterday (without CC) and I'm not gonna get them until Saturday morning =(

Do all first time buyers have to wait 5 days?
edit: I have never actually had any bitcoin before. I keep hearing that Bitcoin is instantaneous but I haven't experienced it as such(yet). Would anyone mind hooking me up with 1 µBitcoin just so I can see how trading Bitcoin actually works?

It depends. If Coinbase warned you at the time of purchase that you are going to get the Bitcoins at market price on Monday, then whatever you spend will be the amount of Bitcoins that you get @ market price on Monday.
Right now, and I mean right now, Bitcoins are in stock at Coinbase and you will get them for the market price that Coinbase is offering them at 
If you're planning to buy from coinbase anyway, may as well help a random internet stranger with a $5 referral :)
Once Coinbase runs out again, there is no guarantee that they will restock before Bitcoin gets even higher.
