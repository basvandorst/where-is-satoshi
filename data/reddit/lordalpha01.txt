@_date: 2019-11-13 00:49:40
It's good to be enthusiastic.  I wish you luck. Will it make you any money? I only thought real huge equipment is the only thing that is able to make money these days but I could be wrong I would be interested to find out an answer
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:19:48

@_date: 2018-10-19 10:39:32
Thanks for that advice.
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:27:00
That is an excellent chart. My question if you could answer with another chart is out all the addresses what percent owns less than .001, less than .01, less than .1, less than 1 btc, less then 5btc  or more than 10 btc. Is that possible to illustrate that? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:35:01
With such little money invested it seems like a lot of flipping to do but I have thought about doing something like that I'll look into it thanks
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:41:39
I dont know ATH....ill read about it.
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:36:20
Should I wait till I see a profit in my original investment? I figured I want to try to flip profit rather than keep throwing money in am I going about this the right way you think? Thanks

@_date: 2019-08-28 18:56:52
Lol!! Ive ben waiting for this for months. I missed the bus last time.. 
Only question.. Im not a pro just a regular part time cryptovestor. Can somone exlain something...
I understand the decentralized idea, im on board with that, but how is there no fear of the whales controlling the market? Does anyone know who the whales are? If the whales control the marlet then isnt crypto centralized in a value sence that whoever has the most shares dominates and controls it?(Oops 3 questions lol)
Thoughts please and thanks
Good luck to all

2019's 80% increase in value 4 Bitcoin will be known as the year of Bitcoin. If someone invested $3,500 January 2019 they would be doing very well right now and congratulations to those who have. Do you believe that by year end 2020 the value of Bitcoin will be +80% again to make the btc 20000?

All in it together man. I think the odds of making money off of this are a lot higher than scratch off lottery tickets. I've been off the lottery and scratch off since April . Btc been on a steady decline since then and almost cut in half . In April it was about 8,000 plus now it's 4000 Plus. They're very positive people on this form and it's good to have a support group but let's be honest Christmas will be the finals. If it's still shity I'm going to shut everything off that has to do the Bitcoin and come back and look at just once a year.
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:22:54
Eh.. Just hodl i guess.
