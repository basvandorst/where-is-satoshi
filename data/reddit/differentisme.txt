HODL. Been in the game for more than 2 years and this doesn't phase me. The veterans that have seen Bitcoin from 100 dollars to 17k to 5k and so on know what this market is about. Not panicked. Not selling. Control your emotions. This is a multi trillion dollar market cap coin in the future.

Exactly. People who have seen these markets for over a year see this as perfectly fine. The growth over the last few weeks have been fantastic and so overall this has only been very positive growth.

The timeline is beyond 2019...in the grand scheme of things even those that hodl at 17k will see profit. Just a matter of how calm people are with their investments.

Well done. I would like to ask how the increase in your wealth has changed your life. Were you particularly wealthy before? Has it made your life as good as you thought it would be, or have you learned anything new about what you thought holding this much wealth would feel like? I think a lot of people are interested for the technology but also because they dream of adding to their personal fortunes. Thanks.
