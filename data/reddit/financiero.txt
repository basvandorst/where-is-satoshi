To create a wall you have to put a lot of money. But to simply trade on gdax you watch online videos
You can get a hang of it by seeing their demo:

I said that because the Android app worked for me on the first try after several retries on the web browser. Perhaps you already checked it  , but can it be that it is locked for 24H after several retries?

1) Check the minimum amount of BTC you can withdraw, perhaps you will need to buy more to be able to do so. No wallet recommendations sorry.
2) You have to move it to an exchange to trade it for other currencies.
3) Having your own keys is safer, assuming you are not going to mess things up. Test you backup plan before you need it with a small amount of BTC on the wallet.
4) You can withdraw other crypto with lower fees, but that is not what you want.

Using different accounts for different topics is safety wise.

You can send money to someone else's wallet directly from the exchange.
(I agree that it is safer to own your keys)

I am from Europe and can only trade on EUR. Are people from US allowed to trade on other fiat currencies? I thing the equilibrium is reached via the other two alts.
