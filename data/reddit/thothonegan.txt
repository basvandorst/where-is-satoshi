Very true! Unfortunately we can't guarantee they've done that, and mapping a good chunk of the network was a way around that (didn't want to have a ton of 'Route Failure' complaints). Might need a better way to do that, or some way to override it if you know what you're doing.
Not sure if those 3 channels are the ones you've opened since I think new channels end up at the back of the channel update list. As long as theirs peers though it should be mapping, but unfortunately we don't have any easy way to show the progress when its having to grab stuff at the start of mapping (this first channel is 10k blocks old, we need 10k*2 filters now to prove it exists!). Definitely needs improvement.

Yup! see

Unfortunately we need lightning to get 'watchtowers' first : otherwise we can't guarantee the other end of the channel doesn't steal your money while you're offline.

Yeah, its somewhere between 3 and 5 confirmations depending on the size of the channel before it switches to Active. Until it's active (aka when it's Opening), it can't be used.

Yeah we're running lnd in the app (slightly modified so it can be used within an iOS app), which is talking to neutrino/btcd on the backend. Its fun trying to get iOS and go to play nice, but it works reasonably well.

Developer here. Its a light client using neutrino - just the headers not the whole blockchain. We're talking to a few servers, but definitely seems to be going slower than usual.

Developer here. Yeah mapping takes a long time : it'll go till it finds at least 1000 channels, then let you pay invoices. Basically when it sees a new channel it has to prove its still open, which involves downloading a lot of things from neutrino. (See BIP158 for the gory details). The first few channels mapping will take a while, then it'll speed up since by then it'll have all the filters. 
The big reason we don't let you pay invoices earlier is you'll get some nasty routing errors (since you don't have enough of the network yet to pay). One of our first goals for the next update is to try to speed up mapping.

We use lnd w/neutrino. It took a few modifications to get it to play nice on mobile, but nothing too crazy.

Yeah, we've got a setting that lets you select between btc/mbtc/bits/sat depending on what you like. Currently we're planning for sat to be the default, but it definitely has some ui issues with huge numbers (just like btc the other direction).

Definitely planning on it for the stuff that makes sense!
