economy going up? are you sure about that?
100 years ago a family of five could comfortably live on a single paycheck, have a decent house, vacations, and the latest gizmos (radio, tv) if the paycheck was average-above average.
Now a family of three can barely survive on two paychecks without welfare. Having a house is nearly unimaginable for millennials.  Unemployment is rising in most of the world (especially youth unemployment), pension ponzi scheme is about to collapse in several western countries, etc.

People constantly put their cc info online without knowing anything about tcp/ip or cyber security. Doesn't seem to bother people that much.


As if it's much different with banks and plastic cards. And before you start singing the predictable song of "money in banks is insured!", duckduckgo what happened in Greece, Venezuela, former Soviet Union republics and even US. Actually, most people don't know that, but the vast majority of bank contracts nowadays state that the money that's in your bank account doesn't actually belong to you: you've lent it to the bank and they can refuse to return it if they want (like during bank runs).


Yes, I keep her more or less informed. Honestly, the portion of payments she receives in btc is so low, that she doesn't bother converting and is fine with the risk of holding.

Who disputed this claim? Everybody is saying that we're still in an early adoption phase. There's an article on the front page at the moment arguing that we didn't even reach early adoption phase yet.


And I argue that they don't need to understand it, just like they don't need to understand tcp/ip to use the internet or care about cyber security to shop online.
Also, I have some understanding how bitcoin works on the protocol level (fairly surface level, I'll admit), and I'm aware that btc can be worth 0$ tomorrow.


If we actually are in an early adoption phase, as you seem to argue, I prefer a slow and gradual adoption, simply because, as you've mentioned, bitcoin deals with money, something a lot more important than cat videos. Also, my friend is pretty technically retarded. I mean she's a young gal, and uses facebook, smarthphones, etc., and she didn't have any troubles setting up a wallet and understanding the very very basics (addresses, change, sending/ requiring payments, confirmations). I understand that this is just a singular anecdote, but I think it shows that it's quite easy already.

That's where decentralization comes in to save the day. There is nothing for the state to attack: the codebase is open source, freely available and has been copied a million times all around the globe; the miners, while mostly centralized in china, can be found all around the globe and can always be moved in dire cases; each full node, which are scattered all around the globe, contain the full copy of every single transaction ever.
There's no easy way for any government to attack bitcoin. It's slightly similar to torrents: plenty of governments tried to take torrents down, but for every torrent hosting site they take down, five more pop up.

This doesn't work. I can always send funds to my buddy in another country, who will deposit it for me (for a premium of course). It might throttle traffic, but it won't stop it.


This is the attack vector that would probably do the most damage, but as long as it's possible to convert fiat to cryptos, it won't matter. I can hold my savings in cryptos, thus robbing government of their power to affect me with their printing presses (inflation).


I really don't see how russians are planning on stopping Boris Blow from participating. This sounds like pure posturing.


A minimal bitcoin transaction is about 250 bytes long. I can send it in any way I can imagine, as long as there's something or someone to decode it at the other end. My favorite example is: you can send a bitcoin transaction with 16 skype smiley faces.


Same as above. It's a lot easier to throttle traffic to torrent sites, but even that is not working. Piratebay is still strong, after years of government persecution, and has like 15 backup sites. If they can't stop torrents, they sure as hell won't be able to stop cryptos.


Facts are now, always have been and probably always will be second to populist manipulation of the public.
"Bitcoin is a terrorist, black market money used to buy drugs and kiddieporn and it's creating instability in our financial sector, undermining your pension savings! We must act!"
Again, they tried doing that with torrents. Actually, they already tried this (admittedly, on a small scale) with bitcoins. There were plenty of articles coming from the usual msm suspects (definitely not propaganda peddlers) how isis, drug dealers and pedos are using bitcoin. The general public doesn't care.


That's what you don't seem to understand: there is nothing to regulate or smother. That's why they can't defeat torrents: there is no central authority, no central hub, no director, president, anything to attack. It's like the legend of the hydra: you cut one head off, 3 other pop out to replace it.


Governments can definitely suppress cryptos, but I think the genie is out of the bottle already and they will never be pushed back into obscurity. Too many people have copies, knowledge and the drive to push them forward.


The world is too reliant on internet for that to ever happen. Even if they tried that, the libertarians and anarchists are already skeptical of government, and losing access to facebook and funny cat videos would push most democrats/ statists towards skepticism as well. In my opinion the worst case that can happen: governments posture about outlawing cryptos, realize that it's impossible, and then just learn to live with them without much acknowledgment to save face. Basically, same thing that happened with torrents.

First of all, I'm not a moderator of t_d, so I'm not the one choosing the banner. I do understand where they are coming from though.
Second of all, crack down on politicians? I guess you haven't heard about police visiting people calmly expressing their dissatisfaction with the open door policies on social media. You probably haven't heard about the guy in uk who got thrown in jail among muslim population (since muslims make up majority of criminals in western european countries) for a symbolic protest of leaving bacon sandwiches near mosques (spoiler alert: he was killed in two weeks iirc). And I guess you missed all the muslim protests with hateful messages (like "death to infidels", "behead those who insult islam") being protected by the police, while christian protesters with peaceful messages ("jesus is the son of god") get attacked and the police refuses to help them, and even forcefully escort them out of the area. Any other genius ideas?
And lastly, I really can't blame people reciprocating the hate that those 1.6 billion people have for them. But for some strange reason, you only want to talk about one sides hate, not the others.

Do you think governments will be unable to stop that?
Nah, I don't think bitcoin, or any other crypto for that matter, will ever (at least in my life time) completely replace fiat currencies. 
I think that cryptos (mainly bitcoin) will at first take over saving accounts (people who want to protect their money from inflation and outright stealing for bank bailouts). We can already see this on a smaller scale, like people moving money to bitcoin during brexit.    
Then they will take over big scale purchases: car, houses, companies, etc. I'm near certain that in 5-10 years people will be buying houses and cars with cryptos.    
As for day-to-day expenses (the much touted coffee cup example), I doubt we'll see cryptos take over them. It wouldn't surprise me, but I doubt it. I think it's a lot more likely that governments will issue their own cryptos (something that estonia is already looking into) with central control over them. Basically, fiat 2.0, just more transparent.
As for governments stopping them, you still don't realize, that cryptos are more of an idea, than anything else. Just like no government can ever get rid of terrorism, they won't be able to destroy cryptos. Also, there's an idea that people who become rich due to cryptos might eventually end up in high places in politics (or simply bribing high politicians). If that happens, they would be more likely to co-opt and encourage usage of cryptos, than try to destroy them.

I don't day trade cryptos. I hold them long term. And just like in op, people keep telling me to sell my cryptos, but they can never explain what I should do next, besides buying a lambo, which I don't need. I also don't invest anything I couldn't bare loosing.


Like I said, I'm certain that stocks are in a bubble right now. What's the point investing in them, if they will be worth half as much in a couple of years?

1) coinbase isn't the only way to buy bitcoin. You can buy it in person, without any documents or scrutiny;    
2) I don't know where you live, but my local banks require a lot more information than low-limit accounts on most exchanges;


Try sending more than a couple of hundred bucks. The bank fees are percentage based, while bitcoin fees are fixed. Also, try sending, or even better, receiving money from a foreign country. Not even some sketchy place like Somalia, try Germany. I frequently have to wait months for payments, because my banks think it's suspicious in today's connected world to receive money from somewhere else than your hometown.


It's also used for charity, black markets, protecting your funds from extreme devaluation, etc.

Ethereum lacks two of the most (imo) important aspects of bitcoin: decentralization and immutability. 
Vitalik is the overlord of Ethereum, for better or worse, and his word is basically final. There are benefits to this: for example, Ethereum can be upgraded far easier than bitcoin. The downsides should be obvious: just couple days ago Ethereum experienced a mini-crash just because rumors came about Vitaliks death.
As for immutability, there was a hack on Ethereum blockchain a year ago. Vitalik, being benevolent dictator and all, decided to fix the hack by basically reversing the last two days (iirc) of transactions. This caused a hard fork (that's where ETC comes from), plenty of people lost a lot of money and is a controversial decision to this day. Irrespective of your opinion on the ethics of this solution, everybody have to agree that this proved the mutability of Ethereum blockchain.

A bitcoin transaction is a several kilobytes in size. You can send it however you want, as long as you're able to pass along that much information. The best example I heard is: you can send a bitcoin transaction as 18 (iirc) smiley faces in skype. 
How can a government stop or ban something like that?
Sure, some governments are talking about banning (Venezuela), regulating (EU), or coopting (private banks) bitcoin. It's simply impossible to do, that's where the beauty of bitcoin is.
