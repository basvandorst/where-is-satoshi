I'm only in Crypto to make money then convert it right back into Fiat.
So honestly I could care less about this..but for the people who pretend otherwise����‍♂️����‍♂️

The news.


It's irrelevant how it got it.
All that matters is when someone downloads the Bitcoin core they are also downloading encrypted CP. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 22:06:05
Should Bitcoin be banned because there is CP encrypted in certain blocks that's impossible to remove? 
Interested to see opinions on this.
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:34:08
I mean that's if that's your opinion
I believe immutable ledgers make it impossible to stop or at the very least slow the distribution of CP through the internet, this is a new concept the world has never dealt with.
Imagine 4chan except there is absolutely no moderation or anyway to remove posts at all or ban people at all.

Are you being a troll?
The difference is one decrypts in mere moments and the other could take a millennial. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:24:10
I would argue there's a significant difference.
ISP do their best effort to remove it when they find it.
With immutable ledgers and decentralization that's simply impossible. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:37:05
This is simply not true.
[Here is the research](

Imagine you had a wall where once CP is painted on it...it could never be removed from said wall.
And anyone could go back to that wall whenever they want and take a picture of it.
Same for the bank note. The transaction history. Any example you think of.
Immutable ledgers a new concept with new issues the world has never dealt with before. None of your examples make any sense in this case.
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:10:50
I'm not sure what you mean and how this relates? 
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:27:06
Are you incapable of having a reasonable and level headed discussion?
The issue isn't whether it's a crime to upload it. Of course it would be.
The issue is me, you, anyone on Reddit, anyone in the entire world could go right now at this very second to that exact block and get the link. And the link is completely impossible to remove at all. 
And before you say the website will eventually be taken down..it's entirely possible to embed actual pictures directly into the block chain not just weblinks. 
Hell, I suspect pedos realized this long ago and they're using some more embed friendly crypto to share. What happens if I'm correct and that immutable ledger is discovered? The pictures will be impossible to remove and stop the distribution of.

But wtf do I know right? 
You people just wanna circlejerk about terrible y'all are with investing.

Thanks for trying but I don't need help from a random internet stranger


Thanks. I actually made profit in 2017, 2018, and 2019.


I have price targets where I have cashed out and will cash out in increments, but thanks for telling me what I already know. 


Lol I don't care about any of this tech crap. All I care about is when I cash in and cash out for profit.
@_date: 2019-08-01 10:32:24
It is a centralized reputation system, their working on figuring out how to decentralize it.
But guess what..I'm still sitting here in massive profit.
Your trolling doesn't change that.
