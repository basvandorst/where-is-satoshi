Excellent - and I'm sure today's IRS announcement only further reinforces that, right? I think it would be hard to say that Bitcoin, as a property, is similar to a stock or security at this point. But who knows - BTC is a game changer.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:30:39
This. Exactly this. I get irritated when people say "I should have bought $X in coins back in 2009." If you were involved with BTC back then, you would know that there weren't that many BTC for sale even if you wanted them!
Some day someone might say, "Man, I wish I would have purchased $1B in BTC back in 2014" ... and you have to realize, there isn't that much BTC for sale right now! Try to buy even a couple million and the price goes through the roof as the walls are eaten through!

You're presenting two separate challenges:
- **Make a clone of Gyft's web/mobile interface:** likely not difficult for someone who is dedicated
- **Offer more than 5% off:** if Gyft can't do this with as big as they are, I'm certain you can't. This cannot be answered precisely unless you know exactly what their wholesale rates on gift cards are, what their operating expenses are, etc ... but you're welcome to try, ala capitalism.

Google FinCEN's MSB "suspicious activity reporting" limits - they pretty clearly define "large amount" as $10k.
However, numerous conspicuous smaller amounts are to be reported as well. (i.e. $9,999 every other day ... this is called structuring and is a very very bad thing to do to avoid SAR)

Here's a decent review of a couple weeks on Soylent: 
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:38:12
First of all, we've all ALWAYS said it's better to hold BTC than to try to mine for profit. That is not new, so you're exactly right, almost EVERYONE would have ALWAYS been better to simply hold BTC. That is not up for debate.
You are wrong - mining profits are actually tied to USD (and thus, the exchange rate) because all power bills are paid in BTC (the largest cost of mining). Whether or not you cash your BTC out to USD is your own prerogative, but you should always be basing your calculations on USD.
To put it in a way that may be easier to understand:
Oct 1, 2013: Pay 35 BTC for a BFL Monarch (delivery promised in Jan 2014) ... current exchange rate is $120 USD/BTC so you paid $4200
Dec 1, 2013: BFL delivers **EARLY**, but exchange rate has sky rocketed to $1,000 USD/BTC. As a result, mining difficulty increases and you are only able to generate 8 BTC, however, that results in $8,000 revenue due to exchange rate and you profit $3,800 (minus power costs). You are (presumably) happy because you made a significant profit and you can choose to keep it in BTC and "let it ride" or sell in USD for an immediate gain.
Sep 23, 2014: You held your huge gains for too long and exchange rate drops to $400/USD. As a result, your mining revenue that stayed in BTC is now only worth $3,200. You're angry and start calling people retards on reddit.
Everyone's story is a little different, but I just wanted to explain how even if BFL would have delivered early, it's easy to see how you could realize a loss simply due to exchange rate fluctuations, which mining revenue is quite sensitive to. In this scenario, BFL exceeded their promise, but customers are still upset.
The point of all of this, is compare USD value of the BTC when you purchased the equipment to the USD value of any mining revenue generated - that is how you'll get a true picture of your loss. Add to that the estimated loss of revenue due to hardware delays and increasing difficulty. That is your loss from BFL.
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:48:19
Really? You never once figured in the USD costs of this investment? That is surprising since your power bills (one of the larger costs of mining) are paid in USD.
There's a reason why nearly every bitcoin calculator on the internet has a field for "exchange rate" ... that's because it's very relevant to potential profits.

I've never seen a drone company advertising on here that they accept BTC. I think your best bet is going to be going the eGifter/Gyft route and purchasing an Amazon.com gift card for BTC.
I have a DJI Phantom 2 with GoPro/Gimbal/FPV goggles ... the whole works. I am very happy with my setup, but with all the bells and whistles, definitely exceeds your budget many times over.
This may be one of the best drones that fits around your budget: [

Hi BitPay! I had commented on a post a few days ago and had inquired as to whether or not you had ever been in a position where you had to provide customer records to a govt agency. I'm always curious as to the security of purchase history and whether or not it's being shared with anyone outside of BitPay: 
@_date: 2014-08-22 21:55:05
"It will be refunded to your Bitcoin" ... the weird wording of that sentence should have been a dead giveaway that this sales rep didn't know what they were talking about.

I was browsing and saw a recommendation for the Mission Belt for CCW and just general durability.
I was going to email them to see if they'd consider accepting BTC but when I scrolled to Mission Belt's footer, I saw that 'ol familiar Bitcoin logo!
I see they never even advertised this on They just created an account with BitPay, flipped a switch on Shopify, and went on their merry way with business as usual. Blows my mind that we've reached a point where I can actually stumble upon a new (large!) business in the wild that is accepting BTC for everyday products we need.
Although I haven't received my belt, the reviews seem promising. Consider trying one out yourself to support this BTC-accepting merchant!
As an aside: the CEO/founder seems like a [really interesting person] ( who genuinely cares about making the world a bit better. Perhaps that's why he's accepting crypto!

I've often wondered about that. I can definitely see the point you're making.
What about a dead man's switch that trips the deletion of that file? Technically, they wouldn't be doing anything after the gag order is issued; in fact, it's the prevention of action that is causing the warrant canary report to be deleted.
I did look it up but haven't found any examples of someone being charged with violating a gag order by use of a warrant canary. Not saying it's not a possibility, just that the courts haven't cared enough yet to make someone an example.
EDIT: I should note, that in any event, failing to properly respond to such a question in an AMA is likely a sign that they have been subpoenaed for purchase histories but are either under a gag order or do not want this information brought to light in this AM(almost)A.
I can't think of another good reason why they would skirt the question with a non-answer in an AMA that is intended to to answer questions about their business. They either can't say or don't want to say and either of those are bad signs.

Purse.io matches up people with usable credit cards to people with an Amazon wishlist. Do you know how they can afford 25% off? Most of the credit cards used for these purchases are fraudulently obtained. i.e., you say you want that $1,000 TV off Amazon. Fraudster has stolen credit card and buys TV for you, asking for only $750 (BTC) for his trouble. You're happy with 25% off, fraudster is happy with $750 he didn't have previously. .... days later, Amazon finds out you received goods from a stolen credit card and shit hits the fan.
If it sounds too good to be true... 
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:55:20
I can only imagine. Do tell some stories!
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:48:48
This - exactly this. The barcodes that Gyft generates are not the ones that Wal-Mart cashiers expect. This happened to me numerous times when eGifter resold Wal-Mart cards, and again now that Gyft resold them. It was not a pleasant experience, for me, the cashier, or the customers waiting in line for 10+ minutes.
Even the manager ended up saying "Any time you get these and want to spend them, please go to customer service and buy a physical gift card. It will make it much easier for all of us."
This has happened with other merchants, too, but Wal-Mart was the most frustrating as the employees have zero motivation to actually solve the situation. They just keep scanning the same non-functioning barcode and scratching their heads.
I think there needs to be better communication between the re-sellers and the merchants about what the end gift card looks like. If Gyft had the ability to re-create the Wal-Mart e-gift barcodes, this probably wouldn't be an issue, but perhaps Wal-Mart guards that closely.
**EDIT** - just received a reply from Wal-Mart:
"Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We take our customers' feedback very seriously, we have documented your request and we will take actions about this matter; however, we cannot promise you that Gyft.com will sell our cards again."

Thanks - in the end, I'm not sure how I'll actually feel about having my cold storage funds swept anyway, so perhaps my use case contradicts the type of service you are trying to offer. Hopefully I'm just a one-off case and other customers will be ok with the compromise.

A lot of that is also because of the significant increase in exchange rate since you ordered. It looks horrible when you look at the BTC figures because of that, but if you compare USD figures (~$4k for the preorder vs. ~$800 in mining revenue) it looks slightly less worse.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:50:36
I agree it is best practice to sweep away when you spend (i.e. not re-using the address). However, the big benefit that I personally see to not sweeping right away, is what if you get locked out of your online account? At least you still have the cold storage private key to recover those funds.
I've seen so many horror stories of users importing a private key into multibit or something similar, then spending a single satoshi, and the rest gets swept to a change address. Then, the user deletes their wallet and realizes "Oh shit, my cold wallet is now empty!" - I can picture many similar stories happening for users simply importing a private key, not expecting it to be swept.
There are lots of opinions on this topic (and GreenAddress clearly has theirs) - I've just really enjoyed the freedom that BC.i has given me to import/export/whatever - very flexible.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:19:35
I got the exact same email today. I'm 100% sure this is someone who originally responded to a Craigslist ad of mine and then had my email address as we exchanged back and forth. 
How do I know? Because it was a one-time use throw away email account - not a single other service or person is even aware that unique address exists!
TL:DR - someone is actively preying on individuals known to sell BTC. 
Thanks for making this public so quickly.

I'm not talking about credit card companies at all. Gyft is merely a re-seller of digital gift cards who happens to accept CC, BTC, etc.
What I'm trying to say is that the only possible way to beat Gyft's current 3% off rate for BTC purchases is to convince the retailer (i.e. Target/Best Buy/etc) to reduce the wholesale price of the gift cards. 
Assume you buy a $100 Target gift card from Gyft. You pay with BTC and the final cost is $97 to you (3% off). Gyft likely paid $92 for that card to ensure they make their 5% required to keep their doors open (overhead, etc) and make a profit that keeps them interested in serving you. 
To compete with them, you either have to be willing to do it for no profit, be really good at negotiating with retailers, or have a large enough account with each retailers where negotiating is easy due to your large volume.
Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that if Gyft hasn't reduced prices beyond 3% (other than promos), there's a good reason most likely.

This is false. You can buy $500,000 worth of Bitcoins right now without obtaining a MSB license. You can also sell $500,000 worth of Bitcoins on a liquid exchange right now without obtaining a MSB license.
What you cannot do is sell 1,000 BTC to someone at a coffee shop for $500,000 in USD cash; that requires a MSB as you are dealing with large amounts of cash and potentially are subject to numerous FinCEN reporting requirements.

"almost risk free"?
Having a stranger on the internet hold onto your Bitcoins is kind of the opposite of risk free. (ala Mt. Gox)
What's to say BitFinex won't file for bankruptcy protection next week, too?

Obviously they don't have much of a choice if they are subpoenaed for such records, but I'm just curious! I have a hard time believing that the IRS is going through BitPay orders and investigating the taxation of such payments, but I guess anything is possible.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:13:23
While I generally agree with your statements about the sunk cost fallacy, there's a fine balance between continuously re-evaluating your investment and panic selling (especially so with Bitcoin).
It's my belief that, when it comes to Bitcoin, the original decision to purchase should carry more weight than future evaluations. This is because there will ALWAYS be something going wrong with Bitcoin from one perspective or another (i.e. a reason to panic sell), but contrary to your second paragraph, you never know "for sure" how much (if at all) that will affect the price. Show me someone who can predict the price will drop by $100 five minutes from now, and I'll show you a millionaire.
I've been trading for a long time and I can tell you that there was definitely a time or two where I thought the way you describe (forget about what I paid and just try to capitalize on current volatility) but it's almost always ended in tears (i.e. selling at the bottom of a dip, ending up in a worse position). To take that example to the extreme, one's prediction of Bitcoin's future could change once-a-day, or perhaps even multiple times per day - does that mean they should ditch their original investment multiple times per day based on new "feelings" or potential performance affecting "news"? With more stable stocks, this makes a lot of sense, but with the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin, I personally feel that your original (calculated) decision should hold the most weight because there will ALWAYS be a better price or a reason to panic sell and cut your (paper) losses. There are very experienced people out there manipulating the current market, and if you're not firm with your decision, you're bound to lose your shirt.
That's where the mantra "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" comes from; with this particular investment, it has historically made the most sense to make a single lump sum **long-term** investment that you will not look back on, and hope it turns out for the best.
It's more of a gamble than an investment at the blockchain's current age, and as such, I personally feel that the sunk cost fallacy is less relevant than it would be in a similar situation in traditional investing.

I disagree. No argument that it will not be the same quality, but "noticeably worse" is a bit of an overstatement, especially since you haven't yet identified what device you're talking about.  For someone who occasionally watches shows on a 20" computer monitor or an iPhone, there would hardly be any noticeable difference. 
I don't watch the same show twice - if I did, you better believe I would have downloaded it locally. 
I consider this option more like a custom TiVo that allows users to watch shows wherever they want, whenever they want, with as little friction as possible. Downloading 1080p videos, managing a NAS or other storage (plus backups!!), and recompressing/loading onto every device that you own is the opposite of frictionless. 
But yes, for the videophile that wants their videos in pristine 1080p accessible only in their home, there is probably no need for this service.

With Bitcoin comes unhindered freedom and with that freedom comes a mentality that brings us closer to our animal-like tendencies. Only the strong survive ... take advantage of the weak.

One question I've had for a while about BitcoinTaxes website - do you take IRS "wash sale" rules into account when calculating gains/losses? I don't know the particulars, but for people who frequently trade BTC, I understand that there are limitations to the losses that can be claimed (if you re-buy within 30 days) and that could have significant implications on gains.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:38:51
Thanks for the clarification. 
I can understand your hesitation, but I also find a bit of humor in a service touting security, while at the same time, it's incompatible with existing cold storage directly (i.e. the only way to pull money from cold to greenaddress is via another intermediary, at present). I think one would argue that cold storage is as secure as it gets and service providers should be encouraging customers to both save and retrieve funds from cold storage in order to increase that type of storage.
As you said, you may be working on a solution to this, but I just want to make it clear how important this is to me (and potentially, many other customers).
I had to make a large in-person transaction last night, and would have used your service in a heart beat had you had a way to pull money from cold storage, but it's impossible for me to use without that.

If he really bought it for ~$4m last year, I bet this small growth doesn't phase him. He's likely more frustrated that he didn't sell it last Nov/Dec when the rate was $1,200.  Failing to sell at that peak actually cost him $27m. :/

Had a nice chat with customer support. They admitted that their fraud algorithms are a bit too strict right now and it's negatively affecting a lot of customers. Being their first week open to the public, they are still a bit hesitant to loosen them up, so I think all you can do is wait until they no longer deem you a risky customer (could be a week or two, depending on how busy these first couple of weeks keep their fraud department).
It sucks, but I guess that's one of the caveats of opening the flood gates to everyone - greater chance of them being ripped off by fraudsters.
I will say that phone support was very responsive and friendly.

Yes, I think we are in agreement on all accounts - just communicating it a bit differently. I'm not suggesting a Bitcoiner holds their coins just because they made the decision to buy them at $1,000; I'm just stating that while Bitcoin is young, there will almost always be **very** good justification on both sides of the argument of whether or not to sell those coins as the price goes up and down. Today I could read a dozen different reddit posts/news articles about Bitcoin and reach a dozen different conclusions about where the market is headed; if I reacted based on each of those conclusions ... well, you see where I'm going. (that's just not the case with traditional investing - there tends to be a pretty clear prevailing investment opinion in most cases). A wise person will recognize the full risk of the investment at the time of purchase and commit to not panic sell or try to predict the bottom of a dip like what we're currently in. 
I do agree that the amount you originally spent on the investment should have absolutely no influence on one's decision; think about why you originally invested and if something has fundamentally changed with any of your reasons for investing, only then should you consider modifying your "bet".

I saw a post recommending GreenAddress yesterday (comment on one of the BC.i posts) so I signed up. I was quite disappointed to see that there is currently no way to import a private key into your green address wallet. Unless I'm missing it somewhere?
This is a very important feature for a fully functional wallet (how else do we successfully pull out of cold storage??) and I cannot consider using this service until this feature is available.
The design looks slick though.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:00:06
The one assumption you're making is that someone is just sitting on BTC looking to buy a miner - that is not true in all cases. Many customers used BFL equipment as a way to simply acquire BTC. I remember very clearly people having issues on MtGox/Coinbase and saw an order through BFL as an easy way to convert USD (via paypal) to BTC (mined).
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:21:28

No, taxes in the US don't work like that. Income is recognized at the time of sale, and future purchases do not affect that in any way. 
In addition, if on Nov 1st, BTC went to zero, and that $5k of BTC was sold for practically nothing, you could not recognize that loss  against your previous gains (wash sale rules).
If you sold $10k bitcoins, determine your cost basis based on previous purchases and pay the full taxes owed. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:00:43
Way to take it to the extreme. The CEO? No. But if you expect every employee to understand their ever changing policies, especially related to newfangled payment methods, you're only going to be met with disappointment. 
Newegg is in the business of selling electronics, not speculating on BTC. Be happy they accept it. 
I always loved what the Overstock rep said during the NYDFS Bitcoin hearings. Something along the lines of "Your purchase of bed sheets is NOT your virtual currency 'option'. All returns will be based on the USD value of the payment at the time it is received."
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:58:10
Trust me, I understand the loss all too well. I'm just trying to point out that, as much as we all hate BFL, it's unfair to hold them accountable for the unbelievable exchange rate gains back in late 2013.
There's no question that what they did was criminal, but with mining difficulty and exchange rate changing so rapidly, it's hard to get a clear picture of the true losses.
Of course we're all trying to generate that almighty BTC, but it's always in relation to the current value in USD. A bit today is not worth the same is a bit tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:04:34
Agreed, but I just want to point out that it's definitely NOT a $13k loss like those BTC figures above might lead one to believe (using ONLY today's exchange rate).
It's painful for everyone involved, and this seizure may not help things for quite some time.

My day job requires transcoding videos for clients regularly ... and I've been doing it since before the GordianKnot days. Trust me, I understand the [repercussions] ( 
The end-device matters significantly; in fact, I would say it is likely THE most important factor when discussing bitrates/transcoding. There is absolutely no need to download a 1080p video if you are going to be watching the video once, on your iPhone on tomorrow morning's commute. Even 720p may be overkill. (and yes, you can say 'well if that's true, just download a lower resolution original file', but you and I both know that with some shows, there are limited resolution options available)
Using [this] ( as a loose reference, you can easily see that re-encoding an original 1080p video to just the 720p standards that YouTube uses (still HD!), you can reduce the file size by 80% (a far cry from the drastic 700MB to 650MB scenario you painted)! That means that I can stream the same movie up to *5 times*, and still use the same bandwidth as you did to download the original. Sure, it's not going to look as stunning on my 60" plasma, but for the morning commute, why not? Keep in mind, if you ever WANT to get the original file (sick day and you want to watch it at home), you can ... and quickly! The two use-cases are not mutually exclusive. You can view it as a way to have access to all media, but only download the originals (quickly and on-demand) when you truly intend to take full advantage of the higher bitrate (I estimate only 25% of my viewing would meet that use-case).
Using the information provided in the link above, I strongly have to disagree with your last point - streaming does NOT come even close to using the same bandwidth as downloading the original, with the assumption that we're aiming for 'acceptable' video quality. If your argument is that streaming will never compare to downloading the original, I wholeheartedly agree. Streaming the file in it's ORIGINAL quality will use near the same bandwidth of downloading it (because of, math).
But again, for those looking for frictionless access to all of their downloaded media (including mobile/remote access outside the home), with 'acceptable' streaming video quality in order to reduce bandwidth requirements, without having to worry about maintaining a storage repository and backups (we can both agree there is a cost to that), this seems like a fair service. 
And let's not forget, they accept BTC to boot!

My original monarch order date was September 2013. I had gone through several of their upgrades/substitutions over the course of the year, finally ending up with the "partial shipment/partial refund" option when they were cranking out orders right before the FTC shutdown this past fall.

@_date: 2015-01-08 03:37:44
My advice is to just send an email giving them a very brief but clear summary of your situation, order number, previous case numbers, how much you're owed, and a BTC address they can send a refund to. More than a few sentences and they may just ignore you in favor of other low hanging fruit. 
I had paid with PayPal, but requested a BTC refund. 
Might also help to add an FTC complaint/case number if you have one.  (if you don't have one, get one)
And as always, be polite! They seem like they really want to resolve these open issues (now that the FTC is watching).

Plenty of websites out there that help to calculate potential mining profit. I was one of the largest ASICM resellers in the US, so trust me, I'm familiar with the calculations. 
But of course, if it was a "safe" investment, everyone would have made it.  Calculated risk ≠ no risk. I was well aware of BFL's track record and was willing to take a chance.
I'll come out ahead with the refund, so I'd say my calculated risk was sound ;).

Roughly a week before they got shutdown, I (along with everyone else) was offered an immediate shipment of weaker monarch's and a partial refund. I could choose between that or waiting for the monarch's with original specs to be produced.
I opted for the weaker monarch's (which were shipped that day) and the refund (which they said would take some time).
Of course then the FTC shut them down almost immediately and I thought all hope was lost. 
I filed claims with the FTC and the Kansas AG for the amount of my refund.
Just today, I received some very kind emails from BF support saying the refunds were sent via Bitcoin (I had provided them with clear refund instructions before the FTC shutdown).
Checked my BTC address and sure enough, I've been paid every bit owed!

Will you please elaborate what you mean when you say you "previously used Dwolla to buy bitcoins on localbitcoins"? This is an important detail that could prevent this from happening to others and it's being left out.
Did you buy some bitcoins on localbitcoins and just send that person the money directly? If so, I don't see how they could have possibly known you were using localbitcoins.
Did you somehow send money to a localbitcoins escrow account from Dwolla (not sure how that works)? If so, that may be easy for them to spot and is how they identified the activity.
Ultimately, you are in violation of what they are accusing you of (you are exchanging money for a virtual currency which has been ruled to be subject as a Money Service Business activity) ... I'm just trying to determine how exactly you were caught as to prevent others from making the same mistakes.

Close: the one month wait is because Dwolla now let's users get chargebacks within 30 days in some scenarios, leaving merchants like CampBX at significant risk of getting screwed. 
The OP truly needs to deal with CampBX if he wants Dwolla purchases. They are great and the one month wait is Dwolla's policy, not CBX. 
If nothing else, create an account, trade one satoshi, and let your 30 day clock start ticking so if in the future you ever want to use it instantly, you'll be prepared!

I watched the demo for "Bitcoin with Friends". If I recall correctly, it was touted as an easy way to get your friends started using bitcoins. You fund your "Bitcoin with Friends" account and make a Facebook post saying you're willing to lend up to x amount of BTC to friends. They see that announcement on their timeline and can claim some/all of those BTCs. Once they take them, they still have to send them to another app (blockchain.info, etc) in order to spend them. Basically, I saw it as a way to announce to your FB friends that you have BTC, are willing to share them, and get more people using them.
I did not see which ideas won the awards as I left right when the judges were debating.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:13:21
Am I understanding correctly that you want to manually generate a custom bitcoin address with a special word in it?
If so, what you are referring to is vanity address mining - you use a program like vanitygen to generate private keys until one of them matches up with the address characteristics (or 'firstbits') that you are requesting. Every additional character that you request in your firstbits exponentially increases the time it takes to find that matching private key.

I don't mean to scare you, but buying silver from coinabul was the worst bitcoin purchase I've ever made. They strung me along for half a year saying "oh, we'll ship in a couple days". Then, when they FINALLY shipped, I received silver that was entirely different than what I ordered - much worse quality. And when I complained, the owner's answer was "Silver is silver - it shouldn't matter what it looks like, just that it's the same weight as what you ordered."
There's a reason Jon Holmquist left them - I really don't think he could, in good conscious, work for them any more after stringing along so many customers.
I would strongly encourage you to do anything you can to get a refund and try someone else.

I just found out about this service and was blown away - what a neat idea. I don't display my LEGO creations and would love to just ship them back after admiring it for a couple days and get started on a new one!
I'd love to be able to pay for a subscription with Bitcoin and I have this itching feeling that there are other nerdy folks like me on here who may want to as well.
Think about it: for 0.15 BTC/month you could have a perpetual LEGO supply! At one point, even a USB Block Erupter was earning that much!
My offer was that I would commit to a year of their Mega subscription (0.4 BTC/month) if they would consider accepting Bitcoins. That's allotta dimp, but I think it would make the next 12 months extremely fun :)
**EDIT 7/28**: They have already contacted me (what was that, 5 minutes!?!) and said they are considering it - they will check with marketing and they said it sounds like a "marvelous idea". If this would be of value to you, consider letting them know!
**EDIT 7/29**: Someone from marketing contacted me and said while they do recognize a great BitPay following, they feel that most of their users are not "Reddit Savvy" and may not take to Bitcoins. In addition, there were concerns about how they would charge users for lost or damaged LEGO sets (very easy with credit cards, you just charge them for it ... impossible to do with one-time BTC payment). I made my case and also told them I would be willing to make a security deposit with BTC if necessary. I encourage anyone who desires this service to email them - give them an idea of the demand they can expect. They say they will keep thinking about it but I assume if they don't receive many inquiry emails regarding BTC, it won't stay on their radar for long.

The reason they have lower pricing is because it is quite difficult to get USD into their exchange. In addition, customers end up missing USD/BTC a lot in their accounts (due to hacking or possibly just corruption) - so like many things in life, the lower price indicates more difficulty/risk.
@_date: 2013-05-22 22:30:56
Yuk, that must be a warm beer. I have no explanation, but I do know when things like this pop up, waiting at least 24 hours is always sound advice. I really do think it could be related to the fact that now that ASICminer is solo mining, they are distributing coins that the network does not yet consider valid (freshly minted coins need at least 100 confirmations before they are considered valid). In that event, all we need to do is wait a bit longer.

When I posted this, I was running Firefox 18.0.2 and My Wallet 1.2. I confirmed several times that I could get around two-factor auth (I just left the field blank when prompted).
Then, I upgraded both to latest versions (FF 19.0 and My Wallet 1.4). I can still confirm that I'm able to enter my account (both online and with the extension) with the auth field blank.
The only thing unique about my situation, I believe, is that I enabled two-factor auth AFTER installing the plugin on my PCs, so perhaps it's cached somewhere that two-factor auth isn't required (even though it's prompting me)?
If this is important enough that blockchain should recognize it (and others can reproduce), consider upvoting to increase awareness.

Claiming that you're "quite sure" it's a bubble also deserves a bit of analysis and explanation. What's to say it's not rapid adoption now that VGA mining is abruptly becoming obsolete?
Just because the share price is going up fast doesn't mean it's "mindless" - I've put a lot of thought into the [undisclosed number] of shares I've been purchasing in order to hedge my other mining investments [damnit BFL] and I'm sure I, for one, have been driving the price up significantly. I'm sure I'm not the only miner in this position either - we're all vying for our own slice of the future of bitcoin mining and I would expect prices to reflect that.
The way I see it, one can either spend the money buying/hosting/building their own ASIC at this point or they can invest in ASICminer - there aren't many other options to stay in the game and time is running out. This steep increase in price on all exchanges reflects that in the same way that BFL recently DOUBLED their prices for WEAKER equipment.

You can't sell your credits?!? Am I mistaken, or were you the one on BitcoinTalk just a few days ago making lowball offers on almost every WTS ad for BFL credits??
I'm very surprised you can't sell even after getting them for what I presume is next to nothing!!
PM me a realistic offer and I'll consider it. I bought a few thousand for $2-$3 already, but I hear they're worth much less now. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:31:12
You have two options: use the credits to buy chips and research how to turn them into useable hash power, or sell your credits. 
I bought a few thousand credits not long ago for $2-$3 each, but it's my understanding that they're worth MUCH less now due to supply. 
You CAN sell the credits by transferring them to another user's email address. 
If anyone reading this has credits but has no interest in jumping through all of the "build your own state-of-the-art miner" hoops, PM me a realistic offer. If you want to give them to me for free, I'll even consider giving you a discount on any ASIC I build - I'm a reputable seller on both BitMit and BitcoinTalk. Again, PM me to start this.

Well, I was hoping to get some feedback before making a purchase, but no one responded so I pulled the trigger anyway!
I bought a plane ticket for a friend and I must say that, thus far, I've been very impressed with the service!
Who knew you could buy plane tickets with bitcoin!?! They've already sent me the itinerary and I'm planning some more purchases from them.
The only constructive feedback I'd provide:
* I wish their current exchange rate was more in-line with exchanges! (for example, their current rate is $95, while CampBX is trading above $105 ... that's like a 10% hidden fee!)
* I wish there was a place to specify seat preferences (this seems very important for a flight, although they have a "note" field, it seems like it's important enough to have its own dedicated field for each passenger. I like aisle seats, my wife likes windows, etc)
Without a doubt, I was absolutely satisfied with the service. So much so that I just bought ANOTHER ticket! ... And I'm beginning planning our fall vacation with term!

Gyft doesn't go by any exchange rate; their payment processor (BitPay.com) does.
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe BitPay does a weighted average between all of the exchanges. They do a bit of arbitrage between the exchanges they have access to and, in doing so, they can offer a pretty fair rate.
**EDIT** - I did attempt a purchase to test your claim that they were lower than CampBX, and I found the opposite - they were above CampBX bid (between CBX and Gox). I would challenge you to look at the CampBX [order book]( when looking at rates as that's as true as it gets (what someone is willing to pay this instant for your bitcoins)

Here's just one example of a group of guys working together to build miners out of raw chips: 
Currently working on Avalon chips only, and you'd likely had to have been in one if the earliest group buys. 
It's quite an endeavor, so honestly, most users are better off giving their credits away for "good will" (discount on a miner that is created from those chips) or trying to sell the credits for whatever the market rate is (low right now). 
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:05:19
They are definitely responsive. In that time, I've had 6 tickets opened and closed. If it's urgent, simply update your ticket with a response (this seems to increase its appearance on their radar) or post on their Facebook.

Do you understand how little effort it takes a merchant to set up a BitPay account? Like 5 minutes of effort and then they can print a QR code so anyone can pay in Bitcoin and yet the merchant still gets the precious fiat they need to operate in today's fiat-based society.

GiftCardZen clearly notes on their site that it's for online use only (so my interaction at Target was completely expected, but thought I'd try anyway), but I just wanted to comment on this because perhaps there is some Target policy preventing Gyft from making e-giftcards available for them.
I know Gyft uses images of Target gift cards in various places on their site/app, and when I inquired a while ago, they thought they may be close, but so far, no dice.

They're making hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars a week at present. You really don't think they have enough capital to continue developing equipment in order to remain competitive?
Also, you should realize that it's not just mining. A large portion of last weeks profit's was actually from equipment sales. They are diversifying a bit from just solo mining, which is a good sign.

Rumor is the American-based company has made significant headway in their own ASIC chip development (prior to this, their mining operation had been heavily diversified with other hardware orders). That's what the announcement tomorrow will likely be about; they're ready to starting manufacturing their own miners to massively increase their hash rate.
Price went out of control yesterday based on this speculation, and the owner released 2 million more IPO shares this morning  in order to raise funding for R&amp;D.
He released IPO shares a few weeks ago at a measly 0.0005 (yes, 20% lower than today's price) - I bet people are really kicking themselves for not snatching those up. And based on rumors that are circulating, I'm inclined to believe people are going to kick themselves for not snatching up today's IPO shares.
This feels a lot like when ASICM first went public for 0.01 ... picture them as an American version of ASICM. What would you give to go back in time and invest even a small portion of your wealth at that price??
USA! USA! USA!
P.S. - this company ALSO pays dividends, just like ASICM.

In order to continue this discussion, I would request that you clearly state the reasons for your frustration.
Is it that someone once convinced you to accept BTC, and you held onto the BTC, and your business suffered as a result?
I guess I don't understand the disadvantages of accepting BTC. Accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, and then holding onto that BTC on nothing but pure speculation are two entirely different issues and should be treated as such.
A merchant who creates a BitPay account and accepts Bitcoin takes on absolutely no additional risk while simultaneously opening themselves up to an army of consumers with Bitcoins burning a hole in their pockets; it seems like a no-brainer.
On the otherhand, if you're talking about creating your own wallet, accepting BTC for your business, and then holding onto that BTC in the hopes that it remains stable or increases ... well, that's only going to cause frustration as Bitcoin is anything BUT stable at the moment.
If your business requires fiat to operate, you need to ensure that every payment ultimately ends in fiat (whether through credit card or BitPay) and in no scenario is it **ever** the consumer's responsibility to ensure you do that. Therefore, I cannot possibly imagine why you would be frustrated with customers who pay in Bitcoin.

I'm curious: as a reseller (and considering the recent unannounced drastic price cuts), are you at all concerned that your inventory will suddenly lose half of its value over night? I've seen a lot of resellers, who made similar promises as you, close up shop in the past few days because the inventory they paid $10,000 for last week can only be sold for $5,000 this week.
I'm just wondering what precautions you (and other resellers) are taking to protect yourselves from such risk. As far as I understand it, ASICM offers no pricing protection to resellers.

I asked one of the models "What can you tell me about this rig? Do you know who manufactures it?" just to make conversation.
After several back and forths, I was absolutely unable to convince this stunning woman that there was not, in fact, a company called "ASIC" out there making these machines. She sat all weekend by the rig and was oblivious to the acronym.

This is amazing Vinny. Did I miss [another announcement that you were going to make on Monday] ( Some of us have been waiting a very long time for the other announcement!!
@_date: 2013-05-21 07:43:26
You're likely thinking of BFL. ASICminer has a damn good reputation in this community.

I've emailed half a dozen times about upgrading my shipping and have tried calling 3 times. Not a single answer. 
I know they're busy and all, but as a paying customer, I find it absolutely unacceptable. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:56:04
Speaking as (likely) one of your best customers: "Woooohooooo!!!" I love you guys, I really do. And this type of behavior certainly reinforces that emotion ;)

I had horrible experiences with coinabul and vowed that my next purchase would be with Amagi. So you have been happy with them?
Coinabul strung me along for months and then finally shipped me the shittiest silver I've ever seen. This was right before Jon Holmquist left them (presumably because he didn't like their shady practices).

As stated by others, they may resell a $100 gift card for $95 and they get to keep $5 at absolutely no risk to them (with Bitcoin payments, anyway). This is consistent with Vinny's post a couple of days ago where he stated they really only make decent money on large purchases.
Why would a store let them keep so much, you may ask? Look at it this way - Gyft is essentially advertising for all of those companies on a commission basis. They're saying "Hey, spend $100 at Target" and Target pays them a 5% fee to do that because once that user gets that gift card, they are commited to spending every single dollar at Target. 
From the retailer's perspective, it's actually **better** than an advertisement because consumers can always return normal purchases (i.e. leads from ads) for fiat, but when you use a gift card, your returns can only be paid in gift card (so those dollars are forever committed to that retailer).
Gyft is supposed to make some big announcements this week. One of them is allegedly along the lines of sharing some of that ~5% profit with Bitcoin users due to the fact that Bitcoin users help to eliminate all transaction risk. (i.e. pay with credit card, you pay full price. Pay with Bitcoin? You get 3% off)
@_date: 2013-07-10 07:30:41
Tell me about it. I've spent a few thousand in the past couple of weeks and $200 just last night!
Gyft, if you're reading this, share the love with some previously profitable customers, too!!

EDIT: Site operating normally as of 23:00 UTC.
[Official response from Olaf] (
Olaf from Coinbase here.
We're working on getting the site back up now. Sorry for the trouble with this!
EDIT: Site is back up - seems it was a Cloudflare issue. I'll give another update if that's not the case. Thank you all for your patience!

Absoutely without a doubt, [CampBX.com](
They have been my most pleasant trading experience yet!
Use this link for 10% off your commissions, leaving them lower than Mt. Gox commisions! 
I'm not even exaggerating that when I click "send" from the CampBX withdrawal interface (to Dwolla), I hardly lift my finger from the mouse button and my phone is beeping saying money has arrived! They are extremely fast at getting you your cash and bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:03:45
I made two bets. First one, I lost 1 BTC. Second one I [won 50 BTC](
I'm a horrible example of the common saying "don't throw good money after bad".
I think it's a great service that offers fun entertainment for those looking for a little excitement!
@_date: 2013-06-23 05:47:31
There are many groups of users working together to accomplish exactly what you're describing. We can do anything from get you chips for assembly on your own, to assemble for you and give you ready-to-hash units based on open source designs. 
Search for "group buy" on BitcoinTalk. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 22:22:09
Nothing to see here - the transactions are on the network and just waiting for confirmations as far as I can tell. Likely just freshly minted coins that are waiting to be "validated". Just be patient, grab a beer, and wait for this to resolve itself. If anyone is good for the money, it's ASICminer.
On the other hand, if you want to buy some cheap shares, perhaps we can all start a bit of panic here and scare some people into selling. /s
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:30:08
How recently did you order from coinabul? I was not at all satisfied, but it was not in the past few months. I haven't really seen many good reviews, but perhaps that's because the bad ones seem to be the loudest!
@_date: 2013-09-08 06:56:14
Haha that's great!
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:42:58
Has it happened for such long periods of time? They have been completely inaccessible for over 20 minutes now...

I'm so confused. I've tried every browser at my disposal (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari).  I have yet to get a single search to work. Here's exactly what it looks like every time I search: 
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:46:21
Don't get me started on this company; I'm in love with them!! Bought a couple plane tickets this week for family/friends and they are just amazing.  Very responsive and friendly!
I made a post a day or so ago asking for feedback on their services; search for it and leave some feedback for other users to see. 
I will definitely be using their services again and again!!
Companies like this, and Gyft, and BitSpend ... they are making using BTC as a real currency possible - so proud of them all.

Don't creep up on me like that - you scared me!

Correct horse, battery-staple!

I can see how it would be hard to get cash to them. They do offer a money order option (never used it), and I heard that usually finds it's way into your account within a week.
I have a Dwolla account (recommended for most users) and it is nearly instant getting money to and from CampBX.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:03:25
How about 7 :)

All good information for people to consider. The owner has stated that he anticipates ~900 Th/s by 2015, but like you said, that may not be in published plans.
Like all investments, if it was a "sure thing", everyone would be invested and the return would be measly. I can't think of a better definition of risk than all of these BTC investments (ASICM not excluded).
It does look like many people are up for the risk though - the IPO shares released just today are disappearing on BitFunder - should be interesting to see what the announcement is tomorrow!
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:20:31
No! Don't open up multiple tickets. The better solution is to have minimal tickets opened, but continue to update the urgent ones with comments. They actually advise this because they tend to see the "active" tickets at the top of their queue, so if someone is updating theirs a lot, they know it's urgent and need to reply.

I've attended a dozen trade shows/conferences so far this year and this was, by far, the most enjoyable and enriching one. Thanks goes out to everyone who worked so hard to put it together. To those who thought $300 was too steep, let me just say that these folks know how to throw a party! Personally, I'd be comfortable paying twice that next year for such an event - hell of a good time.
