don't get me wrong I like bitcoin but this growth does not feel natural whatsoever 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:19:04
yeah that does seem a little high but I tested every country and all countries have the same 1,48% fee for me
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:08:35
today they closed accounts associated with drug trade 
ITT:Lying drug addicts
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:10:12
today they mass closed accounts associated with drug trade. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:09:22
you bought drugs and your account got closed 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:30:27
yeah I checked that on a 1000 euro payment there is a 23 euro difference from what western union and xe.com shows if its not euros
so thats still only 2,3%+0,5%=2,8% if the currency is different
If the currency isnt different its a flat 1,5% fee ex:euros to euros
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:23:22
 and this is sending it to bumfuck nowhere to the least developed country
 same goes for turkey and 80% of the countries

we will see about it I'll actively monitor it and if it starts falling badly I'll slowly unload it while I'm in green and if I'd get into red at the 650$ area I'll probably just sell it all at that time so it still gurantees a profit
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:28:23
I know thats what I should do I just fear another mtgox 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:45:05
6,4$ for 200 so I assume they have a standard fee of around 5-6 dollar which becomes pretty bad if you spend lower than 250$ transfers
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:40:29
That seems like a viable choice too I'll look into it
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:49:38
Yes but dont keep more there you cant afford to lose and use 2 factor and email auth 
I dont keep more than 5-10  coins on it after their latest fiasco made me shit myself thinking I'll lose it all :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:42:52
yeah I mostly only use fiat when necessary I'm running a bitcoin debit card to buy my goods offline as well
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:28:55
yeah I guess that is it I'm just baffled how cheap it is and they allow card transactions with 0 verifications
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:03:34
omg are you the owner of bitpanda?
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:25:35
hey now I got "error:transaction has been submitted and already exist" it send the payment a bit later but it still might be an error on your end
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:37:30
Yeah I'm just crazy refreshing preev.com and I can't believe my eyes that it just keeps rising my friend is telling me its a pump n dump from the chinese again like they did with dogecoin this growth doesn't feel natural at all
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:25:58
all good now actually thanks
@_date: 2016-12-04 09:16:12
It is not about me not being able to use it,the scanner failed to read my wallet QR code and there was no other way to enter my walllet
The bar workers were trying to help as well to no avail
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:39:00
Please tell me it wont send the current pending payments cuz I sent a 700$ payment around 15 times cuz it wouldnt send it 
would be nice not to be out of all my coins on my hot wallet
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:43:45
great thanks 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:58:20
yeah but how do you get bitcoins on exchange price? Because I pay 3-4% to get my coins
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:25:39
Had nothing but great cs with them
@_date: 2016-12-04 09:16:38
I did end up getting my btc for cash afterwards
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:44:42
I only store around 10-15k on blockchain at a time I have 800k+ in my cold wallet and I never had an issue with them thus far and they offer great security too
