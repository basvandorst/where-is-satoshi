"Hey idiots - you're going to lose all your money on Bitcoin, idiots" was a real article title? Amazing.

I read a dozen posts over the last eight months that said Bitcoin is "finally" dead, so.

Wasn't directly to a pizza place, it was to another user who phoned in a delivery to the other party.
And he sold for about 10x profit later. Probably got back in since then, though.

As everyone knows, PayPal and gold don't exist at the same time, so neither can Ripple and Bitcoin.

I'm going to go ahead and suggest that yes, this stereotype has harmed more Jews than it has benefitted.
Rather it be "man are they great bocci ball players!" and skip all the genocide.

Sure they are, just both policies are "spend monies"

Oh no they're taking Satoshi's UnitedWhateverCoins!

Does "fiat pornography" mean a govt declared it porn but it has no stimulation value?

Nobody used the internet in its Year 1?

I'm saying the line doesn't even exist until year 2, yes that's a surprise. Low sure, like the crypto line is very low during its first year, that is not surprising.
But the red line just looks shifted out of place, like the chart is just broken.

Does government know that?

USD to XRP in seconds. XRP to recipient in 4 seconds. XRP to local fiat in the same time as BTC to fiat.
The transfer time is still reduced to a few seconds instead of half a day, cutting down overall settle time.

Jesus tempt fate why don't you? I banked $304 today day trading dogecoin but I also banked $210 day trading stocks. "Diversifying" into one thing that ain't stocks, ain't diversifying.
Not to say I don't hope you make a billion dollars - I hope you do. But fuck, man.

Murphy's Law makes me want to panic sell every time people say stuff like this...
But good luck fellow hodler/trader!

I would like to take a moment to thank everyone who didn't take responsibility for selling back at 1k to crash Bitcoin to 200 for years so we could get to 8k.
