Crazy how math works.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:37:21
Here's my counter thought process:
The size of observable universe is greater than the length of time humans have as a species will exist.
Therefore we can derive an upper limit to human exploration and discovery. A finite existence.
So, I argue that the more you travel the less you have left to travel.
We can agree that we each have our own personal first person perspectives that we 100% experience independently of each other (since I am me and you are you).
So, on a graph using limits I would say as your life continues you approach a point where you have experienced everything (kinda like max level in a video game) but are always tethered to your own perspective that you cannot escape from, a point of origin.
Take into account the fact the other orbits the sun which itself travels through the universe and we arrive at the situation we call reality. Where, nothing and no one is ever in the same place twice in space-time, ever.

@_date: 2017-05-05 04:50:05
The term "over-valued" is being used a bit loosely in your response. (Although not incorrectly)
But, basically any time someone could trade bitcoin for something that they want. For example buying a house using bitcoin. The bitcoin doesn't necessarily lose value, it is just exchanged for a house. But, then the person who had the house now has the still valuable bitcoin and are free to spend it on a new house/care/laptop or whatever.
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:54:26

Your response has absolutely no substance to it. Where is your actual rebuttal? Markets are not complicated. Supply and demand is not complicated. And buying/selling is not complicated. There's are all operations we figured out a long time ago.
The problem is pretending money serves any real purpose other than to perpetuate greed.

Well it's not a flowchart for all scenarios.
For example if the question is "Do you want to buy a car?" and you answer "yes" you should convert your money into Bitcoin and then buy the car using Bitcoin.
This chart is a generic chart meant to help answer basic questions that I have found are commonly asked by people who are interested in Bitcoin but hesitant to participate.

The more consistent we can get the conversation about bitcoin the better it is for the currency known as bitcoin.

Bitcoins are made up of Satoshis.
A satoshi's value is derived by the timestamp it was mined.

The problem with both of our quotes is we make a few assumptions.
A) We assume that the viewer knows who the quote comes from. In my case Theodor Geisel and in your Lao Tzu
B) We assume that the person we are quoting has objective qualifications to make said point.
C) We assume that the quote has not been made obsolete by some other quote by someone even more objectively qualified.
I chose my quote because it is not wrapped in a philosophical enigma. It is a pretty clear cut idea and can be successfully interpreted in many ways.
While, I can appreciate the quote you followed up with, I fail to see the counter-point or agreeing-point that you are trying to make with it.

I just do not understand why it is not even brought up in big political elections. A unified global currency would be a huge boost to a global market place.

7.8 billion people on this Earth.

There's still 7.7 billion wallets that need to convert to bitcoin still.

I'm talking about if you evaluate Bitcoin over time.
So, as a historian you would look back and say "Oh Bitcoin was essentially worthless when created then jumped up to 250$ in a pretty short time" but then you can further go evaluating when it hit 1000$.
Then you get to today and it's 1600+ and a lot of people seem to be in shock an awe, but doesn't it just seem obvious?
Bitcoin has not failed yet, why would it fail from here on out? And why would it ever drop in price? More people are using it every day. In fact more people are using it each day than the day before? 
Historian's will look back and go "I wish I bought Bitcoin when it was $1,000,000.00 each because that was super cheap"
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:22:10

Owning. Selling bitcoin does not lower the total amount of Bitcoin is circulation. Changing hands does nothing to the total supply.

When I think about markets I always compare them to real time strategy games. In particular one of my favorite Age of Empires.
Now in this game you have resources wood, rock, and gold. And you can spend those resources upgrading technologies or producing units. But, what really gets my attention is the fact that the map you play on has a finite amount of these resources. So, when you play a long match it is easy for all teams to completely run out of access to new gold, wood, or rock entirely. 
Digital currency solves this problem almost entirely. We can mine bitcoins/litecoins/groestlecoins for as long as we really want pending the heat death of the universe.
I think the true value of a Bitcoin lies in its abilities to allocate "human labor" resources without us having to rely on earthly ones instead such as gold, silver, diamonds, oils, etc.
So, in my opinion the value/price of bitcoin is not as effected by what you can do with it but more effected by the number of participants that we can bring on board.
This obviously deters old money from participating because they lose power. But, human labor can only be measured in 'time spent' because we cannot quantify the value of any 'work' someone performs because for the most part that level is subjective or negligible and very often wrongly compensated.

Each exchange/middleman  values bitcoin differently.
And each exchange/middleman updates their bitcoin prices at different speeds (think price-lag).
For example: Bitpay, POLO, and Coinbase all have very similar prices for Bitcoin. However, the "realtime" update to those prices is calculated on a different processor clock for each exchange.
So, Bitpay might update their prices ever half second.
Coinbase might update their price ever 3 quarter of one second.
And polo might update their prices once every 3 coinbase price updates.
In order to get a more accurate read across the board of the actual weighted and agreed upon value of a bitcoin I have spread small amounts of bitcoin across different exchanges and I keep an evaluated measure of the change in price overall.
So, by inflation I mean the rate at which Bitpay refreshes their price per bitcoin relative to the global market weighted average of a Bitcoin.

Stopped reading at "no historical presence", Bitcoin has a historical presence.
"Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the invention on 31 October 2008"
People need to understand that "historical significance" does not matter. Bitcoin has already proven itself over many use-cases but case in point as far as functionality and reliability go it could have proven that in a week. 
So, any argument that involves historic significance is moot.

I like that it is harder for the government to seize.
Sure they can raid your house and take your computer, but you do not have to give them the password to the funds. Even better if you have it on anon remote server somewhere.
Bitcoin does a great job of keeping checks and balances at play.

@_date: 2017-05-05 05:33:14
But, that perspective is backwards. You as the owner of the Bitcoin should apply pressure against the buyer. Bitcoins are highly desirable.
Compare it directly with cash. Most people want cash. And a lot of people would love to have cash that grows as consistently and as strongly as bitcoin.
The fear of bitcoin losing value is where a lot of people are going to sell and lose.

I have this hypothesis that eventually all the tradebots will make day traders jobs entirely m00t. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve we should eventually see an entirely self-sustained system. Now, what is important is to drive that system to an unbiased perspective.

In the event that they cannot retrieve the coins is this not good for Bitcoin?
As people who own coins die and the total available supply becomes less that essentially creates permanent hodlers and thus drive up the value.

On a technical level how could they regulate it?
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:09:41

If I go into my Bitcoin core wallet and ban all non uasf for like an hour. Does that help?

Basically they just need to accept Bitcoin when someone pays taxes.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:10:13
Yeah, it's expensive.

@_date: 2017-06-18 18:11:00

So there's like 21 million coins that will eventually be mined right?
Why not just go ahead and make 21 million addresses that each coin will eventually be mapped to and then treat it like solid state storage?
