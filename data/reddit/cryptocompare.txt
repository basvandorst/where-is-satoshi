Agree 100% - but that's not the full story - if there is consesnus and media interest that will drive positive price momentum on top of the bots
 - we seem to be getting a lot of comments on our forums  and Social posts coming from the MMM scheme... another factor perhaps
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:16:20
would be interesting to know how much is real and how much isn't....
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:47:57
Bit of fun - but a serious message if true!
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:45:11
There's no way of just posting the link to the video - so had to put our twitter account!

mm = much millions
@_date: 2015-08-09 07:27:31
can't see any reason for the latest btc price drop
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:19:22
agreed - best to support the attempt in principle...
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:49:46
yep - its a stupid move - just means they will lose lots of potential business.... UK, Switzerland, Luxem have open arms for the industry...
and btw if you have used any exchanges could you review them here to help others. 
Good karma and all that!
@_date: 2015-08-09 08:31:09
everything can be explained apart from the female mind...
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:51:17
nice one keep up to date with live prices across all markets here 
@_date: 2015-08-09 08:29:59
that sounds like the best answer
@_date: 2015-08-08 18:04:12
thought it was an interesting comparison...
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:51:40
thinking about moving out of ether - made the same trade... too good to be true at the moment
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:10:55
agree though on issuance model - but what other options did they have.... chicken and egg scenario
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:10:04
fair cop but you have to admit that the idea behind it has a lot of potential and is a positive step forward for the crypto space as a whole... 
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:07:31
about 60 million were issued during the fundraise and 19.8% of the fundraise were issued to pay for pre launch costs and have a war chest for the foundation. See our article here to get to the bottom of it!
@_date: 2015-08-08 18:55:22
alright will do
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:57:10
What should it really be worth?????
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:26:58
or review here
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:04:20
Thought it was quite on target with the hacking of cars recently - giving it new life.
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:52:59
makes local sense
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:05:49
they're using a different coin supply. They are not counting all the coins held by the ether foundation. Also their prices are not live...
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:52:30
would be a very stupid move to VAT Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:26:06
Hi please share you experience here so other people are aware of the issues your having with BitFinex! 
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:24:11
Maybe a bit too technical but hopefully will help!
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:52:40
Sounds like a paper wallet is the best idea 
A paper wallet is simply a bearer certificate so you can hold it in a safe for her! Also what about buying a bitcoin etf through her broker if when it becomes available...?
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:40:57
Happy Birthday Multibit!
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:41:45
might not fit in with what your looking for but here we go....! Check out the markets tabs for breakdowns by currency and exchange...!
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:47:40
fair valid point!!!
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:38:38
Please Come and review your wallets here!

Hi Gary, will update the page to take into account the new features. 
Thanks for the retweet!
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:46:24
Here is a list of Bitcoin prepaid debit cards that you can rank by fees etc and how much you get if you use it to spend 1000 units of the currency
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:25:13
Fair point - trying to get across the fact that miners have a field to change to adjust their hash... 
Hopefully the question is fit for purpose... 
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:29:25
thats a fair point - but still most of the people who sat it are from sources that you would expect to have a fair amount of knowledge. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 21:08:59
great give it a shot and let us know what you think - working on a fix for one of the questions!
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:23:03
Yep coinsetter are ok!
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:20:29
so its the vat exemption? Or China looking more favourable
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:39:29
Yep its a weird one that - want to get across that its a nom de plume! 
Do you reckon take it out?
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:02:04
Good to know CoinKite has a good reputation 
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:51:46
thought she had started putting ...
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:07:00
yep its happening but when will it break the community and grow up...
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:39:38
or could be
@_date: 2015-10-17 21:21:27
updated it should be more clear now - thanks again or pointing it out
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:02:36
check out the stats - easy way  to keep a tab on the social level of bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:13:19
core seem to have won that battle.... 
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:42:05
Level 3?
Bitcoin definitely at level 2 right now.
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:02:25
Yeah - time will tell on that one! Would be great if you could run some of these comments through our site! and give it a review! Would greatly appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:56:00
Agree 0 fees would have been good
think its a good idea to have leverage products separated from the spot exchanges... 
my bet is the institutional money will trickle in over time - order book isn't thick enough yet and they'll want to see the product up and running for while before pushing clients money through it...
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:54:50
This article here explains the maths behind it all... i.e. a curve is picked which basically has 10^77 points on it. 
you can't find out all the points on the curve with present computing power...
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:45:07
haha - "god mode" definitely not working
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:22:32
no its still above average ...!
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:30:07
@_date: 2015-10-17 18:41:43
glad you like it - please share it! Idea is to get people across the board using it and learning - so spreading the word!
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:34:15
ok break that down?
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:57:46
Thanks we'll try and get a more succinct and on target answer in there- obviously the real answer is angela merkel's birth place!
Thanks again
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:37:16
when Blythe masters starts pushing?
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:31:23
no we've run through the metrics and the logic is good. There might be something we're missing - but you'd expect most Bitcointalk users, reddit subscribers to be a fair bit more knowledgeable that basic probability!
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:06:35
The next level!
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:33:41
representative of a Bitcoin community member or a the GP...
Most of the traffic was from this neck of the woods!
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:20:30
Still no trading here! Guess everyone's got to get through the KYC check etc
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:49:51
thats a good idea - i.e. demarcating by time involved! So a newbie quiz - its something we've been thinking of - the difficulty is making it easy... sometimes you cant see the wood for the trees...
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:23:12
true like lighting a smoke before your food comes

Hi guys, if you're in London in June, Andreas will be at our summit as a keynote speaker. He will also be around for a book signing session when you will be able to meet him. Hope to see you there! [
