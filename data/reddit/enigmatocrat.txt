Check out Localbitcoins...there's loads of reputable sellers on there. I use wechat pay for most transactions, but most sellers will complete by bank transfer.
Edit: As an aside, I will assume that you're new to this space as you wrote "BitCoin". Please don't get scammed by trading with people directly on reddit. I'm sure that most people mean well, but even if you start small and slowly build up trust, there is no guarantee that a trading partner won't scam you several months down the line. With a platform like localbitcoins, you can see someone's entire trading history, and there are means of getting your money back if somebody tries to scam you.

I hate to be that guy, but after reading this post....
I can't help but be suspicious that somebody may be fishing for tips

Appreciated :)

I like the analogy. You're right about the valuation. The function of email is to facilitate communication/ the transfer of information, which of course is extremely valuable. But this would be eclipsed by Bitcoin, of which the primary function is the encoding and transfer of monetary value, IF it reaches a similar level of usage
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:15:17
Holding bitcoin is using bitcoin. One of its biggest use cases is as a storage of value, and that doesn't happen if nobody holds it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:31:23
It would be better with standardised charts showing volume in USD, especially for countries like Russia where some of the volume growth can be accounted for by the rouble falling relative to BTC.
Still liking those general trends, though ;)
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:31:40
How did you even begin to explain what it is? Most old folks I know have trouble with computers, and most tech-savvy young people completely misunderstand bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:02:18
I'm not entirely sure of the overheads of these businesses, but it does make sense that they subsidise fees with VC investment. However, decentralised technology will always be more competitive, and therefore cheaper to the end user over the long term.
These centralised middle men will either have to explore other revenue streams when VC funding runs dry and they are forced to operate at a profit, or perhaps they will be replaced entirely by truly decentralised systems e.g decentralised exchanges popping up now.
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:49:29
It's doable. It'd be good to see more bitcoin non-profits as well as all of the commercial enterprises.

The banks in the UK seem to have taken a rather hostile approach towards bitcoin, refusing to acknowledge its existence and effectively blocking bitcoin companies from opening UK bank accounts.
Can anyone who has used Circle in the UK tell me, is this a truly UK service i.e. no international banking fees? I've tried Coinbase's service for purchasing and with international transfer fees, it's cheaper to by on Local Bitcoins.

Other four words optional

Being from the UK I've never participated in Black Friday before, but all this talk of Bitcoin Black Friday has got me excited, and I'll definitely be making a few small purchases.
Bitcoin as a global currency, spreading customs and culture globally, to places it didn't before exist. Interesting...
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:40:51
Interesting. On your first point though I'd say that there will eventually be bitcoin-based consumer credit services, as we've seen already with loans.
Of course, there's a huge amount of work yet to be done and I just think it's amazing to be a part of this so early on. Think of all the innovations yet to come to fruition. That's why I really have no anxiety about whether or not bitcoin will succeed in the long term because, where we are now, the beast is just awakening.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:50:34
All adds to the legitimacy of bitcoin in the general public's mind. The more large chains begin to accept bitcoin (especially bricks and mortar stores), the more real thought and research people will put into it rather than dismissing it as a scam or 'like debit cards, but more effort'.
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:46:29
My first comment and first tip. Very much appreciated :). I'll pay it forward!
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:11:46
I've not seen many advertisements for cash purchases of bitcoin in China. If you have a Chinese bank account, connect it to wechat pay and you can buy via Localbitcoins
As an aside, if you don't have a Chinese account it is relatively trivial to open one, even with a tourist visa. You just need your passport and the address of the hotel you're staying at.
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:24:06
Well that was remarkably balanced. At the end they propose two outcomes: Bitcoin as a disruptive technology that decimates the current finance sector; and then the standard centralised 'block chain technology'. The fact that they even entertain the possibility of the first, and that they are willing to state this overtly, excites me.
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:49:31
Wrong tense.

I really like Cryptopay. I've used them quite a lot recently as I find myself in a slightly precarious situation (living in China and paid in rmb, I have a UK bank account but have lost the card and waiting for a replacement, and currently travelling in another country where Chinese bank cards are not widely accepted).
They have a deposit/withdrawal limit of several thousand $ per day. Their pretty lax KYC/AML is a result of the issuing bank for the card being in Bermuda, if I recall correctly. The virtual card is available instantly. The fees are pretty high, but no more so than similar services. I just use it when I have little other choice i.e. mostly for online purchases that require Visa or MasterCard.
Edit: I should probably link the site ... 
@_date: 2016-02-16 15:04:54
How do they seem themselves dealing with the threat to their business model from widespread adoption of digital currencies? It would be interesting to see if they even take it as a serious threat yet
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:32:24
Yes, unfortunately this does seem like a pretty fair assessment of contemporary Middle Eastern societies
@_date: 2016-02-21 11:49:29
This sounds like it would be as much of a disaster as the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin is an open protocol, and I think that at this stage in its development any such attempt to add legitimacy to companies would do more harm than good. The last thing we want to do is to misrepresent Bitcoin as being a closed system controlled by a central authority who gives its mark of approval to companies.
Maybe a few years down the road, when Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption and there is an established industry, then this would be beneficial.
@_date: 2016-02-15 10:10:07
As it will do more times, I am sure. I think I've got price story fatigue
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:13:54
Yeah, neither does he
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:35:03
Several hundred percent growth would still be a pretty tiny valuation
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:01:34
I wonder when they will 'ban' Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:57:19
He's a one-man hype machine. He has a lot of followers, and they tend to lap up his opinions unquestioningly. Certainly not a bad thing for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-02-13 12:17:05
I'd say the most compelling reason is that 'blockchain technology' is a paradigm shift in finance with wider technological implications. Bitcoin is the current frontrunner (and in my opinion the only real contender) in this space. Align yourself with the way the world is going, before it actually gets there, and you will be a fortunate man indeed.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:28:26
Yeah, truly disruptive technologies are always ridiculous...until they're not. Anybody who isn't taking Bitcoin at least slightly seriously by this stage is pretty shortsighted
@_date: 2016-02-14 07:02:38
Okay, thanks for the feedback. I should probably have been clearer in articulating myself, but I mean that development of the Blockchain is stagnant relative to potential developments of side chains. I know that this is highly speculative, as the code has not even been written yet. It just seems that due to the non-critical nature of side chains ( they are separate from bitcoin and so apolitical, and can be allowed to live and die on merit), their development will be much more fluid.
A range of features from confidential transactions to smart contracts can be implemented as side chains. Features that would never gain consensus, as they are not considered important by a vast majority of users, but that would still offer conceivable economic benefit to some, can be implemented. Iterations can be made much more smoothly. This isn't an attack on the Bitcoin blockchain, rather a speculation of the impact of the increasing complexity of Bitcoin, with the additional layers being built on top.

I know that Karpeles is a slimy bastard and he fucked everyone over. But "widows, orphans and retirees". Really? I don't think it's necessary to argue from such an emotive position. Stealing people's money is wrong regardless of the background of who you steal from

I hate to be that guy, but the plural of medium in this context is media

Banks are people too. Just really fucking rich people.
@_date: 2016-02-12 14:18:47
I'm inclined to agree with you. Even if the number of LN nodes renders it somewhat centralised, bitcoin remains decentralised. It's the protection of the integrity of the bitcoin blockchain that I'm concerned with. If we have another option (LN) that allows us to scale to 1000s of transactions per second, but it amounts to a few large companies running nodes, I have no real issue with that for non-critical transactions. Just as I have no issue if people choose to accept the counterparty risk of storing their bitcoin on exchanges instead of holding their keys themselves.
As long as the bitcoin block chain remains secure, trustless and decentralised, that's really all that matters.
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:19:32
Just reading this on their website would make alarm bells ring (from the FAQ):




Not wanting to "put all our eggs in one basket" is the most ridiculous excuse. They are a company, by definition all of their eggs are in one basket. If they want cash, they can convert some of the bitcoin earned from mining. That your cash is worth more to them than the bitcoin earned from the hashing power you are paying for says it all.

If I was in your situation I would sell as much as I needed to cover my expenses now. Then, I would ensure that I keep an emergency fund that is sufficient so that I don't have to keep selling of my Bitcoin whenever I'm short of money.
Of course, it could rise but there's also a chance of it falling. If it was a matter of not being able to pay rent / afford food then I wouldn't be willing to take that risk.
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:11:15
This guy gets it
@_date: 2016-02-12 14:26:38
Awesome, thanks for the update. As a relatively non-technical bitcoin enthusiast I'm pretty awestruck by the pace of development in this space. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2016-02-13 13:00:49
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:40:13
Ditch the mining, buy bitcoin. Yes, if the price rises you may become profitable, but you'll still be way less profitable and have less bitcoin than if you'd just bought it. It's the only logical approach.
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:48:52
Get an account with a different bank. I live and work in China also and when I first arrived tried to open an account with BoC. They flat out refused. I went to China Everbright bank and they set everything up for me there and then. Make sure you ask directly for online payments because it isn't automatic. You set a daily limit, and it starts immediately.
Now I buy from localbitcoins via Wechat payments :D
