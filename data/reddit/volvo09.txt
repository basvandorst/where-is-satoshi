Not now, but it was there..... It's the severe environment that caused it. You have severe moisture levels hitting that thing, or it was in a severe environment in it's prior life. This miner is like a computer (it is a computer) you don't run computers in wet environments (wet environments rust metal and oxidize the circuit board traces) unless you want it to break. If that rust came from your environment you need to fix that also (not the rust, the environmental factors that caused it).

Excellent tweet there. 
Miners are certainly replaceable and WILL be replaced by new ones if they stop. My only concern with POW is when 1 company has manufactured the vast majority of mining equipment on the network (regardless of who owns it). More hardware diversity (like we are seeing now) and i'm happy, but imagine if a vulnerability was found and exploited in bitmains miners and they were all told to "fight against" the same entity (let's just say btc) without enough non vulnerable miners on the network (non bitmain hardware) the miners essentially do have some sort of control (ddos or manipulation).  Not really on topic, but it's the only thing that has stayed in the back of my head regarding miners these days... I want more hardware diversity, but I still trust POW over premined junk, and don't agree with POS at all.

Sorry man, but I agree with the others that this has nothing to do with bitcoin. Bitcoin is just another medium to ask for it steal. Your situation certainly sucks, but it could -and does- happen with fiat currency alllllll the time. People pay for home renovations or equipment and the contractor is never seen again... or gave false info and the police don't even know who he is..., people frequently wire money to Nigeria thinking a Prince is going to wire them back millions in inheritence, and so on. (i personally know someone who took out a personal loan for 2k USD to wire over to nigeria). Then there's those check scams where they send you a fake check for WAY more than what you wanted for an item for sale and ask you to wire the difference back through western union (and you keep some for your inconvenience), then your bank calls and the check they sent you comes back as fake and you are out thousands.... there's even scammers sending fake medical bills and getting people to pay them, or finding the name of your family member who just left on a trip, sending a panicked email that they need money wired asap for a serious emergency they can't explain.  Scams are EVERYWHERE. Knowledge is your best defense, look for reviews and past complaints (not ones a company provides) and search the internet for the place of you never heard of it. We have a wealth of knowledge at our fingers now.  Sucks that it happened, but when someone else searches this place (hopefully before handing over btc) they'll know to stay away. 
Be careful. People work hard trying to steal your money.

Is this the guy that says he warned the phone company multiple tjmes saying someone is trying to steal his number and "I'm not changing carriers so don't honor anyone who calls in and wants to port this number to anoher carrier" and they STILL allowed a thief to port his number? 
Ignoring his stupid security practices with his crypto that's still really bad on the phone company and something needs to get them to adhere to a higher standard... They hire low paid low skill call center workers so they can keep more money, and your security is in these peoples hands the moment you are targeted. (nothing against the workers, they're just doing their job and aren't experts in social engineering).

I hope they start to colapse and this IPO goes poorly. They raked in revenue while mining on the machines they were supposed to be making and sending to customers, but they waited too long and intrest in acics is down. 
They were in a good position for the bull run because they were just about the only asic miner you could find, but now that there's increased competition in the field I want to see bitmain start to fold. I'm not comfortable with how much hardware they have on these coins networks... Something malicious (wether from them or an outside actor / entity) could be spread across millions of miners and kill a coin's network.

Lesson aside, you were "done investing in bitcoin" when you bought it from coinbase. To be safe you could send that to your own personal bitcoin wallet, but you basically went to the bank (coinbase) and took out cash, and that guy talked you into giving him the money instead of the bank.  
@_date: 2019-03-11 16:46:29
Yeah, it does use more power... This is completely correct.
 
An older CPU under load can use around 100W of power or more. If you have a graphics card then add 100w more... Rough estimates here, but don't be surprised if you find an old gaming rig to be pulling over 300w under full load.

Yeah did you copy and paste that? All I basically said was an opinion that any average electric car is better than a tesla, which is an opinion I hold due to the reason I singled out next - their current repair practices. A big reply like that with a ton of assumptions comes across as a hugely defensive tesla fanboy mad that someone doesn't agree. I honestly do "like" tesla and am thrilled that they've gotten the public into electric cars and proven that with current tech it's absolutely feasible to own and daily drive an electric car. I just don't like how everything is soooo complicated and so electronic.
I'm a car fan, my reason for liking the other electric cars are based mainly on their design. the tesla is a tech lovers dream, so much advanced stuff pretty much everywhere, it'll keep someone occupied for days straight playing around with everything.... but for your average Joe it's pretty darn complicated (at first glance or without help) I could just give a co worker the keys to a "nissan, chevy, or VW" electric car and they could take off with little adjustment, they already know how to adjust the mirrors and seats as there's only a few places that can be if it's not where it's expected. Now If I tossed them the keys to a tesla? And they have to do 95% through a screen? They'd probably be too scared to drive it, and would ask to borrow another car. Not everyone, but you can certainly see where I'm coming from, I work on computers and I'd hop right in and try to figure it out, but I can think of white a few people I know that wouldn't... Tesla has all the physical stuff I looooove, but I wish I could get a repackaged basic one that looks like a ICE car and has a traditional interior, but has no tech / driver assists and has their motors and batterys, and doesn't need excessive dealership attention. For example It would be hard for me to pass up something like an e golf with tesla's bat / motor.
Oh and to contribute to the Ferrari discussion, a tesla is more like a muscle car than a Ferrari. Muscle cars accelerate hard but don't brake and turn as well. A Ferrari is more like a go cart with it's instant neck snapping steering and braking response, and it also accelerates hard and can get to very high speeds. I know what you mean though, both are fast :) but to be technical muscle cars and sports cars handle so much differently. On a track the tesla even looks like a muscle car, pushing through corners with it's weight, but powering out onto the straight. And I bet the tesla would do an effortless muscle car style burn out. I have to look that up now and see if I can find a tesla burnout!

For me the real big question of authenticity came up in the last sentence "we believe everything else is legally questionable and long term not viable" ... large corporations RARELY explain exactly why they don't do something, they keep it short and vague, and usually semi open ended even if it was a firm no. It's all about not singling out a group of people, they are so careful. Putting a reason in there is an invitation to get picked apart by critics or unhappy people for what they consider decision making. 
If they were saying no i think Google would have said something along the lines of "at this time there are no plans to add additional coin symbols, but we look forward to working with the community for any future changes." .   bland corporate speak.... Like not celebrating an obvious touchdown or home run and saying "I look forward to the official ruling on that play!"

I was thinking scam too, just one picture? but it has a custom interior worth mentioning in an ad?... Also why does it need a flywheel? What "performance mods"?  most car people list this stuff in for sale ads. I'm not a classic car guy so I don't know how acurate the price is and if it reflects a scam, but the car does look very straight from afar. It is a 6 cyl so that probably brings the collectability price down because everyone wants the gt (did they have one in 66?) but you can probably understand where I'm coming from. Just seems a bit odd, unless you bought the car as is an just drove it and liked it, but aren't a "grease monkey" turning wrenches and pouring in your soul.

My quick rebuttal is : what about the almost identical crashes in the past? I don't think this year is really any different than say 2014...

I like that the mining operations are heading to a source of renewable energy... That is good. But as a responsibility to the citizens of the country that let them in in the first place, these mining operations should do what is necessary to keep prices from rising on locals, and work with the utility directly on any expansions that are needed. If negative affects like power rate increases have to occur it would make more sense to send them directly to the heavy users rather than the locals who haven't changed. The country could set itself up to prosper from this in other areas like traditional data centers...  It's like their own tech powered oil boom.

Correct, you'll need to forward the port to your computer's ip. Port forwarding is what it's actually called, and in one router (my Verizon issued one?) they called it "advanced gaming setup" or something stupid like that.... But you have to get into your routers config console to edit this (using your browser to open your default gateway address). Here you tell your router what to do with addresses that are usually blocked, or can't be routed automatically.

I'm not sticking up for them but it sounds like they are protecting your account. I'm actually glad that I wouldn't be able to get into your email and reset your coinbase password with no proof of who I am. If you had a few k in there it'd surely suck. Just try to think of the fraud and theft going on in this area... Gaining access to an account shouldn't be a simple thing to do, and providing proof can be inconvenient for the rightful owner - but it makes theft much harder.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:02:03
They won't reveal their identity.... Probably means it's not real (winning the bitcoin, not the game). Game is also probably unbeatable. 
It will gain the attention of people who love difficult puzzles, and people trying to get the "free bitcoin".

Yeah, if anything this is what I want to see happen, and what should already be happening elsewhere. Mining operations should negotiate their own rates directly with utilities and municipalities, so their load doesnt to not impact locals and their service / rates.

Glad to see people are being smart out there. Years ago all too many would have just run and downloaded things.
I'm a bit uneasy about the web and financial stuff, the things you can do, and the things that can be hidden are pretty powerful these days... 
I am going to setup an entirely separate laptop to use for finance only. No web browsing, just accessing services via link or direct url. With even advertisements getting served up with hidden viruses it's just too scary.

I have no idea how shorts work.... If it started falling again tomorrow would a short still be valid? Doesn't it have to have some sort of "end date"? Because this is no guarantee of a trend reversal, or does that not matter? I'm going to look it up again, but I already have last time we had a $1000 candle. Yes you can call me a n00b.

I think you'd have way more luck if you went to a site dedicated to enthusiasts of the game.  I don't game, but I think something like that has a really limited appeal, best to go "straight to the source".  Like selling a custom part to a car, you'll have the best luck selling it to people who own that car.
Best of luck to you and your family.

So lame... If you aren't being a complete dickhead constantly spewing violent rhetoric then they have no reason to be policing what people are saying. The reason I fell in love with the internet was due to it's uncensored nature, and sites like Facebook are going to kill themselves with that (good thing Reddit won't ban me for saying kill...) I'm happy in ever caved in and re signed up for Facebook after having an account for roughly 2 months around the time when it opened to all. Twatter is doing the same thing..... Repost someone's tweet and YOU get the suspension! Amazing.

I am always quite skeptical when there are grammar errors on a "serious page". It can be expected on a product or service where tranalation to English is used, but on a product such as this I would stop when I saw those mistakes.

Doesn't make sense.... So as a rich individual with 500k+ bitcoin I'm supposed to be calling up my other friend with 500k or more bitcoin and convincing him to keep selling to keep the price low? We will eventually run out, and need to buy more - driving up the price. I'm sure there are games being played for profits, but I do not believe rich people (quit saying that large aquatic mammal) are all in cahoots to keep the price down.

Seeing that is like when you are walking down a trail or a pond and come across 45 smashed beer bottles and 60 beer cans all strewn around a trash filled fire pit. I believe you didn't do it because the paint is aging, but locals (and everyone else) don't know what it means and see it as your average disrespectful vandalism. Stuff like this is what gets the good people kicked out of areas....

@_date: 2018-04-25 13:05:59
Yeah... misleading. Not a scam because it's a real coin, but when someone wants to buy bitcoin they "want the one on the news", not to buy into some lame argument over scalability. I went to bitcoin.com when I was new, but pretty quickly realized it was bitcoin.org because I knew the symbol of BTC already from years past.  Even without knowing that the page raises other red flags as you go through it.
This is a tough one for me because I don't like ver, but I also don't think we should be so concerned with the ever mentioned "naive new user". Everyone has an obligation to their own finances to do their research and select what seems safe... If they throw their money at the first "buy bitcoin" page they visit they have much worse things to worry about than buying a fairly stable altcoin instead of BTC. These people will also end up with more computer viruses and malware, falling prey to phishing scams by not checking web / email addresses before paying for items and the list goes on forever. As much as I don't like the bcash crew, people have to be responsible for their actions. I read an article that more than 75% of financial transactions through Nigeria are fraudulent in nature.. Nigeria!! the place where they pump out "money flip" scams, "Nigerian Prince" emails, and "your power is being cut" cold calls..  Not sophisticated bank attacks, just simple "idiot fishing" adventures that are landing them huge stats like that. People NEED to be smarter!

Miners will still get transaction fees once rewards are gone. If btc is still around then and is in wide use mining will self regulate to the point where fee income is a little greater than power usage... Only time would tell where the power comes from

Besides the fact that he's so obviously reading off a cue card, his voice and mannerisms make it seem like someone is holding a gun to his head (or are ready to not pay him millions). If my mother/family disappeared and a video of her saying something like "we are doing very good, my captors are taking excellent care of me and we are in a nice location" in the same way he's reading off that card I'd KNOW they were in big trouble. That video is super creepy, it gives me scary visions of Isis kidnapping videos.

So they shill bch and trick newbies off the street into buying their first "bitcoins" at bitcoin.com - which will get them bcash.... Which I guess is ok if they take real bitcoin, and explain "the bitcoin you are buying isn't the one you keep hearing about". 
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:46:00
As long as you never told anyone you had it... But that's kind of a silly point... Gold is physical bitcoin is virtual,ok, but you still have to store your keys on something. Unless you are trusting a web service to save them you will still have physical copies somewhere. Or copies on physical devices that said millitary groups would take / destroy. If someone was ripping my mothers fingernails off in front of me I'd have a hard time not turning over my keys. There's nasty stuff out there, I don't think most people take a second to think deeper when talking about funds safety... they just assume it's safer becauser because at it's "core"  it isn't physical... Which is only part.

Yep, kids will brag. "My dad has this...." silly story, but when I was 16 this kid I knew a bit and would see occasionally would always brag about his dad's cherished corvette, but never let anyone see it because his dad would kick his assssssssssd if it got damaged. He kept bragging about it and how rare and nice it was, and letting people know it was locked up and you couldn't get it when they'd ask (in a barn! Not very tough to get into!) I really expected it to get stolen. I felt bad for his dad because you could tell he loved the car and protected it the best he could, but here his son was telling strangers about it ALL the time. 90's gm vehicles weren't hard to steal. For all I know it probably didn't even exist! Haha

Hobby level folks are already doing this. Mining 24/7 requires a large battery bank to run the night if you have any sort of decent load (don't even think about a 1kw miner! and a massive array of solar panels to continue mining and charge the batteries. The tesla powerwall wouldn't be big enough to do a whole lot, or would be hellishly expensive to link enough up to begin thinking about 24/7 mining.
Making a diy power wall to help offset mining power is in my list of plans though :) I already have a few k worth of batteries.
