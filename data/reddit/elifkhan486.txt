 Of a true most governments have cracked down on the system due to its volatility and prone to scams, many more are simply stopping it's activities to follow the bandwagon,but don't you think any government who sees the bitcoin as a threat would simply just stop all activities within its shores? ,but bitcoin is acceptable in more and more countries and stores daily..

 Yeah, I think so.

 So far no government seems to be adopting bitcoin or any other coin, and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. It looks like your story has some flaws and inconsistencies which need to be addressed. I know that it may sound a bit harsh on avid ears but it appears that New World Order conspiracy theorists found a new toy, now this is bitcoin. Yeah, bitcoin was conceived specifically to set up a one-world government and currency, and it turns out that the only way to do that is create a money system based on bitcoin which all countries are slowly adopting. And how did we manage to live without bitcoin before?

 As far as I know the price of mining of one bitcoin is 3100$ without cost of miners, so there is no way that price will drop below this level. It is only one point also we should consider the game makers who also will not allow to drop the price.
