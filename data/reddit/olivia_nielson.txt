Everyone sees a cryptocurrency from different sides. For example, you can buy Bitcoin for $ 500 now and sell it for $ 10,000 tomorrow. Why can't this be considered an investment?
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:57:30
The cryptocurrency is still so unexplored that there are many misunderstandings about this issue.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:35:53
I think that the price of Bitcoin will be $15,000. It is possible that governments will find a way to hit Bitcoin by 2020 and they will stabilize its price at this level.

I don't understand what you try to tell me. I know my opinion, however, I am interested in the opinions of other people. Do you see something bad in that?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:12:50
Are you sure? Every second friend of mine invests in Bitcoin, so I think that it has already found its clients. Maybe there is some other problem?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:47:06
Yeah, I agree with you. Will Bitcoin be profitable for a long time? What do you think?
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:01:45
I think that using Bitcoin as a means of paying for the needs of a small business does not make sense now.

Give this title a bit of time and soon we will hear it from everywhere.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:39:02
Ahahahahah..the author thinks that Bitcoin is able to do this.
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:42:55
In fact, your words make sense, because such emoji would further increase the popularity of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:33:21
Actually, that souns unreal but I want to see what will happen next .
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:42:29
I think it's just the beginning.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:15:51
Good point but I think we need to have much more time to examine your theory.
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:04:06
Ahahaha..you are right! I think that such people have a very special thinking.
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:12:07
Ahahahah! I agree with you. It really deserves our attention!
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:09:56
However, if you continue to buy, then the chance for raising of price will increase significantly.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:32:55
No, because they are trying to make a drama.

This is in fact a very difficult question for which it is difficult to find an answer. On the one hand, global banking didn't find a way to control Bitcoin but also, from another hand, cryptocurrency doesn't interfere with the proper operation of banks.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:08:40
Why do you visit similar forums?
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:03:58
What do you think it's better to buy a fraction or a whole Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:38:22
Do not you trust the cryptocurrency at all?
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:23:23
I'm not surprised. That should have been expected.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:04:16
However, the less Bitcoin you buy, then the smaller your profit will be. Am I right?
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:41:49
Actually, thank you for your answer and I have the same barrier to entry to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:44:54
Thanks to these titles, Bitcoin began to lose its price
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:43:05
This is a good way to wait when the crisis of Bitcoin will end!
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:31:37
But everything will change soon!
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:51:21
Such videos are made for attracting attention and increasing earnings.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:55:23
Are there people who stiil thought that Bitcoin is a scam?
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:41:27
Perhaps someone knows which countries are following in the ranking on the popularity of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:13:04
Do I just believe the decline is temporary?
