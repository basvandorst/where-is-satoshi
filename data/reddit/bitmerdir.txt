Tallycoin is entirely non-custodial. Funds raised go directly to your own wallet. It doesn’t get any more peer to peer than that.
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:18:23
Tallycoin does have Lightning integration ��

No, your claim was that this site somehow detracts from the p2p nature of bitcoin.
It does not.
What you are now describing is unrelated to bitcoin in any way. 
You seem to be confusing “using bitcoin” with “using the internet”.
Also I’m not sure what ‘data’ you are talking about needing to give, beyond log in details and a bitcoin address.
There is also a widget so you can integrate a tip button directly into your own website as well, so your assertion about switching back and forth between websites is also wrong.
If you don’t like the website, no dramas. Your criticisms so far are invalid though IMO.

Exchanges are for buying too ;)

If you do ANYTHING on the internet you are connecting in some way through a middleman third party.
Are you advocating that the only acceptable way to deal with people is face to face, in person and holding their hand as they type out a private key letter for letter?
This website helps people implement different methods of monetisation WITHOUT touching the funds. That’s something of value to people whether you agree or not.
I see the point you think you’re making, but honestly you’re dying on the wrong hill.
And no I’m not affiliated in any way with that website, just perplexed at your reasoning.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:47:35
Again, Tallycoin is NON-CUSTODIAL. There is no middle man third party involved in the transactions. You own the addresses, you own the keys.
I don’t know what part you aren’t getting about this.
@_date: 2019-06-10 01:47:03
Please explain?

“Missing the entire point of a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency...”.

BTC for onchain payments. Sats for Lightning payments.
@_date: 2019-04-19 12:15:01
LND is not the user facing interface. The things they are doing will help make the LN more reliable and secure overall though.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:52:21
[BTCPay Server](  are great too! I think they appeal to different markets though. BTCPay requires you to take more responsibility for yourself. That’s not gonna be for everyone.

Adoption comes on many fronts. Third party payment providers like this are one of many necessary services to increase utility for bitcoin users.
Obviously merchants accepting bitcoin directly is ideal, but realistically it will never go from “nobody accepting bitcoin” to “everyone accepts in the perfect manner” just like that. It will be a gradual process.
@_date: 2019-04-19 12:12:30
LND is is one of several Lightning implementations. It is making great progress. Good for bitcoin. 
I don’t understand your point.
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:39:02
Yes, which is why they recommend only keeping smaller "spending" amounts in them, which is how the LN is designed to function IMO. 
Any larger bitcoin savings amounts should be kept in cold storage, not in any LN wallet- custodial or otherwise. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:21:43
Best evidence there is so far ��
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:40:05
The idea is for ALL bitcoin to be “tainted” by being coinjoined at some point. 
At the moment 4% of all Bitcoin transactions are coinjoin transactions which is a pretty good start down that path.
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:37:24
Basically yes. Any bitcoin can be substituted with any other bitcoin and be treated exactly the same.
At the moment with chain analysis some companies are refusing to accept bitcoin if it looks like the bitcoin might have been used in a manner they don’t agree with in the past.
If you obfuscate a coins history then it can be treated as a bitcoin and have no stigma attached to it. It is the same as any other bitcoin.

I have also bought things with bitcoin at a couple of different BIC Camera stores in Tokyo. 
Very simple, some staff were more familiar with it than others.
@_date: 2019-05-28 08:35:21
Also, the Bitcoin.com wallet is just a fork of the Copay wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:18:05
More users means a higher anonymity set in a mixing round. Think about the difference in overall privacy between mixing 3 inputs, and mixing 100 inputs.
FYI I’m not affiliated with the project. 
The “crypto links” Ive “spammed” are articles I’ve personally written about bitcoin subjects I find interesting and would like to stimulate discussion about.
Sorry about the one month old account if it offends you ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:21:33
Yes it is a custodial wallet.
