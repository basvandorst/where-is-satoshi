Good I need it to go down more so I can buy more while it's still cheap lol. Ppl don't think years ahead but when Bitcoin goes to the $1000s+ it's over. Everyone will want some coins by then.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:09:00
Cheap relative to the price it will be in a few years. I am perfectly ok with hodling until the next halving.

Double tap your home button, then when the slides appear swipe your finger up on the JAXX wallet to delete it(this completely closes an app). Then reopen the JAXX app and it will work.

Is this the next Magic the gathering/Pokemon/yu-gi-oh type trading card game? 
If so I'm in! I grew up playing those.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:09:17
I have to tell you guys just how amazing your JAXX wallet is. I haven't seen such passion and love put into something as I have with your team at JAXX. You truly are paving the way for mass crypto adoption. I've wanted to get into Dash for example for so long but it was too complicated to find a wallet and whatnot. You guys solved that problem so masterfully. Keep doing what you're doing you guys are the best and the gold standard for what a company should offer to its customers. Thank you thank you!!

It took Pokemon 20 years to go mainstream. 
It took the Internet about 15 years. 
I can see Bitcoin doing it in 10 years.
2019-2020, right before the next halvening. Once that happens the price will truly go to the moon ($10,000+).
Mainstream is when your grandma knows what you're talking about and she doesn't get out much lol.
@_date: 2016-08-20 06:31:25
Interesting I haven't heard of that issue before but I believe you. It would suck if that happened. Will be more careful.

NK positioning themselves as a leader in the new global digital economy. The rest of the world needs to hurry before they get left behind. This is the beginning of a global arms race to stockpile digital currencies for more power. $1+ million BTC?!? If it ever happens, it’ll be because of this.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:36:32
Trying to to get to at least 21 btcs one day. That way I will always know that I have 1 millionth of all the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist. When billions are using Bitcoin a millionth will be a huge percentage! See you guys at the moon soon.. Don't forget your tanning lotion.

I’d like to know as well. I wonder if Gemini exchange is still good or is it going down the same path as Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:50:00
Time to buy more
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:19:55
This is the perfect dip to get more before the halvening.
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:16:08
Same here ZeroBlock news feed won't work looking for an alternative as well 
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:02:54
Doesn't work for me either. Sucks because it was actually a useful app.
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:52:55
One last leg up before the drop down.

Yea not yet. Once there is a way for us to use Bitcoin at anywhere (that day is coming) it will be a different story. Citi will go bankrupt.

This is how wars will be created.

Where can I buy one of these physical Bitcoins??
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:05:57
Couldn't agree more my friend. We are so blessed to be able to experience all of this change within our lifetimes.

Through the media. They can paint a bad picture and scare most people away from being affiliated with cryptocurrencies. Will this happen? Hopefully and probably not. Just my opinion of course.
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:20:08
Lol I gots the Bitcoin (scratching neck)
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:57:19
You have a good point! It will be very interesting to see where things will go but I'm feeling good about it.
@_date: 2016-07-05 12:45:27
Lmao that's a good one.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:25:34
It's tougher to predict with Bitcoin since it is so volatile. I'd say that if you feel fear when selling you will probably regret it later on but if you feel good about your decision then you will be ok. It will go up with this halving and will fall down again that's a given. Maybe right before the halving people will start taking profits or right after, we will see.
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:45:35
It is about to experience a dip or price correction for after the halvening when all the speculators begin leaving. Then it will bottom to the 500s before the next major rally which is the rally everyone has been expecting from the halvening.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:32:12
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:36:33
I would just use the profits to reinvest in Bitcoin again once it drops a bit. The goal is to not have to work for your money but let the money work for you, in this case Bitcoin (and Ethereum).
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:06:30
Do you guys ever wonder if the people that work at Coinbase know just how bad their service is?!
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:29:31
I think selling maybe only half my coins for profits and holding the other half just in case I sold too early. Usually wouldn't go for profits since I'm a hodler but I feel like this will be a good opportunity.
@_date: 2016-07-10 20:25:14
I think if the elites start to truly see Bitcoin as a threat they may create a scene where someone kills a lot of people using guns he purchased with bitcoins. That could give Bitcoin a really bad rep.
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:15:48
Lmao thanks for pointing that out
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:10:50
I've been going into cryptocurrencies hard as of late. Here's a tip for you guys. I have bitcoins that I've invested in of course but lately I started trading for other cryptocurrencies like ether. I would follow the market 24/7 and trade bitcoins for ether and the other way around. Once you get the patterns down you'll start making pretty much free coins. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:11:55
Great article helped expand my view of things!

Demand is picking up(people are finding out about it) and new supply of coins getting pumped into circulation is getting lowered. It might not happen overnight but as a trader these are very bullish signs that Bitcoin will have another big run up soon. If you truly believe in Bitcoin it won't really matter you will hodl until the day comes where you can use your bitcoins the same as cash.
