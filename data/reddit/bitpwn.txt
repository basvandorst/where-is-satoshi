Touché however if these startups end up becoming the Apple &amp; Google of Bitcoin it will be no better than a fiat banking system.

No Bueno,
I need to consider moving my coins to an offline app. This type of thing is what scares me about server based wallets

I have been using the beta and it is fantastic. I was literally about to create something just like this when I saw an article for Lawnmower's beta. I tested it and they did it better than I would have thought by partnering with major US banks and Coinbase. I believe you should change your mission statement or add to the description... The TRUE BEAUTY of this application is that it will help everyday people to acquire their first bitcoin in a short period of time. For anybody who is interested in testing the waters of bitcoin, this is a great way to get started. The only drawback, however, is Coinbase takes a few days to transact which could have a drastic change on the cash value of your bitcoin you receive in the end. Something hopefully Coinbase will improve over time, as this is not the developers fault, nor do they have any control, but it is a real pain in the ass to have to wait in the days of instant gratification.

The guy probably didn't know how to operate the miners based on reading the article. What's more concerning is the sting operation related to the miners. I am curious to know more about why the operation itself was going on. That's kind of sketchy...

when importing a paper wallet you want to import the ENTIRE balance of that paper wallet and you will have no issues. You would get screwed if you tried to deposit .5 BTC from a paper wallet that contains 1 BTC. In that scenario don't expect there to be a remaining .5 BTC in your paper wallet. I hope that makes some sense and helps you out. the concept of paper wallets can be quite confusing in the beginning. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:46:12
usually I receive a confirmation win or lose within 10-15 minutes, however sometimes (probably depending on the amount of people playing at a given moment) it will take an hour or two for the bets to confirm and receive winnings. When this happens I can sometimes place another bet and they will both go through. Just my personal experience with Satoshi Dice. 
good luck! hope you win!! :-)

I do hate this, but if you look at regular newspapers that you pay for, they are filled with advertisements. Also most digital newspapers have a few ads here and there too. I don't mind it that much, but I think with digital subscriptions being the price they are there should be no advertisements. I am speaking mainly about newspaper applications in my experience with iOS on Apple devices. OP was a little vague, but not a problem!

I love this podcast! I love how there are always new episodes with recent and relevant topics. I always listen to it on my commute to work. 
Can anyone recommend some other podcasts that are as current and up to date as Let's Talk Bitcoin? Specifically podcasts/shows that are available for download via iTunes.
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:42:36
up voted for an answer! I too would be curious of any decent priced printing companies in the US that accept BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 14:11:19
this is what I do. I usually put larger amounts on paper and use them as Watch Only on blockchain.info until I am ready to spend or cash out. This seems to be the easiest and safest way I have used to manage my coins so far. I also am a newcomer to BTC and have been playing around with coins for only a few months. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:26:06
Anybody know why Gyft is only offering a select few gift cards for purchase? The app has way more to offer, but you can only use BTC via the mobile website :-/. hopefully with time we will see more gift cards.

I use my local connect which Ioathe doing... to be quite honest SR doesn't go down that often, only these past few days... If i were to try another site I would try BMR before Atlantis only because it has been around longer. I would just be very very careful and do much more research than I would do using SR. If you can I would try to be patient for a couple of days. DPR should have this settled soon! Whatever you end up doing is ultimately your choice just be safe and be smart!

I could not agree more! He is trying to come across as an actor (a very bad one) with his outrageously flamboient characteristics, when this is supposed to be a documentary. I sure as hell hope he doesn't try to act his way through this $70,000 "documentary".

most people will agree they hate paying taxes, but they are a necessary evil. Worldwide tax would be a very difficult thing to establish. I think it would have to be declared by the country of origin or the destination. Some have suggested a tax system where we would choose where are taxed income would be spent. While this sounds like a great idea, it would probably not accomplish much. I think people would end up outing their taxes into schools and medicine and neglect the military and other important and necessary parts of a stable society. I am going to stop here before I say too much because I can see how this can become a very heated debate lol. 
PS There is another sub that covers this and has near 1,000 comments. you may want to look there as well. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:23:17
up vote for Coinbase as a cashout option. definitely has lowest fees I've seen and goes right into bank account. less anonymous, but that shouldn't matter for the majority of people using BTC

are there any Mutual Funds or CDs that one could put their BTC in to diversify and also have less risk of investment? This would be a great idea for those, like me, who are new to BTC stocks. I do however have a lot of money in real stocks (Wall Street) but the companies I invested in are not likely to disappear overnight. The BTC stocks are a much higher risk as far as I can tell
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:42:42
this would be great. I use blockchain.info it would be awesome if you there was an option where you could chat with people who are only in your address book to avoid spam. It would definitely be a good idea, however the only con is some people change addresses quite often to track transactions easier or to try to better protect their anonymity. I also worry about exploits that could be found through a chat system which could make your coins vulnerable to a hack/attack. 
All in all if it was done right it could be an awesome addition to the Bitcoin network and help with transactions in many ways. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:54:31
I find it addicting lol. I find myself spending 5-10% of my paycheck each week now at CVS as I watch the price and wait for stable points to buy in. The fees are ridiculous, but I usually receive the funds on my drive home from CVS (within 10-15 mins) with the one or two exceptions where BitInstant had issues and it took several hours and the worst case several days to receive my coin. Lucky for me each time that happened they were both small amounts of cash. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:23:22
I also use CVS as I don't have a Walmart in town. The process at Walmart is slightly different. From what I have read you go to the customer service area and ask for the blue money gram form and tell them you are paying a bill. you basically fill in the information on the paper hand it back to the customer service person and they collect your funds and give you a reference number. 
Again, I have never personally went to Walmart to use bit instant. They don't have the red phone like CVS so the process is just slightly different. all this is based on other people's experiences on this sub. If for some reason I am wrong or am missing details please reply to this with the correct process. 
best of luck!!

yeah.  I'll prob get down voted but my friends cousin made this app. he told everyone at work because it was free when she first released it. It's a great app security wise I just wish more people would use it
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:56:00
upvoted this! It is totally a communal failure. There are tons of stirrups and people hoping to cash out on BTC because it is such a new idea. If some or all of these people worked together and there was more collaboration widespread adoption would not be an issue and in turn ease of use would be better. I think with time bitcoin will become easier to use for the beginners. Right now it's like the Internet in its early years, people don't know what to make of it.
