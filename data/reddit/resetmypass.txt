But let’s say you do have money on both exchanges — you would just buy in one and sell in the other.  Then wait and make transfers later right?
If I’m an institutional buyer/seller with millions in each exchange, then this would be even easier to do, right?

Do you think that bitcoin prices are not influenceable by large central banks or private firms that can buy and sell in much larger quantities?

Haha, just trying to break your balls.  I’ve certainly made worse brain farts

Exactly, no one wants to spend because of the wild growth.  How is this a currency?

Got it!  Thanks for clarifying

Did you read your own sentence?  “They were not used to scare birds...they were designed to scare wildlife ie birds”

What if you just have money in both exchanges?  Do the trade immediately, transfer profits later?
Let’s say I️ have 10 million in each, I️ can then easily trade right away and go back and forth when I️ need to.  Once the big fish get into the markets, this should go away, right?

Also, with no customer service for BtC, if we do have mass adoption, won’t we lose a bunch of bitcoin to idiots that just forget their password? (Key)

i don't really see the difference between the two.
If you make $1000 a month and invest $100 of that over 10 months, how is it different than starting with $1000 and then invest $100 each month over 10 months?

Thanks for the detailed reply.
However, I was replying to your comment that DCA is investing a portion of a lump sum payment and that you were saying spending a portion of your paycheck is just investing.  I don't see the difference between the two.  That is, if you have a lump sum and spend a little bit of it vs you only have a little and do it every month.  The end result is the same -- in my example, in both scenarios, you put in $100 per month.
