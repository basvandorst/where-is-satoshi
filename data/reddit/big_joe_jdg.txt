You dont get taxed if you invest in the spirit of a "good household".
You get taxed 33% if you invest alot, trade alot or "gamble"
The difference? A good fiscal lawyer if they ever ask questions

Please help, dear community

Game.com? Not Bitcoin but cryptocurrency as you suggested.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:45:02
No idea about that. Possible in the future maybe? In reality, you will be fine withdrawing your crypto. Banks will ask questions but you can find solutions to that.

Sorry but Bittrex charges automaticly? Cant change the fees.
What info do you need? The IDs?

So when I use a Trezor, and my computer IS compromised while doing so, they can never see the private key and seed? And only I can see the private key and seed directly on the device?
Also, with my private key and seed, i can use whatever other program or exchange to withdraw them?

So in my own words.
Scan the paper wallets private key to coinbase for bitcoins, so they are on that exchange.
Then scan the same paper wallets private key to another exchange that deals In bch.
I can then sell the bch on that exchange and move the Bitcoins on coinbase to a new paper wallet.
Is this correct? What is a good exchange for bch?

Thanks alot! But sadly I do not own an android machine. So i need to find another bch wallet.
And would it work if i first move my bitcoin to safety location like coinbase? First moving the bch seems more risky.

Most people here do not buy low and sell high I think, they buy and hodl (still dont know why hodl is hold)
They dont use it as often because fees.
If fees drop, it is smart to buy all kinds of stuff with bitcoin because if the price drops, it equals inflation. If it stays, you lose nothing but still screw the banks. If it gains, you can buy more. 
The more people will start paying with btc, the more business, the higher the price will become. So untill fees drop, hodling makes the most sense.
It might be a bubble, thats why u only buy what you can lose. Live well, safe some fiat, buy stocks, diversify, save for your future and your kids', and buy what you can lose for all the same reasons. Dont put everything in crypto.
If your not a early crypto informed person, it is still only the second year it is gaining recognision. So it still needs to be adopted widely. Give it some time to develop! Changes will come.
Just some thoughts from a new crypto buyer, so I might be wrong and uneducated. And pardon my English mistakes but it's only my third used language.

For my paper wallets I use a website that lets you download itself and then generate the wallet offline. I think its bitadress or something?

Epic :p thnx
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:58:45
Cheers mate! Will read and use that.

I'm not saying now is a good time to buy, but making more bad decisions based on previous bad decisions seems like a bad plan. If you believe in the system, buy some?
I regret buying for 750EUR at 6500EUR 2 days ago, but maybe I wont regret in the future? I hold on to them.

To me it is double because forks are never good, but the spike i think was caused by money that wanted free coins. So big correction incoming? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:08:11
Electrum is pretty safe, until you get a keylogger and you lose every last bit you had in there.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:48
Nice, very simple but effective. But there is not written when the next adjustment will be?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:01:53
The point is you control your own private keys with the seed word.
And you can use different passphrases for extra security.
Also you are protected from malware and keyloggers thanks to the on screen PIN.
That's all it does, yes, it is a safe for your cryptocoins.

I'm sorry. But is Seg2x officialy called of? So no fork is going to happen? Or is it postponed?

What is wrong with people? You get a spam e-mail promising you all sorts of things, and you plan on using it? Thats how you lose everything. Ofcourse it's a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:52:27
Ah I see, i tought you were out completely because of grudges. You did the right thing man, took a profit, reinvested, and up again! Noone ever lost any money by taking a profit
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:05:25
My opinion is that alot of people bought extra bitcoin for the fork, because free coins. And after the news that its called of now they are withdrawing some, also returning to the alts that got sold for the same reason. It explains the drop, and rise in alts like Ethereum.
Nothing to worry about, there are beautiful upgrades coming to bitcoin, it's getting alot of attention in mainstream media, market will decide the right price for now.
You can decide what to do with tour money, no one knows for sure.
