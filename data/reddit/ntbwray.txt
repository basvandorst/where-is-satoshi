real estate prices are a result of low interest rates. You can thank the fed.

 Asset bubbles are blown by monetary easing. Asset bubbles pop due to tightening of monetary policy. Bitcoin will be established as the ultimate store of value during the next recession.

You are completely correct. given the supply/demand relationship of bitcoin it remains king as a "store of value". The coin that prevails as the best "transacting medium" will have inflation, and likely use POS or some derivative of POS for consensus.

yup, look at how much short interest BTC has. When it is at its upper range its generally a good time to buy BTC, you will likely catch a squeeze.

"bubbles" don't apply to currencies. As far i'm concerned bubbles apply to assets. Asset bubbles are created by central banks through easy monetary policy. Bubbles pop due to tightening of monetary policy. 
On the other hand, bitcoin price is currently highly speculative and emotionally driven which creates massive volatility. This will change when demand for bitcoin is driven by the utility it provides rather than being a vehicle for speculation. We got a long way to go. Patience will be rewarded.

Their was significant triggers this cycle. The majority of the BTC run-up in 2015-2017 was due to explosive growth in the altcoin market. Altcoins intrigued many retail investors to get into the market.  Altcoins indirectly created demand for BTC. The inverse is true why we have been dumping so hard. It is mainly the dumping of altcoin positions for fiat. BTC happens to be the gateway.

the cost to mine tends to gravitate towards the price over time.

Id be happy to pick up more BTC if we drop low enough.... time will tell :P
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:28:17
I will consider accumulating more if we break much lower... Long-term there is nothing to be worried about.

Your story doesn't add up. If you made half as much in these 3 months as you did in oct-dec, you are doing exceptionally well. However, if your not working with a 7+ digit number i think you jumped the gun on switching to crypto full time. This is a long game -  be patient, with time you will be rewarded.

It is volatile because it is in its infancy, there is a lot of room to grow both price and tech wise. If BTC makes it as the main decentralized global currency, we will see price stability. I don't expect this to happen for many many years. Think long-term.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:43:48
Mainly hocus pocus.... Wait till BTC is out of favor and sentiment shifts to extreme pessimism. Best time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:56:34
Understand that the bitcoin network is under constant development. Upgrades take a long time in decentralized networks. With time, BTC will make it as an instant payment solution.

He doesn't appear to know what hes talking about, or have any valid points. His view on BTC doesn't matter, and his reasoning behind his bearish stance has no substance to it. Moving on.....

Housing prices got exuberant due to easy credit. Monetary tightening ultimately took the prices back down. Believe it or not, Bitcoins best friend is central banks. In the current environment, central banks have manipulated nearly all assets to astronomical highs. Buying bitcoin is a reasonable bet to hedge the devaluation of fiat currencies.

Most robust infrastructure, most liquidity, most credible monetary policy (the most important factor), fair distribution (no ICO), No single entity or group that controls it, most secure POW chain, and the lindy effect.

not much different than the market cap of stocks... However, the stock market is much more efficient.

It is possible to only sell for a profit... If it goes down you can ride it down to zero.. haha

bitcoin may go to 10 bux or 10 mill. Hows that for a prediction?
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:18:20
allocating more of your capital to alts vs. BTC brings on more risk.... Sure you may make more money, but you will lose ALOT more on downside.

A bitcoin ETF doesn't take anything away from bitcoin... It adds liquidity, and will drive demand for BTC. Ultimately we need BTC to be highly liquid and capture a massive market cap for the price to stabilize (will happen at MUCH higher levels). ETF is a good thing, not bad. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:19:16
I agree it is a good time to begin buying on a monthly basis if you don't have enough weight in BTC.

p2p lending options will exist eventually.

a pure BTC loan is not viable. The loan ammount would be pegged to a fiat value. However, a deflationary system can work just fine. It is human nature to spend at the upper range of your means. That will not change. With an inflationary currency, buying appreciating assets (stocks,bonds,commodities) gives you a similar result to hoarding a deflationary currency. Neither is a driver of productivity growth. Recessions/depressions in the current system Will continue to be caused by tightening of monetary policy. Crisis = ease credit -&gt; assets boom -&gt; inflation kicks in -&gt; tightening of policy to combat inflation -&gt; debt implodes somewhere -&gt; nearly all assets drop in value. Rinse and repeat.

During the next recession i wouldn't be surprised if cryptos are the best performing asset class.
We will most likely see a number of rate hikes before a bear market begins in equity markets. Once the time comes we will see central banks ease policy like never before - devaluing all currencies in the process. 
The purchasing power of all fiat currency diminishes over time due to central bank intervention... Bitcoin has been designed to do the opposite.... During the next financial crisis i expect massive inflows into the crypto space. Wouldn't be surprised to see the market cap of crypto break 1 trillion USD.
