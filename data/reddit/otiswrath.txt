There is a fine line between censorship and quality control. I think there can be subs with almost 0 regulation, ie. r/wtf but then others like r/science that are heavily regulated. 
I think intent matters here. Roger Ver wants this to better conflate bitcash and Bitcoin, so fuck him.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:40:10
Of fucking course there is. Sigh...he is such a twat.

This will be remembered as the day when Bitcoin took one of it's largest hits as well as the day that it truly got on it's feet.

They had an opportunity to buy the rights to the telephone back in the day and they didn't think any thing would come of it so the passed. Mr. Bell went on to run his own lines and start the telephone system a we now know it. They then spent the next 30 years trying to buy it. You think they would at least learn from their own history.

I think that with any luck we will have moved on from "currencies" by then. Think Star Trek.

That is sweet. I would actually like to see/hear more about your tractor with the PV panel on it. Does that power it?

I fucking love these bots. The Wikipedia one is amazingly fast and useful.

Oh man. I fucking love Jesse. I have been jamming out to his playlist for weeks.

That is great but holy hell you ever been in the place? It smells like a teenage boy's gym clothes that haven't been washed in a month. Don't get me wrong I like doing yoga and even all the shit having to do with the "founder" of Bikram I was still interested in doing some hot yoga but that smell just made me turn right around. Good folks though. Just not for me.

I dig the commitment and it doesn't sound like the worst idea. Personally I would suggest maybe going 90% in and just have 10% of your assets in a bank account. If we go to the moon you won't miss it but when you get back home you would probably appreciate being able to get a new set of clothes for that job interview, a new laptop to write that resume, or get a used car to get to interviews. 
Just my 2 cents.

I think get what you are saying but doesn't it seem like he is trying to establish provenance of ownership presumably so he can later monetize that ownership?


I guess that really is the question. I guess the idea and therefore IP of Bitcoin. Perhaps to make claim to blockchain technology that every bank in the world will soon be using.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:50:50
Move one Satoshi from the wallets we all know are real Craig. Do it.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:02:57
Congrats. I am always stoked to see people use Bitcoin to purchase tangible things that make them happy.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:25:52
He is trying to secure rights to something that doesn't belong to him by claiming he is someone and something he is not. That is fraud.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:17:00
Huh. This is the first time I have heard this. Interesting. Thanks.

I have always said I don't know if Bitcoin will be around in 20 years but it has become without a doubt a strong proof of concept and I believe in the philosophy. 
Bitcoin won't change the world, it already has.

That video was crap. It literally explained nothing about Bitcoin other than Satoshi started it. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:51:06
All he has to do is move 1 Satoshi from one of the wallets known to be owned by Nakamoto and he will be vindicated. Short of that he is still a liar. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:02:55
I think so. It points out the fundamental questions about Bitcoin, those being security and double dipping but then doesn't say at all how the inherent structure of the system helps protect against these. It still makes Bitcoin sound like a "Black Box" system which it specifically is not. 
Things it missed
-How BTC is generated or "mined"
-How to aquire BTC.
-How to exchange BTC for goods and services. 
If you explain these three aspects you typically can answer many of the questions folks have. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 04:29:34
The fact that more people hear about it is good but it doesn't help stigma that people are using bitcoin for illegal activities.
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:22:16
Yeah...no... That is completely illegal. 
Edit: apparently I am wrong. It is illegal to refuse cash payment on a debit but not for goods or services. Weird. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:21:50
Sigh...you are fucking telling me. Problem is that I want to mine too...

Bought at 9k and said "Oooo that hurts" at 7k and bought again. I feel like I need a gif of the scene from Avengers with the Hulk, "My secret is I am always buying."

This is how we need to find things like Wikipedia and the Way Back Machine in the future.

This sounds sufficient and reasonable. I should do this.

Lol. Everyone knows that Bruce Wayne was just waiting for Batman to become popular before he would tell everyone who he really was. That was why he went through all of the trouble to remain anonymous. He just doesn't take out any of the Bat gadgets because he doesn't want to. 
Craig Wright maybe a smart guy but he is demonstrably lying about this. If he wasn't all he would have to do is move a small amount of the BTC that is in known Satoshi wallets. Fuck him and his power grab over something that is meant to decentralize power.

This is why Roger Very will burn in hell. Fucking dirt bag.

It is also great when they are a part of the National Credit Union Association. Basically means you can make deposits at any credit union in the system nationwide and they don't do withdrawal fees. 
The one bummer about my credit union is that they are often a bit of a shit show and their online system is sub par. But....they aren't evil so we take what we can get. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:03:52
This is such BS and I can't believe he is getting this much press for this. If he were in fact Satoshi he would not have to gather evidence. Given the complexity of the system to maintain  annonimity I am sure they have a very clear example proving their identity if they ever chose to. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:15:09
Profession huh? I like that. Specific skill set and network you are paid for. Covers it. Funny enough you really have to be pretty damn trustworthy and/or accessible and dependable to be a good drug dealer. The best ones are both but you can be just one and get by. You can't really advertise, it is all word of mouth and it really is moderated by pure capitalism. In all honesty in the passed 10 years I am more often satisfied with my drug dealer than any large retailer I have been to.

So can I sell my cards on your site for btc?
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:50:35
This is one of the most solid pieces of advice in this thread. Bitcoin is only the currency of a new economy, there are going to be countless other ways to make money on it.

I think what we are forgetting is that if SM really is some sort of super genius then learning C++ shouldn't be that hard. The one thing in life I have learned to be true is that the resolve and resourcefulness of a individual person is often underestimated.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:51:40
Yeah, now that Bitmit is going down I cannot seem to find a good site for selling things for Bitcoin. I also just have about 2500 cards that I want to sell for Bitcoin.
