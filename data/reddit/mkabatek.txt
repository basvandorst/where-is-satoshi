Or actor with deep pockets sporting an army of FPGAs. AWS has high-performance GPU instances and [FPGA instances as well]( I'm not sure how they would compare to massive rigs with x4 GPUs. My thought is that if someone had enough money they can basically spin up as much hash power as needed via AWS regardless of the PoW. I don't think this was a possibility when Bitcoin was conceived.

Miners get a 'block reward' if they successfully confirm a block of transactions. Currently the block reward is 25 bitcoins, this serves as the incentive for miners to mine. 
There is a fixed amount of space for transactions in each block so the fees let miners prioritize which transactions make it into a block - the reasons for this are two fold: 
1. Prevent people from spamming the network - eg flooding it with many transactions preventing others from using the network, because it costs money to do that - if there were no fees it would cost nothing to clog the network.
2. Transition from block reward to transaction fees, because the block reward decreases over time.
The total incentive to mine is the block reward + fees. As time goes on the block reward eventually decreases to zero (very soon the block reward will drop from 25 btc to 12.5 btc, however by the year 2140 the reward is expected to decrease to 0 btc this is called [Controlled Supply]( so the fees people pay will ultimately replace the incentive for miners to mine. I'm quoting directly from the satoshi white paper:


less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
tl;dr the fees prevent spam transactions, and will ultimately serve as the incentive for miners to mine according to the initial [satoshi white paper](

Doubtful. A private key, is a private key, is a private key, am I right As long as you can export an unencrypted private key you will be able to [import that to another wallet such as bitcoin core]( However you will not be able to import the key into an HD wallet.

I thought you cant import keys to an HD wallet?

Applications, it takes about 18 months for a patent application to 'publish' (become public) after it's submitted - it can take 3+ years to be granted. These are basically in 'patent pending' status.

They don't accept Bitcoin directly yet - xapo does it's transactions off chain.

I was under the impression you cannot import existing private keys into an HD wallet because of the way the keys are generated from the seed - To transfer/import you have to send coins to an address which is generated by the seed. I could be wrong though.

What about massive hashing power attacking the other chain?

Has someone out there written up detailed instructions, and gotchas on how to upgrade to the HD wallet from the old school wallet of the past core releases? - hopefully there is some documentation for doing that.

checkout the [github]( each player has a wallet, you could send bitcoin directly to your player, then your player can use the coin in game.

No, the block reward has been cut in half. A bitcoin is worth a bitcoin.

No SSL? If you care about security, you might want to consider using something like [Let's Encrypt]( otherwise all the data sent/transmitted to/from your site is in plain text.
Edit: spelling ;)
