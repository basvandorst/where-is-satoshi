Well no, say everyone did this, with no inflation, for 10 years, in those 10 years nothing would get made, and the economy suffers massive losses by doing this.
Of course you have to save a little bit, because otherwise you couldn't buy anything, but having more than 50k in the bank isn't that smart, it's better to invest while saving, and sell when you want to buy something.

I'd say spend 1000 dollars, because that money would wind up, trough the next persons hands into the bank, thus also resulting in credit creation. (maby a bit less extra money is created this way).
Say i'd spend my 1000 dollars, and my money spends 95% of it's time in the bank, that would still get 950 dollars available for credit creation, while i can frequently spend 1000 dollars.
And loans have to be paid back, i think that spending money results in more long term growth.

then who's still mining coins? is it still profitable if you have a special bitcoin card?

Yes it is, say you have 500 dollars,  if you keep it, no products get sold, and none get made, but say you give that 500 dollars to your carpenter, for a table, and that carpenter buys e bike with that money, and the bike shop owner buys a laptop with it.
So by pressuring you and the other people to spend their money, a table, a bike and a laptop got made, and more stuff being made=economic growth.
And keep in mind, no one got poorer here, you all got goods worth 500 dollars so it's 100% a win win
Pressuring people to spend their money creates economic growth, otherwise more people would hoard their money. And when everyone does that, nothing gets made and no one has anything

Yes, that's investing your money and also something inflation promotes. Even if you put your money in the bank, your bank kind of invests that money for you without asking, and they give you a little bit of their profits, but it's not enough to offset inflation.

Yea but you're arguing semantics now, the point is that it promotes people to buy stuff that they don't 100% need to survive (anything apart from food and shelter), or make investments.


I don't think you have any significant amount of money in your bank, most people with any kind of money invest it either in stocks, a house or their business. If they didn't they would become more poor by the day.

I already made 2 threads where i got some information about this.

That seems horrible, if everyone put their money in the bank, there suddenly would be 10x more money? Or could you explain this process a bit further?
I'd say spend the 1000, because loans have to be paid back and profits don't and suddenly getting 10x more money in the economy seems horrible.

I'm not quite sure what he means by accomodating economic growth, but inflation (money being worth less over time) promotes economic growth by pressuring people to either spend or invest their money, because if they would just keep cash around, they would be losing money.

If you have no money, there's nothing that loses value. So the poorer are not getting poorer with inflation, it's the contrary even, rich people that have a lot of cash stored, get poorer by the day while your average Pete is living paycheck to paycheck, and not being affected by inflation. Inflation helps close the poverty gap a little bit.


I agree that this is happening but how does inflation contribute to this? Inflation has nothing to do with poor people not having stocks or businesses, and poor people probably have less cash than rich people so they are less affected by inflation.


It's not just new ipads for 6 year olds that are being made. Inflation promotes investment in meaningfull technology and companies that contribute to society.  These are things that we will benefit from in the long term and poor people and third world countries will as well. Inflation promotes investment in shit that we DO need.


Because you might not have enough stuff, but there's a lot of people that don't, with more growth, stuff gets cheaper and products are able to reach more people. This makes the lives of less fortunate people in western and third world countries better.
**For example:**
**Investment and growth in the robotics sector:**
This is a step towards a semi utopian society where everyone just does what they want on a basic income. This will also free up a lot of resources for thirld word countries.
**Investment and growth in the automotive industry:**
Self driving cars are becoming more real every day, and this could make transport a lot cheaper, and basic goods would become cheaper, which is good for poor people. This would also greatly reduce traffic deaths.
**Growth in the technology sector:**
When more tech gets sold, more budget is available for r&amp;d, advancing technology for everyone all while decreasing the price of technology.
Smartphones are huge in third world countries, providing health and agricultural information to people that otherwise wouldn't have access to this information. Growth in this sector would make these phones even cheaper, and growth in this sector is also a major boost for companies trying to set up world wide internet, either via sattelites or solar planes. Again benefiting less fortunate people.
And every day, more people walk around on this planet, if there was no growth, there would be less stuff per person every day, this is bad, there would be less stuff for third world countries and this wouldn't help reduce poverty.
We need economic growth, both for the poor people and to advance to a better society.
And your cancer analogy isn't relevant.

Why is that a problem, no one is actually getting more poor because they have their money invested, all the while promoting economic growth.

Is it still profitable to mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-07-16 17:31:16
Yea, you're right, It's not a good argument for inflation, but I think it was more of an addition to the paragraph before that statement to make it clear that you shouldn't live paycheck to paycheck because of inflation. 
Otherwise my comment would give the impression that you almost shouldn't have a bank account.
And I think you still lose value by storing money in the bank, usually the interest doesn't fully compensate inflation.

But it too will have problems when reaching large scales.
