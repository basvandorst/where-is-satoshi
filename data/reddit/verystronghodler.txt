HODL is life.

If you think that's bad you should look into router backdoors, or just look up prism. Even if you don't have an ASIC or mine, all of this is important to be aware of.

I think there was a point in time around 2008 where anyone could open a BofA account. Loose banking standards.

FPGA's recently got tribus (algo) public bitstreams on DNR, a POW/POS hybrid coin. The community got together and used POS to their advantage and were able to slow down the FPGA's quite a bit. Another affect was speeding up the blockchain and lowering inflation. Would be interesting to see how something like this works for coins with ASICS on them and have POS.

Can anyone explain how someone can send data to the satellite?

Saw something like this recently on an alt where rogue nodes were messing with bandwidth on anything connected to them. Someone scanned the packets going in and out of one IP we were sure of, and they were half packets. Think how a VPS has a monthly bandwidth cap, and all I could think of its easy to roll out 5000 wallets using docker or ansible or take your pick of automation, and do this at much larger scale on anycoin. Its not obvious whats happening unless you watch your traffic logs.

That's even more interesting. Even more curious what's been tried over the years regarding this.

Will there be a Champion edition?

Here is a sample list. Depends on the router how to add.
So you wouldn't change your lastpass master password after they were hacked?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:45:39
HODL, and buy more.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:03:09
Except when master passwords like lastpass were hacked about 2 years ago. Just be aware of everything. Lots of people are starting to use DNS blocking lists at the router.

Been following BTC since the beginning, new to buying on an exchange. I don't see any reason to try to time buys if you are HODLing for the long term. Timing BTC to buy altcoins is a whole other animal.

Someone is still updating this. I guess its not technically bitcoin though.

Mylar with ink is used in City vaults to store plans long term. Some cities still do this.

Production cost gets lower as the metal miners take out larger loans. Not like this ever happens in any other industry. Sell low make it up in volume.
Go long crypto and physical.

I was on the same timeline, which was nice to get earlier than Sept. 15.

Or the Nano S blends in with a bunch of flash drives. =)
Just got mine and been very happy with it.

Remember that guy who bought a 335 with bitcoin? =p

wow I had been trying to do this for a while and decided to try again on my favorite alt earlier today and came across your post as I am in the middle of compiling the QT on the phone. Very cool.
Possiby try apt install tor, then add tor=[127.0.0.1:9050]( or onion=[127.0.0.1:9050]( to the .conf, if your version of bitcoind doesnt have native tor inside of it.

Coinomi is what I use on android. Save your seed, use a strong password to encrypt the wallet. Doesn't get much easier than that. When you decide you like bitcoin more and continue to buy, Ledger and Trezor are great hardware wallets.
