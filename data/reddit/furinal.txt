Does "private" mean nothing to some people? smh

Issuance matters more than distribution. As long as no one can print at will to dilute my holding I don’t mind if some whales hold 99%

Merchants transfer the cost of credit card transactions and chargebacks to all customers including those paying with cash. Why do you think they will give BTC payers a discount unless the business owner is a bitcoiner?

That's misleading. If you don't try to move the dust outputs it won't matter.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:06:05
Inputs. And that's only the case when you empty the whole address. Many wallets allow you to select which outputs to spend.

Only segwit addresses wrapped in p2sh start with 3. A native segwit address in bech32 format starts with bc1.

No proof he sold though. He probably sent btc to bitfinex to make people fomo buy bch.

hate to be that guy but why don't people google "&lt;company&gt; scam" before using them? you can't afford not to be skeptical in cryptospace.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:08:41
Wrong. P2SH address starts with 3, but you can’t know if it’s segwit unless someone spends from it.

It's just a buzzword

You don't think it's intentional to siphon hashrate from btc?

why do people downvote this? people lost money using this wallet because it sometimes didn't save the private key of a change address after making a transaction. it should have been discontinued long ago.
