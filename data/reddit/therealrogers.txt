Hopefully you aren’t buying on robinhood
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:28:06
no it probably won't work like that.  Shorts actually provide a floor for price, but they can't push the price 15x lol
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:07:39
no it will actually be worth half due to reverse compound interest
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:07:04
Are block times still 10 minutes?
Thats 12gb per hour.

Wow. Genius.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:46:45
It's different all the time depends on the market. Just look up how options work if you are interested.
Also options are a great way to lose all your money so.. keep that in mind.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:22:14
adding no value to anything?  Without traders, there is low liquidity which means when you go to buy or sell you won't get anywhere near spot.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:03:26
yeah his one blew me away when I first watched it
It's probably a repost, but I'll allow it.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:24:50
Not really you can maximize your chances based on various factors and if a trade goes against you, well that’s what a stop loss is for.  Basically you can lose 4/5 trades but the one you win more than makes up for the losses.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:27:16
Why even leverage with this market tho lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 01:57:04
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:28:32
Lol no they won’t Iran isn’t Iraq.

You got a source for that?
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:24:13
Well these are all just predictions and most likely 10+ years away from fruition.    Make sure you are taking security extremely seriously and hold your own keys.  You need to do your research to make sure you don’t make yourself a victim by ignorance.

Yeah learning to trade is a full time job but not as difficult as most people make it seem.  Losing money is hard for a lot of people and you lose a lot until you learn how to win.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:25:58
A lot of traders also hodl but just like to keep capital available to trade across many assets.  
I mean, thats what I do.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:28:15
It absolutely should lol there are several options just like i said watch a couple hours of videos on just how to secure your bitcoin learn  it inside and out.  Bitcoin is still early and there are no regulations or fdic insurances yet you and you alone are responsible for your asset.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:20:59
I wouldn’t call it the hardest game in the world. It is challenging, but hardest in the world? Nah.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:59:37
That doesn’t look like a source to me. 
So where is the source saying Iran is the  financier of terrorism?

@_date: 2019-07-04 17:38:43
makes no sense in this context.   Anything you practice for years you can become good at.  Not an especially impressive thing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:18:07
Get and hold at least .03 bitcoin as that is the amount every human on earth would have to fight over.   Then just keep on adding.  Dollar cost averaging s your best bet.  Bitcoin is highly volatile and could see prices go back down thousands of dollars before  resuming a bull market.  No sweat just buy and hold.
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:49:46
A couple of good follow up articles for that
It seems to me that the beef between Iran and the US is more about sour grapes over Israel and other interests in the middle east. 
So yeah, basically the US calls Iran sponsors of terrorism and Iran calls the US sponsors of terrorism.  Literally both countries are accusing each other of the same thing.  
I have a funny feeling there is fuckery on both sides.  Let’s not pretend like the US hasn’t done their fair share to destabilize the middle east.   So yeah idk seems like to me war is business and business is good.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:02:58
Is that because of how long it takes to chop a tree down or?
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:51:43
quality source?
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:34:05
I agree further downside is more likely, but I just doubt it will go as low as 3k.  It could though, but I imagine it won't be there for long.

@_date: 2018-09-22 15:29:49
 It means you are good at risk management.  Lots of day traders sell lower than they bought, but only to cut losses before they are a real hit. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:34:29

@_date: 2018-09-23 21:39:47

If it’s an expense the merchant takes on, you are paying it wether it shows up as a surcharge or not man.  It’s part of the cost of doing business.  It’s the same as when you buy a cold drink but do you see a surcharge for the refrigerator it was kept in?
Consumers are footing the bill.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:04:05
Who pays the merchant?  The consumer- the cost of CCs is baked into everything you buy. You are paying for your own cash back.

My guess is he recognizes that fiat only serves as a tool to spend with in the short term and that other assets hold,store or return value. Things like equities,  PMs, bitcoin, and possible other cryptos.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:54:13
The same place it does now.  
The main point is that assets generally go up in terms of fiat, and fiat always loses value over time in terms of purchasing power.  It’s a complimentary system.  
The nature of fiat devaluing is what drives people to spend it on goods/services.  Assets are what people spend fiat on because of the simple fact that fiat isn’t worth holding.  
Let me put it this way- if dollars were always getting more valuable, people would be less inclined to spend them and contribute to the economy.  
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:05:02

The dollar loses value constantly.  It’s the reason prices and wages go up. What you meant to say is you will stay have $5000.  Your purchasing power, however, will decline indefinitely.

@_date: 2019-08-11 14:58:23
There can be true and false thing in the bible because there are true and false things in it.  In fact there are a lot of false things in most religious books.  It isn’t any different than any of the books you don’t believe in.  But the fact here is, you can easily keep thinking you are right even if “forced rfid chips”  never happen.  There is always another day.  This is an easy manipulation tactic to out.  “Well guys it hasn’t happened yet but that’s because we don’t know when it will happen”.  In your mind, a trillion years could pass and it would still be true to you.  It’s a side effect of religious indoctrination.

im not interested in a pissing match
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:47:29
Yeah believe it or not, I’ve read the bible.  My point was that you can’t say it proves the bible wrong if it never happens because you will always think it’s happening some other time.  
It’s a convenient excuse for something that will never happen.   Really you should be asking yourself why you believe any of it in the first place, as geography and culture have a much larger impact on what religion you follow than any basis in reality said religion has.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:08:00

Don’t be such a snowflake
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:19:33
Technically yeah you are right, but the broader discussion is focused on the economic expansion since 2009.
Anyways, if anything, the yield inversion shows that the cracks in our economy could be starting to show.  While it is typically a reliable indicator of where we might be headed, it also needs to stay inverted to be reliable. In other words, we are still watching as this plays out.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:26:42
Bro I hate to tell you this, but it’s been improving for like a decade now.
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:03:57
Should we expect around 4k bottom?  Maybe.
Could be lower. 
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:58:35
Cool story, BigDaddyAnusTart.
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:13:08
shorts are people who borrowed then sold bitcoin hoping the price goes down so they can buy them back at a lower price and keep the difference.   When shorts are liquidated that means the exchange closed positions because they were gonna lose more than the borrowers could cover.
so like i borrow 1 xyz coin from you and sell it for 100 dollars and then the price goes down to 80 dollars and i buy the xyz back and return it to you. I keep the 20 dollar difference.  Liquidations happen when xyz goes to 120 and I don't have enough money to cover anymore losses, so the exchange automatically buys xyz and charges me the difference in cost for them.
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:02:13
Must be new to the crypto community.  Lots of ass hats here.

No he doesn’t, i think he might be retarded honestly.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:53:21
you can trade longer trends pretty easy.  it's just most people don't have the risk tolerance.
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:03:21
buy 1 bitcoin sure  
I also like to buy other projects (ether,litecoin,neo,onotology ect), but generally, the advice is to start with 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:26:06
Well we would be the ones taking all the risk so I celebrate the price rising.  Wether you like it or not, the price of bitcoin is what is going to drive a lot of adoption.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:04:26
Your first paragraph gives me the impression that you have the attention span of a goldfish.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:49:14
True I just try to make things simple though.  It’s interesting to see people who know so little about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:15:32
What does that have to do with supply?
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:18:23
A block is produced roughly every ten minutes.   If hash rate increases, so does the difficulty.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:13:54
Has anyone looked at the short charts... If bulls keep this pressure up we are gonna see a nice squeeze.
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:10:16
It looks like it’s selling off after hitting resistance. Bulls could still pull through and push up, but I would need to see more conviction behind that move. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:17:12
Opposed in the sense that the wealthy have all the money and it becomes worth more and more over time.  So the reality is they do nothing but keep all those who weren’t lucky enough to accumulate and hoard out of the loop.     Deflation and inflation both have issues.  The point is that you can’t just assume since something isn’t inflationary that  everything will be fixed.  Deflation is the opposite of productivity. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:18:40
Might need more context, any error messages?
First thing I would do is restart everything.  Have any tor settings changed?  
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:04:28
That is accurate, but you are dismissing the reality of our economy improving pre trump.  
 The great recession ended in 2009. Period. 
The economy has been improving since 2009.  
This is a fact.  
It doesn’t matter what has happened in the last several years- it has been improving since 2009.  But, I don’t expect you to understand that tbh.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:44:21
Well some people also want more bitcoin and sometimes that’s the best way to get more.  Sell on parabolic runs and buy lower.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:12
You remember the last bull run? Had a few 30-40% drops on the way up if I’m reading the chart right.
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:07:35
It’s notable, I thought for sure we would break to the downside.  Just keep an eye on it.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:47:10
Lmao yes the economy did a 180 on election day you win thanks for educating me and all the other people who failed to suck dear leaders teet of stimulus
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:24:40
You don’t know things with bitcoin, but it could happen.
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:25:15
I know this, issa joke. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:41:58
Yes the indicators used to gauge how the economy is doing have been improving for a long time.  What does that have to do with cnn? 
A+ on your annoying factor though.
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:28:55
Debt and interest rates are another topic, but yes they do have an effect on the money supply. 
However, I’m just gonna agree to disagree with you on deflation.
-There are plenty of historical examples of how deflation affects things, so feel free to check it out or don’t.   
@_date: 2019-02-02 01:57:26
Yeah and when some people have more and earn more they eventually end up with all of it. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:54:10
excuse me but I can see the future im offended you would say this
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:56:18
No shit?  
@_date: 2019-02-09 15:31:49
Lmao the discrepancy here is so small chill tf out 
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:03:35
Well you aren’t the first person to believe they have stumbled onto some divine loophole.  
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:06:32
Except it is a problem. Deflation is known to lead to things like unemployment.  You can easily find this information if you care to do so. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 00:23:31
But how do we prevent the problems deflation presents? Inflation and deflation can both be problematic.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:49:39
We gotta hold on to what we've got!
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:56:08
No one knows how low we will go.  
Any prediction is bullshit.  
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:34:38
I know im just wondering how all these shorts right now feel being so far in the red looks like they started piling on around the upper 8000s
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:27:28
fear of losing money will do that to you
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:11:48
I mean, you do make a good point about people buying unnecessary shit.
Also, anyone who understands our current monetary policies should know it is inflationary, and that they need to put capital to work if they have the ability to do so.  
I’m not sure how old you are, but I graduated high school in 07 and lived my early adult years through a decade of massive currency creation (qe1,2,3).  So I definitely understand the dollar menu becoming 2 for $5.

“Elasticity of supply is measured as the ratio of proportionate change in the quantity supplied to the proportionate change in price. High elasticity indicates the supply is sensitive to changes in prices, low elasticity indicates little sensitivity to price changes, and no elasticity means no relationship with price.”
The same amount of bitcoin is supplied between halvings- no matter what. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:20:32
The halving is a supply shock.  
Whether you know it is going to happen or not, it is still a supply shock.   
“A supply shock is an event that suddenly increases or decreases the supply of a commodity or service, or of commodities and services in general. This sudden change affects the equilibrium price of the good or service or the economy's general price level.”
@_date: 2019-02-01 22:14:59
Specifically, supply is inelastic- always fixed between halving schedules, so regardless of the true demand, what you get is what you get.  
I wouldn’t expect bitcoin to ever be a stable price, and as we approach 21 million coins mined it will become extremely deflationary.  
People don’t tend to spend deflationary assets because why would you get rid of something that only becomes more valuable?

@_date: 2019-04-24 03:14:34
I’d say so.   Btc is great for security and trust, it can also claim the role of being the peg in the crypto space.   
To say that other blockchains have no value outside of what bitcoin can offer is short sighted in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:49:56

@_date: 2018-11-26 01:53:07
 There is no evidence that this is the bottom yet. You can say whatever you want about price levels or support, but identifying a bottom is something that happens long after the fact when the trend actually changes.  Remember when “6k was the bottom”?    
 Sure you can buy now and it could be the bottom, but don’t fool yourself into thinking you are doing anything other than gambling.

@_date: 2018-03-30 19:39:48
I only trade with money I don’t need and I also have the luxury to ensure I always protect my initial investment. Believe it or not i started buying bitcoin and trading against other cryptos in December.  And You know what- someone who can’t dedicate full time hours to this like I can will probably lose money.

I’ve spent years trading on a nearly naked chart.  There is no formula for TA and the real waste of time is thinking you can boil it down into a programmable strategy.  You either know how to read a market and chart or you don’t.  Each one has it’s own personality and characteristics.  
Oh and I trade to make a little profit here and there.  Pretty common reason.

All he is saying is atms usually carry high fees. 
Your cheapest route is to do a bank transfer to an exchange like coinbase, then purchase the bitcoin on coinbase pro.      
The coinbase app is usually higher than market, and using coinbase pro will let you get closer to market prices. Yes there is a significant difference in price on coinbase vs coinbase pro.

Not to sign up. The only fee is maker and taker fees, which are pretty low.   There is a verification process that will take some time also.  Your best bet is to sign up for a few of the major ones and see who gets you verified first.

Trading with leverage happens in every market.  They have to cover at some point, and at that time they will buy back exactly what they sold when they opened a short position.

I personally care about when I buy and at what price. You may not, but many people do.  
What’s wrong with being realistic about price action?  Does it bother you in some way?

In all seriousness there will always be a fee.
You can use an exchange to get the lowest fees possible.  Coinbase pro, gemini and so on.  
Using the coinbase app is a stupid mark up so if you go that route make sure you are using the pro exchange.

Hate to break it to you but rates have more to do with debt and keeping inflation low than some cabal controlling everything to steal from you.
Sure banks can be shady and do things they shouldn’t, but ultimately people choose to sign the contracts. 
I swear people love to 100% blame banks for their own addiction to debt. 
But hey why take responsibility when we can blame other faceless entities for our own choices?

This is kinda a huge insight for a 13 year old.   If I had invested at 13 I could have been set for life by now at 29.  haha.  I think you should invest in many places, you have no real responsibilities or bills yet right?  Set your self up for the future to help buy the important things in life.
