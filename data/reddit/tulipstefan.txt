Card fees are free for the customer. In the netherlands, the first google hit i clicked offers pin transactions for 4.5 cents (although the terminal costs €600 + €150 annually. Which in the context of a bakery with a couple hundred customers per day is really peanuts).
I would be surprised if you could the handle overhead of accepting cash for less than 4.5 cents for transaction.

The same way websites don't have any obligation to send their content/bytes to Brave users.
The line is thin, though. If i take content from the new york times website without asking and place it on my own website, that's copyright infringement. If i only take a small part of the article, it's called a citation with is legal (in my country). That's google news.
What if i use an iframe to embed the content from new york times on my website? Probably okay. What if i use javascript to extract the article from the new york times website to display it on my website with my own ads? I'm pretty sure that's copyright infringement. What if i use javascript to completely butcher the new york times website? I don't know, but it sure smells like copyright infringement.

As a software developer i agree with you point of view, but I'm not sure about the argument that it's suddenly different because of certain low-level browser details. As an analogy to the physical word, imagine me buying a newspaper, replacing all ads by my own, and re-publishing it. That sure smells like copyright infringement. But when i offer users a tool to do that process automatically, it is suddenly not? The intent of the publisher was that his content would be presented in a certain way.
You can read that novel in any way you like, you're not re-publishing or duplicating that work. I don't think copyright is applicable there.

Behind paywalls, there is copyrighted content. You can copy copyrighted content as you wish, as long as you do not re-distribute it. The copyright owner can not prevent you from, say, creating your own archive of articles (for your own use), or citing from the articles unless there was databankrecht on the data.
It's the same way you can't forbid me from backing up my music collection. Under the same loophole, downloading copyrighted material is (or used to be?) legal. Just the uploading isn't.
By the way, the groceries store example was a bad one, since the groceries store is private property, they can create their own rules. A street market would be a better example. A website is not considered private property.
So no, a paywall is not extortion. You can use a paywall to shield data, but the same paywall can't restrict me copying the data. Of course, if you know that X is crawling your data, you can simply refuse to do business with X, but for a website that doesn't require logins, that is complicated...

Because the publishers own the copyright to the content.
If i re-publish an article on my own website without permission, it's clear cut copyright infringement. But if i use javascript to completely butcher the publisher's website, so that is *still is* the publishers website, but it actually *looks like* my website? How is that different from just re-publishing the content? 
I'm honestly asking here, because i don't know the answer. But i wouldn't immediately dismiss the idea that the publishers have a point here.
Google publishes content under citation laws, which are an exception to copyright laws (in my country, at least).

That is FUD. Try broadcasting a transaction or block without the signature, if you don't believe me.

Well, it's copyright infringement to upload a movie to youtube. You can publish a part of a movie by using a citation or fair use exception, but publishing half a movie is still copyright infringement. Based on this argument, you could make a case that stripping ads is copyright infringement as it is neither fair use nor a citation. I don't think it is a particularly strong argument, but that's something for the court to decide.
I don't have a response for the rest of your post, seems irrelevant to me. No current browser (excluding brave) serves ads over the content of existing websites, and publisher's don't seen very interested to start a lawsuit against something that merely blocks ads. We'll see in a few years, i guess.
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:39:21
Copyright laws don't work like that. Under copyright laws, you can't do anything with the content unless you got permission or an exception (citation and fair use are examples of such exceptions). It doesn't change anything if the copyright holder explicitly forbids you to do something with the content, because that was already the default state.
IANAL, but that's my understanding on the topic.

You should probably read this dutch article if you can: 
Dutch copyright law states that 'legitimate users' are permitted to copy copyrighted material as they see fit. Unless the data is protected by something called databankrecht ('database right', AKA, protection because the data was expensive to acquire/clean. Stuff like google streetview). Copyright prevents people from *publishing* the data, not collecting it in the first place as long as there is a legimate goal to collect/duplicate/scrape the data in the first place.
You can  block users if they are encumbering your website. If bots account for a significant amount of website traffic, you might be able to do that. The same way you cannot prevent me from writing down prices in the groceries store, but if you take an army of people to write down prices, it might be considered encumbering and you can kick me out.
Might be different outside the netherlands, but here this is definitely extortion. Not to mention wholly ineffective.

That depends on the country. In my country you're required to actually deliver the item that's ordered. If it has been sold out in the meantime, though luck. Go find a replacement item at equal or higher value. In this day and age there is no excuse for having crappy inventory management.
This leads to funny situations where stores accidentally misprice an item (or so they say) and then they still have to deliver it.
Of course it sucks for the merchant that payments can be reversed, but then don't accept such payment methods...

Even your bank issues their own tokens... They are called united states dollars, ticker USD. They are supposed to be backed by gold but that was abolished 100 years ago. In case of a bank run you are not guaranteed to get anything back. EUR, KRW and JPY are also fine examples.

Your first source refers a deleted post, it's unclear what you're referring to.

The third source confirms my hypothesis that p2sh addresses are a bit smaller than native segwit.
The fourth source claims "Bech32 addresses are thought to take up less space than its P2SH counterpart." which is hardly conclusive.
Later i found  which claims that native segwit addresses are smaller, but I think he forgets to calculate effects of larger signatures in the total size (see the source in my other post).

It uses a sidechain to run the smart contracts on. You can move bitcoins from/to the rootstock sidechain and execute smart contracts.
The trade-off is that moving funds between chains is annoying/takes time, but it reduces the resource usage of the main chain and reduces the impact of buggy smart contracts on the main chain (think DAO and multisig disasters with eth).
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:07:01
Segwit removes the signature from the transaction and places it into a separate block structure (the witness data). The main advantage is that it's backwards compatible. Old nodes keep working because the base block is still 1MB, they never see the witness data.
New nodes see both the base block (still max 1MB) and the witness data (technically max 4MB).

His idea would essentially give miners veto-power over the blocksize. It's trivial for miners to fill the blocks with trash transactions, or keep the empty on purpose to game the system. If there was a good way to figure out which transactions are good enough to be included in blocks, we wouldn't need bitcoin.


Great. That solves nothing. The miner can just create spam with high fees, since they collect their own fees if they mine a block.
These idea's have been proposed many times already. There are no methods to determine what the optimal blocksize is that are not easily gameable. Even the current 'the developers determine the blocksize' method is possible to game, but much harder than any other method.

Okay, then I just continuously send you invalid blocks so you waste all your mining power on them, since you mine them for 30s before you drop them if you can't verify them yet.
Really there is no security difference between SPV mining and header first mining. You should never waste mining power on blocks that can not be verified, if you do you will be tricked by your competitors and reduce network security.
And there are much better solutions than header first mining such as thin blocks etc. Still not a scaling 'solution'.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say. In your hypothetical scenario nodes would follow the longest chain, aka the chain with the most proof of work. It is fully valid to reject transactions or blocks that you don't like, the protocol gives every participant that power. This is consistent with my statement that you only need to trust proof of work. As long as you do that, miners cannot steal your bitcoins.
Note that the bitcoin protocol does not guarantee that your transactions are accepted by miners. The only guarantee it provides is that it is expensive to mine a block on top of something that is not the longest chain.

On-chain transactions. What they actually mean is '35 million users can open/close 3 channels per year' with the current block sizes. They are not talking about the number of transactions the lightning network can handle.

The discount is an attempt to bring the cost of transactions further in line with their actual cost. For example, if I have a transaction with two inputs and one output, it is more or less the same size as a transaction with one input and two outputs. But the latter costs ~500 more bytes of RAM on every node on the network, so it makes sense that one is more expensive even if the byte count of each transaction is the same.
It's not perfect since cost is somewhat arbitrary and different for each user of the network, but better than it once was.

My counter-claim:

I honestly have no idea what's we are disagreeing about here.

These fees are not caused by volatility in bitcoin. They can just buy bitcoin when it's needed if they want to avoid volatility. Even if they don't do that, volatility increases their variance, but it's still only variance and it doesn't affect their average profits.

You said "if 50% of the **nodes** agree, then that is **consensus**". The whitepaper says: "if 50% of the **hashpower** is honest, than the system is **secure**". That is not the same. A secure system is not the same as a system with consensus.

That is not going to happen. The exchanges won't let any fork happen without either clear consensus or replay protection and different asset name. At that point it's clear which of the two forks is bitcoin.
That's what happened with the previous bitcoin forks too. Bitcoin Unlimited attempted a takeover, the exchanges came together, issued a statement and it didn't happen. They tried again with bitcoin cash and got their minority fork. The current effort to rename the minority fork is sad.

No one would notice, because you aren't really forking. You are only forking when you actually accept an block that is rejected by other nodes. And since there are no miners mining such blocks, you are completely safe. The same thing happens when you reject a block that is accepted by other nodes.

If you hardcode a set SSL certificates for the various blockchain API's, yes. Whether you want to do that is a different question. All client software can be broken regardless of how good the security is. If you want true security, i know no other alternatives than hardware or cloud solutions.
But that's not the point. My point is that blockchain based license management removes the reliance of a central update server while still allowing license revocation. This is not possible with the usual 'one central license server' model most games use. If the publisher decides to throw the towel, some games are not usable anymore [recent example](
If blockchain.info dies, my application will just fallback to a different API, because there are so many to choose from. The disadvantage is that each activation/deactivation costs a few cents.

I don't currently run a bitcoin node, but in terms of resource usage i feel that there is no argument. Even if the block size increased by a tenfold overnight, it still wouldn't put a dent in my available bandwidth.
If we want bitcoin to succeed we should really stop worrying about the lowest denominator. The 7 tps limit is a serious threat to bitcoin, the lack of full nodes is less so and will be solved in the future with techniques like invertible bloom lookup tables. But we need to solve the tps problem urgently.

I built a software licensing system on top of the blockchain.
The application is actually quite obvious considering the requirements for software licencing. I don't need to host an server to verify licenses, yet i gain the option to revoke or change licenses remotely. If the API i use to query the blockchain breaks, i can easily add 5 new ones considering how many block explorers there are.
The blockchain is very useful to store small amounts of data, such as an certificate. I don't see advantages in replacing the entire SSL infrastructure with a blockchain, though. Trust is a much bigger issue than the storage of the certificates.

You're looking at the math all wrong. If there was a block 8 minutes ago. The average time until a new block is found is around 7 minutes (per [this]( chart). Just as when there was a block 2 seconds ago. Or 5 hours ago. The chance to find a block is independent of the time since the last block.

Segwit provides short term scaling by increasing the amount of transactions in a block. Please provide sources that A) segwit was never deigned as a scaling solution and B) explain why we should care that segwit was never designed as a scaling solution when it absolutely increases the amount of transactions that fit in a block. 
Even it it wasn't designed as a scaling solution, it currently is.


Segwit is less lines of code than BU. Several wallet developers have said that Segwit is easy to implement. Segwit solves the quadratic scaling problem which allows for easier future expansions of the blocksize which BU cannot do without making the rules for what transactions fit inside a block even more complex.


That is propaganda. Please explain to me why it is bad for bitcoin that we fix transaction malleability. Please explain to my why off-chain scaling (which requires a fix for transaction malleability) is bad for bitcoin.

Yes, the ETC chain was manipulated in order to give certain people larger amounts of ETC then they owned previously. Because exchanges didn't expect a fork, poloniex was the only exchange that had replay protection in place (at the exact moment of the fork, they created a transaction that moved their entire eth balance and was only valid on one of the two chains. I don't know if that is possible in bitcoin). Some people figured that out and started withdrawing large amounts of ETH from btce/gdax/.. to polo. Then you could sell the ETC on polo and transmit the ETH back to BTC-e. Then you transmit the ETH back to polo and BTC-e would send ETC along with that transaction until BTC-e's ETC wallet was completely drained.
I had a few thousand dollars worth of ETH on exchanges and I never received a single ETC because they claimed it was all stolen. In the end, customers blamed the exchanges, but it was really ethereum foundation's fault for pushing a fork on short notice without community consensus.

Let's say that the difficulty is really high and almost no miners are mining BCH. One miner, miner A, is mining BCH at a rate of 1 block per 6 hours, as in your example, with a total haspower of 5% of the bitcoin network.
Then comes miner B. Miner B has more than 5% (say, 6%) of the network. He starts mining now. But he attaches timestamps to the blocks that lie 24 hours in the future. As soon as he mines a block, the difficulty drops because of EDA.
At this point, miner B mines a few blocks, but doesn't broadcast the chain. Nodes reject blocks with timestamps in the future.
Once the miner has mined a few blocks. He, again, continues mining on the chain 24 hours in the future. The difficulty drops again because of EDA. For good measure, he repeats the procedure twice more more. At this point, the difficulty is very low and the miner mines the rest of the blocks until the next difficulty adjustment, this should take a few minutes or hours.
Now, the miner has to wait until the timestamp on his newest block (let's say, 4x 24 hours in the future) matches the network timestamp. At that point it is safe to broadcast the chain, and since it's the longest chain, it will replace the other chain. Unhonest miner miner B will have mined 2048 blocks = $15m in 4 days, and honest miner A has mined 6*4 = 24 blocks= $180k. Despite miner B only having 20% more hashpower than miner A.
Note that this only works if miner B has more hashing power than the rest of the network combined, since length of the chain is measured in hashes and not in blocks. Miner B has to be very carefully with the timing, but the pay-off ($180k vs $15m) is worth it.
In the same way, mining off the tip of the network is advantageous. If you are *not* mining the tip of the chain and you find a block, it's possible that it has lower difficulty than the main chain because of EDA. Other miners will see that and mine the shorter chain instead.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:34:31
You can. The network just doesn't accept them. But if you wait long enough and the network catches up with the timestamp of your block, you can broadcast it and it will get accepted by the network provided that, at that point, it's the longest chain.

You only need one block with a timestamp in the future to trigger EDA, provided that the 12 blocks before that were evenly spaced at 6 hours. Then you mine 5 other blocks at the same timestamp to trigger the EDA 5 more times.
(exact number of hours/blocks may differ, but that's the basic idea. The overall scheme still works even if you have to mine multiple blocks to trigger the EDA, because you can always do that faster than miner A).

The idea behind bitcoin is that every market participant can verify everything. If the math doesn't check out (too many bitcoins created, incorrect signatures, other rules that are broken), the block is invalid.
What will happen when miners collude with bad blocks is difficult to predict. It is clear that, if *everybody* verifies the rules, there is no incentive to create bad blocks since nobody will accept them. If there are no market participants that accept your blocks, then the blocks are worthless and it's not possible to defraud anyone with it.
If not all market participants verify all the rules, things get nasty. If it's possible to create a block that is accepted by *some* market participants, you could create a fork on the network and the attacker would be able to spend the same coins twice. Among other things. That's why a sufficient number of market participants must run a full node to keep the network secure.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:28:54
That is why, in my example, you continue mining blocks with 6% of the hashing power of the bitcoin network, which is sufficient to out-race the rest of the BCH miners (most of the network is mining the main chain, not the BCH chain).
Essentially you are 51% attacking the chain. What's different here is that you get 15 million dollars in 4 days for doing so and what constitutes a 51% attack is actually within reach of many miners. Put another way, the security of the minority chain is really bad because there are many actors that already have the hardware available to attack it, and attacking it is actually financially attractive.

You still have a house and property to exchange. The fact that the structural integrity of the house was reduced as a result of collision with a aircraft is a detail. A detail that influences the value of your property without actual transactions taking place.
I see a slight logic error in your reasoning. If the value of my house doesn't go up until exchange of similar property, what causes similar property to exchange at inflated prices to begin with? After all, if the value of my property doesn't change then neither does the value of similar property. Any similar properties should trade for the exact previous value and not a higher one unless market participants are just plain idiots. A second logic error is that this reasoning doesn't explain how the price for one-of-a-kind objects such as rare paintings can change.
If millions of people transact bitcoin at $3000 and one transaction of $1m comes through, you can infer that that last transaction provides poor information about the actual underlying value.
When people transact that doesn't give perfect information about the price. It just means that supply and demand met at that particular price point. It doesn't mean that that particular price point is the value, the supplier most likely isn't even a perfectly rational actor.

We don't need to determine the exact value of something. The question was wether value can *change* without a transaction. The aircraft collision example clearly illustrates that it can.

This isn't about the neighbors house but my house. What causes my house to trade at $310,000 rather than $280,000? The last traded price was $300,000. If I can't find any buyers until I drop the price, then the obvious conclusion is that the value of my property dropped without any transactions taking place. If I sell it for a higher price, the the probable conclusion is that it's value has increased. Keep in mind that the last traded price was $300,000. Clearly, something has happened between the last traded price and now. This something changed the value of my property without an actual transaction occurring.


The discussion wasn't about how market prices are determined. The discussion was that value can change without actual transactions occurring. I gave several trivial examples to illustrate this involving karaoke bars and aircraft collisons. In contrary to what you seem to think, value is not the same as last market price. The last market price merely gives information about value.

They are very different. When blocks become larger and larger, the decentralization of the chain grows less and less and at some point (unknown when that is) there will be only a few actors left, which can then change the rules of bitcoin very easily.
But with the lightning network, no such trade-off exists. Even when hubs are centralized, it is still easy to verify the bitcoin history. Owners of big hubs don't actually gain any power. They can censor your transactions, but that's possible today as well (miners can refuse to include your tx in a block, although that's not very effective... same with lightning).
And with the lightning network, you can choose who miners your transactions. So if there are any bad actors, you can just choose another hub. If you don't like the miners, you don't have much choice. It is also much less expensive to setup a hub compared to becoming a miner.

The price rises as a result of supply and demand. I know that the house I live in is worth more than at it's last transaction. How do I know that if no similar houses have been sold in years?

If the stock exchange is closed and apple releases a positive press release, the price of apple stock will rise immediately, even though no exchanges can occur until the market opens again.

If the goal was to find evidence of sockpuppeting, then you've failed miserably. The task you've trained the model on doesn't even have a first-rate relationship with the sockpuppet probability.

That is a fallacious argument. SPV works fine. it really does. But there is one catch: It only works when nobody uses it.
If a significant number of users use SPV wallets, then the blockchain can be manipulated in weird ways. You can spend coins that are already spent, bypass the blocksize limit, spend coins without providing the right private key, and bypass the 21m coin limit. Why isn't this happening today? Because only a small amount of low profile targets use SPV wallets and those small profile targets will immediately get notified by full node users when something goes wrong. Once the number of SPV users reaches a critical mass, the whole system basically falls apart. Bitcoin doesn't work if normal users can't verify the rules.
Think of it like the security of your bank. If everybody in the world uses an secure browser except you, it's not a problem. Nobody is going to launch an attack just to defraud you. If the whole world uses an insecure browser... that's an issue.

Yeah i don't see his point either.
Hell, even if you're neutral in the fork, it makes sense to spin up a node that support both forks to make it easier for the miners to choose. Even if a 2 MB block was found, the 2MB-block-nodes will switch back to a chain containing only 1MB blocks if that is the longest chain. If the 2MB chain stays the longest for a prolonged amount of time, that's called a consensus change, not an attack.

Some guy on the mailing list said that MD5 would still be a secure hash function for the purpose of proving some amount of work was done.

I should note that when *everybody* does that, it doesn't actually decrease the required bandwidth. The bandwidth of the network scales with the number of nodes, not the amount of connections. Lowering the max amount of connections will just push of the bandwidth requirements to someone else.

What do you mean show up on the block chain? Of course it doesn't show up in the blockchain if it's unconfirmed. The definition of being on the blockchain is that it's in a block.
As soon as you broadcast a transaction, it'll be in the bitcoin network. Websites like blockchain.info will allow you to browse transactions in the network that have not yet confirmed. But it is not guaranteed that if you broadcast a transaction, it will indeed end up in blockchain.info's view of the blockchain network. If you can't see it on one block explorer, it might be worthwhile to try another.

The attack vector is opening channels and send all funds to the other party. Then attempt to fraud by closing the channel by broadcasting an old state.
Normally, when you close the channel with an old state, the other side can publish a penalty transaction that allows it to take what's left in the channel. Ordinary, this should prevent the attacker from trying to fraud. However, when the channel is empty on one side, you might as well try to attack because there is nothing at stake.

Fabs (the factories that make chips) require significant research. This research is done mostly by intel (where?) and ASML in the Netherlands. Chips are not 'cheaper' in china. Almost all of the costs are research which is hard to outsource to countries with cheap labor. AMD doesn't make their own chips. Also if you look at where [globalfoundries]( has their fabs, they're all near big cities in high-income countries, and on top of my head, the same holds true for intel and TSMC
The chips are probably manufactured by intel or global foundries as they are the only one with the technology to manufacture at 14nm. It makes sense to manufacture at intel for various reasons, assuming they let you. They don't manufacture chips for competitors.
The chips are designed at the mining companies. Most of the higher-ups at the mining companies are probably former FPGA developers.

@_date: 2017-10-20 17:29:59
People hate it because segwit2x circumvented the conventional development process.
Normally, changes get proposed by developers, and then developers discuss about the changes and make improvements. and then developers create code and review and deploy it on testnet. The whole process is designed to avoid introducing contentious changes or bugs into the system.
Segwit2x circumvented all that. The agreement was drafted by an individual (i think?), without properly specifying it was. Later it got traction after multiple companies signed it. No opportunity was given to discuss the agreement. Some companies declared that they signed because they thought the developers agreed with the proposal, and that they felt it was either for or against.
Naturally, the developers blasted the agreement for circumventing all procedures.
You can read what one of the developers thinks about this proposal here:  Or view  for a somewhat outdated list of developers that support it.
The above discussion views the proposal by the process in which it was adopted. But it goes without saying that if this proposal had any chance of being accepted based on technical merits, they wouldn't have attempted to go through these channels. And indeed, many similar changes have been proposed and have been rejected by the developers. The following fork-attempts to push a blocksize increase through (XT, bitcoin classic, bitcoin unlimited, bitcoin cash) all failed and resulted in nothing else but a damaged community. I suspect that 2x will go the same way. I give the proposal almost zero chance of passing, but you don't have to look far to see the damaging effects this proposal had on the community.

At which point miners will spend tons of money in lobbying efforts to change to a POW function they magically already have chips for. Note that it's relatively easy to hide the fact that you have developed chips for a particular hashing function.
Yes we are doomed. But i think you are missing the point. Miners have relatively little power over the network, they are mostly only there to order transactions. We can manage with only a few miners as long as there are many nodes that enforce the rules of the network. The fact that miners have plenty of custom hardware that would be worthless in the event of a POW change or loss of confidence in the network, provides an extra deterrent for rogue miners. Mining wasn't designed to keep the network decentralized, it was designed to make attacking the network very expensive. That's why we sometimes measure network security as the amount of dollars required to perform a 51% attack.

Maybe because it takes time to develop ASICs and is very capital intensive. Ethereum has only been popular for a year. There is also the threat of future proof-of-stake.


You are just encouraging hardware manufacturers to keep their efforts secret. The fact that it is hard to create a ASIC for it, only increases the profits for the first person to pull it off. It is in the best interest of the security of the network to make it as easy as possible to create an mining ASIC. This dramatically decreases the chances security vulnerabilities are found that threaten the security of the network. Remember asicboost? Image that, but 100x worse.
Also, tens of thousands of dollars sounds pretty low... Try a few million.
Not to mention that your plan would put immense political pressure on devs. That works if your dev team consists of 4 people and there are no business that use it. It doesn't work at the scale of bitcoin.


It's impossible to solve, not just difficult. No matter what mining algorithm you choose, the economies of scale will always push miners to warehouses. The only reason it is still profitable to mine etherum in places with cheap electricity is because the price growth of the ethereum price outpaced the development of warehouses.

Yeah, that's the real question.
The act of calling the chain with the most proof of work BTC isn't necessary a bad idea. The problem is that they didn't clearly define how they are going to do that. From how the statement is written, it sounds as if they are immediately switching between chains based on proof of work, which of course sucks. If you want to spend your bitcoins from Xapo, you wont even know what you are spending.
They really need to state something like 'we will disable operations for some time after the hard fork and BTC will continue to be bitcoin for that duration.' so that you can at least know what you are spending or trading. I don't really care what they do, but they should clearly define it which they didn't. The only advice I can give to people who want to use Xapo around the time of the fork is to get your bitcoins away from there. Send them to bitfinex or something, at least they let you know which coins you are actually trading...
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:39:46
I think segwit2x requires the first block after the fork to be larger than 1MB.
If you don't do that, you risk wiping out the segwit2x chain as soon as the original chain gains more proof of work, because the original chain would still be valid under segwit2x rules (it isn't, because of the first-block-larger-than-1MB rule).

So paypal is free? Paypal does not charge customers to use their services as long as they are not receiving commercial transactions or use different currencies. According to your shitty definition, it's free.
For the record I'm not using this as an argument for bitcoin, I just want to say that your definition of free is misleading. Banks don't charge you directly, but that doesn't mean they are free. Banks charge businesses for their services. You buy a beer with chip card? Fee. You buy something online? Fee. You pay with cash at a shop and they deposit it at their bank? Fee.


In that case the fee is the inconvenience of not having access to your money until the banks it out, as well as the taxes that are being used to recover your money. Nothing is free.


Okay. I'm a bank and each month I charge $100 from 1% randomly selected customers. Is this risk or a fee? Obviously, it's both.

The problem is that if you are only connected to 2x nodes, you are banning all your peers and then there are no more peers to discover more peers from. This potentially results in a segmented network. 
When miners end up in different segments of the network, you get forks all over the place even if they use the same consensus rules.

Designing the chip isn't that hard. Printing the chips is the problem. There are only a few companies that do that (intel, tsmc, samsumg. Maybe more) and production capacity is limited, so you will have to out-bid either amd or nvidia or give intel a lot of money to let them print your chips for them as they generally don't like to print their competitors chips.
I found a price sheet online where you can order small production runs:  You're looking at 18k per mm^2 printed at 22mm, which is pretty old (every node size halving gives approximately 4x power improvement). Apparently it's not possible to print small production runs on a newer production process (16~10nm).
I also did a bit of ugly math with the die sizes of some recent GPU's, and arrived at about $0.5 per mm^2. But those prices only come into play if you order a billion dollars of chips. I suppose there are significant costs associated with preparing your design for printing.

But you didn't contradict what he wrote at all.
The basic idea behind asic resistance is that you can design an algorithm for which an existing piece of silicon is optimal. Or in simpler words, it's impossible to build a piece of silicon that is better at that algorithm than some existing chip.
But anyone with some knowledge about circuits will be able to tell you that the above is a logical fallacy. It's not a question if you're able to improve a chip for a specific task (and thus break asic-resistance). The question is how much money you are willing to throw at it. And as soon as someone decides to throw that money at it, we will end up with much larger centralization problems than we currently have with bitcoin.

The exact amount depends on the receiving bank. You can view the per-transaction costs for business accounts at my bank here: 
Before you say: that's not how it works, I don't pay any fees. Keep in mind that paypal and credit cards are also free under that silly definition. The merchant incurs a cost to receive your transaction and includes that in it's price. That is also a fee even if it's hard to define what the exact amount is. The merchant also incurs costs of running a bitcoin node, that is also something you (the customer) pays for.

His computer science definition of scale is correct. If you had an algorithm that scales linearly, most of the time you would say that it doesn't scale depending on the context. With sidechains/lightning network you can get better than linear scaling which is highly desirable if at all possible.

At this point yes. Once the market cap of zcash grows you can forget about that argument. It's not a question if it's possible. It's a question of how large the market cap needs to be before it becomes profitable.


Great. I'll start lobbying for a POW change right away. Of course, I'll have the chips ready! It should be easy to fabricate a sibyl attack in order to convince the devs ASICSs have been developed and the current mining algorithm should be changed. I'll just buy tons of GPU's and mine at a loss temporarily. Once the PoW function is changes I'll be raking in lots of cash.
You're just setting the dev team up for political pressure and backroom deals.


That doesn't do anything. If the algorithm is deterministic you can make ASICs for it, and the harder is is to create ASICs the greater the centralization effects. If it's somehow controlled by outside sources (i.e. the devs) then you are just opening them up for political pressure.

I think the damage being done here is being vastly overestimated.
The process of running 2x nodes alongside core nodes doesn't harm either of them at this point. Transactions are valid on both chains, and so are blocks. Only after the 2x chain starts producing larger blocks, it becomes a problem. 
What kind of problems? Well, miners produce invalid blocks, and nodes start banning each other. If we are really unlucky, the network can partition and we get more forks. But after the dust has settled (which basically happens after a few blocks have been mined) both networks should be functional without any problems.
The critical point here is that problems occur because miners are producing invalid blocks. That's not a common scenario. If I wanted to disrupt the network with a lot of hash power, I can do so. I don't need nodes for that.

The original bitcoin client didn't have a blocksize limit, but satoshi added one later for well-documented reasons.

So you're fine with developers arbitrary deciding which mining company lives and which does not. How is that not centralization?
What if I have a huge mining farm with NVIDIA GPU's and my competitor has a huge mining farm with AMD GPU's. If the developers change the mining algorithm, there is a good chance one of us will make tons of money because the new algorithm will likely perform better on a certain brand GPU. If I was in that situation, I would surely bribe the devs to change the algorithm to something that works for my hardware. This situation can only be avoided by not giving the devs such power in the first place. Please suggest measures how this situation can be "fixed", as you say.

Why don't we just increase the blocksize? We need &gt;1GB blocks for global commerce. We can do that but there are technical problems that we need to agree on how to solve. The bigger problem is that long before we arrive at 1GB blocks, we will have killed the ability for home users to download and verify the entire block chain.

The difference between the inflation and interest ratio determines the incentive to save money. If the interest ratio is -10% and the inflation is -15%, you are still incentivized to deposit money as the buying power of said money increases over time, even though the absolute amount in your account goes down. Likewise, if the interest ratio is 10% and the inflation is 20%, savers are going to have a bad time.
