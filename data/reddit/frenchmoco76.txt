From my understanding, Australia has systems where you can spend them on your bills and shit.
Based on your language sounds like you'd make that money just by spending coins :)
Maybe consider that instead?

You open a channel for say $20
You spend $15
You're left with $5
For now, you can't add more to the channel, either close or keep for that chance of maybe being able to spend the remaining 5, at least that's what I've come to experience.

I researched this, trying to bypass verification process. Buying flexepin and redeeming them at a few different sites.. although I haven't tried the process yet

I see you guys only using AUD. Any plans for expanding your range of currencies, like maybe CAD ?
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:07:20
No I use bitaccess, pop in any address and the funds arrive in minutes
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:59:24
Way too high, I buy a flexepin and redeem it fees are round 5%?

There's so many ATMs now though! It's a shame about the embassy though, could have been a cool story in 50 years
