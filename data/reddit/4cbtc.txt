I'd have to disagree.  The protocol is much a service to BTC as a leather wallet is a service to cash.

I wish people would stop comparing Bitcoin with credit cards.  Bitcoin is not a **service**.  It is a **currency**.
The reason that credit/debit cards are so convenient has nothing to do with the currency, but rather, because third-party payment processors are paid to serve as an instant, automated escrow.
Imagine if those services didn't exist for fiat just like they don't for Bitcoin.  Without a payment processor, the only way you could receive payment electronically in fiat would be with a wire transfer.  How fast and convenient is *that*?
The most obvious solution for paying in Bitcoin is to do exactly what is done for fiat:  Issue credit cards and debit cards that transact in Bitcoin.
What makes Bitcoin amazing is that, unlike fiat, you have an *additional* electronic option that involves no financial institutions.  You can make transfers directly from one person to another using a QR and waiting for confirmations.  This is *not* the replacement for credit cards, this is the replacement for handing someone paper and coins.
In fiat, if you can't pay with plastic, you pay with paper money.  In BTC, if you can't pay with plastic, you pay with electronic money.  Both can be made more convenient with a credit card terminal.
It'll just be icing on the cake if someone comes out with a BTC point-of-sale that makes direct BTC transfers as quick and easy as credit cards.  This could be as simple as adding a third option on the credit card terminals (next to Credit and Debit), that, when selected, displays a unique QR code and sends authorization to the register when the payment is received.  Probably could done with a firmware upgrade on the same terminals already at the store.

Same way you do with a bank account, use some intermediary (third party) processor to pull it from your store of money (bank account or credit card) or wallet (Bitcoin).

Since learning about Bitcoin, I've gained a big interest in currency, investing, and economics.  I had *no* exposure to that stuff growing up.  (Where I'm from, those topics are for wealthy people and businessmen.)  Those topics have given me a strong desire to became an entrepreneur.
I honestly don't think I would have become intrigued by those subjects had it not been for Bitcoin.  So, I think you're probably right.  I've learned a valuable lesson, and I think that in the end I will have gained far more from Bitcoin than I will have lost.
The Bitcoin giveth, the Bitcoin (and being dumb) taketh away.

Correct.  Might never go through, if there is never someone willing to pay that price.

In the IRC channel there used to be (maybe still is) a "Web of Trust" bot running.  It was a pretty clever thing, and I felt safe with it.  The guy I traded with was a regular in the room, and I had seen him do a lot of transfers with other people.  His WOT score feedback was good, as well.  Maybe someone else remembers that.
I can't remember why I didn't transfer cash straight to Gox, but for whatever reason, it was easier to get it from him than it was to get it from Gox.
True story though.

It seems overpriced if it's not certified normal category.
But, if someone buys one and needs a ferry pilot, I'll work for BTC. :)  Buy an airplane and have it delivered to your local airport without spending a single USD!

Sounds like you know the feeling.  I can't really complain, honestly.  I do still have (almost) one bitcoin.  So, in the end, my $100 investment is now worth $700.  Not a bad return.  It's just easier to be reminded about the $100k-&gt;$700 than it is the $100-&gt;$700.
Thanks for the comment.

Yea, there's probably more of us with some sort of BTC regret than there are without it.
