Tether is doomed to fail, imo. To each their own, but I will never buy that shit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:56
I bought when it was an all-time high at $8k and I was kicking myself because I’ve watched it all year. No regrets. Just do it...although at the rate it’s growing atm, I’d say it’ll crash a little soon. Maybe wait for that and buy in? Can never hurt to buy now though...it’ll go back up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:39:11
Cause shit was on sale!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:52
Bought in at ATH of $8k and am hodling on for dear life now. This is gonna soar back up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:25:03
Yeah I’m currently getting the last laugh right now too. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:42
Your friend is gonna be kicking himself in the ass this time next year.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:32
Download an app called Blockfolio and add all of your transactions. It will tell you separately which ones are profiting or losing, and the percentage.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:46
Someone just recommended this to me. I’m so fucking over Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:11
This is like reading an extra long, extra fucked up version of a Dr. Bronner’s label. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:51:53
I’m a woman that has to take shit from all of my male friends about buying into Bitcoin. I’ve tried to get my female friends on board and they think I’m stupid too. :(
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:17:11
I pulled the majority of my money out of there to buy bitcoin. I can afford to lose it, I guess, but if banks are gonna be playing Russian roulette with our money then they should be paying us more to keep it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:25:22
If my battery holds out. At this rate, it may actually be possible.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:43:07
New person here. Bracing myself for potential slaughtering. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:20:46
Love you guys
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:59:34
My purchase last night is not supposed to come in for another 8 days. Overload? Still don’t know why you’d be disabled. Hope there are some people that can explain this.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:19:36
Lmao. I like to live dangerously. All this fucking Blockfolio refreshing.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:35:13
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:13:37
Of course. It tells you where it comes from if you check the individual product out. My Retin-A Micro came from Turkey. Never had a problem with them and I’d rather pay $50 for my Wellbutrin XR than $300 here. Fuck it. That site is a godsend for a lot of people. They even sell Hep-C treatment drugs for DIRT cheap. It’s supposedly like $90k for 3 months of a couple scripts for that here (and they sell out of it ridiculously quick). I checked one of the scripts and it was like $5/pill or something. On top of that, it’s substantially cheaper if you buy in bulk. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:11:53
Same. If it can get lower and stay there until payday, I’ll be golden.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:55:47
Aaaaand I can’t even transfer to Coinbase. This is royally pissing me off.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:24:53
And at the slightest hint of government takeover, I’m pulling out. Government interference (or being beat by an alt), imo, is the only way I can see Bitcoin failing. This shit is keeping me on my toes. I don’t like it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:18:18
I told myself if I can get up to $20k, I’ll cash it out for a down payment on a home. Good job. I got in late but this makes me feel hopeful.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:02:42
Yeah antidepressants too. Fix your healthcare shit, America. Bitcoin FTW.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:39:59
To be fair, it was pretty hard to predict the drop size considering the potential scare tactic at hand with this Tether scandal. I honestly figured it would be worse, and according to some of my friends that have been in this way longer than me, the worst is still yet to come, as they believe that it’s impact is going to be much stronger than it’s currently being perceived. I personally think it’ll bounce back hard if that’s the case though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:50:12
There are two types of people in this world.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:42:05
So buy? Or get the hell out of dodge?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:12:16
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:13:27
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:29
Yasss! I bought in at $8k a couple weeks ago. It’s been a hell of a ride and I can’t wait for it to fly back up again!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:48
RIP your inbox
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:44:05
So you’re not a millionaire, AND you’re an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:19:20
I know it just came out, but the guy that shared this is somewhat of an analyst. He can tell how Bitcoin will perform just by watching Tether and right after he says it will crash, it does. He has been trying to move all of his Bitcoin for weeks now because he senses a ridiculously large correction over this, be it in preparation of a legit Tether audit or government crackdown on their USD “backing” (but not really cause their legal disclaimer basically deems Tether worthless and Tether claims it is not responsible for any cash exchange with its currency). I trust his knowledge and expertise in the subject, so it’s freaking me out. 
Thanks for not immediately down-voting me. Seems like if you post something concerning or negative in this sub, you just get down-voted to hell.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:28
Lucky bastard
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:45:02
I’mma watch it burn and buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:01:00
I’m hodling and waiting for a real dip to buy like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:43:06
How low can you go? ���� 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:47:44
This hurt to read.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:12:03
What does this mean? I’m a newb so I’m just seeing Bitcoin at $8.1k and am confused. Is it gonna go up?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:47
Bitfolio showed me it was at ~$9,050 a couple mins ago. Bitcoin going apeshit. Wish I had more money to buy this dip but I’ll miss it. *cries*
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:28:04
I buy prescription acne medication from a Canadian site called InhousePharmacy.vu and they offer a 10% discount for Bitcoin payment. They are legit. Been using them for years.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:48:11
In this for the long haul. Hodling for a brighter future.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:54:13
It’s gonna be fun trying to sleep tonight. Too excited. I feel like I should be worried but kinda feels like Christmas cause you know this shit is gonna rebound hard.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:42:46
It’s true, but I just got in a few days ago and I’ve yet to experience the rollercoaster effect of Bitcoin, so I’m overly excited for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:30
Too poor to buy, too smart to sell. Hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:21:10

@_date: 2017-11-25 23:46:25
My first transaction on Coinbase cost me $36.50. :(
All my friends told me that is who I needed to go through and I didn’t realize I fucked up until after the fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:38:08
Yes I keep stalking Blockfolio in disappointment. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:25:24
It wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t have to send a code text to my phone every time I try to transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:19:50
Why private message when we can just post our questions to this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:42:30
This is why I didn’t invest a month ago. I was just short of the $5k something to buy a whole one. I like knowing that I can split my money up into increments instead of just throwing a large lump sum at it...that being said, I’d probably be super happy had I done that a month ago,
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:53:50
I tried signing out of GDAX and signing back in just now...still not working. I’m gonna try to move the coin back to Coinbase and try again. Such bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:46:46
No fees. If you transfer from Coinbase straight to your wallet, you get hit with Coinbase fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:27

Are you still employed? Are you still an American?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:47:41
Why is this being flagged as a “bad link”? The link works and these are legitimate concerns in the bitcoin world. I’m sorry if this post isn’t a bitcoin jerkfest, but I’m tired of this kind of stuff getting flagged.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:18:49
No idea. This shit is crazy. A little scary.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:49:57
Do it. It’s only going up.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:40:30
Any particular reason why they’ve disabled it? I just bought my first bitcoin last night through Coinbase so this is concerning.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:48:11
I’mma watch it burn and buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:30:55
Oh fuck that then. I didn’t realize it was Bcash. I won’t be delving into that.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:54:35
Yeah I need to just wait for my alerts to go off. I’m driving myself insane. I’m hodling but I wanna buy more so I’m waiting for a dip. Then again if it soars, I’m cool with that too, obv. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:39:21
Fuck. I’m anxious about all this activity and my coins just sitting in the exchange. Thanks though. I’ll keep trying.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:33:13
Thanks. I realized that after I posted and facepalmed a little.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:19:32
Is that a VPN? I don’t even know how to mess with that, but it’s an extra level of protection you could take I guess (let me know if I fucked that up lol). There’s always a chance that customs will seize your package but I’ve never had that problem. They don’t sell “controlled substances”, but I have seen a few abusable drugs on there like gabapentin (I’m still baffled they sell that honestly). I’ve used them for over two years now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:24
I’m waiting for this. It’ll happen eventually.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:11:03
Just bought at $8500 and it hurt so bad to do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:44:04
God I hope you’re right. I jumped in at $8k in November so I’m sweating now. I refuse to sell and my bf thinks I’m crazy. I just really believe that there’s going to be huge adoption eventually. What really scares me is government interference.
