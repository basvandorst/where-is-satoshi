You are right, money run by Chinese must be political money. We should never accept it, let's kill those miners.
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:30:35
Actually, this guy(author of those articles) is a publicly known clown in China.
@_date: 2016-12-14 22:27:33
yeah, miners are always wrong, core are always right. we donot care whatever they do.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:44:30
Actually, the leader of core says, @_date: 2016-12-09 11:34:28

It is easy to understand. You can only see those who agree with you. But you selectively ignore those who are against of you. Not like here, Chinese forums are open. However, you cannot read Chinese.

Charlie Lee is not bitcoin miner
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:38:07
not the reason, It happened almost two days ago in China time
@_date: 2016-10-21 07:21:43
But, the transaction fee of bitcoin is too high
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:46:03
well, most miners in China have already said they wont support soft-fork segwit since miners do not do things going against their interests.
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:54:46
Here is the link
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:21:30
Due to the reason you do not know in this sub. Someone may already reply you. But you can not see it.
@_date: 2016-10-24 07:18:18
Yes, btcc didn't
@_date: 2016-10-24 07:20:01
These talks are in wechat group with important miners(btcc is not invited). They did not announce it officially.
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:47:09
However, the price move is leading by China this time. And In every Chinese forum, people think it is a very big good news.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:04:06
Well, please just go ahead, the decentralization of CryptoCurrency market share need more efforts from bitcoin core!
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:04:32
This is totally caused by ViaBTC's annoucement. People in Chinese forums think it is good news
@_date: 2016-10-24 10:19:10
Please go to another sub, you cannot see my reply here, you know the reason

I'm also a altcoin holder, so I really thank core

Samson Mow is nothing in China, he is a clown.
It is hard to say if he is a double agent. I find that a lot of hate to core in English world is caused by Mow's stupid words.
He uses silly words to atrract a lot of people on twitter and make people to hate core, creating the Illusion that he is a influential guy.
But actually, he is nothing in China.
@_date: 2016-10-14 06:20:44
you are wrong, he is actually talking about segwit, greg and theymos's policy trying to modify bitcoin as a settlement layer
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:43:46


But all the active core developers are extremists, they hate Segwit2x...
