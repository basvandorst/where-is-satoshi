I certainly won't. 
- Never give agents of oppression credibility by responding to their coercive ideas. Instead, acknowledge the regulation, never the people behind it, obey if necessary. Going forward, encrypt!

You are the early adopter for everybody who adopts later.
Rich people today are mostly rich because they have figured something out the rest has not. They are likely adopting before the John Doe does. Thus, John pays as always.

That's an interesting work-around! - Thanks

Yes, but it is no different to what we have. You have to wait until the transaction is in the blockchain.

There are multiple ways and you should hold on to this thought as it could become invaluable to solve many of Bitcoin's problems. - For now, it's too early to discuss.
One interesting approach that is being tested:
The general consent is probably along the lines of Peter Todd: 
“ensuring that miners do not have the information needed to selectively censor (blacklist) transactions”
- The “one-mempool-faction”
On the other hand, you have Transaction Tiering: “facilitation of direct communication between users and” hash power.
- The “pro-choice-camp”

No, that is not possible. The worst would be that the transaction is rejected.

PS: Transaction tiering is already starting:

Double spend implies that they add the same output twice. What you describe is a simple scam: Person A promises you to pay for you to person B but pays instead to person C.
If you send a (private) transaction to a miner the recipient of the transaction has to wait until it is included in the Blockchain.
