Nobody has yet implemented an easy-to-use UI for it. Part of the problem is that the user has to generate a public/private key pair for every transaction. If the marketplace automates that process, then there is no security, since the marketplace knows the private key. So the user has to use a local wallet like Electrum to generate the transaction, which is a step that many users don't want.
Evo supported multisig transactions, but almost no vendors actually supported it, and the vendors that did support it reported that almost nobody ever actually used it.

Unless the seller and the market are one and the same, or in cahoots.

This is tricky, of course, since there is nothing stopping the same person from creating a DNM and an escrow service, especially if tens of millions of dollars are the potential payoff. The challenge is that any legitimate escrow service will be unlikely to participate in large amounts of black market sales. (Until you get to truly large amounts, in which case you can apparently use an international bank to launder drug and terrorist money, and not go to jail--but at that point, you hardly need Bitcoin, do you?)

2/3 multisig. The third party is the market admin.

A possible vulnerability in 2/3 multisig us if the market set up fake vendor accounts that mirrored actual listings (with small changes to disguise it). Fake vendor orders would be passed to real vendors for fulfillment. When enough money is outstanding, the market closes all the fake vendor orders and runs.

Yes, this nuanced interpretation is what I was hinting at. All I'm saying is that people should not leave their interpretation at, "multisig would prevent this." Multisig is good, but if you think it's perfect, that's where you'll get taken.

I don't disagree that blockchain analysis might be useful for law enforcement. Maybe I should have been more precise: are there resources available to the average person that might unmask an identity in this way?

Let's say an average Bitcoin user.

2/3 multisig. The third party is the market admin. Any two of the three can complete the transaction.
