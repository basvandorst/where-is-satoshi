I live in New York and I have to pay my rent with a cheque. Not just me but everyone, it's so weird!  No one really uses online payments. Australia really is so far ahead with that sort of thing. Anyway thanks for letting me know, that is interesting!

What are you going to reply to her?

Hi Aussie. I'm an Australian expat and have been living in the us for the past 6 years. I'm curious how bitcoin is perceived in Australia at the moment.

*Sigh* And this is exactly why I don't mention anything about bitcoin to my family.
