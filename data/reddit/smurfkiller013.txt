Sell your Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash now and be rich this time next year ��

I don't get it, he's not falling through the floor
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:30:38
You don't think it'll crash again?

€1000, here we come ��

Bclassic probably has a year to live, if that's what you mean
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:14:27
Yes let's celebrate the downfall of Bitcoin classic, long live Bitcoin Cash ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:09:30
Sounds about right ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:22:44
The old Bitcoin variant, as opposed to the new Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:52:03
RemindMe! 4 years
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:23:13
And yet it's happening :)
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:32:04
Nice! Tell your friends ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:15:45
And it's called Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:48:04
You need a driver's license to buy BTC? Where?
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:51:55
And now we wait...

@_date: 2016-12-11 09:44:24
Why not leave it out? How the fuck are they going to prove what Bitcoins are whose anyway
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:18:44
This sums up the entire subreddit. Shut everybody up (aka ban them) if they don't agree with you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:42:23
Meanwhile r/bitcoin is controlled entirely by one company, but that's surely okay.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:44:40
Let's hope so, at least they'll be able to make a transaction for an affordable price
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:30:34
Doesn't matter if they're being paid
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:51:20
I love this safe space. No, BCH is not BTC, we're not going to degrade BCH to that level
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:07:26
Oh I did, you're about to see why. It's not too late to get in
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:20:40
Just get a paper wallet, save the public key somewhere you can access easily (so you can deposit easily) and hide the private key somewhere like a safe or bank deposit box
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:52:08
Yes, if you have the private key. The Core software will never add support for 2X, so you'll have to swap it out for another client to continue after the 2X network upgrade
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:56:22
Yes, just uninstall core and install a node that supports 2X. Given you even want to run a node at all, of course, for most uses a paper or physical wallet is more than enough
