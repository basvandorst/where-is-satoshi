If you're referring to people ruining their lives by investing in bitcoins, then no that's not what entertains me.

As a matter of fact this is a great idea.


USD but in cash stolen from banks and victims, I doubt they will accept any wire transfers from international banks, or have the means to do so. 
One of the most important aspect of a financial institution is monitoring suspicious activities to fight crime/fraud and money laundering. But also to protect consumers from all these illegal activities. I'd rather pay transaction fees that can help pay for an insurance rather than playing with fire using Bitcoin.

I know that gym, it's 5 mins from my house. It's located in an old building and is always empty, only regulars train there. Let's say there are 1000 members, probably only 1-5 have bitcoins, and I am sure none of them will pay gym fees with BTC because they prefer holding it until it "skyrockets" for profit. That ATM is there to gather dust.

That's why bitcoin is bad and can fund terrorism and crime. But "it doesn't need regulation or financial institution hurrr durr huheheuhe" well, this is what you get.
