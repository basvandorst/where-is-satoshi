Recently, some BTCs from one of the address linked to Bitvanity malware (referred here  started moving. 
The address: 
the transaction in question: 
goes here: 
now, the last transaction of the above address ( sends funds at 1526xfWVCnsbMXT8XKN5J7q53TeKiSqy5Z and 13p4zncq6m3Ax7tvKhEG2k49hgwfS5g7ic 
I just found out that 13p4zncq6m3Ax7tvKhEG2k49hgwfS5g7ic belongs to Bitstamp. Would I be right to assume that the person behind Bitvanity (and therefore Stealthbit) sent some stolen funds to his Bitstamp account?
Just want to make sure before starting legal process.

I reported this to Github 4 days ago, exchanged a few mails with a security representative, and that was it. Still available to download...
Same thing happened when I reported Bitvanity, took them a long time to actually do something and take it down.

I empathise man... had 60 BTC, lost 20 to bitvanity, and 40 to labcoin (fraudulent asic startup). Could have lived happily for quite a few years with that amount....
Hopefully will get these guys, I ll keep updating the thread in bitcointalk with any news.
Sorry again, wished more had been done to prevent this

He buys $4M worth of BTC, she sells $4M worth of BTC... no wonder the markets are screwed

I would recommend extreme caution when using such software. 
I just registered to reddit after seeing this post so to warn people.
Last summer, in my infinite wisdom, I downloaded a Mac app call Bitvanity from Github ( It came out to be a malware that empties your wallet. (lost more then 20 BTCs).
Reference:  -  This was discussed on Reddit as well, but can’t seem to be able to find the post now.
The OP of this thread is called trevorscool, his github account  under the name Thomasrevor.
Bitvanity github account was under the name Trevory (T.Revor.Y you get the drift).
Thomas Revor - Trevorscool - Trevory…. Looks a bit suspect.
Also, looks like trevorscool has been deleting a few posts of his from 7 months ago:
compared to:
The 3 deleted post are inciting people to download/use Bitvanity + link to Bitvanity Github:
 
and 
Would hate to see other people hit their head on the wall… believe me, it hurts.

I think such noble cause is worth supporting. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:45:22
Ho ok, sorry about the misunderstanding :]

It's working with all tested countries so far; US UK Switzerland Spain Portugal Romania Sweden and Singapore. Maybe it was just temporarily down...
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:04:27
Not sure, it is still up for me 
As I said in another comment, maybe some providers block it.
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:03:11
It's not down for me -  
Maybe different countries/providers block it? I ll try different countries with VPN and report
