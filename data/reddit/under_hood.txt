Oh man I feel you. Had to pay 39% on BTC back home :(. Yet in my home country you need buy your own toilet paper if you go to hospital because there is none. Nurses will even beg you to buy some for other patients who have no one to care for them. It's just supporting mafia... (=goverment). Damn at least there should be lower taxes for those who didn't vote for winning party.

They still exist (didn't go bankrupt) only thanks to stealing (legally but still) taxpayers money. Yet he has no shame opening his mouth on bitcoin which is against all odds successful without anybody giving it freebies and bailouts. That man just pissed me so much.

Oh surprise surprise... they are not really worried about Bitcoin being used for money laundering. What they really want is to be the only ones to do it :D

Yeah Bitcoin Judas should be forever remembered for this Fraud he tried to pull off.... Just today i told about Bitcoin to one friend who became interested about it (and apparently never heard of it before).... I told her: To start you should install bitcoin wallet on your phone... Just go to the Store search for bitcoin and install the first/most popular one (which is on android -&gt; Bitcoin Wallet, the official one). Not knowing she has iPhone she tried to do it and installed bitcoin.com wallet in process (was the first one with Bitcoin in the name on Ios)... This makes me think how many poor souls did he scammed this way... Luckily i told her to immediately throw that phone in the water after i learned from screenshot she installed bitcoin.com LOL.. ok serious now... I told her to immediately delete it and install proper one :D

Pattaya Beer Garden... Just at the end of walking street behind the "gate". Finding it is bit hard because it is on pier (over the water) therefore it is behind other "bar girl bars" but behind them the restaurant is very nice. Spent 8 months in Thailand. Enjoy

Yep i have to say-&gt; Even in case i would be pro big blocks I wouldn't be pro BCash because of how (hostile takeover attempt) they do it (sneaky, back stabbing).... Fooling newcomers with the bitcoin com site etc.etc.

Just imagine how this self righteous banker a-holes must feel about what they see as group of hackers and kids creating asset/currency that outperformed everything... All that out of nothing in garage. IMHO they must be furious.

Besides they did circumvent even fiat limitations when I was there (something over half year about 6-8 years ago). There was official exchange rate of  6 peso per 1 euro but if you took cash with you, you could exchange on black market for like 11-12 per 1 euro. If I remember they called it dollar blue for some reason(the real rate in black markets). All people I knew asked me to bring cash for them if I can.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:39:15
But another thing I just recalled is how publicly black market exchanges were operating literally on the main streets (Lavalle, Florida... I may have messed the spelling) screaming cambio cambio, euro, dollars, reais.... So kind of strange... Like illegal but at the same time somehow accepted, overlooked.

Communism has killed more people than infamous German WW2 regime around the world. Many countries are still recovering from damage it has done to them to this day (incl. where I came from). It has tortured, killed and humiliated people and their families again and again if they were in any way not 100 % obedient to the regime... Whether politically, religiously or even for completely trivial reasons (nicely illustrated by lyrics of one song against communism that can be translated as: "children liked the ice cream man, judges were angry at the children, so they killed the ice cream man"). They wanted not only your work(money), they wanted to control even what you think. There are still huge number of people suffering and dying under communist regimes today! Communism worked on basic principle... Stealing and when there was nothing more to steal it collapsed.

Yep... Also quite good restaurant with excellent view is near boat terminal (one with big Pattaya letters) accepts bitcoin trough bitpay. Since I discovered it just at the time bitcoin price was skyrocketing from under 1000usd it was basically free meals. 
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:23:46
it doesn't even move me to be honest. I still remember times when everyone was saying it will never be worth more than dollar. Now it's over 10k here and there sooo....
@_date: 2019-09-11 09:39:35
Confirm here too. I moved to online banks almost exclusively for similar reasons.
1. Slow
2. Few times I have been sent to do some operation to the branch i had opened account in (across the country). Sighhhhh
3. Arrogance of The Old Banks !!
4. few times found actual errors by bank (doubled transaction etc.)
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:31:32
Well I guess of it becomes big enough issue (lot of people running to bitcoin) for government to notice they will try to control BTC too. But they have very few options how to do so (if any... Tech savvy people will just use VPNs etc. To circumvent any attempt to block bitcoin) compared to fiat where they just issue law and all banks have to comply.
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:12:23
Looks like the site you are looking at requires 6 blocks to consider your transaction to be confirmed. So far only 4 blocks has been mined since your transaction was included into the blockchain. You just need to wait a bit longer.
Not all sites need 6 confirmations (some might be ok with less some might require more) but 6 is kind of considered standard.

F2Pool is in as well now

It's clear F2Pool wants this vote to fail for whatever reason. They are stalling on purpose

Yep, of course they have every right to not signal BIP91 now. But it's annoying since we are so close to 80%
