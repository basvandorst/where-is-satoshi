Excellent, thanks for posting this!

Early this year I found this great resource on philanthropy: 
I don't operate on the same level as the Pineapple Fund but I do intend to spend most of my funds within my lifetime directly on underappreciated artists in the form of [private commissions]( with the intention of making them available for the public to see. Regarding checks and balances, I suppose the next commission, or all future commissions, can always be revoked.

For what it's worth, John McAfee once said that Bitcoin will hit 100 billion in 25 years.

To be fair to Coinbase, you can transfer the Bitcoin from Coinbase.com to Pro.Coinbase.com and withdraw the Bitcoin for free from there.

Wonderful, thank you very much for doing this.

I'm hoping that this will spark the next generation of public gifts: museums, libraries, foundations, research grants, angel investing, parks, art and architecture. You put this kind of money into the hands of good people, and they will do amazing things with it. You can basically sponsor your own Renaissance.

Divide the potential market cap by ~16-19 million Bitcoins.

Transfer to GDAX and then send it from there.

The current peak is only base camp for the next mountain.

An equivalent 83% decline from $1163 to $152 would be from $4,000 to $520, and then staying under $1,000 for two years.

BitPay has an option to use a VISA debit card, so that's what I need right now.

As Andreas Antonopolous says, you should be ecstatic that it fluctuates on an upward curve over time and not a downward one. Currently **I lose 15-30%** trying to wire transfer to other countries.

I would look for something really compelling to spend it on. For example I really want to help certain artists succeed by commissioning their work. If their payment multiplies many times over, 10x, 100x, 1,000x, 10,000x, it becomes less of a transaction, and more of an unleashing of long-term potential. If it was worth doing for a price, then it will still be worth doing if money is of no consequence. It is the creation of the work that is meaningful, not the monetary reward. Not even who owns the work, because if it's good enough it becomes part of the world's heritage. The sooner that plays out, the better. No one is getting any younger. The artists don't have 10-20 years to wait for Bitcoin to mature before I start commissioning them. I'd much rather spend it this way than on consumables, events, or traveling. Meanwhile I'd happily work any job to help replenish the Bitcoins.

My belief is that there are thousands of talented living artists around the world today that need the backing of patrons to flourish. Most people don't realize how good they are because they can't afford to show you what they can really do! If I was in your position I would start the equivalent of Y Combinator for artists. Or maybe a privately funded artist-in-residence program with dozens, if not hundreds, of hand-picked artists being freed from financial strain to do what they do best. I have seen with my own eyes that some of the most talented artists in the world struggle to put food on the table. In the best case scenario, I could imagine all of their work being featured in new museums around the world funded by the wealth generated by cryptocurrency.

I believe it is $0 if you transfer the funds to GDAX and move it from there. Coinbase charges arbitrary "ease of use" fees.

This only begins to solve the problem of international commerce. Public and private postage, import duties, export duties are just as corrupt as the banks.

Love it. And to think, the slower moving institutions are still 5-10 years out from making a move

2009, I'm in my dorm room and I start reading this thread on SomethingAwful about how Bitcoin will be the future of money. I don't think much of it because the price of 1 BTC is 0.0001 USD. Yeah, right, like that's going to do anyone any good. I spend a brief time trying to buy some to no avail, and give up.
The next time I see it it's $600 and I brush it off as being too crazy, too volatile.
The next time I see it it's crashing from $2,800 to $1,800 and I brush it off as being too crazy, too volatile.
It's not until I download the redesigned Twitter app that I discover that people are speaking intelligently about it, and in direct contact with the developers. It's the Twitter threads that finally get me to act, but not before several months distracted by
Litecoin. Although it took 8 years to do something, better late than never!
I signed up for Twitter in 2008, but didnt understand what it was good for. My ignorance of Twitter went hand in hand with my igorance of Bitcoin.

Nope, but if someone owns a prominent wall, we must make one that does.
