The system preserves a record of every bitcoin transaction (including [splits/merges]( all the way back to when the bitcoin^1 was created.  This ledger of sorts is stored as a chain of blocks.  
My understanding is that each [block]( is gaining transactions meanwhile everyone is computing hashes on a random number concatenated with that gradually growing block (and perhaps some other data^2).  Once someone "wins" the hash "lottery", their block becomes a new entry in the chain.
This is part of the reason they try to keep the hash solution to around 10 minutes, so that people don't have to wait too long for their money to go through the system.
*^1 I use "bitcoin" as a simplification, don't think of a bitcoin as exactly 1.0 bitcoins when I use the term there, as there are splits and merges as transactions occur.
*^2 [the other data](

There's too much focus on the 50 bitcoin bonus.  
The point is that you get money for running nodes that keep the bitcoin network in operation.  
The "lottery" aspect of it is that the system needs a way to agree upon how and when to periodically "settle" a set of transactions, preferably approximately every 10 minutes. This is accomplished by creating a hash threshold that should take about 10 minutes to find given the current network participation level (difficulty), and then accepting a settlement "block" from the first PC on the network to reach or exceed that threshold.
Currently, you get a bonus of 50 bitcoins (plus voluntary transaction fees for those who elected to get higher priority) as an incentive to help keep the network in operation, but this is only being done as a way to seed the network into existence.  Eventually, the bonus will decrease until the only significant amount you receive for successfully settling a block will be the transaction fees.  Once the bonus shrinks to insignificance, the network should be robust and will no longer need the bonus bitcoin incentive to keep people running on the network.

I wonder how soon they plan to start implementing supernodes or whatever they have in mind to handle this.  I can't imagine many people are going to be pleased to realize bitcoin will soon need to download and store ¾GB+ of data on your drive just to recieve a transaction.  I'm currently at 716MB for %APPDATA%/Bitcoin and I only learned of bitcoin a couple days ago :)

Perhaps this is yet another reason why these efforts are taking so long to implement.

The goal is to maintain the time for someone out there to find a "winning hash" to happen approximately every 10 minutes.  My understanding is that 10 minutes was determined to be the optimal time to collect transactions and "settle" them, as there are tradeoffs to making it too short or too long.
Every two weeks, the system evaluates the pace at which these hashes are being found and increases or decreases the difficulty to help steer the interval closer to 10 minutes.
The system increases or decreases the difficulty by narrowing or widening the window for "winning" hashes.  Rather than have this window be a random range of hashes, it is instead any hash between 0 and a maximum number.  You can find the current maximum number [here](  
As of this writing, it is 


This means the current [probability]( of any particular hash "winning" is


Most modern computers can produce between a million and a billion hashes per second.
As more computers get involved and hashes get solved more quickly, the maximum number will be lowered to make it take longer to find a new "winning" hash.

One problem with these calculators is that they don't take into consideration the rate that the difficulty is increasing, and we are due for a difficulty bump really soon now.

Keep in mind the hashing isn't just a way to hand out bitcoins, it's also keeping the system itself working.  
From many comments I've read, most people are already at the point where the energy costs exceed or equal the payout.  Eventually bitcoin amounts will be smaller and farther between, and those who have the winning hash will earn more from transaction fees than from the bitcoin generation.
I'm not sure why the khash varies so much, mine stays pretty consistently +/- 10% when I watch it.  Keep in mind 5000 khash/s is mostly a sort of long shot lottery, as it would take on average 1565 days to win a hash at the current difficulty (which is very likely to go up significantly in the next two days).
Just for fun I have coin generation on with my desktop (set to use one cpu), but my primary interest isn't with mining.  What I'm probably going to do is use bitcoin to "garage sale" a bunch of stuff in my storage unit without all the eBay/paypal red tape and risks.  
I'd also like to see more sites offer tip jars for bitcoin, as that is a perfect application for it.

If you're storing bitcoins for the long term:
* Create a new wallet by installing bitcoin in a VM or other computer
* Get an address for it, note it down for future use
* Back up the wallet.dat file somewhere safe and secure
* Delete the original wallet.dat file from the VM/computer
Now you can send money to this address for as long as you like, and it will still get there when you open that wallet sometime in the future.
This would work well as a "savings account" that you rarely withdraw from.

In addition to the fine responses you already received, you may also find more information on this topic on a bitcoin forum thread [here](

If I understand it correctly, while every node is searching for that next winning hash, they also accumulate and integrate transaction data into their hashing.  When a node wins, all of the transactions that they have accumulated are inherently part of the block (since they are part of the hash).
This is also why transactions can take a while to go through, since they might not have been propagated to enough nodes for it to chance upon a winner.  Adding a transaction fee will make your transaction spread more quickly as it will be more "popular" since the hash winner gets to keep it.
Here's more on scalability:

Also, when SSDs run out of writes, they can still be read.

Just to make sure you are aware that due to the way [difficulty]( is adjusted, if a lot of people join in on mining, you may never recoup your costs.  
I don't know the numbers, but in the brief time I've been learning about bitcoin, I've come across a lot of comments that seem to indicate that this point has already passed.  Some of them indicate the cost of electricity is more than the payoff.
With the awareness of bitcoin getting around very rapidly in the news in the past few days, I'd make contingency plans for use of the computer if you plan to go forward with it for mining.
Also, with the current average hash discovery rate being over 9/hr, there will very likely be another difficulty increase soon.

That's correct.  


Not quite.  The great thing about hashes is that once you have a hash, it takes next to no time (millionth to a billionth of a second) to validate against the original data.
Only one person gets the 50 BTC for finding the lucky winning hash, but (I think this is what you've read about) these days a lot of people seem to be joining "pools" to divide out the 50 BTC according to how much computation each participant contributed to the pool.

This seems likely, especially once super-capacitors become cheap and ubiquitous.

~~The transactions are sent as strings.~~  If 8 decimal places becomes a problem, the clients can be changed to add more precision.
Edit: I am dumb.  See bgeron's reply. :)

If you're buying that many, you should probably call AMD's corporate office. :)
