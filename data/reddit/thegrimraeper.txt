be honest with yourself, man.  if it was as heavily regulated as the other currencies it wouldn't be nearly as fun.  and the moment the mom and pop businesses start putting their life savings in it is the moment the gov't has no choice but to step in and protect them.
the first thing that would happen is the gov't would start running its own miners; then put their foot down on the exchanges to play by their rules; and then start manipulating the price.  what fun is that?

tell that to the wall street speculators who've made billions doing exactly that

I agree!  which is why I summarized my interpretation.  but I can only imagine that if he's given the same explanation to others, there would be at least a few besides me who've had the same reading.

if you think you're in the "despair" phase, then you're still in the "denial" phase.

I wouldn't call it a boat.  more like a dinghy.

if there is anything cool about bitcoin, it's this.  that's it's the wild-wild-west, and you can do whatever crazy shit you want and get away with it.  it's natural selection at its best, where only the strong survive.
quit acting like a pansy.  if you want regulation and gov't pampering, use dollars.

I know what it's worth.

so, to summarize my understanding of what you're saying:
* buying nearly anything with cash is easy.
* buying most things with bitcoin is difficult.
* buying bitcoin with cash is even more difficult.
* and this is why bitcoin exists (to make life difficult).
uhh, ok.  long live bitcoin!

interesting how when the price tanks, the lawsuits start flying
