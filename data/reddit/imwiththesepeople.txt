.com bubble also deserved to crash like so many of these shit coins... but today, the world literally runs on the successes... Amazon, Google, ebay, etc...

Hey thanks for the response. I think I need to learn more about how the lightning network works... It sounds like you're saying that once any company has a lightning node they can accept any currency with it not just Bitcoin? The lightning network is not specific to the coin it's created for?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:50:31
Really? This is your understanding of BTC? Same as ChuckECheese coins?

Bought at $750. Have been trading. Trying to predict what my tax rate might be?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:49:39
Remember, futures deal in dollars pegged to Bitcoin, not actual Bitcoin... So no they're not buying any Bitcoin to short it.... Unless I'm mistaken?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:49:50
Everyone "can mine" too,  but as we've seen it it's become decreasingly beneficial to do so for the individual... everyone can run a lightning node, but only the most capitalized nodes can handle lots of transactions,  so larger businesses will need larger lightning Network nodes, and those larger lightning Network nodes are going to be run by companies, not individuals, therefore centralization
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:34
I'm just learning about the lightening network, and apparently it has centralization issues as well, it will create BTC clearing houses owned by a few entities large enough to facilitate the volume,  and therefore, what's the point of bitcoin of you need centralized lightening network nodes

1 billion Is  .2 percent of the market, hardly a blip... you need 10-50 billion to even start to be noticed...

Already signed up for Gemini.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:08
Almost as crazy as that huge drop just now! Holy s***!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:44:17
It's hard to do anything when once you're even signef into the app, the app doesn't function properly, I'm clicking on my payment source and app is just Frozen. Never using coin base again.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:41:01
I see. Thank you
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:49:02
Can someone point to a resource where I could see this swing? I'm using the coinbase app, and I don't see at all what anyone is talking about
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:16:03
Stahp that. HODL.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:36:41
Thank you Captain Obvious
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:46:56
Is that... A triple negative? Lying... Didn't.... Less worried?
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:50:04
Also, general timeframe of occurrence would be helpful
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:18:34
So coinbase crashed... Can't log in 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:38
They have officially lost me as a user. This is bull s***
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:46:32
Upvote to the moon
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:21:05
Coin base... But no more, moving to Gemini tomorrow. Or maybe just cold storage. Have faith and hodl
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:58:47
I'm just not seeing the drop to 1080... 1170 is the bitstamp 24 hr low... What am I missing? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:52:37
Fucking fuming. Coinbase just cost me at least 2k. This is probably the worst news of the day... SEC decision aside, if we can't depend on the major exchange when we need it, what the f*** point is there . They have had more enough time to scale to accommodate for this, I have to conclude there's skullduggery.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:45:56
Agreed! I'm actually kind of glad the ETF didn't happen. Let's keep the oligarchy out of it as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:15:25
Source? SEC page still unchanged...
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:29:54
It's funny. I wasn't all in until my minor investment in bitcoin grew to be the largest piece of my finances. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:06
Sold at 9k can't decide to buy back in or stay out and wait for the crash. FOMO could screw me hard. Growth has been so fast with no dip!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:36:07
Find your center. Breath.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:56
I understand that if someone gets my password somehow they might not be liable, but that's on me. If their systems get hacked somehow it's on them and it is insured. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:27
No one ever talks about how coinbase has insurance for theft. They act like if you get your coins stolen that's it, but your actually insured against that in an exchange, while holding your keys has no insurance, and I bet home insurance companies won't care when your hard wallet goes up in a fire.

ME. TOO. FUCKING EXCRUCIATING. Please help me not FOMO buy! I've already been stung so hard. Lost 1.2 BTC so far from bad trades.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:15
I'm with you.

Buy when people are selling. Hold when people are buying.

I hear this a lot. It could become worthless tomorrow. Is there any actual functional situation that could happen or is this just a general warning about investing? It doesn't actually seem possible that it could be worth nothing in one day. Especially since if it did crash massively in one day, what would keep interested parties from getting excited and buying in?
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:18:34
I'm right with you. I had a moderately successful invention on the market for a few years, put the last of my royalties into Bitcoin when it was around 750. Was enough to buy 5 coins back then , and the dream of retiring by 40 is in the back of my mind too.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:41:58
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:49:36
That's an issue too... However I'm talking about when I try to open my app I get a message that coinbase is unavailable currently. Or when I go to Gemini, their mobile site is completely unresponsive. Transaction times are an issue as well, but basic functionality of being able to initialize a transaction is what I'm talking about here. Literally can't open the app because I'm guessing the traffic is too high at the moment. For some reason they're not taking adequate steps to accommodate for the increase in demand.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:33:50
Why would there be a last one out if adoption is increasing?
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:37:56
Okay fair enough. I'm of the opinion that these huge gains can be lost overnight, but there is now a decent sized floor that will not be swept out 
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:06:35
Jaxx doesn't insure against theft? The major exchanges do...
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:44:46
Ok maybe... , what kind of world would coordinate a compete ban overnight, especially when major economies are already incorporating digital currencies? That seems high unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:09:36
Why would it? It IS increasing... I'm not making that up... 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:54:21
Here fucking here. We're already trying to convince people to put their money into a radical concept... These functionality issues are seriously hurting the brand

This is called "building consensus through dialog" and I appreciate the sentiment
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:25:46
And Greece!
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:48:27
Same here. But I lost out on a 200 point swing in that downtime, cost me almost 1k. Unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:47:26
Free??? I think I'm owed a couple hundred of dollars in fees then, because they've definitely made money on me...
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:58:58
What kind of insurance?
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:37:53
But wait. How does "their country worth less" risk Bitcoin crash? Isn't that reason to buy more bitcoin? Why would you cash out of bitcoin into something you think is faltering? Patriotism? X-D   
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:46:00
BTC - radical concept. And I'm 100% with you brother! Down with the plutocrats.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:55:15
Take this shit sentiment to /btc
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:49:10
Agreed. I got off their basic wallet into gdax to avoid this very problem... Turns out gdax is just as bad

When I say ask he needs is Marketing, I mean quadruple the investment, if not more. In this world and INSANE at market, if a piece of art has actual merit (and many times not) is value is determined by the investor who makes it so. It's often been said, the only other thing as scarce as a master artists work is Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:19:58
If you would like to make a very good investment in fine art for 8 mil, I will sell you the career of an artist waiting to explode, who has done over 1 million in sales in his career. All he needs is marketing, his work is beyond critique for abstraction/non representational work.  We are a father son team, he is true genius and I am his agent.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:46:29
I don't think theyre not doing a good job at this point. They MUST be trying to control the market / stop panic selling
