I'm talking about top domains... They are all registered. I have no way to register a good domain for $10 because I have lost the time to buy it for that price.
The opportunity that I have now is to buy domains from $100 to $1k range to try to re-sell.

Bring new money to the table for those in need of it?
There are risk in this business. Including holding time, sales fraud and risk to buy a domain that wont be sold for a better price.

Someone told me once that domains are valued property that has real world value. I don't believe that someone that hold more food than me is a selfish person because someone else is in need of it in Africa. This is just a selfish idea. Buy and sell domains is just business as usual.

This is speculation. It is business as usual. It is legit. There are a domain buy/sell industry.
Why don't you sell a domain/site if you need money to pay your bills when you have no other way to get money somewhere else?
Well, you think like my grandfather that never agreed to sell land because land is sacred.

I need to figure out the price range for a top bitcoin domain because I want to invest in it. I believe domains like bitcoinpay.com is better than bitpay.com, no? Anyway this is investment. There is an industry doing this.
EDIT: I mean I want to buy and sell domains from bitcoiners.

It could be said the same for the bitcoin itself. Just change the subject you are replying. Why do you own more bitcoins than you need? You are contributing to make the bitcoin price high...

I would like to see price range from someone with a really good domain. Something like bitcoin.info, bitcoin.ws, bitcoin.mobi, bitcoin.asia (they are already registered) that would be good.

This is a good premium domain. Do you have any idea of the price range?

You buy bitcoins to store value and for profit. Then you make it difficulty for others to do the same. You make bitcoin price high.
I buy houses, land, sites and domains to store value and profit.
What make you different from me? Nothing. You just hat people like me as someone else hat you for what you do hoarding bitcoins.

I don't hold any of these domains but I think they are really good. Bitcoin.com then.
