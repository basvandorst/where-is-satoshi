That all depends on your time preference. Are you gonna hodl til people are measuring dollars in terms of satoshis (instead of measuring Bitcoin in terms of dollars), or are you in it just to make a quick buck? If the former, then no. If the latter, then my condolences.

I like **1** because it looks both like an "S" with a Lightning bolt over it, and like an "S" and an "N", for **S**atoshi **N**akamoto (I'm not sure which one of those you were going for, if either, but that's what I see when I look at it).
Though I think my favorite might be **4**. It's simple, unique, easy to write, and looks like links in a chain. All of them are great ideas, though!

If I understand your question correctly, then yes, it will. For instance, if you bought exactly 1BTC when the price was $5K, that investment would now be worth just under $4K. And when (not if, but *when* ��) it goes back up to $5K and beyond, that's how much your investment will be worth, in terms of dollars. Make sense?

I like it! Clear, simple, and just *happens* to resemble a bolt of Lightning! ⚡��

Hm. Possibly. I wonder if the relatively small number of new users via this one new Samsung phone -- as compared to the much larger current Bitcoin userbase -- won't make much of a dent in Bitcoin's price either way. Plus, if they do mess it up, I wonder how many of those new users would be quicker to blame Samsung (a centralized business, with plenty of central people to blame) than Bitcoin (a decentralized protocol with no central person to blame). Personally, I don't think this will affect Bitcoin's price much, whether they mess it up, or if it's the new "killer app". But we'll see!

I think there is. Unfortunately, I can't give this a try because Twitter keeps censoring my account, and never accepts my verification when I try to start a new account and prove I'm not a bot. Which is why I finally came to Reddit! ��

Yeah, sorry about that. You seem to know what I was talking about, but for those who don't know what azte.co is, here's a good video that explains it: 
Thank you so much! Yes, libertyx.com is exactly what I was looking for! ����

It means SegWit is working, and more people are transacting with Bitcoin than ever before. It is a very good thing. ��

It's a combination of all other currencies (whether crypto or fiat) being completely irrelevant, and Bitcoin hodlers getting tired of waiting for moons and lambos. They haven't learned the most important lesson that Bitcoin teaches, which is *the importance of having a low time preference.*

Perhaps, but the value of their token would first have to come from the money that greater fools had previously put into it, and their "self bailout" would really be no different than the leader of a ponzi scheme running off with everyone's investments. I guess in essence it wouldn't be much different than what they did in 2008, except it would be a little more transparent.

I agree with Ant0n61. Also, they'll still be receiving transaction fees along with the block reward, and even after the reward has gone down to zero. And those fees will be *very* valuable!
Actually (and I could be wrong about this), I thought that the reason hash difficulty goes up is because of more miners joining the network, which itself is a result of Bitcoin's value rising, not because of elliptic curve cryptography. But yeah, I could be wrong. Satoshi and others in the beginning of Bitcoin actually *did* mine for absolutely nothing for a while (because it wasn't worth anything yet), and afterwards for only the tiny amount that Bitcoin was worth! Back then, it wasn't about turning a profit, but about furthering the experiment that they hoped could undo the grip of the banking cartels. But now, with Bitcoin's ever-increasing value (in the long term ��), miners will always get paid with greater and greater value (even if the nominal amount of Bitcoin that they receive goes down).

If I understand your question correctly, the block reward actually does *not* diminish with the increase of hash difficulty. The block reward is on a strict schedule to be cut in half every 210,000 blocks (first from 50 to 25 in 2012, then from 25 to 12.5 in 2016, then from 12.5 to 6.25 in 2020, and so on), regardless of how much hash power is being produced to secure the network. The difficulty level rises as more hash power is applied to the network in order to keep each block time to roughly 10 minutes. This does not affect the amount of Bitcoin rewarded for each block found, though.
*Edit:* The halving of the block reward until no more are produced (which will be sometime around the year 2140) is to help ensure that Bitcoin will always be *deflationary* in nature, and according to a predicable schedule. So while the addition of more miners will raise the amount of electricity needed to compete with other miners in finding a block, the ever-shrinking numbers of new Bitcoins will help keep Bitcoin scarce, raising its value even more.
Hope that answers your question!

It *should* make you nervous! I'm no expert when it comes to private/public keys and cryptography, but I do know the number 1 rule for Bitcoin ownership: *Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.* The moment you share your private key with anyone, you risk handing them the ownership of your Bitcoin. My (uneducated, though gut-driven) advice: **Stay away.**

Small detail, but I think you meant *CCN*, not CNN. Still clickbait, though. Still worthless. Hey, it might as well be from CNN! ��

True, according to the chart on  , SegWit adoption has recently declined some. But that's likely due in large part to the activation of the Liquid sidechain, since much of the daily transactions are on/between major exchanges.
Besides going against the free market principles that Bitcoin's built on, forcing SegWit onto the network would require a hard fork, which would likely never reach the necessary consensus. I'm actually quite pleased that it can be freely adopted by whoever wants to use it, and rejected by anyone who wants slow, expensive transactions! ��
~~If~~ *When* the amount of transactions continues to rise, the next move is the current move(s): Encourage more SegWit adoption, use the Lightning Network more, and upgrade to other scaling solutions (such as Schnorr Signatures) when they're released.

Love this! Thanks for sharing it! According to the meanings of each emoji, if I could still have a Twitter account, my username would be "Bitcoin Saint ⚡������������������☕��". I'd like to add ��️ and �� sometime soon, but we'll see. ��
(Note about the ☕: I don't drink coffee, but I'd have that emoji to say "See? You can buy little things, like coffee, with Lightning!")

Just FYI: For the second question I voted "Other" because I buy/hodl Bitcoin for freedom; to escape the enslavement that comes from inflation and banking cartels.
