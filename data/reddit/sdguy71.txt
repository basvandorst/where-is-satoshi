Must have upped their limits when they moved to Imaxess from the BIT Center.
But the ATM is inside an office and subject to business hours, [currently]( 8 am - 8 pm Mon-Fri and 8 am - 4 pm Sat, so a steady stream of regulars maxing out the ATM would get suspicious quick.
But maybe a more enterprising person with deeper pockets can take a shot at that niche.

"I have thoroughly studied this topic, and I want to announce that Venezuela is going to implement a new system of cryptocurrency based on the oil reserves."

Finding the correct SHA-256 hash more efficiently. Does each chip in a mining rig begin with a nonce of 0 and increases one by one up to 2^32 (4,294,967,296) independently of the others?  Don't they end up calculating the exact same hash?
Would it be more efficient for some chips to start at 4294967296 and decrease by one, others at the middle, some with a random nonce, etc.?
On the other hand, if they're random, how does the software keep track of what nonce has been used?

I'm no math expert, but from what I understand of public-key cryptography, it depends on the fact that while it's easy to calculate the product of two large prime numbers it's, for all practical purposes, impossible to find the factors of a large number if it has only very large prime factors.
In **overly-simplified terms**, the public key is one of the prime numbers, and the private key is the product of the public key and the other prime number (which can be a *different* prime number every time a key pair is generated).
So even if you found a key pair with a matching public key, there is no guarantee that the prime number it was multiplied by to obtain the private key was also the same.
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:35:01

There really is not much financial incentive to extract that information, and it probably could be solved using a one-way hash. The voter could verify the vote using the private key but it would still be secret. You would not be able to tell who voted for whom by analyzing the blockchain.

They would need to get a bitcoin wallet and buy some bitcoins. Then go to the sendbitcoin.mx site where they enter the email or phone number of the person who's going to receive the money in Mexico so they can notify them of the 12-digit code.
They move the slider on the page to choose the amount, a QR code shows up, they scan it and send the bitcoins there. The company interfaces with BBVA Bancomer's "Mobile money" option and makes that money available using the 12-digit code and a 4-digit PIN that is sent separately.
The recipient goes to any BBVA Bancomer (a very common bank in Mexico), chooses **Dinero móvil** from the ATM screen, inputs both codes and gets his money. No bank card needed. There is a video labeled **Dinero móvil** [here]( that shows how it works.

The bank doesn't care where the money originally came from, you just input the 12-digit code you got through SMS from the bank plus the 4-digit code from the person that sent you the money and you are good to go. Bitcoin to pesos using a regular bank ATM.

If you compare things now with just three months ago  it is orders of magnitude easier (get an email or SMS on your phone and going to a regular bank ATM to withdraw pesos vs. opening an account at a Mexican exchange, linking it to a bank account, giving them your IFE ID plus another form of ID, making sure they send the bitcoin to the exchange's address, converting it to pesos at the exchange as quickly as possible to avoid fluctuations, initiating a SPEI transfer to your bank account - that can only be made during bank hours - and wait for the following day, withdrawing pesos from an ATM).

There are ways around this. One of the creators of RSA devised a ballot system where you cast three votes, two cancel each other out and the third is the real vote. I don't recall all the details but you could give the coercer the key to the vote he wants and he can't tell if that vote was canceled or not.

When you initiate the transaction at Sendbitcoin.mx you have a 15 minute window where the price doesn't change. After that, the amount in pesos is fixed and is independent of bitcoin going up or down.

Mathematically yes, but bitcoin uses computer numbers, that have real limits. Both long integers and double-precision floating-point numbers have limits, with around 15–17 significant decimal digits of precision.
Bitcoin calculations have to be done on 32-bit and 64-bit processors, with fixed size registers and other memory constraints. So, in the real world where bitcoin operates, numbers **are not** infinitely divisible.

The really interesting point is that Bancomer already has the infrastructure set up so their clients can [send money]( to people that are unbanked, and notify them via SMS or email.
So all that's missing is a business that links a Bancomer account to a bitcoin exchange in Mexico (like like [Bitso]( [MexBT]( or [Volabit]( and uses Bancomer's ATM network to transfer money to their customers. No need to set up offices all over the country.

By 2024 there will be 19 million bitcoins and around 8 billion people on the earth. If it's *widely* adopted across the globe as a currency, there will be too few to go around at a price of $10 to $100 (the world economy is measured in trillions of dollars and 190M to 1.9B in bitcoin would be insignificant, a far cry from widely adopted), so it should be worth a huge amount.
On the other hand, if it gets replaced by another "better" coin or outlawed out of existence, it would go pretty much to zero.

You just put into words (a LOT of them) what I think of every time some "expert" points out that bitcoin has lost X% of its value and is the "worst" investment of the year.
Curiously, the same people that dismiss the $1200 value as a bubble, always use it as a benchmark to "prove" how much bitcoin has fallen.
A month ago the price of gold [went crazy]( due to a glitch at an exchange, yet nobody is using that price to say that gold's price has crashed. The 1200 USD for bitcoin was a man-made glitch back when a single exchange controlled most of the market, and should be treated for what it was, a manipulated, phony and artificial price.
Some prices from Coinbase:
* 3 years ago $3.20
* 2 years ago $13
* 18 months ago $100
* 12 months ago $790
* 6 months ago $600
* Today $320

But if you open and fund a Bancomer account, link it to an exchange that handles MXN like [Bitso]( [MexBT]( or [Volabit]( you can essentially turn Bancomer's 6,000+ ATMs into one-way Bitcoin2fiat dispensing machines.

I understand that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence, but it's not the only game in town.  lists 492 Currencies and 47 Assets as of today.
If your hypothetical New Yorkers buy up all the bitcoins, what's to stop people from Boston buying litecoin or (gasp!) dogecoin instead? They are far more abundant (84 million and 100 billion) and they just might say, screw New York and their bitcoins, we'll go our own separate way!

Peter Schiff understands Bitcoin more than we give him credit for. He is quite aware of its deflationary nature and limited supply but rightly says that you can create an infinite number of altcoins. The problem is that he sells gold, and it skews his thinking.
Listening to this new video, you can't help but feel the butthurt from Bitcoin surpassing the price of an ounce of gold.  His tulip bulbs/beanie babies comparison is rather weak and outdated, and the "going to zero" ignores the massive investment Bitcoin miners have made, who would never sell bitcoins below their cost.
When he started talking about Über, I thought it was the perfect introduction of how Bitcoin came to shake things up, but he used it to push Goldmoney, which has a centralized point of failure like eGold had.
Check [this video]( from two months ago, where he recognizes Bitcoin was the best performing asset of 2016 (listen all the way to 10:40), the title is rather prophetic "Bitcoin Again Approaches Parity with Gold".

Bits will always cause confusion, what we need is a completely new and unrelated name, similar to another coin that shall remain nameless that is divided into Finney, Szabo, Shannon, Babbage, Ada and Wei, each a thousandth of the previous one.
A microbitcoin could be a "Nakamoto", divided into a hundred Satoshis. Feel free to propose other names, some marketing people could probably come up with something much better, taking into account that it has to work in several languages.
Countries with high inflation rates sometimes go the opposite way, dropping 3 zeroes and renaming their currency.

For SegWit, [Litecoin]( chose a 75% activation limit, vs. [Bitcoin's]( 95%, so it was easier to attain. Even then, it was initially blocked by some miners but then everyone got on board (like 99.4%) after threatening to use a UASF (which is what Vertcoin is going to do).
Bitcoin is not waiting for SegWit to activate on LTC or any other coin (3 more already have it: Groestlcoin (Jan/24), Syscoin (Mar/31) and Digibyte (Apr/21)), but is being held back by a lack of miner support.
LTC price and development had stagnated for years and SegWit was a way of increasing interest and price, which had flatlined around $4 USD.
As for impact on price, if two coins have SegWit and LN, they can use [Atomic cross-chain transactions]( to complement and increase their utility.  That, plus the other things that SegWit opens the door to, will *probably* lead to increased usage and price.

In this [video]( the bank mentions that you can use the "Mobile money" option on their ATMs to withdraw cash without having an ATM card. This is a screen-cap 
Click on **Videos** and choose **Dinero móvil** (fast-forward to 0:44 where it says "Retiro del dinero en ATM" if you're the impatient type).
Its original intent is for Bancomer clients to [send money]( to people that are unbanked, and notify them via SMS or email.
But if you open and fund a Bancomer account, link it to an exchange that handles MXN like [Bitso]( [MexBT]( or [Volabit]( you can essentially turn Bancomer's 6,000+ ATMs into one-way Bitcoin2fiat dispensing machines (for small amounts, since there are daily limits).

I want to congratulate you for using the cost of miners to calculate relative security, since SHA256 and Scrypt hashrates are not equal.
My question is, how secure is secure enough?  As far as I know, there have been no problems with the Litecoin network, so let's just say it's 99.8% secure (just a random number).
If Bitcoin's network is 27.93x more secure, that means its security relative to Liteoin's is 100-0.2/27.93 = 99.9928% secure.
At what point do you say, it's *secure enough* for my purposes, and the savings on transaction times and fees are worth the added (minuscule) risk.
Like when you buy anything, there is a cost/benefit consideration. You rarerly  buy the absolute best there is, price be damned, but chose something reasonable that gets the job done.

In Popper's book Digital Gold, he describes what I believe Blodget is talking about at 2:45, that around March 3-5, 2013 this took place:
*To prove how easy this all was, Wences asked Blodget to take out his phone and helped him create an empty Bitcoin wallet. Once it was up, and Wences had Blodget’s new Bitcoin address, Wences used the wallet on his own phone to send Blodget $250,000, or some 6,400 Bitcoins. The money was then passed to the phones of other people around the table once they had set up wallets. Anyone could have run off with Wence’s $250,000, but that wasn’t a risk with this particular crowd. Instead, as the money went around, Wences saw the guests’ laughter and wide-eyed amazement at what they were watching.*
One of the interesting things about Bitcoin is that those transactions are somewhere on the blockchain, does anyone know if it has been researched? (sort of like Laszlo's pizza purchase).

If you know for certain a certain character string in wallet.dat, you can search for it in the entire disk, sector by sector, with the following command:
$ sudo grep -a -b "text" /dev/sda5
Substitute "text" by the characters in the wallet.dat file and sda5 by the correct partition.
If **grep** finds the text, it will show a large number (the sector number) and the text, and you can copy that from the screen or CAREFULLY use **dd** to copy it somewhere else.

A [Genesis1]( Bitcoin ATM was showcased at the [Hotel Del in San Diego]( on May 3, 2013, but never installed.
It was later sold to [Bitcoin42]( south of the border, where it continues to operate to this day.

It always comes back to gold!

It would not. It would either implement a system like [Ecuador]( where it trades its currency 1:1 with the digital one, or make a new, premined coin that it controls 100%. Implementing bitcoin would be the worst option.

Fluctuation is not an issue. For example, to send money to Mexico you can use   They give you a 17 minute window to complete the transaction, after that, the amount in MXN is fixed and no amount of variability in the price of bitcoin is going to affect it.
The recipient has a week to withdraw pesos at any one of BBVA-Bancomer's 12,000 ATMs using a 12-digit code they get by email or SMS. They never see bitcoins. Check these posts   and

Seems like it's a small operation. Almost every time I check they are out of pesos for the day.
It is an easy to use service but they don't seem to have the necessary volume.

Install a small ATM (like a Skyhook) in your store, with a daily limit (say $1000 total) and a per-transaction limit (say $100 or $200) so you don't have to deal with a lot of AML-KYC crap.
Potential customers have an easy way to get bitcoins to take advantage of the discounts you offer.

I've suggested "hals" before. It's still in honor of Finney, and similar to satoshis in using the first name.
Plus, it's not taken (yet).

You could pay your employees in Bitcoin, and encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin so they can spent it there, like this company has done in San Diego

I see SETI there, this is similar but far more deserving **folding.stanford.edu** (they also have some specific alts like Curecoin and  FoldingCoin).

Before Lazlo and his 10K pizza, there was Sirius: "The First Bitcoin-to-Fiat Exchange Occurs — 2009-10-12 04:21:18"
"Using PayPal, NewLibertyStandard buys 5,050 BTC from Sirius for $5.02, equating to roughly one tenth of a cent per bitcoin."

Yes, when it was around 37% - 38% you could hear crickets, or at the very least, posts saying it was a meaningless metric.

They will always have cash-only customers, so paying utility bills and such would not be a problem. They need to incentivize bitcoin use, try to pay their suppliers and employees at least partially in bitcoin and try to close the loop.
I've read they literally keep multiple safes to store all their cash, it would be nice to trade that for a Trezor or a few BIP38 paper wallets, the savings would be significant (no armored guards, or at least not as many).
But there has to be a incentive (discounts?) or people won't bother, especially if Coinbase monitors if any of their clients coins end up in those businesses, and closes the clients (the buyers) accounts.

As far as I can tell, it's David Eifrig trying to scare up some customers for his Stansberry Research newsletter about investing in NFC technology.
Still, the very specific October 15th, 2015 deadline caught my eye and I would like to hear fellow bitcoiners opinion on this.

Satoshi just liked the number 21 (halving every 210000 blocks, 21 million cap). Look at it like 21 trillion bits instead and there's enough to go around for everyone.

Great link! Thanks! BTW, this is an example of really good answers to a dumb question. I was about to skip it but glad I decided to click on it.

I had heard that taxis would be the first to accept it, and later the taxi unions were saying that that news was false. What is the truth?

Get Airbitz wallet and you can spend your bitcoins at any Target or Starbucks by buying discounted gift cards within the app.

Calculate how much you are willing to spend on equipment (including switches, cabling, etc.), set-up costs, Internet connectivity and 9-12 months of electricity and then just buy bitcoin with that money.

Yes! Anyone living in Colorado that is involved in Bitcoin needs to help out. In San Diego, companies that pay their employees in Bitcoin reach out to local businesses so they accept Bitcoin and they can eat and buy goods there.

Once it's in the system (Bitspark or Sendbitcoin) the exchange rate is fixed, so it's not "pretty dangerous" unless the fiat currency is the one that devalues.

It's been proposed in the past; islands are not feasible because of the huge transportation costs for everything.  A state in Mexico is frankly insane, because you would still have the Federal government on your back PLUS paying a protection fee to people with weapons.
Best bet would be something like the  or a small, existing island-nation with liberal immigration policies, where like-minded people can move to, slowly increase their representation in the government and promote bitcoin-friendly laws.
But starting your own nation? Not going to work. Don't forget [Galt’s Gulch in Chile](

Si te vas a poner a promover tu moneda Bcoin aqui al menos corrige las ligas en tu artículo que apuntan a tu propio disco duro. FAIL!

Both the quality and balance of article itself and the comments, particularly from Justin Barnet, DAN_FROM_SAN_DIEGO, upanddown, SG and SandwichOfEarl, would have been unheard of a couple of years ago, and most people here nitpick on the details.
Try to look at the article from the perspective of someone new to bitcoin, and realize it explains bitcoin pretty well, in a very positive light.

As far as I can tell, he made a screen cap of the QR code you scan with Google Authenticator and emailed it to himself for "safekeeping"

Lets take a good look at the picture: 2 Bitcoin signs, Money Orders, Western Union, Phone Cards, "Pases y Fichas del Bus", an ATM, so it looks like a good place for remittances to Mexico and Central/South America.

There are two or three more, it's not such an exclusive club anymore.

Anybody know what "fantastic TEDX talk on bitcoin and digital currencies" he is referring to?
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:59:55
Ironically, it would be much easier if they were already in Mexico.
Transfer bitcoins to sendbitcoin.mx, email your parents a 12-digit code plus 4 digit PIN, they walk up to any BBVA-Bancomer ATM (of which there are thousands) and withdraw pesos.
Probably WU is the best bet, can't find any ATMs near Orlando on coinatmradar.com

Nobody is jumping on the ETH train because of its market cap, but because of the crazy gains it has had in the last 90 days, going from $28 to $400 (it was $8.17 on Jan 1st !!).

Hacker Group Paralelni­ Polis Shuns Bitcoin, Says [Litecoin ‘More Advanced’](

At this moment, ETH's market cap is 21 billion vs. Bitcoin's 38 billion, and 10BTC = 101ETH, would you care to explain where you get your numbers?
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:55:27
The one thing wrong with this (and similar examples) is that market cap is measured by [Circulating Supply]( not [Total Supply](
In the latter case, SolarCoin ( or DynamicCoin ( would be your FoolCoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:57:52
Huh? Did I miss something? Litecoin is still up 10X from three months ago.

If you're using Coinbase, at least store it in the Vault. I convinced a friend to open a Coinbase account and he was careless with his email and 2FA and had all his bitcoin stolen and CB can't do a thing because the thief used the correct email and 2FA.
