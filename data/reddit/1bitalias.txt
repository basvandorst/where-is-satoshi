please show me. where?

One flaw I noticed:
If ROOTs get mined on the RootStock chain AND BTC get mined on BTC chain AND if there is a 1:1 peg, THEN there will be more than 21 million coins (more than there should be).

BitAlias is a more simple, lightweight approach for giving names to cryptic addresses. 
Blockstore is covered inside the BitAlias FAQ  - short: there is at least one design flaw, since miners can register names for free (
DNSChain seems to be a web interface for several blockchains, thus could also be used on top of BitAlias (?).
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:16:26
BitAlias is definitely not for people who need high privacy. Instead it focuses on ease-of-use and the ability to build up reputation (having a known history).
The security issue can be solved through binding the alias to a master address (pubkey) so that everybody can generate child addresses in a publicly verifiable and deterministic way.

Hard to believe that Satoshi would put his bitcoins into a trust controlled by others or he would communicate about secret things in plain-text (not encrypted). Thus this story looks fabricated. Cui bono? Nonetheless the bitcoin price is 5% up today.

Thanks, added a reply also to the FAQ at  and linked to your wiki link.

Really nice!
I came up with a very similar scheme with some tweaks for  - usernames for Bitcoin. The scheme would involve embedding your alias and the extended public key into a Bitcoin blockchain transaction. This way unlimited* public and stealth payments could be done to a name-string instead of a Base58Check encoded address, a sort of 'Reusable Payment Names'. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:12:27
Can somebody explain why the BTC price is up following this story?
@_date: 2015-06-16 02:51:00
miners != users
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:55:25
Yeah, in some respects like 'DNS for bitcoin'. You are getting it mostly right. For thin clients (apps) there will be a library which does 'Simplified Alias Verification'. Then the download of the whole blockchain will not be needed anymore.
A UI idea you can see at  Simply type the alias (username) you are sending to inside the address field. Auto-complete and a directory could be done, too.
If somebody with in-depth knowledge of ECcrypto could review the derivation function, this would be awesome! Also trying to find some input whether or not to bind the alias to an extended public key or just a simple one.

If your read the article you will see that this is not about a classical democracy, just letting the people / users vote to express their opinion. Nothing can be bad about this.
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:03:44
Which concerns with address reuse do you have?
@_date: 2015-06-07 05:13:36
I am aware of this. Also a reason why I first published a draft of the protocol instead of building it completely. Maybe the community can help solve this issue. It is especially a problem for thin-clients, not when you run your own node. A fairly easy way to increase security for thin-clients is to fetch the address for the BitAlias from several resources and thus make a MITM attack more difficult, especially also when the responses are signed, instead of simply relying on https. Full decentralization you can only achieve when you run your own node, this is clear.
From the FAQ:
"Are SPV-proofs possible?
Unfortunately SPV-proofs do not seem to be possible because all the history of transactions, which got send to the marker address, is needed. All one can do with SPV is to verify that one transaction was a valid transaction (embedded in the blockchain), but not that there have been other transactions before which contained valid alias registrations."
Versum might also be a solution. Will have a look.
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:58:54
It is.

UPDATE ON PRIVACY - Yes, it is possible!
The initial idea and implementation does not focus on privacy, because there are a lot of use-cases where you actually DO want to be in public, e.g. when you send and receive tips on the web.
But after spending some more thoughts on this I came to the conclusion that privacy can easily be archived through using stealth addresses.
The protocol above needs a minor change: By publishing the missing information for creating your extended public key inside the [ALIAS_REGISTER] transaction (part of the OP_RETURN output) payers can generate as many stealth and also hierarchical addresses as they want. Afterwards one can chose between sending BTC privately (default) or publicly.
Conclusion: By knowing a simple alias payers can generate unlimited private and public addresses for any BitAlias user. If implemented properly, this could be a true revolution for the usability of Bitcoin. Please get in touch if you want to help!

I am in contact with at least one guy of OpenAlias already. But OpenAlias is not censorship-free. It gives regular domain names crypto-coin addresses in a rather complicated way. When the domain name gets seized you also lose your alias. Well, you can use Namecoin identities, but they have again other flaws, have a look into our FAQ. 
BitAlias is the most simple system to give your Bitcoin address a name.

For a strange reason some of my replies are only visible for myself when I am logged in. Here is a screenshot with an answer to your question:

 is working on solving exactly this. Check out our blog (BitAlias II) for more details.

Reads like an ad for the lightning network. The higher the fee, the more other blockchains will be used for small transactions, the less power Bitcoin will have as a whole.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:49:06
Full blocks are prohibitive for any new viral application. Imagine something like theDAO launches today and causes 10% more transactions on the network. Obviously they will pay a higher tx-fee and drive out other people's transactions.

For all people who say that it does not matter if the tx fee is 5 cent or 10 cent, don't forget that Bitcoin competes with lots of other cryptocurrencies.
