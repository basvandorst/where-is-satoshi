I dare you to try and prove how bitcoin is not a threat to tax collection,and currency stability. Not to mention it makes criminal transactions so much easier. The politicians are behind but once they realize the problem bitcoin will get crushed and made illegal for any legitimate business to use. My guess is if you use it they will automatically flag you for tax audits as well since there really is no reason to use bitcoin other than to cheat the system in some way.
You have been warned, think long and hard about how this journey ends in the real world.

Gold and other materials are hedges vs currency which are fiat. You cannot compare fiat to currency as fiat is not backed by anything and gold is gold.

Are you joking? How is a currency they cannot control going to be better for them than one they can?

MAGIC THE GATHERING EXCHANGE LOSES $400 million and crashes the bitcoin market... I'm sorry its going to be a pretty funny looking back on the history of bitcoin and seeing this event on the timeline.
Guys I am not invested in bitcoin myself but If it was to invest I would do it at a time like this when crazy shit like this happening. One persons bad luck is another opportunity.

I still do not understand why governments do not just make this all illegal now rather than later. A lot of people are going to get hurt by bitcoin when they finally make it officially illegal to do trade in the currency and ban devices like this one.

You should call it the irrational decision makers hotline. Even if you lost all your money you have to realize that most people with mortgage live in a -% state of wealth and they think its perfectly normal.Losing your money in bitcoin just puts you at 0% and if you have a mortgage well I assume you have a job. Its all just perception which no one can take from you but yourself.

Gold bugs say gold should be worth several thousands and they were considered crazy... which they were. The average person will not use bitcoin and if they start to the government will regulate its destruction as it will cause very serious currency competition which will hurt a lot of their population and destabilize them.
