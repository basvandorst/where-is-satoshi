Coinbase is the most noob friendly. Does have some fees but it’s not too bad until you are ready to get on an exchange. 
Of course, do some research off of Reddit.

Different websites are based on different exchanges which have slightly different prices. Crypto pro is the best app. You can set it to reflect the market average so the numbers are taken from all the top exchanges instead of just one. 
Crypto pro does cost $5. There are good free ones, just like at reviews.

That’s too bad, my experience couldn’t be more the opposite though.
I was fully verified at least two exchanges within a few hours. The actual bank transfers did take a few days but I never had any issues with the transfers or anything.

Make a Coinbase account then buy on GDAX (they are connected).
If you aren’t comfortable on the GDAX exchange early on just use Coinbase. Fees are a little high but it’s extremely noob friendly. 
As far as a wallet, for anything over 1btc I’d get a cold storage wallet.
Exodus is good for smaller amounts and has ShapeShift built in for quick exchanges. 
NEVER keep a lot of money on an exchange long term.

Amazon would be huge. Netflix would be cool. Steam as well. Pretty much any popular online store that would attract your average everyday person who doesn’t know about btc. 
If I had to pick one it would be amazon.

Not for me, I was hoping to have a longer dip so I could buy more. Would’ve loved a dip to 3k then a nice steady rise
