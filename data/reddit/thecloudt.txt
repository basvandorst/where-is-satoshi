Did not see anybody actually answering your question. I am curious too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:12:11
Oh the irony.

I am still waiting for the next drop back to 8000 to get back in :)

Fees are quite high for small transactions though
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:29:35
Think about it, for a Visa transaction I pay less than 0.01$. So 0.28$ is still too high.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:59:22
Such as?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:46:57
0.28USD is still quite much for something revolutionary. LN still takes too long.

Except from the fact that bitcoin cash is able to reach consensus in its network without any problems to solve the problems they have. Bitcoin is still left with scaling problems.
Also the complexity of Segwit and LN is far greater than that of EDA, meaning that a fatal bug is more likely to happen to either Segwit or LN.

Hypothetically, slush could be mining btc in order to get rid of their own coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:16:57
I call bullshit. Bitcoin cash is almost the same code as with core, only without segwit and with higher block size. There is nothing alpha with bitcoin cash.

Bitcoin is at the moment a gamble too, furthermore for a store of value bitcoin is too volatile. For now we have only seen a long term up trend, why is this uptrend sustainable?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:58:25
Bitcoin loses competitiveness in comparison to altcoins which do have lower fees.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:55
Can't disagree with that.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:12:14
What fork is coming? I am not really up to date.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:40:45
It is a joke if you havent bought it.

Isn't he just already starting to make sure he still gets money when the build in reward for mining blocks stops?

Were they really out of stock or just in cold storage?
