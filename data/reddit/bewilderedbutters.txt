Paxful's a good place to get bitcoins with paypal instantly w/ anonimity.It works with a live chat (between traders + customer support) and escrow security. All good so far, as long as you're willing to pay for the convenience.

Compete or Die indeed. The crypto world isn't for just anybody.

Paxful is their biggest competitor right now, they better watch their back.

ah yes, hello there. care to trade on Paxful?
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:32:16
So far I use the wallet that comes with the website I use to trade. Paxful gives you a free wallet and it seems to do the job.  It also doesn't ask for your number or any personal info, just your email.

Nice! I thought [this]( might help as well

Haha I hope not! Let's all try to keep this chill and safe for other BTC people 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:19:06
Hahaha so true. Where do you guys usually trade to get the best deals?

I can vouch for it as a temporary storage and a quick transfer but I do agree that you should do it in small amounts throughout the duration of your need, just to be safe.

Not at all. A lot of traders across the globe have been using this for business.

I agree, the media site shouldve at least gotten a more accurate photo instead of some stock photo lol

Just this week i saw exchange volume on bitfinex and others hit record lows, could it be the exchanges are cleaning up their act and taking away bots and fake volume pre regulations or is it that P2P exchanges are getting more popular?

As a trader of Paxful, I've put the card-to-bitcoin trading on hold. It's pretty wild these days but I have to admit it's still the most prominent. Bank transfers have been my thing recently because it has been the most secure, despite the waiting time. Pretty pumped for BITCOIN BLACK FRIDAY though.
