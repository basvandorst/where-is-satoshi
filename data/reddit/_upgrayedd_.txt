Bitcoin is alive and well. Bitcoin Core and on the other hand are probably on their last legs.

I'm on whichever side is on.

If he was good enough for satoshi, is good enough for me.  I'll trust any Bitcoin project he supports.  He and Jeff Garzik are the natural and rightful leaders of the Bitcoin community.

That's not how the stock market, or any other market for that matter, works.  If a market loses a significant percentage of its value, most of that value doesn't go anywhere.  It is just gone.  Value can and is created out of thin air and vanishes into nothing every day.

There is not necessarily any single set of Bitcoin developers.  While people generally acknowledge Bitcoin Core as the reference client for now, anybody with the proper skillset and knowledge can create their own Bitcoin client to interact with the network in the exact same way different entities have created various web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, etc.)  If a specific group of developers released seriously flawed code on the network, it would likely fork the blockchain and as it is unlikely the majority of the network will be running the broken code, that fork will simply be orphaned.

Either the title is wrong or their map. I count 14 states not serviced.

Most credit unions are bitcoin friendly. This is in addition all of the other benefits you get from using a credit union while also knowing Wall Street won't get their grubby hands all over your money.

I don't think you understand the definition of either the term vpn, the word blockchain, or both because your question makes no sense.

Your crapcoin provides no benefit to anybody.  I'm guessing it is premined and even if not it would probably be trivial to run a 50% attack on it.  Furthermore, who in their right mind would ever buy it?  Seriously, you must have been high to think it was ever a good idea.  Either that or you think there are people out there high enough to fall for your obvious scam.

Only those running the operation

Seriously, you need to understand the terms you are using or you risk coming off as a total idiot.  A VPN is an encrypted tunnel through which a computer can access the resources of a remote network as though it were directly connected.  The way you are obviously utilizing this technology is to mask your IP address but that is just one very minor potential use.  In any case, there is no reason a VPN necessarily even needs servers to operate as many VPNs can be managed entirely via routers, there is nothing about the technology that can be "crowd-sourced", and as a blockchain is merely a record keeping mechanism it has no relevance or bearing to a VPN at all.
That said, the closest thing to what I think you might be asking about is Tor which has nothing to do with either blockchains or VPNs.

Just because you don't owe taxes does not mean you do not have to file.

Even that is flawed because if the two outside parties found a way to collude with one another they could steal the funds.  You would need a 3-of-4 multisig where you controlled 2 of the keys, but even then I wouldn't trust it.
