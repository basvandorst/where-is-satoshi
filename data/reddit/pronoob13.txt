Good point.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:41:54
I *knew* it.

Which is a surprisingly large share of the Bitcoin-community. Besides, what happens with all the Bitcoin they're holding hostage will have an impact on the whole market at that time.

well, replacing Monopoly money with a crypto-currency sounds pretty cool. Also, having a currency getting used only as play-money doesn't even sound like a bad idea, since playing with actual valuable currencies is a bit too much of a gamble for a board-game.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:45:50
My best guess is both.

Wait, wait, wait... There are porn sites that *aren't* getting their incomes from advertising?
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:51:17
\^ This.

Okay, I can follow you on the capitalization issue, though that's something I suffered from myself too, back when I was setting up my first pooled mining station.


He never says he doesn't understand it. He just says he's not "willing to buy it", that he finds it hard to believe. Also, that wasn't the issue he was writing about with that sentence...


It's not how well it works as a medium of exchange that's bothering him, it's the question what value Bitcoin would have, other than being a currency.

That's the reasing it's crashing: Everybody selling it. So, basically *you're part of the problem*.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:51:30
Most Bitcoin-trading platforms seem to do that nowadays.

If they want a transaction *to* you, then they just need your wallet address. If they would want to make a transaction *from* you, they'd indeed need your private key.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:24:05


No, *you're* making a valid and well-informed argument here.
I haven't read Krugman's articles, but claiming that he "doesn't understand the technology and hasn't read the introductory materials" out of thin air feels like you're just as well-informed on his situation as he supposedly was on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:43:15
Not really. Since Bitcoin is a semi-anonymous network, the only way to get a number for that is basically guessing.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:46:27
Too late.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:33:38
Indeed. If you'd like to set someone up to be able to pay with your Bitcoins, the best idea would be setting up a alternate wallet just for that. Then you could also use a different private key, which'll keep them out.

You'd perhaps try [where they've got more experience with miningware.
As for your question: GPU's are never built to constantly keep working on thousands of calculations, and you need to cool them properly when doing so. Best practises in this would be watercooling (if not in place yet), or just opening up your case and placing a tabletop fan next to it.
And, if it's worth the strain? Well, that depends on how much BitCoins you're getting. Just keep in mind that two BitCoins are roughly of the same worth as a videocard. ;)

Well, no. Most of the time, you use your phone, which is (or should be) protected using a PIN-code and a lockscreen-password with codes only you know. Basically you trust your phone as you only put in the private key once, where most apps have another password which'll decrypt your private key to make payments. It's up to you, and the app developers how secure it is.

Windows 8 for mining? Why not a mining-optimized Linux-distro? Though I'm pretty sure you could get some nice bragging-right-worthy stats from that machine anyway.

For not writing an OP-message, I guess. If you want people to engage in a debate, you should always start of by posting your thoughts on the topic. Then people will reply to that with their own ideas, creating engagement.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:32:49
Yeah, that sounds really legit.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:24:44
Why not both?

GPU mining certainly isn't dead, there are enough professional mining companies still investing thousands of dollars on graphic cards each month. It's just that one ASIC-box (which you can just plug in using USB, instead of dedicating a motherboard) can provide about the same processing power as a set of graphical cards, and is thus a more efficient investment.

Nice! About 1 hash/minute?

Can I date her? She's hot, evil *and* into Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:43:20
Don't you freaking dare to pump out *yet another* crypto-currency.
