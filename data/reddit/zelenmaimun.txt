I found 4 .dat files one of them was 288kb(that was the biggest) the smallest was 80kb. I think I know the password. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:53:57
But I have searched only the first hard drive there could be more files in the second.

@_date: 2018-12-09 15:39:46

I think he mined bitcoins for some time then he started mining litecoins. So what program should I download. Thank you for the help!

I found the bitcoin adress and placed it but it tells me please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:47:02
I did it with other wallet.dat file and it didn't have a wallet phrase but it is not starting with 5.

It's not fake. I don't get it why should I lie?

I downloaded litecoin core (as most of you told me it is better)  but I get this error after opening it: Incorrect or no genesis block found. Wrong datadir for network?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:25:06
I started downloading bitcoin core but it is 223gb?!
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:36:49
Is there any other way to get in without the passphrase?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:57:23
How can i stop the sync

Deminero30 told me this: dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here] This will return the private key which will start with the number 5 Once you have your private key, download electrum from electrum.org
Create a new wallet &gt; standard wallet &gt; import private key &gt; click next and it'll show you if you have coins there.

I did backup of the files. I think he mined bitcoin for some time then he started mining litecoin.
