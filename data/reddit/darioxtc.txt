What if goes up 10% overnight? What counts is the price at the time of transaction.

Av Jose Banus, near the Supercor, they do not sell beer after 10 PM ��
Lovely location, it’s where old CEO’s retire in Europe, bitcoin atms were available there since 2014, in many locations, the owners of the atms were some lovely fellows from Canada or USA

Finally a topic about the elephant in the room today
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:14:30
The whole idea with deflation is to encourage people to save more and borrow less, ideally you would rather pay your home in full upfront or save for a while until you get the entire amount rather than borrowing. Just like in good old days when the dollar was paired with gold.
One important aspect that no one mentioned about is that housing prices are much lower in a deflationary system, when people don’t borrow but save, fractional lending does not make sense and the artificial demand for housing created by unlimited lending does not exist, therefore prices stay low.

So how do you fight excessive inflation? Someone named satoshi had an ideea in 2008 and created excessive digital deflation, I personally think this will work under given conditions. We literally have no power anymore without a tool like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:37:34
Let’s face it, debt, inflation and consumerism in forced upon us, we are not living in equilibrium, we are living in state and corporate greed, that’s why we need a deflationary asset like bitcoin, not saying deflation is good, but where there’s an inbalance like the one we live in, you can be sure I will save in Bitcoin

I see boxmining bought some gold, I also did and quite alot in 2018, now I got a big problem, how to store it safely, it can be confiscated by the authorities, it can be stolen and it’s a tough sell, now as a holder of both bitcoin and gold I can tell you that Bitcoin is much better than gold, something I wouldn’t have been certain of if I never invested also in gold, both great buys, Bitcon is just better
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:16:02
Makes bitcoin look like a scam instead of promoting it, just my 2 cents
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:48:37
That’s right, economies are fueled by masses of brainwashed people going into debt just to consume and spend on shit they don’t even need
But on the other hand, say you got nothing against consumerism, but you just want to save and not be like everyone else, how do you fight inflation? What’s your vehicle of saving?
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:30:23
Pomp. Boss bull
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:31:16
As a holder of both, I would say bitcoin is up, gold slightly
I got better returns on the numismatic gold that I graded on ngc, than on the bullion gold I own,
But nothing beats Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:15:37
Mind: Blown
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:46:05
Yeah, except in that situation bitcoin will be a hell lot more than $10k

Is this for sale?

Nobody is gonna say nothing about the low volatility of bitcoin, staying exactly on $8200 - $8300 region, it’s not the Bitcoin I used to know since 2014, I find it odd, I personally think it’s being manipulated to an extent that I am not even sure we are gonna see new aths like we used to, not this year not in the future, the market looks rigged by whales, almost like Bitcoin has been tamed, what’s your opinion?
Edit: It stayed at exact 10k area for a while, then dropped to 8k area exactly, now it stays here but nothing in between, just static. I find this very odd
Edit2: And I am pretty sure it will drop to exactly 6k in no more than a month and will stay there for at least a month, no volatility, none whatsoever. I used to go to sleep with a price, next morning, I woke up to see another price, I miss that, something is wrong don’t you think?

No big news, rich people only getting richer, probably also due to insider information

I personally know an investor in wind turbines in the region of Dobrogea, he got sick of reselling his energy to the national grid and tried to maximize his ROI by initially trying to associate with miners, eventually he ended up buying his own mining equipment, which turned out ideally for him, producing his own energy and mining for himself, so I wouldn’t be surprized if the study is true
