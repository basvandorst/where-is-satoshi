@_date: 2017-12-03 23:26:44
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:06:10
Which is fine, because you can do a search for wallet.dat very easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:46:00

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:53:54
Who isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:56:01
Because it went past £8000 before.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:45:29
9k worth the risk of not having 1mil? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:54:35
How. BCash is an altcoin. BTC isnt.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:53:19

@_date: 2017-12-13 13:56:46
Or Girls.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:53:26
It's a stronger currency, so its not irrelevant at all.
And London is the financial capital of the world, dont forget that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:21:24
If he had triple digits in BTC. He would currently be a millionaire.

@_date: 2018-05-15 09:16:09
How do you know?
Oh yep, you don't
@_date: 2018-05-03 09:21:30
It's an old meme, but it checks out. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 23:39:45

@_date: 2017-11-21 13:59:45

@_date: 2017-11-02 22:54:48
Anything greater than 10k and 100 people is a waste.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:10:44


The entire show is cringy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:48:43
Be greedy when others are fearful.
You are being fearful.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:47:39
If it's a nice area, prices will rise. If there is easy commuter locations to major cities you will see price rises too. 
The lake country is stunning.

I said that back in July before the aug fork. Doing that was a massive mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:06:51
You can sell direct with brokers, or use a virtual debit card service like Wirex, transfer it into the card and then pay yourself via paypal 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:27:42
Less talkie, more ball eating. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:43:46
