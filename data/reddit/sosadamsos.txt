Why would they be paying more than 1%?


And this is better than the ~3% rate they would pay using credit cards.

Coinbase does what is required of them by law. It's not their fault, it's the government's.

My Trezor (white) came with the standard white USB cable as well as an additional black USB cable along with a note saying something like "our original USB cable is shitty, so if it doesn't work try this black one instead". Luckily, the white one worked.

Wow. That payment method was sweet. Scanned it with the coinbase app on my phone and the video just started playing 10 seconds later. I'm kind of blown away.
BUT, IMHO, you should fix the audio before you charge for it. I listened to about 5 minutes and couldn't stand to listen anymore :(

Not knowing much about ACH, I wish you would've answered these -- but I can appreciate being made to work for a good answer.
**Is the price to use ACH tied to the price of a dollar?**
I'm not sure. In a way this is the opposite of my question. I was asking something like 'is the price of a dollar tied to ACH' - to which I *think* the answer is 'no'.
**What happens if people use ACH but not dollars?**
Again, I'm not sure. It seems ACH is mostly (exclusively?) used in the US. So I would think you have to use dollars. So I think you're saying *you have to use bitcoin to use the Bitcoin network*. right?
**Could people use ACH without using dollars?**
I think no. But banks could convert the dollars to another currency after the fact.
It seems to me that ACH is exactly the type of system that Bitcoin is destined to replace.

@_date: 2014-12-19 21:33:42
I like that example a lot. But I'm not sure If I have an answer for my original question.
As an example, lets say bitcoin never really takes off as a currency. Instead, every transaction that goes through the blockchain is immediately turned into dollars. Wouldn't that keep the price of bitcoin low, and is such a thing even possible?
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:58:02
I've said it once, I'll say it again. 
Many love to complain about services like Coinbase and Circle because users don't have their private key...
But you're not giving them credit for trying to make it easier for the masses. Most people are not savvy enough to keep their private keys. Until that process is made simpler, Coinbase and Circle are their best options.
At least give them the respect they deserve, and stop bashing them for trying to grow their business and Bitcoin adoption.

I'm getting tired of all of the Coinbase hate going on in Non-stop complaining about them being a bank and giving out your information, and so on.
**They ARE a Bitcoin bank. AND THAT'S OKAY.**
We need bitcoin banks. We need companies like Coinbase and Circle who are working to make it easier for the general public to get involved. And they have done that and are continuing to make that experience even easier. I can't think of another recent company who's made as much progress in the bitcoin industry as Coinbase has. Can't we at least appreciate that?

The theory suggests that whoever set up the Silk Road forum, probably also had a hand in setting up BitcoinTalk.org.
Do we know who created BitcoinTalk.org?
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:24:06
I love the idea of Coinbase implementing a similar tool.
As far as monetization, I can't imagine that once the tool is actually developed that it would cost much to upkeep. It seems they should easily stay in the green with an ad or two on the page.

Was going to say the same thing. I'm guessing the majority have no idea what a website costs. 
Also, yes, the design is not the greatest, but I assume a lot of that time and money went into development. Slap a new face on it and they'll be good to go.

Trezor is great for what it is, but it feels very cheap... Which it shouldn't for how much wealth it can store.

You can't really separate the bitcoin blockchain from the bitcoin "currency". If they use the bitcoin blockchain, they will in some way or another be using bitcoins (the currency).
What they may mean from this is if someone trades $1m in stocks, there's not going to be $1m in BTC exchanged. Only tiny fraction of that which correlates with the stock.
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:15:50
Nope, it sounds like they're definitely using the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:36:08
This is exactly my take on it. Let them try -- but in the end, there will only be one true blockchain. Just as there is one true internet.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:31:35
I don't agree with censorship at all... he should allow the community to come to it's own conclusion -- not force his conclusion on them.
BUT -- Next time you have the opportunity to convince someone of something, try less name-calling and more rational thought.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:33:13
I see your point. Reality is we don't know for sure if they are 100% using bitcoin. But it does seem by the way that this was written that they were intending to use Bitcoin, why else would they actually mention it, instead of just saying "blockchain technology"? Lastly, if they were going to use a blockchain, it would make sense to me to choose the largest and most secure.

Which to me says whoever wrote this article probably doesn't completely understand bitcoin, and that you must use bitcoins to use the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:18:09
Of course there is, but its not *the* internet.
A company could decide to use their own intra-blockchain, but that would be in contradiction to one of the main aspects of a successful blockchain -- decentralization. 
A centralized blockchain seems like an oxymoron.

TBH, I've never taken that much out of the Vault at one time. I believe when you do take your funds out the of the vault, it simply puts them into your normal account -- then you can transfer them wherever as you normally would, with their normal requirements.
