I saw those as well, but first brush, I thought those were Fiat-to-BTC only boxes? It'd get him going, for sure. I'll look more closely. I was hoping to find a place that would get him a Visa card or something similar he could transact with as he's coming home, but I'll keep digging. Appreciate the reply.

As an aside, the flair says Reddit for 4 days. That's not accurate. How do I remedy that?

Bought some last week. 15 100B for $10. 
Market's down. =P

Stop telling people stuff like this.

To further complicate things, the first BTC transaction was from Satoshi to Finney.
If you're aware of how the FBI caught the Unibomber, it was through analysis of his writing styles.
Analysis of everything Satoshi has written matches Nick Szabo's linguistic patterns. Also, Satoshi's white paper mentions everything in the sphere of crypto at the time except BitGold, a project Szabo worked on before the Bitcoin whitepaper was released. 
It was almost as though BitGold(I think I have that incorrect off the top of my head) was purposely excluded to throw people off his trail, but ends up being a major point of curiosity.
In the last few months I've really been brushing up on my Bitcoin and cryptocurrency history, and there's a lot of pointers to Finney being the coder to Szabo's vision, if not others before ultimately Gavin Andresen became lead programmer.

Enjoy the rabbit hole.

I currently have one of these as a bookmark in my Andrea Antonopolous book, 'The Internet of Money.'
The others fifteen I picked up for $10 are in my safe, making a legitimate trillionaire.
Edit: Billionaire? Pssssh. TRILLIONAIRE.

Well, shit. I'd really like to see what he has, unless items just hyperbole.

Read : ICOs.
That said, no risk, no reward. Fortune favors the bold. No one got rich playing it safe. No one got rich standing still, etc, etc. 
That said, a fool and his money are soon parted, and on and on, etc.

And to further that, you're going to want to learn about Multi-Sig wallets if you don't already know, and get some cold storage protection in place for the bulk of that.

Er duh. Fixed.

I really want one of these. 
Also, why not set your rotational axis as ($market_percentage * 2), with 0 = horizontal? Then have a button that selects against 1 hr, 12 hours, 24 hours, and an inverse log (or log, I may be thinking about it wrong) after 45 degrees? So, market up 60%, but the angle would only be about 48 degrees, etc. 
Though, representing this in an Arduino may run the controller out of RAM storing and calculating values, unless there's a more efficient way of representing it, or off-loading the calculations from the actual controller?
I *really* want to get ahold of the programming for this. I would love to make and tune my own. Please post it here or @_date: 2017-10-18 08:00:40
Exactly. This is how Xapo manages that kind of money and more.
Take this advice.

That's exactly it. I'm not a trader, I'm an investor. I have a second job that I make a nice chunk of change at, plus I have cheap electricity, which means I have a few Antminers, so I put ~20% of my income, plus bonuses into it in a dollar-cost-average scheme that works nicely for me. 
I have a little extra sitting for the right moment to buy in, but for the most part, it's every two weeks, on the dot, price be damned.

You should understand that RIGHT NOW there is someone trying to figure out how to get to you and get that money.

Ebay has them cheap. I use them for fancy bookmarks.

Instead of down-voting you for no proof, I'll just ask: When? Where? Can you give me an example of him 'shilling' for Core?

You're thinking of the documentary 'Banking on Bitcoin' on Netflix.
I just watched this weekend, and it was Hal Finney who lived 2 blocks from him, hence why the theory is Nakamoto is Finney, Finney is Nakamoto.
