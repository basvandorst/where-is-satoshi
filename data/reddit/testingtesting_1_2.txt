Construction simulator meets mining operations + real bitcoin. Now there's a game

No need for the apostrophes in "fees" by the way, because it is plural rather than possessive
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:31:39
Great link, very interesting read. I'd hardly call myself a libertarian but this is one issue that really infuriates me.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:50:27
It's so good that the btc could go to someone who needed it. This turned out to be a wonderful story!

You can proofread your writing

I use 2FA whenever possible and on all but very few sites I am able to use an app (Authy, works like Google Authenticator). I hate when sites require SMS for 2FA (e.g., Paypal. Go figure.)

I think he meant that these guys aren't amateurs, and stand in contrast to TREZOR, not that they are ignoring sources of ingenuity
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:05:31
Ah I gotcha. Just the way it was phrased confused me or something (plus I'm sick so not totally with it)
It's a virtual certainty that the NSA uses this technique to pass information along to other agencies. Would almost be more surprised if they didn't use it to hunt DPR

1. Maybe they stand to make a lot from inactive accounts  
2. Might not be worth the legal troubles of selling  
3. They could still sell it at any point

Never said it was, and frankly a support forum is extremely mundane under just about any circumstance.
We were talking about professionalism and backing, the reasons the company has taken off recently.

Don't know why someone downvoted you, seemed like a well-meaning comment to me!

I understand your cynicism, but I think it is misplaced in this instance. A "knowledge base" is standard for any business with a large customer base. If it can provide answers to common questions quickly and easily, benefiting all parties involved. Plus, they are still a young and growing company, so I sincerely doubt it will lead to any layoffs. I really don't see the need to be such a negative Nancy about something this benign
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:53:57
Define "into the ground" though. From an evil villain perspective, what he did (especially if this SR business is true) is pretty impressive. It doesn't seem like he was trying to run a legit business
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:50:52
I want to understand what you mean but I just can't

Highly unlikely. There are higher (2-4x) rates of gastric cancer in East Asia. Plus, if radiation were the culprit, it would have presented earlier, and more likely would have caused leukemia.

Yes, and reddit also has moderators

It *is* a form of censorship in its own way, just a decentralized form. Spam crowds out actual content and prevents it from being seen.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:42:55
On a related note, any idea how much it costs to get a proofreader? Always been curious about that
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:29:05
Paul actually has great ideas and a path for true change for the nation, **which is why he** could never gain national voter traction.
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:26:12
That information is proprietary
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:01:12
This is super fucking interesting. That's brilliant!
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:37:09
Exactly. It is silly to argue "let the free market decide" when we don't *have* a free market (with telecoms at least).
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:58:33
If you get caught, though, you could get banned, depending on the tracker.

Might want to try again now. Link works fine for me.

That was actually in 1928
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:30:18
That person should be charged with fraud. But I guess we'd judt have to let him pay the gubmint a few thousand bucks but "admit no wrongdoing" and avoid jail time.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:36:23
You realize that one person hardly constitutes a riot, and that a party would be a wildly inappropriate place for said riot

It sort of does... with parking tickets
@_date: 2015-02-12 08:52:42
Also illegal in a lot of cities :/ but as you point out, those cities can easily solve that by making a new address each time
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:06:14
It's called "plugging the meter" and I think the idea is that the time restrictions aren't wholly arbitrary - rather, they encourage people to move their cars so that other people can park. If you need a spot for the day, then use a parking garage.

but how would they know the phone number, address, etc without him, again, being a real-life-on-the-internet nu-Journo?
You can quite easily get that information about most people, for free, even with relatively little info to go on. His real problem was the utterly rookie mistake of not having 2FA on his email

I just found my formerly near-worthless 3 year old doge wallet yesterday and now I'm the proud owner of .25btc. Seems like hodl works for some alt coins too
