For Bitcoin to make fiat currency obsolete it would require stability, It's true the USD has been declining in value since the day it was created but it does so gradually, Bitcoin could lose or gain 50% of it's value in a single day, This is completely unacceptable for a medium of exchange.

Paper money buys less and less everyday, I hear stories from my grandparents about how they use to work for 58 cents an hour and i can't help but imagine that 58 cents an hour in 1940 is probably like $15 an hour in 2013.

But if you purchased a book that costs $100 today and bitcoins increased in value %100 5 days later you just paid $200 for that book.
Just like the guy that bought the first pizza with Bitcoins, I bet he really wished he had those bitcoins back now lol.

1 pizza @ 10,000BTC = $8,035,000 today.

@_date: 2013-10-08 16:53:51
But it's not a physical form of money, At least there are very few if any real Bitcoin ATM machines that can print out Bitcoin Cash, And then of course if there is such a thing what is to stop people from simply counterfeiting it? Maybe some verification system? But that would of course depend on infrastructure and computer networks so that rules out Bitcoin in areas that have little if any access to such things.

Ebay fees are the worst, They charge you a fee to list the item, they charge you a fee when it sells and then paypal hits you up with another fee just for withdrawing you money.
After it's all said and done you lucky to get half the money you sold your item for.

I think your math is wrong, If everyone used Bitcoin as they use USD today, Then obviously a few million bitcoin will not be enough to go around for a planet that has roughly 7 Billion people, Bitcoin would be used by people in uBTC or mBTC, And be broken down that way, so having just 1 Bitcoin would make you part of the wealthiest people in the world.

I'll admit back when i was a noob i made a wallet and put 1 BTC in it and didn't back up my data (was using the bitcoin client), My hd crashed and without giving it much thought i threw it in the garbage.
I can only imagine how many people might have done the same because back then bitcoin really wasn't worth hardly anything, I think 1 BTC was worth about $15.
I'm sure it's less common now that we have online wallets like blockchain.info.

This is true but for person to person transactions nothing beats cash, It's faster, Doesn't rely on any computer network.
But putting aside it not being physical money for a second, The real problem with Bitcoin is it's volatility, It would be damn near impossible to conduct day-to-day business with money that has such rapid fluctuations in value, You would walk into a store and go to the back and get your item and by the time you made it to the check out counter Bitcoin could have gone up or down in value.
But I will consider the possibility that if Bitcoin ever did entirely replace fiat currency then there would be no fiat value tied to it anymore so maybe it would then become stable or maybe collapse? Who knows.

For Bitcoin to really be a threat to fiat it needs to reach stability, The current situation seems to be people buying bitcoin just because they see the price shooting to the moon but not because they want to use it as a medium of exchange, In fact as long as the price stays high or on the rise there will be little incentive for anyone to spend their bitcoins.
